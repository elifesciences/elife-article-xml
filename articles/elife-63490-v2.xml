However, the exact nature of these neuromodulatory effects on neural activity patterns in vivo is not well understood. Here, we show that in awake monkeys, LC activation is associated with changes in coordinated activity patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). These relationships, which are largely independent of changes in firing rates of individual ACC neurons, depend on the type of LC activation: ACC pairwise correlations tend to be reduced when ongoing (baseline) LC activity increases but enhanced when external events evoke transient LC responses. Both relationships covary with pupil changes that reflect LC activation and arousal. These results suggest that modulations of information processing that reflect changes in coordinated activity patterns in cortical networks can result partly from ongoing, context-dependent, arousal-related changes in activation of the LC-NE system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>cingulate</kwd><kwd>correlations</kwd><kwd>pupillometry</kwd><kwd>pupil size</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 MH107001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gold</surname><given-names>Joshua I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simultaneous recordings in brainstem and cortex, combined with pupillometry, show that changes in coordinated activity in anterior cingulate cortex are related to distinct patterns of pupil-linked activation of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Changes in brain state are associated with different levels of arousal, attention, motivation, surprise, and other factors that can affect the activity patterns of large populations of cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">McAdams and Maunsell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Purcell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Falkner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Downer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ecker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Thiele et al., 2016</xref>).

One prominent example is the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system, whose diffuse projections throughout the brain, close relationship to the sleep-wake cycle, and relationship to electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry have led to several theories of its role in arousal-related modulations of cortical activity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gilzenrat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Einhäuser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>).

We targeted the ACC because it has strong reciprocal connectivity, both structural and functional, with the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lewis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morrison et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Porrino and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jones and Olpe, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fernández-Pastor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gompf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chandler and Waterhouse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chandler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Köhler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koga et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, ACC neural activity can encode computations that underlie adaptive, goal-directed behaviors, including those that are also associated with indirect measures of LC-linked arousal, such as changes in pupil size and the P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Shima and Tanji, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gehring and Willoughby, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Holroyd and Coles, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Critchley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ebitz and Platt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sarafyazd and Jazayeri, 2019</xref>). Thus, interactions between LC and ACC neural activity patterns are likely to have broad behavioral relevance.</p><p>We recorded neural activity simultaneously in LC and ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and measured the pupil size of alert monkeys under two behavioral conditions: (1) performing a fixation task and (2) performing a fixation task with randomly presented sounds.

Conditioned on the firing (or lack of firing) of LC neurons, we measured activity patterns of individual neurons and coordinated activity between pairs of neurons in ACC, both of which govern the information processing capacities of neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Britten et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parker and Newsome, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>). We were particularly interested in the timescales over which these features of neural activity in LC and ACC are related, which can provide insights into putative underlying mechanisms. For example, neuromodulatory effects of the LC-NE system on ACC might be expected to have a relatively long time course compared with the time course of typical synaptic events that are mediated by faster, glutamatergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Feldman RS et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McCormick and Prince, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang and McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Timmons et al., 2004</xref>).

Our analyses focused on whether and how mean spiking activity and individual and pairwise neuronal variability measured in one brain region (ACC or LC) related to neuronal activity in the other brain region (LC or ACC, respectively). To understand the temporal dynamics of these potential relationships, we systematically tested for effects across a broad range of time windows. These windows ranged in duration from 100 ms, which is often used to study neural synchrony, to 1 s, which is consistent with typical timescales of slow neuromodulatory influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Feldman RS et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McCormick and Prince, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang and McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Timmons et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doiron et al., 2016</xref>).

Previously, we showed that changes in pupil size during passive, near fixation and when driven by external startling events covary with the timing of spiking activity in LC and parts of brainstem and cortex, including the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have shown that pupil size and other indirect measures of LC activation can also correspond to changes in coordinated activity in sensory cortex under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>). These previous studies did not explore the relationships between ongoing versus evoked LC activation (or NE release) and concurrent changes in both coordinated cortical activity and pupil size. We extended those findings, including one study that elicited changes in coordinated activity in cortex via manipulation of LC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Devilbiss and Waterhouse, 2011</xref>), by showing that LC neuronal activity is reliably associated with changes in correlated spiking activity (spike-count correlations, or <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic>) between pairs of neurons in ACC. We further showed that these LC-linked changes in ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> depend on the nature of the LC activation. During passive fixation and in the absence of controlled external inputs, ongoing LC firing was associated with a reduction in ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic>. In contrast, startling sounds drove transient increases in LC firing that were associated with an increase in ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic>. Under both conditions, LC and pupil-linked changes in ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> were most pronounced over relatively long time windows (&gt;500 ms) that are consistent with neuromodulatory timescales and thus might involve the effects of LC-mediated NE release in the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Feldman RS et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McCormick and Prince, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang and McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Timmons et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The context dependence of these effects implies that spontaneous versus sensory-evoked activation of the LC-NE system can have different effects on coordinated patterns of activity in cortical networks. These effects seem likely to involve the different LC firing patterns under these conditions, which for sensory-evoked activity include not just a large, transient increase in spike rate but also a reduction in spike-count variability and heterogenous relationships to pupil-linked changes in arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>). In principle, different temporal patterns of NE release could mediate a range of synaptic effects via distinct NE receptor subtypes with different affinities and different spatial distributions in different parts of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nicholas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnsten et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnsten, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berridge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berridge and Spencer, 2016</xref>). These synaptic effects can influence both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes, resulting in changes in network dynamics in thalamus, cortex, and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Segal and Bloom, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dillier et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Waterhouse et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">McCormick and Prince, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang and McCormick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McLean and Waterhouse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fernández-Pastor and Meana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Salgado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Salgado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Guan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Schiemann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sherpa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ohshima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rodenkirch et al., 2019</xref>). Exactly how these diverse mechanisms support context-dependent changes in coordinated activity patterns merits further study, perhaps by selectively controlling the magnitude and timing of NE release in cortex while assessing changes in coordinated activity and using biophysically inspired models to test hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de la Rocha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Doiron et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the relationships that we identified between LC activation and coordinated ACC activity patterns, we did not find similarly reliable relationships between the spiking activity of individual neurons measured simultaneously in each of the two brain regions. For example, we found slight increases and decreases in mean firing rates and a marked reduction in the trial-to-trial variability of firing rates of individual units in the ACC in response to external stimuli, as has been reported previously for other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>). However, these changes in single-unit ACC responses were not related reliably to properties of the concurrently measured LC response that we could measure and thus may involve mechanisms other than the LC-NE system. These findings do not appear to be consistent with previous work showing improvements in signal-to-noise ratios in cortex in response to LC-NE activation or during states of higher versus lower global arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kolta et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McLean and Waterhouse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lombardo et al., 2018</xref>). This difference could reflect differences in the specific neurons that we targeted in ACC, the different task conditions we tested relative to previous studies, analyses based on ongoing versus evoked LC activity, or some combination of these factors, and merits further study.</p><p>What might be the function of LC- and arousal-linked changes in ACC correlations? In general, correlations in spiking activity can be useful or detrimental depending on a number of factors, many of which remain unexplored, particularly outside of sensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>). For example, an increase in correlations is considered a possible mechanism for connecting neural populations over a range of spatial and temporal scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gray et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Singer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Riehle et al., 1997</xref>). Some computational schemes can benefit from increases in correlated variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Singer and Gray, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gray, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Valente et al., 2021</xref>). However, an increase in correlations can also negatively impact the information coding capacity of a large neural population, particularly over longer integration windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zohary et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Renart et al., 2010</xref>; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nirenberg and Latham, 2003</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>, for alternative interpretations). Global states such as arousal and attention (traditionally linked with LC-NE and cholinergic systems, respectively) can modulate cortical correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Herrero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Some work has also suggested that correlations induced by common inputs must be actively decorrelated by the action of local recurrent excitation and inhibition to preserve information fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Renart et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that both increases and decreases in coordinated neural activity patterns in cortex may be under context-dependent, moment-by-moment control of the LC-NE system. Event-driven transient activation of LC could help to synchronize populations of cortical neurons by shifting them to a more correlated state. Conversely, during nonevoked, ongoing (event-independent) firing, the NE release could enhance information processing and signal-to-noise ratios by reducing cortical correlations. Further work is needed to identify if and how NE-mediated changes in network dynamics subserve these functions, particularly in the context of goal-directed behaviors that involve multiple brain regions, including LC and ACC, as well as other neuromodulator systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Varazzani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ebitz and Platt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alamia et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Three adult male rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were used for this study (monkeys Oz, Ci, and Sp).

The behavioral task and pupillometry recording and analysis techniques were identical to those we used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, fixation trials were of variable length (1–5 s, uniformly distributed). The monkey was rewarded with a drop of water or diluted Kool-Aid for maintaining fixation until the end of the trial. On a subset of randomly chosen trials (~25%), after 1–1.5 s of fixation a sound (1 kHz, 0.5 s) was played over a speaker in the experimental booth (‘beep trials’). The monkey was required to maintain fixation through the presentation of the sound, until the fixation point was turned off.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Each monkey was implanted with a recording cylinder that provided access to LC+ (the LC and adjacent, NE-containing subcoeruleus nucleus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Paxinos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kalwani et al., 2014</xref>), inferior colliculus (IC), and superior colliculus (SC).

Briefly, the LC was targeted initially using custom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kalwani et al., 2009</xref>) and/or commercial software (Brainsight). Tracks were then refined using electrophysiological recordings and microstimulation in brain regions dorsal to LC. Neurons in the intermediate layers of SC (SC<sub>i</sub>) exhibited spatial tuning on a visually guided saccade task and could elicit saccades via electrical microstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Robinson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sparks and Nelson, 1987</xref>). IC units exhibited clear responses to auditory stimuli. Activity in the trigeminal mesencephalic tract (me5), located immediately dorsal to the LC, showed distinct activity related to orofacial movements such as sipping. LC+ units had relatively long action potential waveforms, were sensitive to arousing external stimuli (e.g., door knocking), and decreased firing when the monkey was drowsy (e.g., eyelids drooped; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aston-Jones et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bouret and Richmond, 2009</xref>). Nonoptimal tracks also helped with mapping; for example, a more medial track could miss me5 but lead to the trochlear decussation with characteristic ramp-and-hold activity related to downward saccades. Likewise, tracks that encountered IC but not SC<sub>i</sub> were likely too lateral and often missed me5 and LC. Sites were verified using MRI and assessing the effects of systemic injection of clonidine on LC+ responses in monkeys Oz and Ci and by histology with electrolytic lesions and electrode-tract reconstruction in monkey Oz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kalwani et al., 2014</xref>).

For ACC recordings, we targeted the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus, ~4–6 mm below the cortical surface. ACC tracks were planned and refined using MRI and Brainsight software, as well as by listening for characteristic patterns of white and gray matter during recordings in an initial series of mapping experiments. Recordings were conducted using either custom-made single electrodes or multicontact linear electrode arrays (8- and 16-channel V-probe, Plexon).</p><p>For each brain region, we recorded and analyzed data from all stable, well-isolated units that we encountered. Neural recordings were filtered between 100 Hz and 8 kHz for spikes (Plexon MAP). Spikes were sorted offline (Plexon offline sorter). Electrical microstimulation in SC<sub>i</sub> consisted of biphasic (negative-positive) pulses, 0.3 ms long, 100 ms in duration, and delivered at 300 Hz via a Grass S-88 stimulator through a pair of constant-current stimulus isolation units (Grass SIU6) that were linked together to generate the biphasic pulse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For each recorded neuron, we considered spiking activity only during stable fixation, defined as a 1.1 s window that began 1 s after attaining fixation in which the monkey’s gaze remained within a square window 0.2° per side centered on the fixation point.

The authors systematically assess the relationship between neuronal activity in an important neuromodulatory center of the brainstem, the locus coeruleus (LC), and a reciprocally connected cortical region, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). LC is a major source of cortical norepinephrine (NE), so LC spikes may predict momentary changes in cortical NE. Pupil size, also measured here, is sometimes used as a peripheral index of NE levels in the cortex, though this is also correlated with a variety of other factors, including other neuromodulators. The authors have three main conclusions. First, spikes in LC neurons predicted a decrease in the Fano factor in ACC and a decrease in the pair-wise correlations (r<sub>sc</sub>) between highly correlated ACC neurons. Second, both LC spikes and ACC r<sub>sc</sub> appeared to have a consistent phase relationship with pupil size, with the troughs in ACC r<sub>sc</sub> lagging LC spikes. Third, LC spikes predicted changes in the relationship between surprising stimuli and ACC r<sub>sc</sub>, as well as the relationship between the pupil response to surprising stimuli and ACC r<sub>sc</sub>. The authors also mention that these changes are independent of the relationship of LC activity and ACC firing rates.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers felt that this is a timely and important study, particularly because the LC-ACC circuit is under-characterized in primates. The major strengths of the study include the rarity of the data set, the technical sophistication of the analyses, and the investigation of LC-ACC relationships across multiple timescales. However, it was felt that revisions are needed to make some points convincingly, and in other cases the inherent limitations in the analyses should be more thoroughly acknowledged. The specific comments on these points are outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The analyses in this study do not directly assess causality or directionality of the interactions reported. This was noted my multiple reviewers, with specific points in the comments below. In addition to these points, in light of the difficulty in claiming causality or directionality from recording data, and it was agreed that there should be a general restructuring of the interpretation to reflect this limitation.</p><p>a. While the data are very interesting and compelling in their current form. I think that some limitations of the current analyses should be acknowledged. Specifically, the analyses do not allow for inferences about the directionality of effects. So, it remains open if the changes of LC firing rate cause the changes in spike-count correlations in ACC (as seems likely), or vice-versa; or if a third variable causes the effects in both brain regions? Even without causal manipulations, inferences of this kind could be based on an assessment of the temporal relationships of changes in the local signal properties. It could also be based on statistical assessments (e.g. using multivariate autoregressive modeling) of &quot;Granger causality&quot;.</p><p>b. Related to &quot;Single-neuron activity during passive fixation&quot;/Figure 2. I'm curious to understand the direction of this effect – does variance in ACC predict spike counts in LC or do spikes in LC predict variance in ACC? Is it possible to look at spike-evoked Fano factor in the ACC (i.e. before and after an LC spike)? Figure 6 is described as implying that these LC spikes and ACC r<sub>sc</sub> are temporally related, but this is only analyzed as mediated by the relationship between each and pupil size, but this temporal relationship appears not to be investigated directly (&quot;relatively fixed temporal relationships to pupil fluctuations and therefore to each other&quot;).</p><p>c. The authors do nice internal controls testing not only LC-ACC effects, but also ACC-LC effects. They describe that LC-ACC are significant, while the ACC-LC effects are less reliable. This is important for their claims but also as a validation of the analyses. Did the authors formally compare whether there are significant differences between ACC-LC and LC-ACC effects? Showing that ACC-LC is not significant does not address this per se. Slopes (Figure 5) can definitely be tested for LC-ACC vs ACC-LC. (e.g., is the slope more negative in one versus the other).</p><p>d. Figure 6A, in the legend is described as evidence that LC spikes have a consistent phase relationship with pupil fluctuations that have a period of 600 ms. In the text, this result is taken as evidence that LC peaks 270 ms in advance of the &quot;relevant pupil change&quot; (I'm not entirely clear what pupil phase is being referenced by this phrase). Are these different interpretations? Do LC spikes have a fixed relationship to one component of the pupil fluctuations (like dilation or the cresting at peak size) or are they entrained to the oscillation? Also, it would be good to cite Pong and Fuchs 2000 J Neurophysiol in addition to Joshi, 2016 as evidence for hippus in the monkey at this 1.67 Hz frequency.</p><p>e. Related, in Figure 6B, it looks (to my eye) like ACC r<sub>sc</sub> is also peaking in advance of the trough highlighted in this figure. This would suggest an alternative model, where high r<sub>sc</sub> in ACC predicts spontaneous LC spiking, and then lower r<sub>sc</sub> in ACC. This alternative might more in line with Alla Karpova's work that focuses on the effects of ACC on LC activity, rather than the LC-ACC relationship that is the focus of this paper.</p><p>2. A major caution in interpreting these results is that the paper performs a lot of multiple comparisons in nested bins, and it is not clear that the multiple comparison problem is appropriately controlled for. Many effects appear obvious in the plots suggesting that the three major results would survive correction (i.e. Figure 2G), but for some of the latter analyses it is not clear that effects would survive correction. This problem is complicated by the fact that the tests are strongly interdependent, so it's not clear that a simple correction would be sufficient. It may be more appropriate to conduct permutation tests, or directly ask how independent variables alter how the dependent variable scales with bin sizes.</p><p>3. There was some confusion surrounding the motivation for the study as stated in the Introduction. Specifically, the tonic/phasic dichotomy is mentioned in the introduction, but it appears that this was not directly investigated in the rest of the manuscript. Moreover, it was noted that this dichotomy may not be so clear-cut. There may be some overlap with the ideas of ongoing/evoked activity, as in the Aston-Jones and Cohen (2005) framework, however the links between these perspectives are not explored. Reviewers recommend either describing in more detail how the tonic/phasic perspectives motivated the study, or removing this from the introduction and better explaining why one might be curious about the relationship between LC spikes and ACC activity. In the same vein, it would also be helpful to motivate the specific analyses that were performed. Later analyses were well motivated, but the rationale behind the first few were less clear.</p><p>4. The authors claim that the firing rate changes in ACC are not reliably related to LC activity, yet the effects appear significant when monkeys are combined? As the authors know, short times scale firing rate correlations (and cross correlations) even in anatomically connected areas are very hard to detect but nonetheless could be real. I think the authors need to take these effects into account to make a convincing case that the other effects they focus on cannot be explained by small population level shifts in rate (or also particularly in fano factor which is highly relevant to population level correlations). I believe this is in their data but it should be fleshed out and the above points should be discussed.</p><p>5. Two conceptual points were raised that should be addressed in the discussion or elsewhere:</p><p>a. It is reported that LC phasic activity related to bottom up salient cues (e.g. &quot;surprise&quot; or &quot;startle&quot;) increases correlations in ACC, so does this mean the ACC is able to encode less information during surprising events as would be predicted by most theories of correlated activity and information coding in cortex? This has interesting implications for ACC functions, if true.</p><p>b. The current literature on LC is very preliminary and theoretic. Precisely, while strong assumptions exist about what it encodes, we don't know if it encodes RPEs, surprises, intense sensory events, higher order RPEs (e.g. some belief state violation related signal), etc. It looks like it is likely complex, however the present task is very simple and may miss important nuances in the LC-ACC network. It is important to point this out and explicitly indicate early in the paper that the procedure is meant to &quot;elicit&quot; LC firing states, rather than test what Lc encodes.</p><p>6. It was concluded that LC activity has a context-dependent effect on ACC r<sub>sc</sub>, increasing it during passive viewing, but not changing it with LC activity is evoked by a surprising event. However, this conclusion is based on comparing post-stimulus ACC r<sub>sc</sub> to the pre-stimulus baseline, which does not rule out the alternative interpretation that ACC activity before a surprising event predicts the likelihood of an LC spike. To elaborate, it seems like there is largely a change in the pre-beep, baseline ACC r<sub>sc</sub> in this data. This would imply that elevated ACC r<sub>sc</sub> before beep trials predicts no phasic response in LC. If so, the decrease in ACC r<sub>sc</sub> after LC might be a simple homeostatic effect (i.e. due to the tendency to return to baseline), rather than a context-dependent effect of LC spikes on ACC r<sub>sc</sub>. Did the authors consider this alternative model? Further, the paper does not show that the pattern of ACC r<sub>sc</sub> after a surprising beep is any different following an LC spike than it is in the absence of an LC spike.</p><p>7. In Figure 8, it's not clear if the effects are due to the fact that beep-evoked changes are happening over longer time scales or if they're happening at different latencies relative to the beep (i.e. the longer bin sizes are ambiguous here). The latter seems most likely, given that there's no change in the peak of the quenching with LC spikes, but it would be helpful to clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63490.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have revised the text to avoid unsupported suggestions of causality and instead focus on the main measurements and related findings – namely, the relationship between spiking activity in one region relative to spiking activity in the other region. For example, in the second paragraph of the Introduction, we state: “Our aim was to test if and how endogenous, tonic ongoing activity and sensory-driven, evoked, phasic firing patterns responses in the LC relate to changes in neural activity patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the primate brain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a.

We agree that, ideally, explicit causal manipulations (not done in our study) might provide clear answers about the directionality of these effects. In the context of our current data set, we revisited this point and examined temporal relationships between spiking in the two regions. For example, we computed LC spike-triggered average (STA) measures of PETHs of ACC spiking, variability, and pairwise correlations (and ACC STA of LC spiking).</p><p>Unfortunately, we were not able to make much sense of these analyses, which are all highly sensitive to even subtle changes in spike rates over the course of fixation that we were not able to compensate for effectively. To overcome this problem, we instead analyzed the time courses of relationships between LC and ACC spiking patterns aligned two fixed task events: fixation onset and beep onset. These analyses, which are presented in the new Figure 9, are consistent with the two main findings from our study: (1) on average, an elevation of baseline LC activity corresponds to a subsequent decrease in ACC r<sub>sc</sub>; and (2) on average, a transient, beep-evoked LC response is followed by a rapid increase in ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

We have now included a schematic (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) to explain more clearly how these measurements were made. During stable fixation, the pupil size oscillates quasi-periodically. We have also related these findings to those shown in Joshi et al., 2016. In that study (Joshi et al., 2016, Figure 5, LC firing re: pupil events) we showed that LC firing increases relative to maximum rate of pupil dilation and decreases relative to maximum rate of constriction. Here, we corroborated this result (in a new set of experiments and animals/hemispheres) and extended it to show that when aligned to pupil “events” that are not the peak rates of dilation or constriction (i.e., phases other than 0° and 180°), LC spiking show less pronounced peaks. Therefore, during passive viewing, the peak rates of pupil dilation and constriction have a special relationship with LC firing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e.

Specifically, the tonic/phasic dichotomy is mentioned in the introduction, but it appears that this was not directly investigated in the rest of the manuscript. Moreover, it was noted that this dichotomy may not be so clear-cut. There may be some overlap with the ideas of ongoing/evoked activity, as in the Aston-Jones and Cohen (2005) framework, however the links between these perspectives are not explored. Reviewers recommend either describing in more detail how the tonic/phasic perspectives motivated the study, or removing this from the introduction and better explaining why one might be curious about the relationship between LC spikes and ACC activity. In the same vein, it would also be helpful to motivate the specific analyses that were performed. Later analyses were well motivated, but the rationale behind the first few were less clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insight. We have revised the text throughout to better motivate the initial analyses and clarify the terminology. We now use the terms “ongoing” and “evoked” instead of “tonic” and “phasic”, as the latter might have distinct implications (as we also discussed in detail in Joshi and Gold, 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors claim that the firing rate changes in ACC are not reliably related to LC activity, yet the effects appear significant when monkeys are combined? As the authors know, short times scale firing rate correlations (and cross correlations) even in anatomically connected areas are very hard to detect but nonetheless could be real. I think the authors need to take these effects into account to make a convincing case that the other effects they focus on cannot be explained by small population level shifts in rate (or also particularly in fano factor which is highly relevant to population level correlations). I believe this is in their data but it should be fleshed out and the above points should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. Changes in ACC spiking and Fano factor are indeed <italic>not</italic> reliably related to LC activity (Figure 2). We agree that <italic>any</italic> changes in ACC Fano factor might be important in relation to changes in ACC correlated variability. We explored this via an additional analysis to measure the relationship between LC-linked changes in ACC rsc and ACC Fano factor. This is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. We found a weak but reliable positive correlation between changes in ACC correlated variability and changes in ACC pair Fano factor (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Two conceptual points were raised that should be addressed in the discussion or elsewhere:</p><p>a. It is reported that LC phasic activity related to bottom up salient cues (e.g. &quot;surprise&quot; or &quot;startle&quot;) increases correlations in ACC, so does this mean the ACC is able to encode less information during surprising events as would be predicted by most theories of correlated activity and information coding in cortex? This has interesting implications for ACC functions, if true.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have revised and clarified the Discussion related to these results. In particular, increases and decreases in ACC correlations might be associated with different effects. Encoding specific information is one function of cortical networks. Another is coordination of activity, especially when there are sudden, salient changes in the environment (such as a startling event). Reduction in correlations could lead to increased information encoding capacity (as predicted/theorized by many) whereas increased correlations (or greater synchronization) could serve as a coordinating signal within ACC (and possibly between cortical regions, but we have not tested that here), similar to a network reset. A recent report by Valente et al. (2021) suggests a role for increased correlations in behavioral readout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The current literature on LC is very preliminary and theoretic. Precisely, while strong assumptions exist about what it encodes, we don't know if it encodes RPEs, surprises, intense sensory events, higher order RPEs (e.g. some belief state violation related signal), etc. It looks like it is likely complex, however the present task is very simple and may miss important nuances in the LC-ACC network. It is important to point this out and explicitly indicate early in the paper that the procedure is meant to &quot;elicit&quot; LC firing states, rather than test what Lc encodes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this important point and have edited the text accordingly. For example, in the Introduction we state that “Our aim was to test if and how endogenous, ongoing activity and sensory-driven, evoked responses in the LC relate to changes in neural activity patterns in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the primate brain.” In the Discussion, we reiterate that these are measurements made during passive fixation and that similar measurements will need to be made “particularly in the context of goal-directed behaviors” that will test what LC encodes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It was concluded that LC activity has a context-dependent effect on ACC r<sub>sc</sub>, increasing it during passive viewing, but not changing it with LC activity is evoked by a surprising event. However, this conclusion is based on comparing post-stimulus ACC r<sub>sc</sub> to the pre-stimulus baseline, which does not rule out the alternative interpretation that ACC activity before a surprising event predicts the likelihood of an LC spike. To elaborate, it seems like there is largely a change in the pre-beep, baseline ACC r<sub>sc</sub> in this data. This would imply that elevated ACC r<sub>sc</sub> before beep trials predicts no phasic response in LC. If so, the decrease in ACC r<sub>sc</sub> after LC might be a simple homeostatic effect (i.e. due to the tendency to return to baseline), rather than a context-dependent effect of LC spikes on ACC r<sub>sc</sub>. Did the authors consider this alternative model? Further, the paper does not show that the pattern of ACC r<sub>sc</sub> after a surprising beep is any different following an LC spike than it is in the absence of an LC spike.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these insightful points. We have re-made the main figure (Figure 7) to show explicitly that the pattern of ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> after a surprising beep is different following an LC spike than it is in the absence of an LC spike (*’s in Figure 7A). We now also include a new figure (Figure 9) that shows the time course of ACC LC firing rate and ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> before and after the beep, separated into trials with and without an evoked LC response. We show that: (1) there is no reliable difference in LC spiking or ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> on trials with versus without a beep-evoked LC response; and (2) the pattern of ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> after the beep is different on trials with versus without a beep-evoked LC response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 8, it's not clear if the effects are due to the fact that beep-evoked changes are happening over longer time scales or if they're happening at different latencies relative to the beep (i.e. the longer bin sizes are ambiguous here). The latter seems most likely, given that there's no change in the peak of the quenching with LC spikes, but it would be helpful to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. The results shown in Figure 9 address these points by showing the time course of changes in LC spiking and ACC <italic>r<sub>sc</sub></italic> following the beep.</p></body></sub-article></article>
