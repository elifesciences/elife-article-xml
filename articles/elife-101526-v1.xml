However, whether education causes long-term structural changes in the brain remains unclear. A pressing challenge is that individuals self-select into continued education, thereby introducing a wide variety of environmental and genetic confounders. Fortunately, natural experiments allow us to isolate the causal impact of increased education from individual (and societal) characteristics. Here, we exploit a policy change in the UK (the 1972 ROSLA act) that increased the amount of mandatory schooling from 15 to 16 years of age to study the impact of education on long-term structural brain outcomes in the UK Biobank. Using regression discontinuity (RD) – a causal inference method – we find no evidence of an effect from an additional year of education on any structural neuroimaging outcomes. This null result is robust across modalities, regions, and analysis strategies. An additional year of education is a substantial cognitive intervention, yet we find no evidence for sustained experience-dependent plasticity. Our results provide a challenge for prominent accounts of cognitive or ‘brain reserve’ theories which identify education as a major protective factor to lessen adverse aging effects. Our preregistered findings are one of the first implementations of RD on neural data – opening the door for causal inference in population-based neuroimaging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroimaging</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>natural experiment</kwd><kwd>Regression discontinuity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003986</institution-id><institution>Jacobs Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jacobs Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judd</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006209</institution-id><institution>Radboud Universitair Medisch Centrum</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hypatia fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kievit</surname><given-names>Rogier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004472</institution-id><institution>Riksbankens Jubileumsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pro Futura Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Judd</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There is no discernible effect of an additional year of education from a policy change on long-term structural neuroimaging measures in a large aging sample (UK Biobank).</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Access to education is codified as a fundamental human right with immense societal and economic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Geneva Convention IV, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">UNCRC, 1989</xref>). Individuals who experience more education tend to show a wide variety of beneficial health, cognitive, and neural outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lövdén et al., 2020</xref>). Correlational evidence across disparate contexts, countries, and demographics offers overwhelming support for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Strand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ross and Wu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kobayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Waldstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Livingston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Montez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turrini et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Education not only increases learned skills and knowledge, but also reasoning and fluid intelligence abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ceci, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ritchie and Tucker-Drob, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Means and Voss, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Judd et al., 2022</xref>). One plausible mechanism underlying these widespread benefits from education is the long-term reorganization of brain structure. Lifespan theories on heterogenous neurodevelopment place particular emphasis on education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stern, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lindenberger and Lövdén, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Newcombe, 2011</xref>) and correlative work further supports the role of brain structure as a mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Waldstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Walhovd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noble et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, more educated individuals show higher mean cortical thickness (CT) in later life – taken as evidence of ‘increased brain reserve’ lessening the neurodegenerative effects of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Yet, strong causal evidence for the effect of education on brain structure is severely lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seyedsalehi et al., 2023</xref>). Both ethical and practical constraints mean that the effect of education cannot be experimentally tested. This makes it unclear if any findings from education are causal, or if instead, they reflect a complex web of preexisting, interacting, sociodemographic and individual characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lövdén et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 2021</xref>) – many of which have been associated with brain structure (e.g. intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jung and Haier, 2007</xref>], parental income [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farah, 2017</xref>], neighborhood pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bottenhorn et al., 2024</xref>]). Among the plethora of environmental factors, there is also a substantial (~40% heritability) genetic component implicated in educational attainment, further confounding potential effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branigan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, access to higher education involves substantial selection processes at the level of the individual and educational system, which further complicate the causal pathways involved.</p><p>One solution to this problem is using a <italic>natural experiment</italic> – a ‘random-like’ (exogenous) external event – allowing causal inference in observational phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Lemieux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>). A crucial feature of this design is an assignment mechanism outside a participant’s control, usually of natural (e.g. geographical, weather events) or governmental (e.g. policy decisions, cutoff rules) origin. For instance, a law that increases the number of mandatory school years affects everyone equally, in turn, decoupling individual characteristics and other unmeasured confounders from the effects of additional education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angrist and Krueger, 1991</xref>). One of the most widely used causal inference analysis techniques is regression discontinuity (RD), which is applicable when treatment is assigned via a cutoff of a particular score or running variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Lemieux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>). Recent advances in the field of econometrics have optimized inference and largely standardized RD analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Kolesár, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong and Kolesár, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattaneo et al., 2019</xref>). Similar natural experimental designs have provided robust evidence that additional education <italic>causes</italic> an increase in intelligence (0.14–0.35 SD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ritchie and Tucker-Drob, 2018</xref>). Despite the many strengths and potential causal insights natural experiments offer the field of cognitive neuroscience, they have not been used to address such questions.</p><p>On September 1 1972, the minimum mandatory age to leave school was raised from 15 to 16 years of age in England, Scotland, and Wales (called here ‘ROSLA’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">ROSLA, 1972</xref>). The consequence of this law change was substantial: it resulted in almost 100% of children aged 15 staying in school for an additional year, in turn, increasing formal qualifications, income, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gorman, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark and Royer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clark and Royer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barcellos et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcellos et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether this substantial intervention also affected the long-term brain structure of those born right around the cut-off remains an open question. This is unfortunate, as RD is a powerful tool to study phenomena that cannot (ethically or practically) be randomized. Recent developments of increased large population-based neuroimaging cohorts provide the sample size needed to make use of these cross-disciplinary methods. One such cohort, the UK BioBank, has recruitment criteria matching the geographic and birth window of the natural experiment ROSLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018</xref>). This provides the ideal opportunity to test, for the first time, the causal effect of a year of education on long-term structural neuroimaging properties.</p><p>Using a preregistered design (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rv38z/">https://osf.io/rv38z/</ext-link>) with over 30,000 participants, we evaluate if an additional year of education, as mandated by ROSLA, causes changes in six global neural properties (total surface area [SA], average CT, normalized total brain volume [TBV], mean weighted fractional anisotropy [wFA], white matter hyperintensities [WMh], and normalized cerebral spinal fluid volume) as compared to individuals born before the cut-off. It is also possible that an effect from education could manifest only in specific regions, in the absence of broad, macro-neural effects. For this reason, we further tested 66 individual cortical regions for SA and CT, 27 white matter fiber tracks for fractional anisotropy, and subcortical gray matter volume in 18 regions. Taken together, the combination of cutting-edge quantitative methods, a large sample, a well-validated natural experiment, and high-quality imaging allows us to examine, for the first time, if an additional year of education causes long-term structural reorganization in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To test if an additional year of education causes long-lasting changes in neural properties, we used fuzzy local-linear RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Kolesár, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong and Kolesár, 2020</xref>). This continuity-based technique exploits the fact that ROSLA affected individuals based on a date of birth (DOB) cutoff (September 1, 1957). More specifically, adolescents born after this date had to spend one more year in school than those born only one day earlier. Compliance with ROSLA was very high (near 100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, given the cultural and historical trends leading to an increase in school attendance before ROSLA, most adolescents were continuing with education past 15 years of age before the policy change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Prior work has estimated that 25% of children would have left school a year earlier if not for ROSLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark and Royer, 2010</xref>). Using the UK Biobank, we estimate this proportion to be around 10%, as the sample is healthier and of higher SES than the general population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Alten et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lyall et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Local-linear RD analysis tests the effect of this policy change by comparing the limits of two non-parametric functions, one fit using only participants right before the policy change to another function fit on participants right after (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>). If an additional year of education affects neural outcomes, we assume that brain structure will be <italic>discontinuous</italic> exactly at the cutoff. In contrast, if ROSLA does not affect long-term neural outcomes, the functions should be <italic>continuous</italic> around the cutoff.</p><p>Using fuzzy local-linear RD, we fit a series of regressions to various measures of brain structure to test for any discontinuity at the cutoff. To determine the optimal number of participants to include, we use mean square error optimized bandwidths to a maximal range of 10 years before and after the cutoff (N&gt;30,000). Doing so, we observed no evidence of an effect from additional education on any of our preregistered global neuroimaging measures (<italic>p’s</italic>&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In other words, the relationship between the year of birth and neural outcomes was <italic>continuous</italic> around ROSLA’s cutoff, indicating no differences in global structural measures from an extra year of education. The optimized bandwidths used in this analysis included participants born 20–35 months around the cutoff (average N=5124). The absence of a causal effect of education was observed for all our global neuroimaging metrics: total SA, average CT, normalized TBV, mean wFA, WMh, or normalized cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

However, to ensure the validity of our (causal) inferences, a critical step in any RD approach is to test the validity of the design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>). For instance, if participants can manipulate their treatment by sorting around the cutoff, this severely limits the strength of causal claims. In the context of ROSLA, this is highly unlikely since the assignment was based on DOB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">ROSLA, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Geruso and Royer, 2018</xref>). However, for completeness, we tested this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattaneo et al., 2018</xref>), finding no evidence that individuals were somehow able to adjust their enrollment (<italic>T<sub>q</sub></italic> = –0.72, p=0.47; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A second validation approach is to employ <italic>placebo outcome tests</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>).

An additional benefit is that we implemented this analysis in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to more readily interpret the strength of evidence either in favor of the null or alternative hypothesis. Our preregistered default point null Bayes factors were too wide, arguably providing relatively strong evidence in favor of the null. Taking a more conservative approach, we report these analyses with a narrower normal prior (mean = 0, sd = 1). Doing so, we replicated and extended our findings from fuzzy local-linear RD analysis, observing <italic>strong</italic> evidence in favor of the null hypothesis for total SA (BF<sub>01</sub>=18.21), average CT (BF<sub>01</sub>=15.09), TBV (BF<sub>01</sub>=13.61), wFA (BF<sub>01</sub>=11.63), WMh (BF<sub>01</sub>=13.26), and cerebral spinal fluid volume (BF<sub>01</sub>=14.50). In addition, we tested across a range of priors which did not meaningfully affect our inferences, as each showed evidence in favor of the null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6 supp4">Supplementary files 4 and 6</xref>).</p><p>The two quantitative RD approaches described here (local-linear and local randomization) have strengths and challenges similar to the widespread bias versus variance tradeoff. As the number of months on either side of the cutoff increases, bias is introduced as participants become less similar. Yet at the same time, the sample size increases, thereby lowering the variance of the estimate. Our local randomization approach runs a negligible risk of bias, but at the cost of a relatively modest sample size: One could argue the 230 participants included in our 1-month window are too few for neuroimaging outcomes. To examine the consequences of this tradeoff, we therefore expanded the boundary to a 5-month window around September 1, 1957 (n per group ≈ 600).

Similar to the causal approach, five of the six measures showed evidence in support of the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In contrast, total SA showed weak evidence in support of a positive association of education (BF<sub>10</sub>=2.3, n=229).

This null result is present across imaging modalities, different regions, and analysis strategies. We find no issues with the design of the 1972 ROSLA, substantiating it as a valid natural experiment, in agreement with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark and Royer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clark and Royer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barcellos et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcellos et al., 2018</xref>). Despite a large sample (min N=4238), we find no evidence of an effect of education on any of the global neuroimaging measures with a continuity-based RD analysis. Confirming this result, we find strong evidence in support of the null hypothesis for these global neuroimaging measures using a Bayesian local randomization analysis. Moreover, we find no regionally specific effect of education on local mean CTs or SA across 66 cortical regions. This lack of localized effects was further confirmed in weighted mean fractional anisotropy for 27 white matter tracks, as well as subcortical gray matter volume in 18 regions. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability to find strong evidence in favor of observational associations between education and brain structure at this resolution, suggesting our findings are not due to lack of sensitivity more generally.</p><p>Our robust null result is seemingly at odds with causal inference findings of education’s positive behavioral effect on intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ceci, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Judd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gorman, 2023</xref>) – which is sustained throughout decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ritchie and Tucker-Drob, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 2018</xref>). This juxtaposition suggests that, to the extent that the additional year of education induced long-term changes in cognitive abilities, the neural manifestation is at a level of resolution not detectable with conventional MRI field strengths. However, this would seem to contrast with a range of influential findings demonstrating that high-intensity experimental behavioral interventions (e.g. juggling, studying, memory training) lead to measurable differences in brain structure (with similar imaging pipelines) in much smaller samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Draganski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Draganski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bråthen et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, compared to even these high-intensity interventions, a year of education is an <italic>extensive</italic> period of learning. The 1972 ROSLA was well implemented, schools had time to prepare and were given additional funding, increasing standardized formal qualifications of those affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clark and Royer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barcellos et al., 2023</xref>). This leaves open the question of how to interpret this constellation of findings.</p><p>One potential explanation to account for this discrepancy is the concept of <italic>expansion-renormalization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wenger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garzón et al., 2023</xref>), which posits that following a period of skill acquisition, the cortex initially expands and then renormalizes over the course of a few months. In our context, this would suggest that the additional year would have manifested at a level detectable in MRI when the difference in educational exposure between children pre- and post-ROSLA was most pronounced and recent. In other words, MRI effects at the macro-scale might have been detectable immediately post-ROSLA in 16-year-old adolescents, before renormalizing to a micro-scale, leaving in place permanent, but microstructural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hille et al., 2024</xref>). Possible cellular candidates for initial experience-dependent plasticity are an increase in dendritic spines, the swelling of astrocytes, and intracortical myelin adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hille et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mediavilla et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schmidt et al., 2021</xref>). These structural changes may be detectable using other approaches such as in vivo cellular work (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goriounova et al., 2018</xref>), extreme high field strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garzón et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vachha and Huang, 2021</xref>), or postmortem histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perneczky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the long period of time between additional education and neuroimaging offers both strengths and weaknesses for our design. First, it could be the case that 46 years is too long and any potential effect faded out over the years. That is, rather than having a micro-neural effect, it may be that there simply are no lingering effects at the brain level at all. In this case, it may be better to think of the (causal) impact of additional education as more akin to fitness or strength interventions which are also unlikely to persist across such a period. However, we note that prominent aging-related theories of heterogeneity argue <italic>directly against</italic> this rationale, instead positing life course experiences offer a reserve or ‘brain buffer’ that leads to an increasing cascade of processes limiting adverse aging effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stern, 2002</xref>). Here, the timing between our intervention (ROSLA) and scanning makes our design particularly well-powered to test these theories, since education would contribute to an initial brain buffer (intercept) and any cumulative educational effect (slope) over 46 years. While our results are at odds with prior conceptual and observational work, a recent longitudinal study found prior education to not affect the rate of brain aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nyberg et al., 2021</xref>) – in alignment with our findings.</p><p>Lastly, to demonstrate the importance of controlling for unobserved confounders, we conducted a simple correlation analysis – using the same subset of participants – relating education to differences in brain structure. We found evidence to support an <italic>association</italic> between more years of education and greater SA and cerebral spinal fluid volume. This result emphasizes the need for caution in attributing causation in non-causal designs, as unobserved confounders can masquerade as an effect of interest. For instance, more education is frequently highlighted as offering behavioral and neural protection against the adverse effects of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stern, 2002</xref>) – while we replicate this inference associationally, we find no causal evidence for any neuroprotective effects. This suggests a more complex pathway of effects unfolding over time. Environmental causes are most likely very small and additive, which makes them not only difficult to study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burt and Johnson, 2023</xref>) but also equally hard to adequately control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">von Stumm and d’Apice, 2022</xref>). Our findings suggest that to truly understand the neural and behavioral processes that unfold after interventions such as education, we need a multipronged, mixed methods approach that combines deep phenotyping, longitudinal imaging, and behavioral follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pfeifer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Molenaar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwartz and Glymour, 2023</xref>), as well as more sophisticated models that can capture gene-by-environment interplay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Judd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burt and Johnson, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dolan et al., 2021</xref>). Only then will we be able to identify idiosyncratic environmental effects and individual characteristics underlying heterogenous lifespan development.</p><p>The UK Biobank is known to have <italic>‘healthy volunteer bias’</italic>, as respondents tend to be healthier, more educated, and are more likely to own property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Alten et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lyall et al., 2022</xref>). Various types of selection bias can occur in non-representative samples, impacting either internal (type 1) or external (type 2) validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Alten et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Munafò et al., 2018</xref>). One benefit of a natural experimental design is that it protects against threats to internal validity from selection bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barcellos et al., 2023</xref>). Design-based internal validity threats still exist, such as if volunteer bias differentially impacts individuals based on the cutoff for assignment. A more pressing limitation – in particular, for an education policy change – is our power to detect effects using a sample of higher-educated individuals. This is evident in our first stage analysis examining the percentage of 15-year-olds impacted by ROSLA, which we estimate to be 10% in neuro-UKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), yet has been reported to be 25% in the UK general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark and Royer, 2010</xref>). Our results should be interpreted for this subpopulation (UK, 1973, from 15 to 16 years of age, compliers) as we estimate a ‘local’ average treatment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choi and Lee, 2018</xref>). Natural experimental designs such as ours offer the potential for high internal validity at the expense of external validity.</p><p>Here, we report a lack of causal evidence of a year of school on long-term neural outcomes in a large sample of aging individuals.

The recent availability of large neuroimaging cohort data paired with cutting-edge methods from econometrics offers new avenues in studying neural effects.

Outliers were winsorized if they were either above quartile 3 plus 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) or below quartile 1 minus 1.5 times the IQR and brought to the fence by manually recoding them to this limit (Tukey/Boxplot Method). Our alpha level for global neuroimaging measures (mean CT, total SA, average FA, WM hyper-intensities, normalized TBV and normalized CSF) is 0.05. The regional metrics (SA, CT, wFA, and subcortical structures) are false discovery rate (FDR) corrected using the number of regions per modality (e.g. 66 regions for SA) with a q value less than 0.05 considered significant. Neuroimaging measures are reported in raw units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Continuity-based framework: Local-linear fuzzy regression discontinuity</title><p>RD is a technique we use to estimate the effect of an intervention on an outcome where assignment (usually binary) is based on a cutoff of a running or ‘forcing’ variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee and Lemieux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>) – in our case, age in months. One major design issue in RD is if participants select into (or out of) the treatment group by sorting around to the cutoff of the running variable. However, as the 1972 ROSLA law was not pre-announced, generally strictly enforced, and affected teenagers, such alternative explanations are highly improbable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Geruso and Royer, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, we conducted a density test of the running variable to check for bunching near the cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cattaneo et al., 2018</xref>).

For instance, due to cultural and historical trends, there was an increase in school attendance before ROSLA; most adolescents were continuing with education past 15 years of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Prior work has estimated that 25% of children would have left school a year earlier if not for ROSLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark and Royer, 2010</xref>). Using the UK Biobank, we estimate this proportion to be around 10%, as the sample is healthier and of higher SES than the general population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">van Alten et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lyall et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>RD analysis broadly falls into two separate but complementary frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattaneo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattaneo et al., 2024</xref>). The first, continuity-based approach defines the estimand as the difference between the limits of two continuous non-parametric functions: one fit using only participants right before the policy change to another function fit on participants right after. The other, so-called <italic>local randomization</italic> approaches assume participants are <italic>‘as if random’</italic> in a small window (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$\omega $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) around the cutoff (described more in detail in the section ‘Bayesian Local Randomization analysis’). In this case, the estimand is the mean group difference between participants before and after the cutoff within <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$\omega $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>.

Our outcome variables are the neuroimaging metrics described above, which were adjusted to increase statistical precision (see section ‘covariates of no interest’). The running variable (<italic>X</italic>) is a participant’s date of birth in months (mDOB). As is convention, it was centered at zero around the birth cutoff of ROSLA (September 1, 1957). Our first-stage (fuzzy) outcome was a dummy coded variable of whether the participant completed at least 16 years of education. Participants who indicated they completed college were not asked this question; therefore, we recorded their response as 21 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 2018</xref>). Our choice of using the RDHonest package was primarily due to its ability to provide accurate inference with discrete running variables (in our case mDOB). We used the default settings of local-linear analysis on MSE-derived bandwidths with triangular kernels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Kolesár, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong and Kolesár, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We included participants born in England, Scotland, or Wales 10 years on either side of the September 1, 1957 cutoff (DOB September 1, 1947 – August 31st, 1967) with neuroimaging data. The range of the running variable (age in our case) to include on either side of the cutoff (known as the bandwidth; <italic>z</italic>) is one of the most consequential analytical decisions in RD designs. Prior work using ROSLA in the UK BioBank has analyzed bandwidths as large as 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barcellos et al., 2018</xref>) to as small as a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davies et al., 2018</xref>). Large bandwidths include more participants (decreasing variance), yet these participants are also further away from the cutoff, in turn, potentially increasing bias in the estimand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattaneo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattaneo et al., 2024</xref>). Conversely, smaller bandwidths provide less biased, yet noisier estimates. State-of-the-art continuity-based RD methods use data-driven bandwidth estimation such as mean squared error (MSE) optimized bandwidths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calonico et al., 2014</xref>). Since we used this approach, the optimal bandwidth range and, in turn, the number of included participants will differ per fitted model. This also makes it logically incompatible to sensitivity test our bandwidths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattaneo et al., 2019</xref>), since they are mean squared error derived – widening them will lower variance and, in turn, increase bias while tightening them will have the opposite effect. Lastly, the use of triangular kernels means participants further away from the cutoff will be weighted less than those closer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cattaneo et al., 2019</xref>). Both MSE-optimized bandwidths and triangular kernels determine the number of ‘effective observations’ to be fit by a fuzzy local linear RD model.</p><p>For our global continuity-based analysis, we made sure the results did not change due to missing covariate data. This was accomplished by imputing missing covariate data (≈4%) with classification and regression trees from the MICE package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011</xref>). We imputed using information from only the variables included in each analysis and did not use the running variable (DOB in months) or our first-stage instrument for prediction. We did this ten times, checking the estimates and inferences across each iteration to ensure robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Bayesian local randomization analysis</title><p>As a robustness test and to provide evidence for the null hypothesis, we conducted a Bayesian analysis using the local randomization framework for RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>).

While the local randomization framework invokes stricter assumptions on the assignment mechanism, placing more importance on the window around the cutoff (ω = [c − w, c+w]), it handles discrete running variables well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattaneo et al., 2024</xref>). As the number of months on either side of the cut-off increases, bias is introduced as subjects become less similar, yet at the same time, the sample size increases, thereby lowering the variance of the estimate.</p><p>As recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Titiunik, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cattaneo et al., 2024</xref>), we included participants within the smallest window possible (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft5">\begin{document}$\omega $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>=1 month; August vs September 1957), then expanded to a 5-month window around September 1, 1957. A dummy variable (ROSLA) was constructed to reflect if a participant was impacted by the policy change. We then tested the effect of this variable on our six global neuroimaging measures while correcting for the covariates listed above. As preregistered, in this framework we report the ‘intent to treat estimate’ (ITT) which should be interpreted as the effect of the policy change ROSLA on neuroimaging outcomes. Lastly, a few neuroimaging covariates did not have sufficient observations to be included (see ‘deviations from preregistration’).</p><p>Models were fit in R (v. 4.3.2) with rstanarm with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of 80,000 iterations over four chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodrich et al., 2024</xref>).

However, this is a relatively wide prior for point null Bayesian hypothesis testing, and at odds with the defaults from packages meant for this purpose (e.g. Bayes Factor). We therefore deviated from our preregistration and reported Bayes Factors with a normal prior centered at 0 with a standard deviation of 1 (medium informative). We also report strongly informative (SD = .5) and weakly informative (SD = 1.5) normal priors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Model diagnostics were checked with trace plots, posterior distributions, and rhat values (&lt;1.05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Depaoli and van de Schoot, 2017</xref>).

Bayes factors are reported as BF<sub>10</sub> in support of the alternative hypothesis. We report Bayes factors under 1 as the multiplicative inverse (BF<sub>01</sub>=1/BF). The strength of evidence was interpreted on a graded scale using the criteria preregistered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jeffreys, 1961</xref>).

We used standard neuroimaging covariates for two purposes: (<italic>1</italic>) to further test the validity of the 1972 ROSLA and (<italic>2</italic>) to increase statistical precision in our RD analysis. For instance, there are large sex differences in certain neural measures mostly related to head size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ritchie et al., 2018</xref>); therefore, we included a dummy variable for sex. We expect ROSLA to not affect the proportion of males and females, yet including this measure as a covariate will increase the estimation precision for measures sensitive to sex-related head size differences (e.g. SA [as expected, we found a 24% precision gain for total SA, measured as the difference in CI width of the RD parameter pre and post-correction. Precision increased for <italic>all</italic> global measures (3–7%, 24%).]).</p><p>Children born in July and August could technically leave school at 15 after the 1972 ROSLA due to the exam period ending in mid-June and the school year starting on September 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clark and Royer, 2010</xref>). This is an artifact of asking in the UK Biobank <italic>‘What age did you complete full-time education?’</italic>, rather than <italic>‘How many years of education did you complete?’</italic>. This artifact predates and is not influenced by ROSLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avendano et al., 2020</xref>).

In turn, there is a wide range of intervals in terms of the period between when someone was born and the age at which they were scanned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We control for this discrepancy by including a variable ‘date of scanning’ (DoS). This was done by coding the earliest date a (included) participant was scanned to 0 and counting the number of days until the last included participant. This resulted in a value for each participant that was the number of days they were scanned after the first participant. We also include this variable squared, so we can model quadratic effects, resulting in two variables (DoS and DoS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">UNCRC, 1989</xref>). Other (preregistered) neuroimaging quality control measures were included, such as scanning site, head motion, whether a T2 FLAIR sequence was used, T1 intensity scaling, and three diffusion measures recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2024</xref>).

They use a regression discontinuity anlaysis to measure the impact of a UK law change in 1972 that increased the years of mandatory education by 1 year. Using brain imaging data from the UK Biobank, they find essentially no evidence for 1 additional year of education altering brain structure in adulthood.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors pre-registered the study and the regression discontinuity was very carefully described and conducted.

How was the flexibility of the model taken into account in testing? Were there any concerns about post-selection inference? A sensitivity analysis across bandwidths is also necessary. Based on the model fit in Figure 1, results from a linear model should also be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>It is common in the RD literature to illustrate plots with higher-order polynomial fits while inference is based on linear (or at most quadratic) models (Cattaneo, Idrobo &amp; Titiunik, 2019). We agree that this field-specific practice can be confusing to readers. Therefore, we have redone Figure 1 using local-linear fits better aligning with our analysis pipeline. Yet, it is still not a <italic>one-to-one</italic> alignment as point estimation and confidence are handled robustly while our plotting tools are simple linear fits. In addition, we updated Sup. Fig 3 and moved 3rd-order polynomial RD plots to Sup. Fig 4.</p><p>Empirical RD has many branching analytical decisions (bandwidth, polynomial order, kernel) which can have large effects on the outcome. Fortunately, RD methodology is starting to become more standardized (Catteneo &amp; Titiunik, 2022, Ann. Econ Rev) as there have been indications of publication bias using these methods (Stommes, Aronow &amp; Sävje, 2023, Research and Politics (This paper suggest it is not researcher degrees of freedom, rather inappropriate inferential methods)). While not necessarily ill-intended, researcher degrees of freedom and analytic flexibility are major contributors to publication bias. We (self) limited our analytic flexibility by using pre-registration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rv38z">https://osf.io/rv38z</ext-link>).</p><p>One of the most consequential analytic decisions in RD is the bandwidth size as there is no established practice, they are context-specific and can be highly influential on the results. The choice of bandwidths can be framed as a ‘bias vs. variance trade-off’. As bandwidths increase, variance decreases since more subjects are added yet bias (misspecification error/smoothing bias) also increases (as these subjects are further away and less similar). In our case, our assignment (running/forcing) variable is ‘date of birth in months’; therefore our smallest comparison would be individuals born in August 1957 (unaffected/no treatment) vs September 1957 (affected/treated). This comparison has the least bias (subjects are the most similar to each other), yet it comes at the expense of <italic>very few</italic> subjects (high variance in our estimate).</p><p>MSE-derived bandwidths attempt to solve this issue by offering an automatic method to choose an analysis bandwidth in RD. Specifically, this aims to minimize the MSE of the local polynomial RD point estimator – effectively choosing a bandwidth by balancing the ‘bias vs. variance trade-off’ (explained in detail 4.4.2 Cattaneo et al., 2019 p 45 - 51 “A practical introduction to regression discontinuity designs: foundations”). Yet, you are very correct in highlighting potential overfitting issues as they are “by construction invalid for inference” (Calonico, Cattaneo &amp; Farrell, 2020, p. 192). Quoting from Cattaneo and Titiunik’s Annual Review of Economics from 2022:</p><p>“Ignoring the misspecification bias can lead to substantial overrejection of the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. For example, back-of-the-envelop calculations show that a nominal 95% confidence interval would have an empirical coverage of about 80%.”</p><p>Fortunately, modern RD analysis packages (such as rdrohust or RDHonest) calculate robust confidence intervals - for more details see Armstrong and Kolesar (2020). For a summary on MSE-bandwidths see the section “Why is it hard to estimate RD effects?” in Stommes and colleagues 2023 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14526">https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14526</ext-link>). For more in-depth handling see the Catteneo, Idrobo, and Titiunik primer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09511">https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09511</ext-link>).</p><p>Lastly, with MSE-derived bandwidths sensitivity tests only make sense within a narrow window of the MSE-optimized bandwidth (5.5 Cattaneo et al., 2019 p 106 - 107). When a significant effect occurs, placebo cutoffs (artificially moving the cutoff) and donut-hole analysis are great sensitivity tests. Instead of testing our bandwidths, we decided to use an alternate RD framework (local randomization) in which we compare 1-month and 5-month windows. Across all analysis strategies, MRI modalities, and brain regions, we do not find any effects of the education policy change ROSLA on long-term neural outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the Bayesian analysis, the authors deviated from their preregistered analytic plan. This whole section is a bit confusing in its current form - for example, point masses are not wide but rather narrow. Bayes factors are usually estimated; it is unclear how or why a prior was specified. What exactly is being modeled using a prior? Also, throughout - If the log was taken, as the methods seem to indicate for the Bayes factor, this should be mentioned in figures and reported estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to thank you for spotting that we incorrectly kept the log in the methods. We have fixed this and added the following sentence to the methods:</p><p>“Bayes factors are reported as BF<sub>10</sub> in support of the alternative hypothesis, we report Bayes factors under 1 as the multiplicative inverse (BF<sub>01</sub> = 1/BF)”</p><p>All Bayesian analyses need to have a prior. In practice, this becomes an issue when you’re uncertain about (1) the location of the effect (directionality &amp; center mass, defined by a location parameter), yet more importantly, the (2) confidence/certainty of the range-spread of possible effects (determined by a scale parameter). In normally distributed priors these two ‘beliefs’ are represented with a mean and a standard deviation (the latter impacts your confidence/certainty on the range of plausible parameter space).</p><p>Supplementary figure 6 illustrates several distributions (location = 0 for all) with varying scale parameters; when used as Bayesian priors this indicates differing levels of confidence in our certainty of the plausible parameter space. We illustrate our three reported, normally distributed priors centered at zero in blue with their differing scale parameters (sd = .5, 1 &amp; 1.5).</p><p>All of these five prior distributions have the same location parameter (i.e., 0) yet varying differences in the scale parameter – our confidence in the certainty of the plausible parameter space. At first glance it might seem like a flat/uniform prior (not represented) is a good idea – yet, this would put equal weight on the possibility of every estimate thereby giving the same probability mass to implausible values as plausible ones. A uniform prior would, for instance, encode the hypothesis that education causing a 1% increase in brain volume is just as plausible as it causing either a doubling or halving in brain volume. In human research, we roughly know a range of reasonable effect sizes and it is rare to see massive effects.</p><p>A benefit of ‘weakly-informative’ priors is that they limit the range of plausible parameter values. The default prior in STAN (a popular Bayesian estimation program; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mc-stan.org">https://mc-stan.org</ext-link>) is a normally distributed prior with a mean of zero and an SD of 2.5 (seen in orange in the figure; our initial preregistered prior). This large standard deviation easily permits positive and negative estimates putting minimal emphasis on zero. Contrast this to BayesFactor package’s (Morey R, Rouder J, 2023) default “wide” prior which is the Cauchy distribution (0, .7) illustrated in magenta (for more on the Cauchy see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://distribution-explorer.github.io/continuous/cauchy.html">https://distribution-explorer.github.io/continuous/cauchy.html</ext-link>).</p><p>These different defaults reflect differing Bayesian philosophical schools (‘estimate parameters’ vs ‘quantify evidence’ camps); if your goal is to accurately estimate a parameter it would be odd to have a strong null prior, yet (in our opinion) when estimating point-null BF’s a wide default prior gives far too much evidence in support of the null. In point-null BF testing the Savage-Dickey density ratio is the ratio between the height of the prior at 0 and the height of the posterior at zero (see Figure under section “testing against point null 0”). This means BFs can be very prior sensitive (seen in SI tables 5 &amp; 6). For this reason, we thought it made sense to do prior sensitivity testing, to ensure our conclusions in favor of the null were not caused solely by an overly wide prior (preregistered orange distribution) we decided to report the 3 narrower priors (blue ones).</p><p>Alternative Bayesian null hypotheses testing methods such as using Bayes Factors to test against a null region and ‘region of practical equivalence testing’ are less prior sensitive, yet both methods demand the researcher (e.g. ‘us’) to decide on a minimal effect size of practical interest. Once a minimal effect size of interest is determined any effect within this boundary is taken as evidence in support of the null hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is unclear why a different method was employed for the August / September data analysis compared to the full-time series.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a local-randomization RD framework, an entirely different empirical framework than continuity methods (resulting in a different estimate). For an overview see the primer by Cattaneo, Idrobo &amp; Titiunik 2023 (“A Practical Introduction to Regression Discontinuity Designs: Extensions”; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08958">https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08958</ext-link>).</p><p>A local randomization framework is optimal when the running variable is discrete (as in our case with DOB in months) (Cattaneo, Idrobo &amp; Titiunik 2023). It makes stronger assumptions on exchangeability therefore a very narrow window around the cutoff needs to be used. See Figure 2.1 and 2.2 (in the Cattaneo, Idrobo &amp; Titiunik 2023) for graphical illustrations of (1) a randomized experiment, (2) a continuity RD design, and (3) local-randomization RD. Using the full-time series in a local randomization analysis is not recommended as there is no control for differences between individuals as we move further away from the cutoff – making the estimated parameter highly endogenous.</p><p>We understand how it is confusing to have both a new framework and Bayesian methods (we could have chosen a fully frequentist approach) but using a different framework allows us to weigh up the aforementioned ‘bias vs variance tradeoff’ while Bayesian methods allow us to say something about the weight of evidence (for or against) our hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 1 - why not use model fits from those employed for hypothesis testing?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion (ties into #3), we have now redone Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The section on &quot;correlational effect&quot; might also benefit from additional analyses and clarifications. Indeed, the data come from the same randomized experiment for which minimum education requirements were adjusted. Was the only difference that the number of years of education was studied as opposed to the cohort? If so, would the results of this analysis be similar in another subsample of the UK Biobank for which there was no change in policy?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the methods section for the correlational/associational effect. This was the same subset of individuals for the local randomization analysis; all we did was change the independent variable from an exogenous dummy-coded ROSLA term (where half of the sample had the natural experiment) to a continuous (endogenous) educational attainment IV.</p><p>In principle, the results from the associational analysis should be exactly the same if we use other UK Biobank cohorts. To see if the association of education attainment with the global neuroimaging cohorts was similar across sub-cohorts of new individuals, we conducted post hoc Bayesian analysis on eight more subcohort of 10-month intervals, spaced 2 years apart from each other (Sup. Figure 7; each indicated by a different color). Four of these sub-cohorts predate ROSLA, while the other four are after ROSLA. Educational attainment is slowly increasing across the cohorts of individuals born from 1949 until 1965; intriguingly the effect of ROSLA is visually evident in the distributions of educational attainment (Sup. Figure 7). Also, as seen in the cohorts predating ROSLA more and more individuals were (already) choosing to stay in education past 15 years of age (see cohort 1949 vs 1955 in Sup. Figure 7).</p><p>Sup. Figure 8 illustrates boxplots of the educational attainment posterior of the eight sub-cohorts in addition to our original analysis (s1957) using a normal distributed prior with a mean of 0 and a sd of 1. Total surface area shows a remarkably replicable association with education attainment. Yet, it is evident the “extremely strong” association we found for CSF was a statistical fluke – as the posterior of other cohorts (bar our initial test) crosses zero. The conclusions for the other global neuroimaging covariates where we concluded ‘no associational effect’ seems to hold across cohorts.</p><p>We have now added methods, deviation from preregistration, and the following excerpt to the results:</p><p>“A post hoc replication of this associational analysis in eight additional 10-month cohorts spaced two years apart (Sup. Figure 7) indicates our preregistered report on the associational effect of educational attainment on CSF to be most likely a false-positive (Sup. Figure 8). Yet, the positive association between surface area and educational attainment is robust across the additional eight replication cohorts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors conduct a causal analysis of years of secondary education on brain structure in late life. They use a regression discontinuity analysis to measure the impact of a UK law change in 1972 that increased the years of mandatory education by 1 year. Using brain imaging data from the UK Biobank, they find essentially no evidence for 1 additional year of education altering brain structure in adulthood.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors pre-registered the study and the regression discontinuity was very carefully described and conducted.

We have now addressed these limitations with the following passage in the discussion:</p><p>“The UK Biobank is known to have ‘healthy volunteer bias’, as respondents tend to be healthier, more educated, and are more likely to own assets [71,72]. Various types of selection bias can occur in non-representative samples, impacting either internal (type 1) or external (type 2) validity. One benefit of a natural experimental design is that it protects against threats to internal validity from selection bias [43], design-based internal validity threats still exist, such as if volunteer bias differentially impacts individuals based on the cutoff for assignment. A more pressing limitation – in particular, for an education policy change – is our power to detect effects using a sample of higher-educated individuals. This is evident in our first stage analysis examining the percentage of 15-year-olds impacted by ROSLA, which we estimate to be 10% in neuro-UKB (Sup. Figure 2 &amp; Sup. Table 2), yet has been reported to be 25% in the UK general population [41]. Our results should be interpreted for this subpopulation (UK, 1973, from 15 to 16 years of age, compliers) as we estimate a ‘local’ average treatment effect [73]. Natural experimental designs such as ours offer the potential for high internal validity at the expense of external validity.”</p><p>We also highlighted it both in the results and methods.</p><p>We appreciate that one year of education may seem modest compared to the entire educational trajectory, but as an intervention, we disagree that one year of education is ‘a very modest manipulation’. It is arguably one of the largest positive manipulations in childhood development we can administer. If we were to translate a year of education into the language of a (cognitive) intervention, it is clear that the manipulation, at least in terms of hours, days, and weeks, is substantial. Prior work on structural plasticity (e.g., motor, spatial &amp; cognitive training) has involved substantially more limited manipulations in time, intensity, and extent. There is even (limited) evidence of localized persistent long-term structural changes (Wollett &amp; Maguire, 2011, Cur. Bio.).</p><p>We have now also highlighted the limited generalizability of our findings since we estimate a ‘local’ average treatment effect. It is possible higher education (college, university, vocational schools, etc.) could impact brain structure, yet we see no theoretical reason why it would while secondary wouldn’t. Moreover, higher education education is even trickier to research empirically due to heightened self and administrative selection pressures. While we cannot discount this possibility, the impacts of endogenous factors such as genetics and socioeconomic status are most likely heightened. That being said, higher education offers exciting possibilities to compare more domain-specific processes (e.g., by comparing a philosophy student to a mathematics student). Causality could be tested in European systems with point entry into <italic>field-specific</italic> programs – allowing comparison of students who just missed entry criteria into one topic and settled for another.</p><p>Regarding the amount of time following the manipulation, as we highlight in our discussion this is both a weakness and a strength. Viewed from a developmental neuroplasticity lens it would have been nice to have imaging immediately following the manipulation. Yet, from an aging perspective, our design has <italic>increased power</italic> to detect an effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors assert there is no strong causal evidence for EA on brain structure.

Although sample sizes for individual analyses are an order of magnitude smaller, most neuroimaging studies usually have to rely on much smaller samples.</p><p>(2) This study has been preregistered in advance, detailing the authors' scientific question, planned method of inquiry, and intended analyses, with only minor, justifiable changes in the final analysis.</p><p>(3) The analyses look at both global and local brain measures used as outcomes, thereby assessing a diverse range of brain phenotypes that could be implicated in a causal relationship with a person's level of education.</p><p>(4) The authors use multiple methodological approaches, including validation and sensitivity analyses, to investigate the robustness of their findings and, in the case of correlational analysis, highlight differences with related work by others.</p><p>(5) The extensive discussion of findings and how they relate to the existing, somewhat contradictory literature gives a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this area.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) This study investigates a well-posed but necessarily narrow question in a specific setting: 15-year-old British students born around 1957 who also participated in the UKB imaging study roughly 60 years later. Thus conclusions about the existence or absence of any general effect of the number of years of education on the brain's structure are limited to this specific scenario.</p><p>(2) The authors address potential concerns about the validity of modelling assumptions and the sensitivity of the regression discontinuity design approach. However, the possibility of selection and cohort bias remains and is not discussed clearly in the paper. Other studies (e.g. Davies et al 2018, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0279-y">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0279-y</ext-link>) have used the same policy intervention to study other health-related outcomes and have established ROSLA as a valid naturalistic experiment. Still, quoting Davies et al. (2018), &quot;This assumes that the participants who reported leaving school at 15 years of age are a representative sample of the sub-population who left at 15 years of age. If this assumption does not hold, for example, if the sampled participants who left school at 15 years of age were healthier than those in the population, then the estimates could underestimate the differences between the groups.&quot;. Recent studies (Tyrrell 2021, Pirastu 2021) have shown that UK Biobank participants are on average healthier than the general population. Moreover, the imaging sub-group has an even stronger &quot;healthy&quot; bias (Lyall 2022).</p><p>(3) The modelling approach used in this study requires that all covariates of no interest are equal before and after the cut-off, something that is impossible to test. Mentioned only briefly, the inclusion and exclusion of covariates in the model are not discussed in detail. Standard imaging confounds such as head motion and scanning site have been included but other factors (e.g. physical exercise, smoking, socioeconomic status, genetics, alcohol consumption, etc.) may also play a role.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their numerous positive comments and have now attempted to address the first two limitations (generalizability and UKB bias) with the following passage in the discussion:</p><p>“The UK Biobank is known to have ‘healthy volunteer bias’, as respondents tend to be healthier, more educated, and are more likely to own assets [71,72]. Various types of selection bias can occur in non-representative samples, impacting either internal (type 1) or external (type 2) validity. One benefit of a natural experimental design is that it protects against threats to internal validity from selection bias [43], design-based internal validity threats still exist, such as if volunteer bias differentially impacts individuals based on the cutoff for assignment. A more pressing limitation – in particular, for an education policy change – is our power to detect effects using a sample of higher-educated individuals. This is evident in our first stage analysis examining the percentage of 15-year-olds impacted by ROSLA, which we estimate to be 10% in neuro-UKB (Sup. Figure 2 &amp; Sup. Table 2), yet has been reported to be 25% in the UK general population [41]. Our results should be interpreted for this subpopulation (UK, 1973, from 15 to 16 years of age, compliers) as we estimate a ‘local’ average treatment effect [73]. Natural experimental designs such as ours offer the potential for high internal validity at the expense of external validity.”</p><p>We further highlight this in the results section:</p><p>“Compliance with ROSLA was very high (near 100%; Sup. Figure 2). However, given the cultural and historical trends leading to an increase in school attendance before ROSLA, most adolescents were continuing with education past 15 years of age before the policy change (Sup Plot. 7b). Prior work has estimated 25 percent of children would have left school a year earlier if not for ROSLA 41. Using the UK Biobank, we estimate this proportion to be around 10%, as the sample is healthier and of higher SES than the general population (Sup. Figure 2; Sup. Table 2) 46–48.”</p><p>Healthy volunteer bias can create two types of selection bias; crucially participation <italic>itself</italic> can serve as a collider threatening internal validity (outlined in van Alten et al., 2024; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/53/3/dyae054/7666749">https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/53/3/dyae054/7666749</ext-link>). Natural experimental designs are partially sheltered from this <italic>major</italic> limitation, as ‘volunteer bias’ would have to differentially impact individuals on one side of the cutoff and not the other – thereby breaking a primary design assumption of regression discontinuity. Substantial prior work (including this article) has not found any threats to the validity of the 1973 ROSLA (Clark &amp; Royer 2010, 2013; Barcellos et al., 2018, 2023; Davies et al., 2018, 2023). While the Davies 2028 article did IP-weight with the UK Biobank sample, Barcellos and colleagues 2023 (and 2018) do not, highlighting the following “Although the sample is not nationally representative, our estimates have internal validity because there is no differential selection on the two sides of the September 1, 1957 cutoff – see Appendix A.”.</p><p>The second (more acknowledged &amp; arguably less problematic) type of selection bias results in threats to external validity (aka generalizability). As highlighted in your first point; this is a large limitation with <italic>every</italic> natural experimental design, yet in our case, this is further amplified by the UK Biobank’s healthy volunteer bias. We have now attempted to highlight this limitation in the discussion passage above.</p><p>Point 3 – the inability to fully confirm design validity – is again, another inherent limitation of a natural experimental approach. That being said, extensive prior work has tested different predetermined covariates in the 1973 ROSLA (cited within), and to our knowledge, no issues have been found. The 1973 ROSLA seems to be one of the better natural experiments around (there was also a concerted effort to have an ‘effective’ additional year; see Clark &amp; Royer 2010). For these reasons, we stuck with only testing the variables we wanted to use to increase precision (also offering new neuroimaging covariates that didn’t exist in the literature base). One additional benefit of ROSLA was that the cutoff was decided years later on a variable that happened (date of birth) in the past – making it particularly hard for adolescents to alter their assignments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) FMRIB's preprocessing pipeline is mentioned. Does this include deconfounding of brain measures? Particularly, were measures deconfounded for age before the main analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is such a crucial point that we triple-checked, brain imaging phenotypes were not corrected for age (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf">https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf</ext-link>) – large effects of age can be seen in the global metrics; older individuals have less surface area, thinner cortices, less brain volume (corrected for head size), more CSF volume (corrected for head size), more white matter hyperintensities, and worse FA values. Figure 1 shows these large age effects, which are controlled for in our continuity-based RD analysis.</p><p>One’s date of birth (DOB) of course does not match perfectly to their age, this is why we included the covariate ‘visit date’; this interplay can now be seen in our updated SI Figure 1 (recommended in #3) which shows the distributions of visit date, DOB, and age of scan.</p><p>In a valid RD design covariates <italic>should</italic> not be necessary (as they should be balanced on either side of the cutoff), yet the inclusion of covariates does increase precision to detect effects. We tested this assumption, finding the effect of ‘visit date’ and its quadratic term to be not related to ROSLA (Sup. Table 1). This adds further evidence (specific to the UK Biobank sample) to the existing body of work showing the 1973 ROSLA policy change to not violate any design assumptions. Threats to internal validity would more than likely increase endogeneity and result in ‘false causal positive causal effects’ (which is not what we find).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Despite the large overall sample size, I am wondering whether the effective number of samples is sufficient to detect a potentially subtle effect that is further attenuated by the long time interval before scanning. As stated, for the optimised bandwidth window (DoB 20 to 35 months around cut-off), N is about 5000. Does this mean that effectively about 250 (10%) out of about 2500 participants born after the cut-off were leaving school at 16 rather than 15 because of ROSLA? For the local randomisation analysis, this becomes about N=10 (10% out of 100). Could a power analysis show that these cohort sizes are large enough to detect a reasonably large effect?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point, one which we were grappling with while the paper was out for review. We now draw attention to this in the results and highlight this as a limitation in the discussion. While UKB’s non-representativeness limits our power (10% affected rather than 25% in the general population), it is still a very large sample. Our sample size is more in line with standard neuroimaging studies than with large cohort studies.</p><p>The novelty of our study is its causal design, while we could very precisely measure an effect of some phenotype (variable X) in 40,000 individuals. This effect is probably not what we think we are measuring. Without IP-weighting it could even have a different sign. But more importantly, it is not variable X – it is the thousands of things (unmeasured confounders) that lead an individual to have more or less of variable X. The larger the sample the easier it is for small unmeasured confounders to reach significance (Big data paradox) – this in no way invalidates large samples, it is just our thinking and how we handle large samples will hopefully change to a more casual lens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Supplementary Figure 1: A similar raincloud plot of date of birth would be instructive to visualise the distribution of subjects born before and after the 1957 cut-off.</p></disp-quote><p>Great idea! We have done this in Sup Fig. 1 for both visit date and DOB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) p.9: Not sure about &quot;extreme evidence&quot;, very strong would probably be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>As preregistered, we interpreted Bayes Factors using Jeffrey’s criteria. ‘Extreme evidence’ is only used once and it is about finding an associational effect of educational attainment on CSF (BF10 &gt; 100). Upon Reviewer 1’s recommendation 7, we conducted eight replication samples (Sup. Figure 7 &amp; 8) and have now added the following passage to the results:</p><p>“A post hoc replication of this associational analysis in eight additional 10-month cohorts spaced two years apart (Sup. Figure 7) indicates our preregistered report on the associational effect of educational attainment on CSF to be most likely a false-positive (Sup. Figure 8). Yet, the positive association between surface area and educational attainment is robust across the additional eight replication cohorts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The code would benefit from a bit of clean-up and additional documentation. In its current state, it is not easy to use, e.g. in a replication study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now further added documentation to our code; including a readme describing what each script does. The analysis pipeline used is not ideal for replications as the package used for continuity-based RD (RDHonest) initially could not handle covariates – therefore we manually corrected our variables after a discussion with Prof Kolesár (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kolesarm/RDHonest/issues/7">https://github.com/kolesarm/RDHonest/issues/7</ext-link>).</p><p>Prof Kolesár added this functionality recently and future work should use the latest version of the package as it can correct for covariates.
