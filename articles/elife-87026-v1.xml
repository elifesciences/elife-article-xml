To understand how the major human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> manages this we have utilised a functional genomics approach to identify a number of new loci that affect the ability of the bacteria to survive exposure to serum, the critical first step in the development of bacteraemia. The expression of one of these genes, <italic>tcaA,</italic> was found to be induced upon exposure to serum, and we show that it is involved in the elaboration of a critical virulence factor, the wall teichoic acids (WTA), within the cell envelope. The activity of the TcaA protein alters the sensitivity of the bacteria to cell wall attacking agents, including antimicrobial peptides, human defence fatty acids, and several antibiotics. This protein also affects the autolytic activity and lysostaphin sensitivity of the bacteria, suggesting that in addition to changing WTA abundance in the cell envelope, it also plays a role in peptidoglycan crosslinking. With TcaA rendering the bacteria more susceptible to serum killing, while simultaneously increasing the abundance of WTA in the cell envelope, it was unclear what effect this protein may have during infection. To explore this, we examined human data and performed murine experimental infections. Collectively, our data suggests that whilst mutations in <italic>tcaA</italic> are selected for during bacteraemia, this protein positively contributes to the virulence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> through its involvement in altering the cell wall architecture of the bacteria, a process that appears to play a key role in the development of bacteraemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteraemia</kwd><kwd>TcaA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000883</institution-id><institution>University of Bristol</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Douglas</surname><given-names>Edward JA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SWBio DTP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palk</surname><given-names>Nathanael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018948</institution-id><institution>Saudi Arabian Cultural Bureau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Altwiley</surname><given-names>Dina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>212258/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massey</surname><given-names>Ruth C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202846/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLoughlin</surname><given-names>Rachel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA AI000904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otto</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SBF006\1023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laabei</surname><given-names>Maisem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The most common interaction with its human host is as an asymptomatic coloniser; however, it frequently transitions to a pathogenic state with the ability to cause a wide range of diseases, ranging from relatively minor skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) to more life-threatening incidents of endocarditis or bacteraemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon and Lowy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lowy, 1998</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> is notorious for producing a plethora of virulence factors ranging from pore-forming toxins to various immune evasion strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Powers and Bubeck Wardenburg, 2014</xref>). The toxicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> is generally accepted as playing an important role during infection, with high toxicity isolates typically causing more severe symptoms and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelnour et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheung et al., 1994</xref>). However, for the more invasive diseases such as bacteraemia and pneumonia, it has been shown that the causative isolates are often impaired in their toxin production and instead rely on alternative virulence approaches to cause disease, such as being able to better survive exposure to host immune defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laabei et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As the most severe type of infection caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, bacteraemia has a mortality rate of between 20% and 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaasch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2022</xref>), and despite infection control measures that have reduced the incidence of MRSA bacteraemia, the incidence of MSSA bacteraemia continues to increase in several countries, suggesting we have much to learn about this disease process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">OGL Cookies on GOV.UK, 2023</xref>). Entry into the bloodstream is the first step in the development of bacteraemia and represents a major bottleneck for the bacteria, whether they seed from an infection elsewhere in the body, or take a more direct route through an intravenous device. As a heavily protected niche, the bloodstream contains numerous humoral immune features with potent anti-staphylococcal activity, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and host defence fatty acids (HDFAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenny et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beavers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das, 2018</xref>). However, the fact that cases of <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteraemia occur demonstrates that these do not represent an impregnable force and that the bacteria can adapt to resist these defensive features.</p><p>In previous work we have pioneered the application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to characterise bacterial virulence, where it has proven to be a powerful approach to define complex regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laabei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laabei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Recker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yokoyama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevens et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altwiley et al., 2021</xref>). In related work we have also begun to characterise a new category of <italic>S. aureus</italic> genes we refer to as MALs (mortality associated loci) and found that many of these are involved in serum survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douglas et al., 2021</xref>), with serum containing the bulk of the humoral immune response present in blood, but without the added complexity of the cellular components. Given the outstanding research questions surrounding the development of bacteraemia, we performed a GWAS on a collection of 300 clinical isolates with respect to serum resistance. We found significant variability in how well individual isolates survive exposure to serum and identified seven novel effectors of this activity. Of particular note was the TcaA protein, which we have further characterised and demonstrate that it is a critical protein for the bacteria involved in the remodelling of the bacterial cell wall during the development of bacteraemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Survival of <italic>S. aureus</italic> upon exposure to human serum is a variable trait</title><p>The human bloodstream is a highly protected niche, and so to establish an infection in this environment the bacteria must evade many aspects of host immunity, such as the bacterial membrane damaging AMPs and HDFAs found in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenny et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beavers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peschel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ernst and Peschel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joo and Otto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>). To examine the level of variability that exists in serum susceptibility in natural populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we exposed 300 clinical isolates to pooled human serum and quantified the proportion of each culture that survived. These 300 isolates represent the two major clones, as defined by multi-locus sequence typing: clonal complex 22 (CC22) and clonal complex 30 (CC30), that are responsible for the majority of MRSA cases in the UK and Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Recker et al., 2017</xref>).

This collection is a unique resource as each strain has been sequenced, extensively phenotyped, and we have clinical metadata for many of the patients the bacteria were isolated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Recker et al., 2017</xref>. We found there to be similar levels of variability in the ability of the bacteria to survive exposure to human serum across the two CCs, both with a &gt;10<sup>3</sup>-fold difference between the most and least susceptible isolate with respect to the number of bacteria that survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Serum susceptibility is multifactorial and varies widely across closely related <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> isolates.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) The susceptibility of 300 bacteraemia isolates from clonal complexes clonal complex 22 (CC22) and CC30 were exposed to human serum and their ability to survive this exposure quantified.

the 44 loci associated with serum survival, there were transposon mutants available for 32 in the Nebraska library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fey et al., 2013</xref>). To functionally verify our GWAS findings, each of these mutants was tested for their ability to survive exposure to human serum. We found that seven mutants were significantly affected in this ability, and this effect was complemented by expressing the inactivated gene in trans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The pRMC2 plasmid used to complement the mutated phenotypes requires the use of two antibiotics, one for selection of the plasmid and one for induction of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corrigan and Foster, 2009</xref>). These antibiotics can often affect bacterial gene expression. As such validation of complementation is based on the comparison between the empty and target gene containing plasmid which can be grown under the same conditions. The seven genes were <italic>tcaA</italic>, a gene associated with resistance to the antibiotic teicoplanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenberger et al., 2000</xref>); <italic>tarK</italic>, a gene involved in wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia et al., 2010</xref>); <italic>gntR</italic>, which encodes gluconate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujita and Fujita, 1987</xref>); <italic>ilvC</italic>, which encodes ketol-acid reductoisomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2017</xref>); <italic>arsB</italic>, which is an efflux pump involved in arsenic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen et al., 2013</xref>); <italic>yfhO</italic>, which is involved in the glycosylation of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rismondo et al., 2018</xref>); and <italic>pdhD</italic>, which encodes a lipoamide dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hemilä, 1991</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional verification of loci involved in serum sensitivity of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</title><p>The effect of the inactivation of the genes associated serum sensitivity was examined using transposon mutants of strain JE2.

The majority of the isolates with the SNPs were less sensitive to serum, suggesting the SNPs negatively affect the activity of the protein.

Using AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) we generated a structure for TcaA where it is predicted to be membrane bound with a single membrane spanning domain; to have a zinc finger presented intracellularly; with the majority of the protein including the Phe290 displayed extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Given that phenylalanines are frequently involved in protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Nussinov, 2007</xref>) we examined the effect this change has on the activity of TcaA by cloning the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene with this SNP into the complementing pRMC2 plasmid and comparing its ability to confer serum resistance relative to that of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene without the SNP. The TcaA protein with Ser at position 290 instead of Phe were slightly more resistant to serum killing, but not as affected as when the entire protein was inactivated, suggesting this change has a subtle effect on the serum sensitising activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>The clinical</italic> tcaA <italic>mutations are associated with increased serum resistance</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The individual clinical isolates with polymorphism in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene are indicated (in red) on a graph displaying the range of serum survival of the collection.

To determine which aspects of human serum TcaA were conferring increased sensitivity to, we measured the relative ability of the wild type and mutant to survive exposure to some of the antibacterial factors found in serum: to the HDFA arachidonic acid, and to two AMPs: HNP-1 and LL37. The strains producing TcaA (i.e., the wild type and complemented strain) were more sensitive to all three components of human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref>). For the AMPs this sensitivity was significant after only 90 min exposure, whereas for arachidonic acid sensitivity the bacteria were incubated overnight, and differences in sensitivity determined by bacterial growth (OD<sub>600</sub>).

WTA are hydrophilic and when present in the cell wall they are believed to be protective by interfering with the penetration of the hydrophobic HDFAs through to the bacterial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>). It has also been shown that when the ligation of WTA to the cell wall is affected, such that they are instead released into the environment, this also decreases the sensitivity of the bacteria to HDFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beavers et al., 2019</xref>). With distinct modes of action and means of accessing their target, it is intriguing to consider how TcaA may be contributing to increasing the sensitivity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to both these types of antibacterial molecules. To examine whether the TcaA-associated increase in sensitivity to arachidonic acid is a result of an increase in the abundance of WTA in the bacterial cell, we extracted and quantified WTA from the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, where we found that the cell wall of the wild type had significantly more WTA when compared to the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a, b, and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We next quantified WTA in the bacterial supernatant, as recent work on a <italic>S. aureus lcpA</italic> mutant demonstrated that another WTA-related means of altering sensitivity to arachidonic acid is to release the WTA to the bacteria surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beavers et al., 2019</xref>). We found significantly less WTA in the extract of the TcaA producing wild type strain compared to that of the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>), which could explain the observed difference in sensitivity to HDFAs. It was unclear from the previous work on LcpA how the released WTA by the <italic>lcpA</italic> mutant affects arachidonic acid sensitivity, and here we demonstrate that this mutant, like the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, is also less sensitive to human serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). One hypothesis is that the WTA can either sequester or inactivate HDFAs in the environment surrounding the bacteria, thereby neutralising them. To test this, we harvested the supernatant of the wild type JE2, the JE2 <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, and the JE2 <italic>lcpA</italic> mutant from overnight growth. These supernatants were used to supplement fresh broth (at 10%) into which the wild type JE2 strain was inoculated. In the absence of any arachidonic acid JE2 grew equally well regardless of the supernatant supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). However, in the presence of the supernatant of both the <italic>tcaA</italic> and <italic>lcpA</italic> mutant (both of which contain an abundance of released WTA), JE2 was able to grow in the presence of arachidonic acid; whereas when the JE2 supernatant was used as the supplement the bacteria were unable to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). To further verify that soluble WTA can neutralise arachidonic we performed WTA extractions from an isogenic wild type and mutant of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain LAC where the mutant has had the <italic>tarO</italic> gene deleted and consequently does not produce any WTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). The incorporation of the wild type LAC purified WTA extract to broth at 2% created an environment in which JE2 could grow in the presence of arachidonic acid, whereas the equivalent WTA extract of the <italic>tarO</italic> mutant, which contains no WTA, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Together these data demonstrate that WTA in the environment can neutralise arachidonic acid, and this provides a likely explanation for the increased sensitivity to HDFAs associated with TcaA production.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Wall teichoic acids (WTA) are released from the cell wall in the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant to affect resistance to host defence fatty acids (HDFAs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) WTA was extracted from both cells and supernatant of the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and visualised on and SDS-PAGE gel stained with 1 mg/ml Alcian blue.

To examine this, we incubated the bacteria with cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, which is positively charged and through its electrostatic-related ability binds to the bacterial cells, providing a measure of the charge across bacterial cell walls. Using this we found that the wild type strain bound significantly more cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and is therefore more negatively charged than the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, which explains the increase in AMP sensitivity we have found associated with TcaA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Together these results explain how TcaA production affects the sensitivity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to both HDFAs and AMPs. By retaining WTA within the cell wall, there is less released to sequester or inactivate the fatty acids from the environment, and due to their negative charge, increased amounts of WTA in the cell wall affects the charge across the cell wall and results in increased electrostatic attraction of the positively charged AMPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Serum-induced tcaA expression increases both the abundance of WTA in the cell wall and the sensitivity <italic>S. aureus</italic> to teicoplanin</title><p>As mentioned previously, an additional interesting feature of the TcaA protein is that it has also been associated with changing the sensitivity of the bacteria to the antibiotic teicoplanin, although this has been reported to vary between strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenberger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maki et al., 2004</xref>). To examine this for our strains we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for three independent sets of isogenic wild type and tcaA mutants (i.e., in strains JE2, Newman, and SH1000, all corresponding to CC8), where TcaA production resulted in increased sensitivity to this antibiotic across all three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To examine whether the clinical isolates with the SNPs in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene associated with increased serum resistance also had altered teicoplanin sensitivity, we compared the ability of 12 clinical isolates containing the GWAS identified <italic>tcaA</italic> SNPs to grow in teicoplanin to that of 12 isolates from the same collection with the wild type gene sequence, that is, without the polymorphism. The isolates with the polymorphism in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene were on average less sensitive to teicoplanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Using the pRMC2 complementing plasmid expressing either the wild type or SNP (conferring the Phe290-Ser substitution) containing <italic>tcaA</italic> gene, we demonstrated that this mutation significantly reduces the ability of the protein to sensitise the bacteria to teicoplanin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), confirming that this mutation negatively affects the activity of the TcaA protein. As TcaA has been shown to be upregulated when exposed to teicoplanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenberger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maki et al., 2004</xref>), we examined whether serum would also induce its expression. The wild type JE2 strain was exposed to either subinhibitory (2.5% serum and 0.5 μg/ml teicoplanin) or inhibitory (10% serum and 10 μg/ml teicoplanin) concentrations of either serum or teicoplanin for 20 min, total RNA was extracted and the transcription of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene quantified by qRT-PCR. For both serum and teicoplanin, induction of expression of the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene was concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Given the association of WTA abundance in the cell wall with <italic>tcaA</italic> expression described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>) we next examined whether serum-induced expression of <italic>tcaA</italic> would also result in an increase in abundance of WTA in the bacterial cell wall. Both the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant were exposed to inhibitory concentrations of human serum for 90 min and the WTA extracted from the cell walls, where serum exposure resulted in an increase in WTA for the wild type strain but not the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). To examine whether serum-induced increased expression of <italic>tcaA</italic> would affect sensitivity to teicoplanin, we exposed the wild type bacteria to a subinhibitory concentrations of serum (2.5%) and then incubated these overnight in a subinhibitory concentration of teicoplanin (0.5 μg/ml). Pre-exposure to serum-induced increased sensitivity to teicoplanin suggesting that induction of <italic>tcaA</italic> expression by the initial serum exposure was sufficient to induce cross-sensitivity to the antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). To put this sensitisation effect in the context of serum, the reverse experiment was also performed whereby the wild type strain was exposed to a subinhibitory concentration of teicoplanin (0.5 μg/ml) overnight and a serum killing assay performed following this incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Pre-exposure to teicoplanin also induced increased sensitivity to serum again highlighting this cross-sensitivity effect. To verify this induction effect was not specific to the JE2 lineage, a <italic>tcaA::gfp</italic> reporter plasmid was constructed and electroporated into JE2, SH1000, Newman, and a clinical CC22 isolate EMRSA15.

In support of this, it has been reported that a <italic>tarO</italic> mutant, devoid of WTA, confers sensitisation to β-lactam antibiotics due to mislocalisation of the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). As the target for teicoplanin is peptidoglycan, more specifically the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala residue of lipid II, we hypothesised that the increased ligation of WTA into the cell wall of the TcaA producing strain may affect peptidoglycan biosynthesis and assembly, and that this may be responsible for the change in sensitivity to teicoplanin. To test this further, we compared the sensitivity of the wild type and mutant to a range of peptidoglycan attacking antibiotics, where we found the TcaA producing wild type strain to be more sensitive to vancomycin (as shown previously; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maki et al., 2004</xref>), oritavancin, but not dalbavancin (all alternative members of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics), and ramoplanin, a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, TcaA production conferred decreased sensitivity to oxacillin, a β-lactam antibiotic that targets penicillin binding protein 2 and moenomycin a phosphoglycolipid antibiotic that inhibits the transglycosylase PBP enzymes and prevents the formation of peptidoglycan polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that TcaA production affects the overall composition and structure of peptidoglycan in the wild type strain. To examine whether the crosslinking of peptidoglycan is affected by TcaA production, we tested the susceptibility of the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant to lysostaphin, which is a glycylglycine endopeptidase capable of cleaving the pentaglycine crosslinks of peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kurokawa et al., 2013</xref>). We found that lysostaphin cleaved the cell wall of the wild type strain more slowly than for the <italic>tca</italic>A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We next performed a Triton X-100-induced autolysis assay where the wild type exhibited a slower rate of autolysis compared to the mutant, suggesting that the cell wall is more robust due to higher levels of crosslinking when TcaA is produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Together these data suggest that the integrity of the peptidoglycan, in particular its crosslinking, is increased when TcaA is produced. This provides a likely explanation for why the mutant is more resistant to teicoplanin, reduced crosslinking in the cell wall increases the number of off target D-ala D-ala which teicoplanin will bind to instead of reaching lipid II in the membrane and causing disruption to this. With changes to the quantity and composition of WTA and peptidoglycan associated with TcaA production, we sought to visualise the cell wall using transmission electron microscopy. We observed a clear difference in the density and structure of the outer layer of the bacterial cell wall between the wild type and <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant, confirming a role for TcaA in the structural integrity of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>TcaA alters the structure of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cell wall.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The rate of lysis in the presence of lysostaphin was assayed, where the strain producing TcaA was lysed at a slower rate than the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant.

From a pathogenicity perspective these activities would appear to be in conflict, with one making it less likely for a bacterium to cause bacteraemia (increased serum sensitivity) and the other making it more likely for a bacterium to cause bacteraemia (increased WTA in the cell envelope; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wanner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weidenmaier et al., 2005</xref>). To understand this apparent dichotomy we first examined whether TcaA production only affected survival in serum, whereas in whole blood where other components of the human immune system may be present (e.g., complement, antibodies, and phagocytes) this effect may be lost. Using human blood from three donors, we demonstrated that TcaA production increases the sensitivity of the bacteria to whole blood killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). We next interrogated our human clinical data, where in addition to the 300 bacteraemia strains that form the basis of this study we have an additional 176 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> isolates, which has allowed us to include more genetic diversity to this analysis (i.e., from CC22 [n=138], CC30 [n=162], ST8 [n=132], and ST93 [n=44]). The source of these isolates was also available to us (i.e., bacteraemia [n=341], SSTI [n=80], or carriage [n=55]), as well as their genome sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We examined the distribution of nonsynonymous mutations in the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene across these, where it was present in 6% of the bacteraemia isolates compared with only 1.5% of non-bacteraemia isolates (n=21/341 and 2/135 respectively; p=0.03, in a Fisher’s exact test). However, when we examined the 30-day mortality rates for the 113 bacteraemia patients for whom we had this clinical data, the mortality rate of the proportion of patients infected with a <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain with the wild type <italic>tcaA</italic> gene was significantly higher compared to those infected with a mutated <italic>tcaA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and c</xref>) (two-tailed chi-squared test: p=0.03). So, although the incidence of mutations in <italic>tcaA</italic> appears to be relatively rare, that isolates with variant <italic>tcaA</italic> genes are enriched amongst those causing bacteraemia suggests that a functional TcaA may limit the propensity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cause a bloodstream infection, such that it acts as a selective force for mutants of this gene. However, once the bacteraemia has become established, TcaA positively contributes to the infection process, likely due to the increased abundance of WTA in the cell envelope, and the greater structural integrity of the cell wall. To experimentally test these human findings we utilised a mouse model of bacteraemia where the tail vein of C57/Bl6 mice are inoculated with 2×10<sup>7</sup> colony forming units (CFUs) of bacteria to establish a bloodstream infection, where they seed from there into organs such as the liver spleen and kidneys. We performed mixed infections, where the wild type and mutant bacteria had to compete during the development of the infection within the mouse. The mice were infected with equal quantities of both bacteria and the change in ratio of the bacteria in the mouse blood, liver, spleen, and kidney recorded after 48 hr, which allowed the relative virulence ratio (RVR) of each bacterium to be calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monk et al., 2008</xref>). The RVR of the TcaA producing wild type strain was significantly higher than that of the mutant at a systemic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). As such, while the TcaA-associated self-sensitisation of the bacteria was not evident here, possibly due to the size of the inoculum level needed, once an infection has become established, TcaA contributes positively to disease severity as demonstrated by the wild type strain outcompeting the <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>TcaA contributes to increased disease severity in mice and humans.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whole human blood survival.

To address this, we have applied a population-based approach to analyse the pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and identified seven genes that affect the bacteria’s ability to survive exposure to human serum, the first step in the development of bacteraemia. The dissection of the molecular detail of how these genes affect serum survival is underway to determine their potential for therapeutic intervention. However, our focus here has been on the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene where we show that its expression is induced upon exposure to serum, that it is involved in the ligation or retention of WTA in the cell wall, and that this renders the bacteria more susceptible to killing by both AMPs and HDFAs. We have also found that TcaA is associated with changes to the crosslinking of peptidoglycan, such that the bacteria are more susceptible to some antibiotics (e.g., teicoplanin) and less susceptible to others (e.g., oxacillin). It is interesting to note that our GWAS approach identified <italic>tcaA</italic> due to the presence of function altering SNPs amongst clinical isolates. Our human data suggests that bacteraemia and/or the antibiotics commonly used to treat it such as teicoplanin and vancomycin may impose a selective pressure on the bacteria to mutate this gene, due to the decreased sensitivity this confers to serum killing and to clinically relevant antibiotics. However, both our human and mouse data have confirmed that once bacteraemia has become established, TcaA contributes positively to disease progression, likely due to its cell wall remodelling activity. A graphical summary of this has been provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Graphical summary of our hypothesis for TcaA activity.</title><p>Upon exposure to serum the expression of <italic>tcaA</italic> is induced in the wild type strain, resulting in an increased abundance of wall teichoic acid (WTA) in the cell wall and less in the extracellular milieu. This decreases the negative charge of the bacterial surface, rendering the bacteria more susceptible to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In addition, there is less WTA released into the extracellular milieu to sequester host defence fatty acids (HDFAs), rendering the bacteria more susceptible to killing by these molecules. This self-sensitising activity of TcaA limits the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to establish a bloodstream infection. However, once established a strain with wild-type TcaA can cause more severe disease. In <italic>tcaA</italic> mutants, there is lower abundance of WTA in the cell wall and a higher abundance in the extracellular milieu. This increases bacterial resistance to AMPs as it increases the charge of the bacterial surface, resulting in less electrostatic attraction. The release of WTA into the extracellular milieu also sequesters HDFAs, preventing them from reaching the bacterial surface. As a result, a <italic>tcaA</italic> mutant is more likely to establish a bloodstream infection. However, this infection is less likely to cause severe disease due to the importance of TcaA in remodelling the cell wall for the full virulence of <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

This locus is also reported to be part of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell wall stimulon, following a number of studies that monitored the response of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to cell wall attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steidl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Utaida et al., 2003</xref>). It is interesting to note that the <italic>tcaA</italic> gene was not associated with serum resistance for the CC30 collection of isolates, however, there were very few isolates with variation in this gene amongst that collection such that they would have fallen below the minimum allele threshold. While work to understand the activity of each of the proteins encoded by the <italic>tca</italic> locus is underway, our data suggests that TcaA play a role in the ligation or retention of WTA within the cell wall, perhaps alongside the LcpA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beavers et al., 2019</xref>). How this is achieved is yet to be determined. TcaA may play a direct role in ligating WTA to the cell wall; it may play a role in cell wall turnover and the subsequent release of WTA and other cell wall macromolecules into the external environment; or it may interact and subsequently interfere with other cell wall biosynthetic processes that are responsible for WTA ligation. It is interesting to note that <italic>tarK</italic>, which is one of the other six genes associated here with serum survival, is also involved in the biosynthesis of WTA. Additionally, <italic>yfhO</italic> which encodes an enzyme that glycosylates LTA is also involved in serum resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rismondo et al., 2018</xref>), providing further evidence for the importance of teichoic acid-associated molecules to this aspect of the biology and pathogenicity of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. For TcaR, we hypothesise that it likely controls the transcription of the co-transcribed <italic>tcaA</italic> and <italic>tcaB</italic> genes, and may directly respond to the external stimulus of teicoplanin and serum as reported here. What is less clear is what role TcaB plays, as efflux pumps are more typically associated with increasing the resistance of a bacterium to an antibiotic, or other toxic molecules.</p><p>In addition to <italic>tcaA</italic> this study has identified one other locus (<italic>yfhO</italic>) that negatively affects serum survival, and added a further five loci (<italic>tarK, gntR, ilvC, arsB</italic>, and <italic>pdhD</italic>) to the list of genes that contribute positively to serum survival by protecting the bacteria from HDFAs and AMPs. This leads us to the questions of why <italic>S. aureus</italic> has loci in apparent conflict with regard to the survival of the bacteria during bacteraemia. It is perhaps through the consideration of the other ways in which <italic>S. aureus</italic> interact with humans that we may understand this. The vast majority of interactions that occur between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and humans is as a commensal in the human nose from which it can readily transmit. The five identified protective genes may therefore also protect the bacteria during colonisation, which would confer a selective advantage, and it is just an unfortunate coincidence that they also confer increased survival in serum during the development of bacteraemia. While the focus of this work has been on the role of TcaA in serum, it is also worth considering what role it may have during colonisation of the nose, which involves the adherence of the bacteria to the nasal epithelium, to which WTA has a well-established role. It is therefore possible that TcaA enhances the ability of <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells to colonise the nose by retaining WTA within the cell wall. However, the role of TcaA in responsiveness to cell wall attack is as yet unclear, but perhaps it contributes to the competitiveness of <italic>S. aureus</italic> within the nasal microbiome in response to cell wall damage inflicted by competitors.</p><p>The evolution of the virulence of a pathogen is heavily dependent upon their mode of transmission, which for opportunistic pathogens raises interesting challenges. If within-host invasiveness limits between-host fitness by preventing them from transmitting to a new host, there are likely selective pressures acting on bacterial populations to evolve means of limiting their ability to cause invasive disease. However, if increased invasiveness facilitates enhanced within-host fitness, as the bacteria multiply and spread throughout the body, the ‘short-sighted evolution of virulence’ hypothesis proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levin and Bull, 1994</xref>, could apply and may explain situations like <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteraemia. We propose that TcaA may represent a system at the cusp of both these scenarios, in that it responds to cell wall attack by serum by making itself more susceptible to killing by serum, thereby potentially limiting its ability to cause bacteraemia, which could have long-term between-host benefits. However, once established in the bloodstream and TcaA has remodelled the cell wall, the short-sighted view of virulence hypothesis applies where the bacteria survive and thrive, allowing them to cause a successful bacteraemia.</p><p>Entry into the bloodstream to establish an infection has long been considered a significant bottleneck for the bacteria, but until now, the stringency of this bottleneck was believed to be a result of the onslaught of all the immune mechanisms present in blood. Here, we suggest that <italic>S. aureus</italic> may contribute to this bottleneck by responding to serum-induced cell wall damage by further sensitising itself to this attack as part of the pathway towards increasing their pathogenic capabilities by remodelling the cell wall. Our findings presented here opens up an entirely novel aspect to the biology of a major human pathogen and brings into question the appropriateness of the term ‘opportunistic’ when we refer to such highly effective bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>A list of the genetically amenable bacterial strains and mutants can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, and the clinical strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Using an innovative GWAS-like approach applied to a bank of over 300 well-characterized clinical <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates, the authors discover SNPs in seven different staphylococcal genes that confer increased survival in the setting of serum exposure. The authors then mainly focus on one gene, tcaA, and illustrate a potential mechanism whereby modification of peptidoglycan structure and WTA display leads to altered susceptibility to serum, serum-derived antimicrobial compounds, and antibiotics. One particularly significant finding is that the identified tcaA SNP is significantly associated with patient mortality, in that patients infected with the SNP bearing isolate are less likely to die from infection. It is therefore hypothesized that this SNP represents an adaptive mutation that promotes serum survival while decreasing virulence and host mortality. In a murine model of infection, the strain bearing the WT allele of tcaA is significantly more virulent than the tcaA mutant, suggesting that the role of tcaA in bacteremia is infection-phase dependent.</p><p>This manuscript has many strengths. The triangulation of genomic analysis, patient outcomes data, and in vitro and in vivo mechanistic testing adds to the significance of the findings in terms of human disease. Testing the impact of mutating tcaA in multiple staphylococcal lineages and backgrounds also increases the rigor of the study. The identification of bacterial loci that impact susceptibility to both host antimicrobial compounds and commonly used antibiotics is also a strength of this work, given the evolutionary and treatment implications for such genes.</p><p>One moderate weakness is that the impact of the identified SNP in tcaA is only tested in some of the assays, whereas the majority of the testing is performed with a whole gene knockout. In some cases this results in more speculative conclusions that will require further testing to validate. All in all, this is an exciting manuscript that will be of interest to the broader research communities focused on staphylococcal pathogenesis, bacterial evolution, and host-pathogen interactions, as well as to clinicians who care for patients with invasive staphylococcal infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87026.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors embarked on a study to identify SNPs in clinical isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> that influence sensitivity to serum killing. Through a phenotypic screen of 300 previously sequenced <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteremia (SAB) isolates, they identified ~40 SNPs causing altered serum survival. The remainder of the study focuses of tcaA, a gene with unknown function. They show that when tcaA is disrupted, it results in increased resistance to glycopeptides and antimicrobial components of human serum.</p><p>They perform an elegant series of experiments demonstrating how a tcaA knockout is more resistant to killing by whole serum. arachadonic acid, LL-37 and HNP-1. They provide compelling evidence that in the absence of tcaA resistance to arachidonic acid is mediated through release of wall teichoic acids from the cell wall, which acts as a decoy and sequesters the fatty acid.</p><p>Similarly, they suggest that resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides is through alteration of the net charge of the cell wall due to loss of negatively charged WTAs based on reduced cytochrome C binding.</p><p>They continue to show that tcaA is induced in the presence of human serum, which causes increased resistance to the glycopeptide teichplanin.</p><p>They propose that tcaA disruption causes altered cell wall structure based on morphologic changes on TEM and increased sensitivity to lysostaphin and increased autolysis via triton x-100 assay.</p><p>Finally, they propose that tcaA influences mortality in SAB based on raw differences in 30-day morality. Interestingly they do decreased fitness during murine bacteremia model compared to wild-type.</p><p>The strengths of this manuscript are that it is well written and the identification of SNPs leading to altered serum killing is convincing and valuable data. The mechanism for tcaA-mediated resistance to arachadonic acid and AMPs is compelling and novel. The murine infection data demonstrating that tcaA mutants exhibit reduced virulence is important data.</p><p>The weakness of this manuscript mainly concerns the proposed mechanism that tcaA mutants show reduced peptidoglycan crosslinking. This conclusion is based on qualitative TEM images and increased sensitivity to lysostaphyin/autolysis. While these data are suggestive. it is difficult to draw such a conclusion without analysis of the cell wall by LC-MS.</p><p>Overall, I think this is a good submission and the majority of their conclusions are supported by the data. The mechanism behind the clinically relevant tcaA mutation is important, given its known role in glycopeptide resistance and therefore likely clinical outcomes. This manuscript would benefit from the inclusion of some additional experiments to help support their finding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87026.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript by Douglas et al., the authors used a functional genomics approach to understand how <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> survives in the bloodstream to cause bacteraemia. They identified seven novel genes that affect serum survival. The study focused on tcaA, a gene associated with resistance to the antibiotic teicoplanin and is activated when exposed to serum and plays a role in producing a critical virulence factor called wall teichoic acids (WTA) in the cell envelope. This protein affects the bacteria's sensitivity to cell wall attacking agents, human defense fatty acids, and antibiotics, as well as autolytic activity and lysostaphin sensitivity. The data in this study suggested that TcaA play a role in the ligation or retention of WTA within the cell wall. However, more work is needed to clarify that part. Interestingly, despite making the bacteria more vulnerable to serum killing, tcaA contributes to <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence by altering the cell wall architecture, as demonstrated by the wild type strain outcompeting the tcaA mutant in a Mouse Co-infection model. The study raises an important point that TcaA in <italic>S. aureus</italic> may represent a system balancing two scenarios: it makes the bacteria more susceptible to serum killing, potentially limiting bacteraemia and providing long-term benefits between hosts; however, once established in the bloodstream, the bacteria survive and thrive, causing successful bacteraemia, as per the short-sighted evolution of virulence hypothesis. This duality highlights the complex interplay between within-host and between-host fitness in bacterial evolution. I strongly suggest creating a graphical abstract to illustrate the complex relationship between within-host and between-host fitness scenarios involving TcaA. Having this visual representation in the discussion will enhance comprehension and provide a concise summary of the complex system for the reader.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors achieved their aims, and the results support their conclusions. This work will be important for understanding this complex system and for developing novel therapeutics and vaccines for <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p><p>We’d like to take this opportunity to thank the reviewers and editors for their consideration of our work. As detailed below, we have made the majority of the suggested corrections by the reviewers and believe these have greatly improved our manuscript. The reviewer’s comment are in blue font below and our response to each of these in black font.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions to improve the manuscript:</p><p>- Line 33 and 34: &quot;This protein&quot; is vague. Please reword to state whether you are referring to TcaA or to WTA</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 33)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Intro: It would be helpful to provide more rationale for testing serum as a surrogate to whole blood in the GWAS screen. Serum is obviously lacking components of the clotting cascade, and some of these components have antimicrobial functions. However, this is easily justified in the text- e.g. to avoid clumping during the screen, to focus only on serum-derived antimicrobial compounds, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been edited in the revised manuscript (Line 84-86)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 120: Please state if the 300 clinical isolates represent 300 distinct patients, or if some of the isolates came from the same patient during sequential collections. If the latter, were there any instances in the which the tcaA SNP appeared during the course of infection?</p></disp-quote><p>They each came from individual patients so we were unfortunately unable to look for within host events. This information has been added to the revised manuscript (line 104).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 133: the closed parenthesis sign is missing after &quot;CC22&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 135)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Table 1a - NE1296 is misspelled as ME1296. Also there is a typo in the last entry of this table for the locus tag</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Table 1b - the authors should comment (in the discussion) on the potential reasons why tcaA was not identified in the CC30 background.</p></disp-quote><p>A comment to this effect has been added to the revised manuscript (Lines 553-59)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2a - Why is the mutant with the empty complementation vector not significantly different from WT JE2?</p></disp-quote><p>The most widely used and reliable expression plasmid for complementation of mutated phenotypes in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is the pRMC2 plasmid, which requires chloramphenicol selection and anhydrotetracycline to induce expression of the cloned gene. These antibiotics, and the presence of the plasmid often affect the expression of other genes by the bacteria (as noted by this reviewer). As such, to verify complementation of a mutation the comparison we make is between the strain containing the empty plasmid induced with anhydrotetracycline with a strain with the gene containing plasmid induced with anhydrotetracycline. In that situation, the only difference between those two strains under those conditions is whether the gene is expressed or not. A comment explaining this has been added to the revised manuscript (lines 149-153).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 188: Statistical analyses should be applied to figure 3C, which also appears to be underpowered.</p></disp-quote><p>P values have been added to this in the revised manuscript. We present data point of three biological replicates, which are the mean of three technical replicates, which we believe is sufficiently powers for this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3 legend - Tecioplanin is mentioned in the title, but the data are not included here</p></disp-quote><p>This legend title has been the revised (Line 193).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4 - here is an example where testing the actual tcaA SNP could have been enlightening. For example, what if the selective pressure makes the SNP more relevant to a specific AMP or AA?</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that this would be an interesting experiment to perform, the complementing vector that we would need to use to compare the wild type and SNP contains gene requires antibiotics to select for the plasmid and another to induce expression. As such it becomes quite a complex and messy experiment where synergy between the antimicrobial agents would be likely, the results of which will be difficult to interpret.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 317-321 - Suggest moving this to discussion</p></disp-quote><p>We have left this here as we felt it a necessary summation/explanation of the results described in that section. It is discussed again later in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 341 - I believe &quot;serum&quot; should actually be &quot;teicoplanin&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 342).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6e - wouldn't it be more powerful to determine the WTA levels in the supernatants of these strains and conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We could have done this both ways, but we focussed here only on how TcaA ligates WTA into the cell wall in the presence of serum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6 - What is the explanation for the different growth yields for JE2 in tecioplanin in panel A versus panel F? Are these actually two different concentrations? If so, please update the figure legend and the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration used for the A was inhibitory and for F sub-inhibitory. To improve the clarity of this we have now used a table displaying the MICs for the six strains as panel A. We have also included the concentration of teicoplanin used for each experiment in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 413: Consider more precise language than &quot;the cell wall is stronger&quot;. E.g. More crosslinks?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been edited in the revised manuscript (Line 421)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 415: Consider changing &quot;altered&quot; to a directional term such as increases. It can be difficult for the reader to follow the expected change when you are discussing how the lack of a gene versus the presence of a gene changes susceptibility in one direction and another phenotype in the opposite direction.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been edited in the revised manuscript (Line 423).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 7: The conclusions made from panels A and B need to be supported by statistical analyses. It is unclear if these lines are truly different from one another.</p></disp-quote><p>These have been included in the revised fig 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 426: I believe &quot;tcaA&quot; is missing following &quot;producing&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 434).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 446: &quot;increase&quot; to &quot;increases&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 460).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 8C: if one goal of the mouse experiment was to look at survival during transit in whole blood, earlier timepoints are indicated based on the described kinetics of bloodstream dissemination in this model.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary goal of this experiment was to see if TcaA contributed positively or negatively to the development of the infection. Work on this protein is ongoing, and so we hope in coming years to be able to provide more detail on its activity in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 506: &quot;changes to the structural integrity of peptidoglycan&quot; seems overstated without additional studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been edited in the revised manuscript (Line 524).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 564: &quot;represents&quot; to &quot;represent&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 603).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 588: The figures all refer to &quot;100 net&quot;.

Therefore, we know each tcpA mutant will be able to grow in the presence of sub-mic concentrations of teicoplanin.
