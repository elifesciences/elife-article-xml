minus end. These dyneins are then pulled back when the axoneme bends in the other direction, meaning oscillatory back and forth movement of dynein during repetitive bending of cilia/flagella. There are various factors that may regulate the dynein activity, e.g. the nexin-dynein regulatory complex, radial spokes, and central apparatus. In order to understand the basic mechanism of dynein’s oscillatory movement, we constructed a simple model system composed of MTs, outer-arm dyneins, and crosslinks between the MTs made of DNA origami. Electron microscopy (EM) showed pairs of parallel MTs crossbridged by patches of regularly arranged dynein molecules bound in two different orientations, depending on which of the MTs their tails bind to. The oppositely oriented dyneins are expected to produce opposing forces when the pair of MTs have the same polarity. Optical trapping experiments showed that the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex actually oscillates back and forth after photolysis of caged ATP. Intriguingly, the complex, when held at one end, showed repetitive bending motions. The results show that a simple system composed of ensembles of oppositely oriented dyneins, MTs, and inter-MT crosslinkers, without any additional regulatory structures, has an intrinsic ability to cause oscillation and repetitive bending motions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor proteins</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>DNA origami</kwd><kwd>molecular biophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24115522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirose</surname><given-names>Keiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K07332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirose</surname><given-names>Keiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H05898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirose</surname><given-names>Keiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H00798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tadakuma</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tadakuma</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H04773</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higuchi</surname><given-names>Hideo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higuchi</surname><given-names>Hideo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasunaga</surname><given-names>Takuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pair of microtubules, ensembles of oppositely oriented axonemal dyneins, and inter-microtubule crosslinkers are the minimum components needed for oscillation and repetitive bending motions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Beating of cilia and flagella is powered by axonemal dynein molecules that are minus-end-directed microtubule (MT) motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibbons and Rowe, 1965</xref>). Each dynein is tethered to a doublet MT with its tail, and interacts with the neighboring MT using its stalks in an ATP-dependent way, to produce relative sliding of the two MTs. The MTs in an axoneme are all parallel and arranged in a 9 + 2 structure with their minus ends at the base and interconnected with various components, such as the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heuser et al., 2009</xref>). Because the neighboring doublet MTs are interlinked and also anchored to the basal body at the base, minus-end-directed movement of the dynein molecules on one side of the axoneme causes bending of the axoneme in one direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These dynein molecules are then pulled back (i.e. toward the plus end of the MT) when the dyneins on the opposite side of the axoneme produce force to bend the axoneme in the other direction. Thus, during cyclical bending of the axoneme, dynein molecules oscillate back and forth along a MT. How a minus-end-directed motor dynein can move back and forth along a MT is unknown.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of the dynein-microtubule-DNA-origami (dynein-MT-DNA-origami) complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic models showing directions of dynein sliding and bending of the axoneme. Dynein molecules between two pairs of doublet MTs, one pair on the far-side (top) and another pair on the near-side (bottom) are illustrated. When viewed from the front of the axoneme, the stalk and head of a far-side dynein are seen to the left of the tail, whereas those of a near-side dynein are on the right. As a result, the axoneme bends in opposite directions when only the far-side or only the near-side dyneins are activated and move toward the minus ends (colored in orange). Bending of the axoneme causes sliding of dynein on the unactivated side (yellow) toward the plus end. (<bold>B</bold>) Geometry of the dynein-MT complex. Longitudinal and axial views are illustrated. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> outer-arm dynein molecules crossbridge two MTs, binding with their tails and stalks. The stalks point toward the MT minus end. Because the tails and stalks bind to different MTs, there are two possible orientations for dynein depending on which MT the stalks bind to. (<bold>C</bold>) Schematic illustration of a cross-sectional view of an axoneme. Note that the geometry of dyneins in the dynein-MT complex shown in (<bold>B</bold>) mimics that of a combination of the dyneins on two opposite sides of the axoneme (cyan boxes), although the dynein arrays in (<bold>B</bold>) are not continuous. (<bold>D</bold>) Design of rod-shaped DNA origami. For binding to MTs, mutant kinesin motor domains (E237A) were attached to 5'-SNAP-ligand-modified handles placed on the DNA rod. The two handles were separated by ~50 nm, corresponding to the center-to-center distance of the two MTs in the dynein-MT complex. Each handle has 30 nucleotides of poly-thymidine linker between the SNAP ligand and the rod. (<bold>E</bold>) Geometry of the dynein-MT complex crosslinked with DNA-origami rods. In the presence of ATP, dynein molecules bound in the opposite orientations are thought to produce force in opposite directions (indicated by arrows). DNA rods are expected to crosslink the two MTs of the complex and restrict their relative movement.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76357-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>There are many factors that may influence force production by dynein. For example, outer-arm dyneins and several species of inner-arm dyneins are thought to affect each other’s activities. The arrangement of the dyneins in an axoneme must be also important for their communication; the outer-arm dyneins are aligned in a row with a periodicity of 24 nm, and the inner-arm dyneins are also regularly placed in specific positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bui et al., 2008</xref>). The inter-doublet linkers connect the circumferentially arranged nine doublet MTs, and thus transmit the force produced locally by some dyneins to the other parts of the axoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindemann, 2003</xref>). Other regulatory components, such as the radial spokes and central apparatus also seem to play important roles in the regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Witman et al., 1978</xref>). In order to minimize complexity and elucidate only the basic mechanism of cilia and flagella motility, we designed a simple model system and tested its structure and motility. Our system consists of in vitro polymerized MTs, axonemal outer-arm dynein molecules, and passive linkers that interconnect pairs of parallel MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This simple model system does not have the circular arrangement of nine MTs in the axoneme, nor does it have inner-arm dyneins, radial spokes or the central apparatus.</p><p>To reconstitute the regular arrangement of outer-arm dyneins, which allow neighboring dynein molecules to interact with each other, we used dynein preparations extracted from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella axonemes with high salt (typically 0.6 M KCl). The high-salt-extracted dynein preparations are known to crossbridge MTs with ~24 nm periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haimo et al., 1979</xref>), and although they contain other components in addition to outer-arm dyneins, previous work showed that the proteins bound to MTs are mostly outer-arm dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyama and Kamiya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oda et al., 2007</xref>). As inter-MT linkers, we utilized rod-shaped DNA origami structures and attached the DNA rods to the MTs via flexible linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Use of DNA origami enabled us to design a molecular layout of the crosslinking structure that allows relative sliding of the MTs over a certain distance, resulting in oscillation and repetitive bending motions as seen in intact axonemes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Geometry of dynein-MT complexes</title><p>Dynein preparations extracted with high salt from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella axonemes were mixed with taxol-stabilized MTs polymerized from brain tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyama and Kamiya, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haimo et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oda et al., 2007</xref>), the MTs became bundled with the crossbridging molecules bound with a period of ~24 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In the dynein-MT complexes prepared with high concentrations of dynein, a pair of MTs in bundles are crossbridged by two continuous arrays of dynein, so that superposition of two rows of dynein molecules is observed in electron microscopy (EM) images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haimo et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oda et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, when a low concentration of the dynein preparation (6.25–12.5 µg/ml [corresponding to ~3–6 nM outer-arm dynein]) was mixed with 20–25 µg/ml MTs (200–250 nM tubulin dimers), the MTs were only partially decorated with dynein, so that we were able to observe single layers of crossbridges without superposition in many regions. Negative-stain EM observation of the individual crossbridges showed characteristic shapes of outer-arm dynein, with stacked heads and a tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heuser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Movassagh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming that the crossbridging proteins are mostly outer-arm dyneins. The average number of dyneins per 1 µm of a MT pair was about 12 when 6.25 µg/ml dynein was used.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure of the dynein-microtubules-DNA-origami (dynein-MT-DNA-origami) complex.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Negative stain images of the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex in the absence (<bold>A</bold>) and presence (<bold>B</bold>) of 0.1 mM ATP.

Thus, we determined the polarity of the MTs in the dynein-MT complex based on the orientation of dyneins in the EM images. Whereas the orientation of the head + stalk is always toward the minus end, binding of the tail to the MT was less specific in vitro, so that the resulting complexes had either parallel or antiparallel MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ueno et al., 2008</xref>) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>.

Compared to the continuous dynein arrays in axonemes, the arrays of dynein in our complex were much shorter and discontinuous because we used low concentrations of dynein. Nevertheless, the arrangement of dyneins in our complex is analogous to a combination of two dynein arrays on the opposite sides of an axoneme, in the sense that both systems contain two subsets of regularly arranged dynein molecules, and the subsets produce antagonistic forces (compare the axial views in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The resemblance in their geometries led us to the idea that these dynein-MT complexes might work as a simple model system to investigate the minimum components required for oscillatory movements that occur in cilia and flagella.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Motile properties of the dynein-MT complex</title><p>The outer-arm dynein preparations used here supported movement of MTs in gliding assays at a speed comparable to those in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furuta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

When the dynein-MT complexes are adsorbed to a glass surface, the MTs that are directly attached to the glass cannot move, but other MTs in the same complex are allowed to slide relative to the glass-attached MTs. Relative sliding of the MTs leads to disassembly of the complex as soon as the complexes are exposed to an ATP-containing solution. Therefore we used caged ATP and observed the movement of MTs immediately after the ATP was uncaged locally by photolysis. Even though the majority of the complexes are thought to contain groups of dynein molecules that produce force in opposite directions, many of the complexes showed unidirectional sliding of MTs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), probably because the numbers of molecules in the two groups are not equal and the dominant group would ‘win’.

About 48 out of 94 such traces showed sliding movement, and 65% of them exhibited oscillatory movement (at least two forward and two backward displacements, each displacement larger than 10 nm, and the velocity of each movement between 0.1 and 50 µm/s) in some parts of the trace.

Thus, we have also measured the length of dynein in our negative stain images.

On the other hand, the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complexes in our optical trapping experiments were fixed to the glass surface along the whole length. In order to investigate whether the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex has an ability to produce bending motions, we searched for a complex which is held at one point. Whereas a majority of the complexes seemed to be fixed to the glass along their entire length, there were some complexes attached only partially either to a bead or to the glass. Some examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>.

The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> shows that the complex can bend in both directions compared to the position before ATP release. Thus, it is likely that the bending motions in the opposite directions are powered by oppositely oriented dyneins, not just the cycles of force production and detachment. Sometimes a part of the MT bundle separated during bending motions as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>, probably because this region did not have DNA origami attachment or because the DNA origami was pulled away during bending.

Another important feature of cilia and flagella is that the dyneins on the opposite sides of the axoneme produce force to bend the axoneme in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The dynein-MT system used here mimics cilia and flagella in that it contains two groups of oppositely oriented dynein molecules, that the neighboring dyneins are arranged with 24 nm periodicities between a pair of MTs, and that the MTs are interconnected with passive linkers. Previous work using frayed <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella axonemes showed that a pair of doublet MTs can display cyclic association, buckling, and dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyama and Kamiya, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brokaw, 2009</xref>). In their system, the doublet MTs were bundled at the proximal end and the inter-doublet linkers were proteolyzed. Our dynein-MT complex differs from theirs in that it contains inter-MT linkers and two groups of dyneins that produce opposing forces between a pair of MTs.</p><p>Oscillatory movements of MTs were also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shingyoji et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shingyoji et al., 2015</xref>, using single or a few molecules of sea urchin axonemal dynein. In contrast, our work shows that multiple molecules of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> outer-arm dynein move a MT unidirectionally. We think the discrepancy is caused by the number and the arrangement of molecules: our system has multiple dynein molecules (~35 on average in the case of the complex with oppositely oriented dyneins) aligned regularly on a MT, which would work cooperatively as in cilia and flagella. An effect of the number of molecules on a motor’s directionality was also reported for kinesin-5 Cin8: a single Cin8 moved to the MT minus end, while a team of Cin8 showed plus-end-directed motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roostalu et al., 2011</xref>). Our results show that an ensemble of dynein molecules aligned on a MT produce force in one direction, but participation of oppositely oriented dyneins is required for oscillatory movements.</p><p>The axoneme is a complex structure containing various components that may modulate the dynein activity, which makes it difficult to understand the basic mechanism of oscillation. For example, radial spokes and central apparatus are thought to be important for beating of flagella, but mutant flagella lacking radial spokes or the central pair can beat under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yagi and Kamiya, 2000</xref>), indicating that they are not absolutely needed for oscillatory beating. The circumferential layout of nine doublet MTs and/or the cooperative activities of outer-arm and several species of inner-arm dyneins may also be important for oscillation, but it has not been known whether they are essential for oscillation. Some modeling studies predicted that a system composed of dynein, MTs, and passive components can produce oscillation due to mechanical instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayly and Dutcher, 2016</xref>), but direct evidence has not been obtained because of the lack of a reconstituted system with minimal components. Here, use of DNA origami enabled us to construct a simple system composed of two MTs with clusters of oppositely oriented dyneins and passive linkers. Oscillation of this system shows that the regulatory components including the 9 + 2 structure with radial spokes and the central apparatus, nexin-dynein regulatory complexes, and inner-arm dyneins are not essential for generation of oscillation per se.</p><p>Since our dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex contained dyneins that produce forces in opposite directions, the most likely explanation for the oscillatory movements would be that each of the two dynein orientation-groups is responsible for just one of the two directions of movement, one orientation powering forward movements and the other orientation driving backward movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We cannot completely rule out the possibility that at least some of the backward motions are caused by the trap force after detachment of dyneins; although steps were observed in the backward motions, force-induced backward stepping was reported with cytoplasmic dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gennerich et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, we think that it is more likely that the oscillatory movements are produced by alternating actions of two groups of dyneins that produce force in opposite directions, because (1) the dynein-MT complexes with unidirectionally aligned dyneins did not show oscillation and (2) there exist two groups of dyneins that produce opposing force in more than 80% of the complexes, and if all the steps observed during backward motion were force-induced backward stepping, that would mean the dyneins in only one of the two groups are responsible for both forward and backward movement while the dyneins in the other group do nothing, which we think is unlikely.</p><p>The DNA linkers limit the range of relative sliding, and thus may function as the trigger to change the direction of movement. The average frequency of the observed oscillation (~33 Hz) was close to the beat frequencies of the two flagella of a detergent-extracted <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cell (30 and 45 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamiya and Hasegawa, 1987</xref>). In addition, the dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex showed repetitive bending motions when one end is free in solution. Although regulatory components including the radial spokes and central apparatus are probably needed for more coordinated and long-lasting oscillation, our results show that a minimal system composed of two groups of oppositely oriented dyneins, MTs, and inter-MT crosslinkers has an intrinsic ability to oscillate and bend cyclically.</p><p>The dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex developed here contains multiple dynein molecules aligned between the MTs with a 24 nm periodicity as in axonemes, allowing the neighboring dyneins to cooperate, and the oppositely oriented dyneins to work against each other. This simple system is thus useful for future research on the mechanism of cilia/flagella motility. It can also be used to study the high-resolution structures of dynein during oscillatory movement. Future cryo-EM studies analyzing the 3D structures of activated and regulated dynein molecules would be of great interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Dynein, kinesin, and microtubules</title><p>A wild-type strain (137c-) of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> was used.

After 1 min, ATP (final: 0.1 mM) was added and the sample was immediately stained with uranyl acetate. The samples were observed using an FEI Tecnai F-20 electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Orius 831 CCD camera. The images were adjusted for contrast and Gaussian-filtered in Adobe Photoshop to reduce noise.</p><p>For the analysis of dynein shapes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, a set of high magnification images and a low magnification image were taken from the same dynein-MT-DNA-origami complex. The high magnification images show the dynein structures at a higher resolution and comparison with the low magnification image tells where each dynein is located in the complex.</p><p>The electron microscopic images were analyzed using the Eos software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yasunaga and Wakabayashi, 1996</xref>). Images of dynein-MT-DNA-origami complexes that have dynein molecules bound in two opposite orientations were selected. After correction for the contrast transfer function, image segments each containing a dynein molecule and parts of two MTs were extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Images of dynein molecules whose tails are bound to the same MT were grouped, so that there are two groups of dynein images observed between a pair of MTs.</p><p>Image segments that belong to the same group were aligned and averaged in the following process. To lower the effect of the MTs and neighboring dyneins during alignment, the contrast of the peripheral region in each segment was reduced by 10%. Each segment was pasted into a slightly larger box filled with the mean density of the peripheral region. For each group, we selected one of the segments as the original reference and aligned the other images by calculating their similarity using a correlation function, allowing translation and rotation with 9–0.072° steps. The images in the same group were averaged using the rotation angles and translation values that showed the maximum correlation. We then used these average images as the references for the next cycle of alignment. The alignment cycle was repeated until the average images did not change. For comparison with these average images, 2D projections of the EMDB maps (EMD_1696 and EMD_1697) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Movassagh et al., 2010</xref>) were calculated using mrcImageRotation3D/mrcImageProjection on Eos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yasunaga and Wakabayashi, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The length of the dynein molecule along the MT axis was measured in each average image. The length of the dynein image projected onto the MT axis was defined as the dynein length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, inset). Distributions of the lengths in the presence and absence of ATP were compared statistically (Welch’s T-test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vitro motility assays</title><p>Glass chambers were made using two pieces of cover glass (24 mm × 32 mm [No. 24321, Muto pure chemicals, Japan] and 18 mm × 18 mm [No. 0101030, Marienfeld]). The glass was cleaned with KOH, and then rinsed with H<sub>2</sub>O and ethanol for MT-gliding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue and Shingyoji, 2007</xref>). For optical trapping experiments of the dynein-MT complex, uncleaned glass was used because more beads adhered non-specifically to the cleaned glass. The size of the chamber was ~18 mm × 5 mm.</p><p>MT-gliding assays over dynein-coated glass surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) were performed by introducing 100–125 µg/ml dynein in a chamber for 2 min, followed by 1 mM ADP in HEM for 1 min, and then 5 µg/ml MT in the assay buffer (1 mM caged ATP [Dojin], 0.1 mM taxol, 20 mM glucose, 0.5% [v/v]; β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 1 unit/ml hexokinase in HEM). Movement of MTs after UV photolysis of caged ATP was observed using a fluorescence microscope (81 X, Olympus, Japan) equipped with a 100× lens, a mercury lamp (USH1030L), and filters (535 BP/30 and 330 WB/80). Caged ATP was photolyzed by switching the filters. Images were recorded using a CMOS camera (ORCA-Flash 2.8, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan).</p><p>For motility assays of the dynein-MT complex with and without DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>), the complex preformed in solution was perfused into the chamber. After applying the ADP solution and assay buffer (without MTs), the MT movement after caged ATP photolysis was observed as above. The velocities were calculated from the videos recorded at the frame rates of 100–400ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optical trapping</title><p>Optical trapping experiments were performed as previously described using a custom-made microscope system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinoshita et al., 2018</xref>). After perfusion of the dynein MT-complex with and without DNA-kinesin, 1 mM ADP in the HEM buffer, and then the assay buffer (1 mM caged ATP [Dojin], 0.1 mM taxol, 20 mM glucose, 0.5% [v/v] β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 1 unit/ml hexokinase in HEM) with streptavidin-coated beads and 0.2 mg/ml casein were introduced into the glass chamber.</p><p>An avidin-coated bead was trapped and then brought in contact with a biotinylated MT in the complex. Caged ATP was photolyzed by a UV laser pulse. Displacement of the bead was measured at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a quadrant photodiode connected to a MacLab system (AD Instruments). For the experiments with dynein-MT-DNA-origami complexes, 200 nm beads were used (trap stiffness: 0.015–0.055 pN/nm). For measuring the maximum force produced by the dynein array in the dynein-MT complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), 500 nm beads were used (trap stiffness: 0.175–0.35 pN/nm), because the bead-attached MT often slid out of the optical trap and the dynein-MT complex disassembled when 200 nm beads were used.</p><p>For the optical trapping experiments of MTs gliding over dynein-coated surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), 10 µl of 125 µg/ml dynein was applied to the glass chamber as in usual MT-gliding assays. Assuming that 10% of the perfused dynein molecules are adsorbed to the glass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sakakibara et al., 1999</xref>), the density of the dynein molecules was roughly estimated to be 209 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, if dynein molecules directly below a MT that has a diameter of 25 nm can interact with the MT, the number of dynein molecules that interact with the MT is calculated to be 5.2 molecules/µm.</p><p>Stepping events were analyzed by a step-finding algorithm by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerssemakers et al., 2006</xref>. To statistically optimize the step finding procedure, they defined a parameter <italic>S</italic>, which is the ratio of the <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> of the counter fit to <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> of the best fit. The <italic>S</italic> changes with number of steps, and the highest peak S gives the best fit. For the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, only those data that had a clear peak in <italic>S</italic> were used. The detected step sizes were calibrated with attenuation factors to account for the compliance of the bead-MT linkage and that of dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinoshita et al., 2018</xref>). Fitting with Gaussian functions was performed by graphic software (Datagraph, Visual Data Tools, Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Observation of bending motions</title><p>Avidin-coated beads (200 nm in diameter) were perfused into a glass chamber. After washing with HEM buffer, dynein-MT-DNA-origami complexes prepared as above using 6.25 µg/ml (final) dynein and rhodamine-labeled MTs were introduced into a chamber and incubated for 5 min. The assay buffer containing 1 mM caged ATP, 0.5 mM ADP, and 0.3 mg/ml casein was then perfused and the sample was observed under a fluorescence microscope. Although the majority of complexes firmly attached to the glass and did not show movement, some complexes appeared to be attached only by a part of their length while the other ends were free and showed movement. For some experiments, avidin-coated beads were first introduced to the chamber, and dynein-MT-DNA-origami complexes made with rhodamine and biotin-labeled MTs were bound to the beads.</p><p>Positions of the MTs were detected by fitting Gaussian functions to the fluorescence intensity profile using ImageJ. The maximum values of relative sliding of the MTs in the complex were estimated using the parts where two MTs of the complex separated (e.g. shown by orange arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The length along each MT was measured and the difference between the lengths of the two MTs was taken as the sliding distance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>DNA oligonucleotide sequences for the DNA origami rod.</title><p>The asterisk indicates the C6dT modified oligonucleotide.

I therefore recommend publication, subject to the following changes:</p><p>1. Abstract: The description that &quot;…axonemal dynein molecules move in an oscillatory manner along a microtubule…&quot; is not correct. All dynein molecules perform unidirectional power strokes along axonemal MTs (they don't oscillate along MTs). The oscillatory beating of axonemes results from the coordinated, out-of-phase activation/deactivation of dynein molecules at opposing sides of the axoneme. I recommend correcting the first sentence and the last sentence on page 2.</p><p>2. Introduction: References are missing at the end of &quot;Beating of cilia and flagella is powered…&quot;, &quot;…the inner-arm dyneins are also regularly placed in specific positions&quot;, and &quot;…produced by some dyneins to the other parts of the axoneme&quot;.</p><p>3. Results, page 6: The authors state that the demonstrated activity shows oscillatory motion. The depicted displacements in Figure 5 and Suppl. Figure 5 look mostly like unidirectional force generation followed by detachment (more than 90% of the depicted events show this behavior). This sawtooth-like pattern is even expected as the force generation of the dynein motors must eventually cease as the MTs are cross-linked. Sections where backward motion is observed could be force-induced backward stepping.

Figures 5B and Suppl. Figure 5A: Why can 180-200 nm unidirectional displacements be generated if both MTs are cross-linked by DNA origami? What explains these large displacements considering that the following sawtooth-like displacements are only 50 nm in amplitude?</p><p>7. Figure 7: It looks like the trace in Figure 7B shows also sawtooth-like displacements initially after the photolysis of caged ATP, which can also be seen in Supplemental Figure 7C. As the amplitude of these displacements is on a similar length scale (~50 nm) as reported by Shingyoji et al., (Nature 1998), I would say that these experiments largely agree with the results of Shingyoji and co-workers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors could discuss how the force generating dyneins are localized in cilia. In Figure 8c, dynein generates force at the straight parts, not at the bending point. This is close to the model based on the sliding disintegration (Hayashi and Shingyoji, 2008) and different from the one proposed based on cyo-ET (Lin and Nicastro), where asymmetrical dynein activation occurs at the bending points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

Concerning the possible difference in the velocity distribution for backwards sliding versus forwards sliding (relative to the trap centre) (Figure 6C), the authors consider the possibility that the trapping potential may be hindering the one and helping the other, and raise the possibility that some backwards motions are slips.

If so, are there any 'forwards' detachment events?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76357.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address Reviewer #2's concerns about the EM characterization of your system.</p></disp-quote><p>In response, we have added some more analysis and revised the manuscript as we wrote as response to Reviewer #2’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Address Reviewer #3's concerns.

We did not intend to say that the dynein molecules actively move back and forth.

This reviewer suggests that ‘more than 90% of the depicted events show this behavior’ (unidirectional force generation followed by detachment). We do not agree with this comment, because, for example, 3 out or 5 backwards movements indicated by pink arrows in Figure 5 show steps. Also, the average velocity of the backwards movements (6.4 µm/s; Figure 6D) is much slower than the velocity after detachment (&gt;600 µm/s during detachment that happens after 160 ms in Figure 5). We have added another example of steps in Figure 5 – suppl 1, where backwards movements during oscillation (indicated by pink arrows) show steps. We have also added a histogram to compare the time required for forwards and backwards movements in new Figure 6. The average time required for backwards movement (8.3 ms) was slightly shorter than that for forwards movement (10.1 ms) but much longer than the time required for simple detachment from a MT (&lt;1 ms).</p><p>We realize that we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the observed steps during the backwards movement are ‘force-induced backward stepping’. Nevertheless, we think that the most likely explanation for the oscillatory movements would be that each of the two dynein orientation-groups is responsible for just one of the two directions of movement, one orientation powering forwards movements and the other orientation driving backwards movements, because 1) the dynein-MT complex with unidirectionally aligned dynein did not show oscillation; and 2) there exist two groups of dyneins that produce opposing force in more than 80 % of the complexes, and if the steps observed during backwards motion are force-induced backwards stepping, that would mean the dyneins in only one of the two groups are responsible for both forwards and backwards movement while the dyneins in the other group do nothing, and we cannot think of any reason for that.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added discussion about the possibility that the observed backwards movements might be ‘force-induced backward stepping’, and the reasons why we think they are caused by oppositely oriented dyneins:</p><p>“We cannot completely rule out the possibility that at least some of the backwards motions are caused by the trap force after detachment of dyneins; although steps were observed in the backwards motions, force-induced backwards stepping was reported with cytoplasmic dynein (Gennerich <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007). Nevertheless, we think that it is more likely that the oscillatory movements are produced by alternating actions of two groups of dyneins that produce force in opposite directions, because 1) the dynein-MT complexes with unidirectionally aligned dyneins did not show oscillation; and 2) there exist two groups of dyneins that produce opposing force in more than 80 % of the complexes, and if all the steps observed during backwards motion were force-induced backwards stepping, that would mean the dyneins in only one of the two groups are responsible for both forwards and backwards movement while the dyneins in the other group do nothing, which we think is unlikely.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Video 2: I am not sure what one is supposed to see in Video 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas the MTs slide after caged ATP photolysis in Video 1, the MTs stay still in Video 2 (Figure 4-video 1 in the revised manuscript), which means that addition of DNA origami can stop large relative sliding of the MTs and prevents disassembly of the complex. We moved this video to supplements (Figure 4-video 1), since it gives rather supporting evidence. We have also added the following phrase in line 172-173 for clarification:</p><p>“so that movement of MTs was not detected by fluorescence microscopy”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3: Please plot the absolute sliding velocities in Figure 3B and not the relative velocities.</p></disp-quote><p>As we stated in line 135-137, ‘when the dynein-MT complexes are adsorbed to a glass surface, the MTs that are directly attached to the glass cannot move, but other MTs in the same complex are allowed to slide relative to the glass-attached MTs.’ We measured the velocity only when one MT moved while the rest of the complex stayed still. Therefore, the absolute sliding velocities are equivalent to the relative velocities at this resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figures 5B and Suppl. Figure 5A: Why can 180-200 nm unidirectional displacements be generated if both MTs are cross-linked by DNA origami? What explains these large displacements considering that the following sawtooth-like displacements are only 50 nm in amplitude?</p></disp-quote><p>A similar comment was made by Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors #3). As we explained in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A, the maximum displacement of the MT before the DNA linker becomes fully stretched depends on the initial binding angle of the DNA origami with respect to the MTs. The largest amplitude of the back-and-forth movement of a MT is expected to be ~190 nm (96 x 2 nm), but it would happen only when the binding angles of all the DNA origami rods (we estimated there are about 7 DNA rods crosslinking the complex) are equal. Therefore, the sliding distance is usually shorter than 190 nm.</p><p>However, as the MT slides, one of the origami rods that binds with the most disadvantageous tilt angle would be stretched more than the rest of the origami rods. The origami rod is bound to the MT via kinesin heads, but the binding force of one or two kinesins may not be enough for stopping the MTs sliding. These kinesins may be dragged, allowing farther sliding. The sliding would stop when enough DNA rods work together.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 7: It looks like the trace in Figure 7B shows also sawtooth-like displacements initially after the photolysis of caged ATP, which can also be seen in Supplemental Figure 7C.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we show these two traces starting 60~80 ms before the UV flash. The traces show similar irregular noises both before and after the UV flash. The oscillation reported by Shingyoji et al., had the frequency of ~70 Hz, corresponding to ~14 ms for one up-and-down cycle, which is clearly different from the noise observed in some of our traces of unidirectionally aligned dyneins.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the noise before and after UV flash.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76357-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors could discuss how the force generating dyneins are localized in cilia.

We have revised the sentences in Abstract as the following:</p><p>“Electron microscopy (EM) showed pairs of parallel MTs crossbridged by patches of regularly arranged dynein molecules bound in two different orientations depending on which of the MTs their tails bind to. The oppositely oriented dyneins are expected to produce opposing forces when the pair of MTs have the same polarity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I don't understand why restraining force due to the DNA crosslinker triggers oscillatory switching between the two sets of dyneins, whereas restraining force due to the optical trap does not. I may be missing something, please comment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out an interesting possibility. We think that the optical trap force can basically trigger oscillation. However, we used small beads (200 nm) in order to detect 8-nm steps, so that the trap force was weak. As the results, the optical trap could not stop sliding of the MTs, and the dynein-MT complexes disassembled in the absence of the DNA linkers.</p><p>When a larger bead (500 nm) was used to measure the maximum force, the optical trap was able to stop sliding of the MTs, and some traces showed up and down at a higher force (Figure 3 – supp 1). By adjusting the conditions such as the number of dyneins per complex, it might be possible to see oscillatory switching of the moving direction by the optical trap force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I don't understand why in Figure 5B, the initial response to the UV flash is 170 nm of unidirectional sliding, after which much smaller amplitude oscillations ensue.

There are similar large amplitude sliding events in some of the traces in Figure 5 supp 1.</p></disp-quote><p>A similar comment was made by Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors #6). As this reviewer suggests, we think that the dyneins can drag origami when not enough origami rods are functioning. As described in Materials and methods, the end of a linker of the DNA origami rod has three sites for mutant kinesin heads to attach. Thus, the origami is bound to a MT via one to three kinesin heads. Although there are several origami rods crosslinking the MTs, they are in various angles, and when the MTs slide relative to each other, one of the linkers would become fully stretched to maximum before the other linkers do. We think that the binding force of one or two kinesins may not be strong enough, and they may be dragged until cooperation of some more linkers stops the sliding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. l.186 How are oscillation events defined?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comment. Although we selected the traces in which we could detect steps for the analysis in Figure 6, we did not have a clear definition for this sentence. To answer this comment, we have now set a definition, re-counted the traces, and modified the text:</p><p>Lines 208-211: “Forty-eight out of 94 such traces showed sliding movement, and 65% of them exhibited oscillatory movement (at least two forwards and two backwards displacements, each displacement larger than 10 nm, and the velocity of each movement between 0.1 µm/s and 50 µm/s) in some parts of the trace.”</p><p>We chose the value ‘50 µm/s’ because sliding velocities faster than 40 µm/s were observed for dynein-MT-complexes by Aoyama and Kamiya (Cytoskeleton, 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Does the steppiness of the traces imply that relatively few dyneins (perhaps sometimes only one?) are engaged at any one time? Or are multiple dyneins synchronising? In Fig7 Supp2 (no origami, larger forces) are the traces steppy?</p></disp-quote><p>The average number of dyneins per complex was 35. If the numbers of oppositely oriented dyneins are equal, the number of the dyneins oriented in the same way would be ~18. Because of the low duty ratio of outer-arm dynein, it is likely that the number of dyneins engaged at any one time is small.</p><p>Prompted by this comment, we tried step analysis for the traces in Figure 7 and Figure 7-supp2, and steps were indeed detected for some of them. An example (a part of the trace in Figure 7-supp.2C) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Steps detected for the trace in Figure 7 —figure supplement 2C.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-76357-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Concerning the possible difference in the velocity distribution for backwards sliding versus forwards sliding (relative to the trap centre) (Figure 6C), the authors consider the possibility that the trapping potential may be hindering the one and helping the other, and raise the possibility that some backwards motions are slips. Can these events not be recognised according to their special rapidity? If so, are there any 'forwards' detachment events?</p></disp-quote><p>With the step-finding algorithm we used, we estimated by simulation that we can reliably (&gt;90 %) detect 8-nm displacement only when the dwell time is longer than 1 ms. Therefore, we could not tell whether the very rapid movements included steps or they were just ‘slips’.</p><p>We did not recognize any clear ‘forwards detachment’. During forwards (away from the trap center) movement, the trap force, the force of the DNA linkers, and that of the oppositely oriented dyneins are all directed to the trap center, and the only force directing away from the trap center is produced by the dyneins that are moving forwards. Therefore, it is most likely that ‘detachment’ occurs in the backwards direction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
