Surprisingly, it has also been shown to possess reward-related activity, presumably to facilitate reward-based learning of new movements. However, whether reward-related signals are represented among different cell types in M1, and whether their response properties change after cue–reward conditioning remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the activity of different neuronal cell types in M1 while mice engaged in a classical conditioning task. Our results demonstrate that most of the major neuronal cell types in M1 showed robust but differential responses to both the conditioned cue stimulus (CS) and reward, and their response properties undergo cell-type-specific modifications after associative learning. PV-INs’ responses became more reliable to the CS, while VIP-INs’ responses became more reliable to reward. Pyramidal neurons only showed robust responses to novel reward, and they habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-INs’ responses emerged and became more reliable to both the CS and reward after conditioning. These observations suggest that cue- and reward-related signals are preferentially represented among different neuronal cell types in M1, and the distinct modifications they undergo during associative learning could be essential in triggering different aspects of local circuit reorganization in M1 during reward-based motor skill learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>two-photon calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>inhibitory neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>05308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>950-231274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>06972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Naud</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Major neuronal subtypes in M1 show differential responses to reward and reward-associated stimuli and undergo cell-type-specific plasticity following associative learning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary motor cortex (M1) is an essential site for movement execution and motor learning. Within M1, neurons encode movement goals and movement kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgopoulos et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moran and Schwartz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, neurons in M1 have also been reported to show reward-related activity. In vivo recording studies performed in nonhuman primates found neurons in M1 that encode reward anticipation, reward delivery, and mismatches between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramakrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>). In human subjects, reward has also been shown to modulate M1 activity, likely through an inhibitory circuit-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thabit et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains unclear how reward-related responses are represented in M1, and if the representation changes with associative learning.</p><p>It was recently shown that in well-trained mice performing a skilled reaching task, a subset of layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in M1 specifically report successful, but not failed, reach-and-grasp movements. In contrast, a different subset of PNs report only failed reach-and-grasp movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levy et al., 2020</xref>). Since the ability to use past experience to learn action–outcome associations is critical to survival, encoding the outcome in M1 may be an important part of motor skill learning. It is widely accepted that associative learning using reinforcement can accelerate and enhance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikooyan and Ahmed, 2015</xref>). In the case of motor learning, studies have demonstrated that positive feedback (reward) facilitates motor memory retention and negative feedback (punishment) speeds up the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galea et al., 2015</xref>). One hypothesis is that during learning, reward signals in the brain, together with neuromodulators and synaptic plasticity, are involved in potentiating and optimizing the neural circuitry in M1 that underlies the rewarded movement. Implementing such a learning process would necessitate the interplay between different cell types within the local microcircuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richards et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>M1, like other cortical areas, is densely packed with PNs and diverse inhibitory interneuron (IN) types and is wired in a delicately balanced and intricate circuit. Different IN subtypes have been shown to have distinct gene expression profiles, electrophysiological properties, and connectivity motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fishell and Rudy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Markram et al., 2004</xref>). Somatostatin-, parvalbumin-, and vasoactive intestinal peptide- expressing inhibitory neurons (SOM-INs, PV-INs, and VIP-INs, respectively) are three major nonoverlapping subtypes of GABAergic neurons that broadly form a common microcircuit motif in the cortex. Some studies have demonstrated that SOM-INs preferentially target distal dendrites of PNs to filter synaptic inputs, fast-spiking PV-INs preferentially target perisomatic regions of PNs enabling strong inhibition of spiking, and VIP-INs regulate local microcircuits by controlling other local INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Due to their diverse properties and strategic connectivity motifs, these INs exert fine control over local network activity and provide a potential mechanism for how the brain processes reward signals and ultimately uses this information to optimize neural activity related to learned motor skills.</p><p>Multiple studies using in vivo opto-recordings in the primary visual cortex have shown that visual orientation selectivity in PNs is modulated and sharpened by PV- and SOM-INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson et al., 2012</xref>). In the primary auditory cortex, PV- and SOM-INs exert analogous control over PN frequency tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seybold et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, in the auditory cortex, prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala, reinforcement signals such as reward and punishment have been shown to recruit VIP-INs, which in turn, inhibit SOM- and PV-INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). The subtype-specific roles of these INs have long been elusive, but a complex picture is emerging where INs are not only responsible for maintaining a delicate balance of excitation and inhibition, but are also actively involved in processing activity in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wood et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we employed chronic in vivo two-photon imaging, combined with a head-fixed classical conditioning task, to monitor the activity of the same population of PNs, PV-INs, SOM-INs, or VIP-INs before and after associative learning to investigate whether and how conditioned cue stimulus (CS) and unconditioned reward are represented among different neuronal cell types in M1. Our results demonstrate that all four major cell types in M1 show distinct responses to CS and reward, and their response properties undergo cell-type-specific modifications after associative learning. Notably, PV-INs and VIP-INs exhibited stimulus-specific modifications, in which PV-INs became more reliably responsive to the CS but not to the reward, whereas VIP-INs became more reliable to the reward but not to the CS. PNs initially showed robust responses to novel reward but became habituated to it after associative learning. Lastly, SOM-IN responses emerged with learning and responded more reliably to both the CS and reward. Taken together, these results show that cue- and reward-related signals are preferentially represented among major neuronal cell types in M1, and they undergo cell-type-specific modifications during associative learning, indicating they may have distinct roles in integrating reinforcement signals to promote circuit reorganization in M1 during motor skill learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To understand how reward-associated signals are represented within the local microcircuitry in M1 before and after associative learning, we established a head-fixed auditory cued reward conditioning task, which allowed us to combine the task with in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to examine the response properties of different neuronal cell-type populations in awake and behaving mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this task, water-restricted mice were exposed to a conditioned stimulus (CS; auditory tone, 1-s duration), followed by a 1.5-s delay and then the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus (US; water reward, ~10 µl). Mice were trained for ~30–35 trials/session (1 session/day for 7 days) with randomly varied intertrial intervals (ITIs) between 60 and 120 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since M1 is known to be involved in movement initiation and motor skill learning, we chose to use a simple classical conditioning task with just an auditory tone paired with reward and omitted any additional training where mice would be required to learn a new movement. The rationale for this is that many neuronal cell types, including PNs, PV-, and SOM-INs, have been shown to undergo modifications when mice acquire new movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). However, since licking is an innate movement that does not induce plastic changes in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2014</xref>), we can reliably attribute changes in neuronal activity over the course of the task to associative learning, rather than motor learning.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Associative learning during a head-fixed classical conditioning task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of head-fixed classical conditioning task.

On a trial-by-trial basis, anticipatory lick rate did not change significantly within a single session on both days 1 and 7, implying limited within-session improvements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To ensure the increase in lick rate was specific to the CS, we compared the mean lick rate during the CS and reward period to the lick rate during self-initiated spontaneous lick bouts in the ITI (in the absence of the CS or reward). To be consistent with the 2.5-s analysis window for CS responses, we analyzed the first 2.5 s of ITI lick bouts and 2.5 s following reward delivery. On day 1, the mean lick rate during ITI lick bouts (1.47 ± 0.17/s) and the CS (1.37 ± 0.17/s) were similar, while the lick rate following reward delivery was significantly higher (7.16 ± 0.48/s). In contrast, on day 7 following associative learning, the lick rate during the CS period (3.42 ± 0.37/s) was significantly higher than during ITI lick bouts (1.71 ± 0.2/s), demonstrating that the mice effectively learned the CS–reward association by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the activity of different neuronal cell types during this task, we used in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of different cell-type populations. To target PNs in M1, we injected an adenoassociated virus (AAV) carrying a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GCaMP6f) driven by the CaMKII promoter (AAV1.CaMKIIa.GCaMP6f) into M1 of wild-type B6129S mice. After 3–5 weeks, we recorded the activity of hundreds of L2/3 PNs using two-photon microscopy in awake mice while they underwent the head-fixed conditioning task, and we tracked the same population of neurons on days 1 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We identified all the active neurons within a session, irrespective of the behavioral task (see Methods), and sorted neurons by the timing of their peak activity relative to the CS onset. It was apparent that there were subpopulations of neurons more responsive to CS, reward, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). We also repeated the experiments to examine if the major IN subtypes in M1 also respond to the CS and reward during the conditioning task. To do this, we injected AAV-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6f in PV-Cre, SOM-Cre, or VIP-Cre transgenic mice to selectively express GCaMP6f in PV-INs, SOM-INs, or VIP-INs, respectively, and then performed in vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the response properties of the same population of INs on days 1 and 7 after associating learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>).

By repeating this 1000 times for each cell type on days 1 and 7, we created a distribution of the percentage of active neurons that were present at baseline levels or by chance. Surprisingly, we found that only PV-IN and VIP-IN cell types had a percent of CS- and reward-responsive cells that were significantly greater than chance level on both days 1 and 7 (PV-IN CS: day 1: 15.26% ± 2.11%, day 7: 24.09% ± 2.98%; PV-IN reward: day 1: 20.17% ± 3.27%, day 7: 27.47% ± 3.66%; VIP-IN CS: day 1: 11.29% ± 3.23%, day 7: 16.59% ± 2.01%, VIP-IN reward: day 1: 18.65% ± 5.91%, day 7: 26.3% ± 6.04%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). PN responses to the CS were not different from the null distribution on both days 1 and 7 (day 1: 18.42% ± 1.05%, day 7: 16.41% ± 1.33%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); in contrast, PN responses to the reward were significantly higher on day 1 but significantly lower than the null distribution on day 7 (day 1: 23.95% ± 2.49%, day 7: 12.12% ± 0.95%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Lastly, SOM-INs showed significant responses to the CS and reward only on day 7 following associative learning, while on day 1, they demonstrated no response to the CS and a modest response to the reward (CS: day 1: 5.53% ± 2.7%, day 7: 13.56% ± 3.17%; Reward: day 1: 9% ± 3.66%, day 7: 12.15% ± 3.93%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Based on these findings, we decided to only examine the sessions where the percent of active cells were significantly greater than the null distribution in our subsequent analysis, as a nonsignificant percent of active cells during the stimulus period cannot be readily distinguished from nontask-related baseline noise.</p><p>We began our analysis on PV-INs and VIP-INs because they both showed significant responses to both the CS and reward on days 1 and 7. To understand how their representations of reward and reward-associated cues changed over the course of learning, we first analyzed the tuning of individual cells to unbiasedly identify their response properties. By quantifying the tuning of each cell’s average response during the CS and reward response periods (2.5-s window) using the nonparametric Spearman correlation <italic>ρ</italic> (see Methods), we observed a wide range of tuning coefficients to the CS and reward, with a small proportion that was strongly positively or negatively tuned to the CS or reward stimulus (tuning coefficient near –1 or 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), consistent with our earlier analyses demonstrating that neurons in M1 show activity associated with the CS or reward during the conditioning task. We next examined whether the tuning coefficient within each cell type changed after associative learning by calculating the change in tuning coefficients for each cell between days 1 and 7. Again, to validate our findings, we compared these values to a null distribution of Δ<italic>ρ</italic> values obtained by randomly sampling the two sessions (see Method details). The PV-IN population did not show any significant changes in either CS or reward tuning between days 1 and 7 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CS</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.049</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.046</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>reward</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.014</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.054</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>), indicating that neither CS- nor reward-related tuning became stronger after associative learning.

When we assessed population activity following the CS onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), it was apparent that a group of PV-INs and VIP-INs were responsive to CS on both days 1 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). Hence, by identifying and tracking the same neurons from days 1 to 7, we were able to ask if there was (1) an increase in the number of neurons being recruited as CS or reward responsive during associative learning or (2) a change in the trial-by-trial reliability of CS and reward responses. When we compared the mean percent of CS-responsive neurons on days 1 and 7, we found that the average percent of CS-responsive PV-INs during a trial increased significantly by day 7 (day 1: 15.26% ± 2.11%, day 7: 24.09% ± 2.98%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), while the percent of CS-responsive VIP-INs did not change (day 1: 11.29% ± 3.23%, day 7: 16.59% ± 2.01%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), demonstrating that more PV-INs became responsive to the CS after associative learning. We then assessed the reliability of the responses, defined as the percent of trials within a session where a neuron was responsive to the CS. This measure quantifies how consistently a neuron responded to the CS within a session. We first plotted the cumulative distribution function of reliabilities among all PV-INs and VIP-INs. We observed that PV-INs, as a population, were significantly more reliable in their CS responses than VIP-INs on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). When we sorted neurons based on their day 1 reliability values and followed them to day 7, we observed that many of the PV-INs that initially had Low Reliability to CS became more responsive on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>); therefore, we grouped neurons into ‘High Reliability’ if they were among the top 50th percentile, while neurons in the lower 50th percentile were deemed ‘Low Reliability’. We found that PV-INs that began as highly reliable maintained their reliability to the CS (day 1: 29.8% ± 1.51%, day 7: 33.87% ± 4.72%), while PV-INs that began as Low Reliability became significantly more reliable (8.47% ± 0.46%, day 7: 18.99% ± 3.76%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, the reliability of both High and Low VIP-INs did not change (High Reliability: day 1: 26.55% ± 2.62%, day 7: 25.93% ± 3.81%; Low Reliability: day 1: 6.32% ± 0.76%, day 7: 14.24% ± 2.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Lastly, we examined if the onset of neuronal activity after the CS changed after associative learning, and if any neurons that were previously responsive to the CS became responsive to the reward only. We did not observe a change in the onset of neuronal activity following CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see Methods). Furthermore, 97% of the CS-responsive PV-INs from day 1 still showed responsivity to CS on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Altogether, these results show that as a population, more PV-INs became responsive to the CS, and this is mainly due to Low Reliability PV-INs that became more reliable following associative learning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PV-IN and VIP-IN cue stimulus (CS)-related responses before and after associative learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trial structure.

In the first experiment, water-restricted PV-Cre mice were exposed to the same auditory tone used as the CS (1-s duration) but all water rewards were omitted (randomly varied ITI between 60 and 120 s; ~30 trials/session; 1 session/day for 7 days). We imaged PV-IN activity on both days 1 and 7 and assessed their population responses following the tone onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We first compared the mean percent of active cells during tone to a null distribution made by randomly sampling the session irrespective of the behavioral task (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Surprisingly, PV-INs did not show significant tone-responsive cells compared to the chance level on either day 1 or 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>); hence, the average percent of tone-responsive PV-INs per trial also did not increase from days 1 to 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Next, in a separate cohort of mice, we exposed water-restricted PV-Cre mice to tone, followed by a ‘nonpaired’ water reward that was given at randomly varied time intervals (40–80 s). Mice were also trained for ~30 trials/session (1 session/day for 7 days) with a randomly varied ITI between 15 and 25 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We found PV-INs were significantly responsive to the tone stimuli on day 1, similar to what we observed earlier in the CS–reward task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, by day 7, PV-INs no longer responded to the tone stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). We next examined if mice that received the tone stimulus with nonpaired water reward learned to associate the two after 7 days. We found the animals did not learn the association, as their conditioned response (tone-evoked anticipatory licking) did not increase at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). Unlike the mice that learned the association in the CS–reward task, we did not observe a change in the mean percent of tone-responsive PV-INs from days 1 to 7 in the nonpaired paradigm, and the reliability of Low Reliability PV-INs to tone also did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H, I</xref>). Together, these results suggest that PV-INs in M1 do not respond to auditory tone in general, but instead only respond to the tone when the animal actively associates it with reward. Moreover, the changes among PV-INs to the CS tone from days 1 to 7 are specific to associative learning.</p><p>We next assessed reward responses among PV-INs and VIP-INs in the same manner but now looked for responses within 2.5 s of the reward delivery time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A, B</xref>). We tracked the same neurons from days 1 to 7 and compared the mean percent of reward-responsive neurons. PV-INs and VIP-INs did not show a significant change in the percent of responsive cells per trial (PV-IN: day 1: 20.17% ± 3.27%, day 7: 27.47% ± 3.66%; VIP-IN: day 1: 18.65% ± 5.91%, day 7: 26.3% ± 6.04%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). When we examined the cumulative distribution of reliabilities for reward responses between the two cell types, VIP-INs as a population were significantly more reliable than PV-INs on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). By dividing the cells into High and Low Reliability groups, we found the High Reliability VIP-INs maintained their reliability (VIP-IN High Reliability: day 1: 38.79% ± 2.71%, day 7: 35.88% ± 4.32%), and the Low Reliability VIP-INs became significantly more reliable on day 7 (VIP-IN Low Reliability: day 1: 10.25% ± 1.67%, day 7: 24.06% ± 4.87%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>). In contrast, both High and Low Reliability PV-INs maintained their reliability to reward (High Reliability: day 1: 35.59% ± 2.81%, day 7: 41.94% ± 5.7%; Low Reliability: day 1: 10.58% ± 0.74%, day 7: 19.59% ± 3.08%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We also followed individual Low Reliability VIP-INs and calculated the change in reliability to reward (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) from days 1 to 7.

We also examined if the onset of neuronal activity after reward consumption changed after associative learning, and if neurons that were previously responsive to reward became responsive to the CS only. We did not observe a change in the onset of neuronal activity following reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, 95% of the VIP-INs from day 1 still showed responsivity to reward on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Lastly, to demonstrate that changes in VIP-INs’ representation of reward resulted from associative learning, we examined both PV-IN and VIP-IN responses to reward in mice that were exposed to the nonpaired behavioral paradigm (tone+ randomly timed water rewards; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Consistent to what we observed in the CS–reward paradigm, both PV-INs and VIP-INs consistently showed higher mean percent of active cells during reward (2.5 s from the first lick after reward delivery) compared to the chance level on both days 1 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2J–M</xref>). However, because these mice did not learn the association between the auditory tone and randomly delivered water reward, we did not see an increase in the reliability of the Low Reliability VIP-INs from days 1 to 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2O</xref>), or a change in the percent of responsive cells in either PV-INs or VIP-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2K–N</xref>). Altogether, we found that during associative learning, while the proportion of reward-responsive VIP-INs during a given trial did not change, a subset of VIP-INs that were largely unresponsive to reward on day 1 became more reliably responsive on day 7.</p><p>Although PV-INs and VIP-INs were the only cell types that were significantly responsive to both CS and reward on both days 1 and 7, PNs and SOM-INs also had significant responses to specific stimuli on certain days. While PNs did not show significant CS responses when compared to baseline, their reward responses on day 1 were significantly above the null distribution, and they became significantly lower than the null distribution on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result is in line with the change in tuning coefficient (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>), which showed a significant decrease in reward tuning between days 1 and 7 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>reward</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.141</mml:mn><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.067</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the cumulative distribution function of PN reliability also shifted significantly to lower reliabilities on day 7 compared to day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results indicate that PNs initially responded to novel reward; however, they habituated to the reward following associative learning.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pyramidal neuron (PN) and SOM-IN reliability is altered after associative learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, distribution of changes in PN Spearman correlation Δ<italic>ρ</italic> for reward.

Altogether, these results suggest that in naive mice, SOM-INs were unresponsive to the CS and modestly responsive to the novel reward; however, following associative learning, SOM-INs became more reliably responsive to both the CS and reward.</p><p>Lastly, reward consumption requires innate tongue movements during licking, and since microstimulation of M1 in mice has been shown to evoke tongue and jaw movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>), it is crucial to distinguish whether the observed CS and reward responses resulted from task-related stimuli or if the activity is simply associated with licking movements. We demonstrated earlier that head-fixed mice learned the CS–reward association by displaying the conditioned response (anticipatory licking) following the CS on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To address this potential confound, we identified all the self-initiated licking bouts during ITIs, when no reward was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first assessed all the significantly active cells in each cell type (identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) during the first lick bout of each ITI on days 1 and 7. We observed that in each cell type, the majority of the neurons were nonlick neurons on both days 1 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then tracked individual lick and nonlick neurons and examined if they shifted their responses after associative learning. We found that most of the neurons maintained the same responses, and nonlick neurons were still the majority in all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we examined whether the lick neurons also showed mixed responses to CS, reward, or CS+ reward. Indeed, lick neurons exhibited mixed responses to CS, reward, or CS+ reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then further divided them into three categories – ‘CS cells’, ‘reward cells’, and ‘CS+ reward cells’ and compared the percentage of neurons in each category between days 1 and 7; we did not observe a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Lastly, at the population level, we examined the response reliability index of all the active neurons during all ITI lick bouts and compared them to the response reliability index for the CS and reward. On both day 1 (when there was minimal anticipatory licking during the CS) and day 7 (when mice showed anticipatory licking), all cell types exhibited lower reliability index values for the ITI lick bouts compared to the CS and reward, indicating that the increase in task-related responses following water rewards was specific to the reward stimulus, and not licking movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–J</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the cell-type-specific modifications observed between days 1 and 7 were not caused by licking movements.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cell-type-specific cue and reward activity are not due to licking movements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the cued reward conditioning task (top) and the trial structure (bottom).

Recent studies have demonstrated reward-related activity in M1 using in vivo electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramakrishnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramkumar et al., 2016</xref>) and transcranial magnetic stimulation in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thabit et al., 2011</xref>). However, whether CS- and reward-associated signals are represented among different neuronal cell types within the microcircuit in M1 is still unclear. Using chronic two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, combined with transgenic mouse lines and viral strategies to target different neuronal cell types, we demonstrated that during a conditioning task, all major cell types in M1 responded to either the CS, the reward, or both. Most notably, each cell type underwent distinct modifications after association learning. By tracking the same population of neurons, we revealed that the CS-responding population increased among PV-INs and individual cells responded more reliably to the CS following associative learning. On the contrary, VIP-INs became more reliable in response to reward. When mice underwent control behavioral paradigms where tone was not paired with reward and no associative learning occurred, PV-INs and VIP-INs did not undergo these changes. Additionally, PNs had a drastically reduced response to reward, while SOM-INs became more reliable to both the CS and the reward. Our findings suggest that each cell type has a distinct role in processing information related to the cue–reward association in M1, and they may work together to provide the reinforcement signals in M1 that are important for motor skill learning.</p><p>Previous studies in trained rhesus monkeys performing a joystick center-out task have shown a widespread representation of reward anticipation and reward-related activity among cortical neurons in M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramakrishnan et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with earlier work, we also observed reward-related activity in all four major cell types in M1, even in naive mice on day 1 when they were first exposed to the CS and reward. It has been reported that in sensory cortices, repeated passive exposure to a sensory stimulus leads to a long-lasting reduction in PN responsivity, but when animals are engaged in learning, PNs maintain their responsivity to the repeated stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>). However, we found in M1, when water-restricted mice were engaged in a conditioning task to learn the association between the CS and water reward, PNs still showed a drastic habituation to the reward stimulus. A recent study that imaged neuronal activity in expert mice performing a head-fixed pellet reaching task demonstrated that L2/3 PNs in M1 are involved in encoding movement outcome (success vs. failure) but not the appetitive outcome (reward vs. no reward). However, the authors did not image the mice at the naive stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levy et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, one possibility is that L2/3 PNs in M1 encode reward signals during the naive stage, but after associative learning, they habituate and become unresponsive to the reward stimulus. In addition, in the sensory cortices, the flexibility to either respond to or ignore sensory stimuli is based on the stimulus’ behavioral relevance and is gated by local SOM-INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poort et al., 2021</xref>). In line with these findings, we found that SOM-INs became more reliably responsive to both the CS and the reward with associative learning. We also observed stimulus-specific increases in the reliability of PV-INs’ response to the CS and VIP-INs’ response to the reward after associative learning, and these changes to tone and reward were not observed in the absence of associative learning. When mice were exposed to tone alone, PV-INs did not show significant responses to tone on either day 1 or 7, while mice exposed to a nonpaired tone and reward task showed significant responses to tone on day 1, but not on day 7. This suggests that in M1, PV-INs only respond to behaviorally relevant cues such as those that predict reward. Finally, while VIP-INs remained responsive to reward in the nonpaired paradigm, VIP-INs did not show changes in reliability in the absence of associative learning. Together, our results suggest that different IN subtypes may have distinct roles in processing CS- and reward-related information in M1 during motivated associative learning.</p><p>One hypothesis is that PV-INs are recruited by the CS to control the behavioral responses (anticipatory licking) during reward anticipation since PV-INs are known to regulate PN firing through both feedforward and feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fishell and Rudy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu and Callaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Similar observations have been reported in the striatum, in which optogenetic activation or suppression of PV-INs during a similar conditioning task impaired anticipatory licking, demonstrating the importance of PV-INs in the expression of conditioned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, PV-INs in the basolateral amygdala, are also recruited during the CS and subsequently inhibited during the US in an auditory fear conditioning task. Optogenetic activation of PV-INs during the CS increased conditioned freezing behavior while PV-IN suppression reduced freezing, indicating bidirectional control of the conditioned response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). Our results demonstrate that in a naive animal, a subset of PV-INs in M1 are responsive to the CS only when rewards are present, and more PV-INs are recruited by the CS if the animal learns that the CS predicts reward. This suggests that in M1, PV-IN responses to the CS are not purely sensory, but rather, they may play an important role in controlling the behavioral responses to the CS.</p><p>VIP-INs, on the other hand, were significantly less reliable in responding to the CS compared to PV-INs, and their responses to the CS remained low. However, VIP-INs’ responses to the reward were more reliable than those of PV-INs, and they became more closely tuned and reliably responsive to the reward with learning. Due to the disinhibitory position of VIP-INs in the microcircuit, activation of VIP-INs can lead to widespread increases in local excitability and contribute to regulating cortical gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, a growing body of evidence suggests a general principle across brain regions, in which VIP-INs receive long-range inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gasselin et al., 2021</xref>), respond to reinforcement signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), and play an important role in goal-oriented learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turi et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that during CS–reward conditioning, PV-INs in M1 encode the CS association, and may regulate local circuit activity related to reward anticipation, whereas VIP-INs act as a context-dependent switch following the reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turi et al., 2019</xref>) to instruct and disinhibit local PNs to enable learning-induced plastic changes critical for the acquisition of new movements. An interesting point to note is that since PV-INs are only responsive to tone when it is paired with reward, and neither PV-INs nor VIP-INs undergo plastic changes in the absence of associative learning, M1 is unlikely to be a primary site for learning reward predictions. We hypothesize that other brain regions are responsible for learning relevant CS–reward associations while filtering out behaviorally irrelevant stimuli, and these regions subsequently send long-range inputs to M1 to instruct motor responses to the CS and the reward. In summary, this study provides insight on how different IN subtypes in M1 integrate incoming inputs from various brain regions and orchestrate local circuit plasticity. Future work will be important to identify the origin of these putative long-range inputs to different cell types in M1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Experimental mice were group housed in plastic cages with food and water ad libitum in a room with a reversed light cycle (12–12 hr).

Neurons were defined as CS or reward responsive on a trial-by-trial basis if they exceeded 1 <italic>Z</italic>-score (excitation threshold used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2015</xref>) for at least five consecutive frames within 2.5 s of the CS onset or 2.5 s of the reward delivery time, respectively. This was assessed for each trial with at least three lick responses within 2.5 s of the reward delivery time. We then took the median of the percent of responsive neurons across all trials in a session from one mouse, and the mean across mice. In the nonpaired experiments, since the reward was not preceded by a CS, the mice required variable amounts of time to notice the water reward. Therefore, in the nonpaired experiments, we calculated reward responses within 2.5 s from the onset of the first lick following the water delivery. In the case that no licks were recorded before the subsequent tone, the trial was not included in the reward analysis.</p><p>We used a Monte-Carlo approach to validate the percent of CS- and reward-responsive neurons. The mean percentage of CS- and reward-responsive neurons observed were compared to a null distribution made for each cell type on each day. We randomly sampled mice with replacement, then sampled the entire session, and then calculated the percentage of active cells (exceeding 1 <italic>Z</italic>-score for at least five consecutive frames) during a randomly chosen 2.5-s window. For each mouse, the number of samples was equal to the number of included trials (i.e., number of trials with at least three lick responses within 2.5 s of reward delivery). We then took the median across the random samples and then took the mean across mice to obtain a mean percentage of responsive neurons during a randomly chosen time window. This was repeated 1000 times to generate a null distribution of mean percentage of active neurons. To assess whether the observed percentage of CS- and reward-responsive neurons was significantly different from the null distribution, the observed value was compared to the tails of the null distribution. This was done for each cell type on both days 1 and 7. We considered the CS or reward responses to be statistically significant at the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf58"><mml:mi>*</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> level if they fell into the 5 or 1% tails of this distribution, respectively, and *** if there was no overlap with the distribution. Since this approach tests the null hypothesis that the observed neuronal responses are due to chance (in this case, baseline activity/noise), only cell types with a significantly higher percentage of responsive neurons for a given session were analyzed further.</p><p>The CS/reward reliability index was defined as the percentage of trials within a session where the neuron was CS/reward responsive. The reliability cumulative distribution was made by pooling the day 1 index values of all the neurons from a neuronal cell type (across mice). If a neuron’s day 1 index value was lower or equal to the index value at the 50th percentile of the cumulative distribution (excluding nonresponsive neurons with a reliability of 0) for that cell type, it was categorized into the Low Reliability group. If a neuron’s day 1 index value exceeded the 50th percentile value, it was categorized into the High Reliability group. To assess changes in reliability at the population level, we took the mean reliability within each group on days 1 and 7. To assess changes in reliability among individual Low Reliability neurons, we used a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> measure where, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>.

For the onset time of reward-related neuronal activity, the time from the first lick (after reward delivery) to the time of the first Ca<sup>2+</sup> event (fifth frame above threshold) within the reward response period was used. The latency for each cell was first calculated by taking the mean across all active trials for a single cell, then the median of all cells within a mouse was calculated. Only cells that were tracked between days were included.</p><p>To determine the proportion of PV-INs that responded to the CS on days 1 and 7, we found the overall proportion of cells that responded to the CS out of total active cells on both days 1 and 7. To calculate the percentage of PV-INs that maintained CS responses across days, we found the proportion of day 7 cells that also had CS responses on day 1. We also found the proportion of day 1 cells with CS responses, that either maintained CS responses on day 7, became CS unresponsive but reward responsive, or became unresponsive to both CS and reward. The same analysis was performed on VIP-IN reward responses. Only active cells that were tracked from days 1 to 7 were included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Licking-related analysis</title><p>ITI lick bouts were defined as self-initiated licking events that occurred at least 20 s after the preceding reward delivery time (trial end) and more than 2.5 s prior to the subsequent CS onset (trial start). If individual licks were separated by 3 s or more, they were considered to be a new lick bout. To remain consistent with CS and reward analyses, only the first 2.5 s of a lick bout were analyzed for neural responses. ITI lick bout reliability indices were calculated as described above.</p><p>To determine lick cells, we found the first ITI lick bout in each ITI and calculated the mean <italic>Z</italic>-scored Δ<italic>F</italic> during the first 2.5 s of the lick bout. We then created a matrix of concatenated ITIs from the same session and randomly sampled the concatenated ITIs, and calculated the mean <italic>Z</italic>-scored Δ<italic>F</italic>, matching the duration and number of ITI lick bouts. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean <italic>Z</italic>-scored Δ<italic>F</italic> during ITI lick bouts and during the random samples. Cells with significantly higher Δ<italic>F</italic> during lick bouts were considered to be lick cells. We performed this analysis on days 1 and 7 and tracked individual neurons to identify changes in selectivity on a cell-by-cell basis. To determine if cells have mixed selectivity, we performed the same analysis using the CS and reward response periods (2.5 s from onset) and compared this activity to an equal number of random samples using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis for tuning coefficients was performed in Python and in R. All other statistical analyses were performed in Matlab using the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in anticipatory lick rate on days 1 and 7. One-way ANOVA was used to test for differences in lick rate during ITI, CS, and reward. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the percent of active cells across cell types on a single day. Monte-Carlo (as described above) was used to test for significant percent of CS- and reward-responsive neurons, and for changes in tuning properties. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to test for differences in the percentage of responsive cells and reliability index on days 1 and 7, and for differences in neuron reliability between ITI lick bouts, CS, and reward. Paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine mixed selectivity as described above. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to compare response reliability cumulative distributions and ∆reliability distributions. All values were reported as the mean and standard error of the mean unless otherwise specified. Power analysis was not performed to predetermine the sample size, and the experiments were not blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis and code availability</title><p>Tuning coefficient calculation and statistical tests were performed using Python 3.8 with the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, h5py, and SQLAlchemy.

primary motor cortex of mice during a classical conditional task, in which a tone is paired with a water reward. They found that distinct types of neurons respond differently to the auditory cue or the reward, and the responses evolve differentially as learning proceeds. This work reveals an interesting role of the motor cortex beyond its well-recognized function in motor control and suggests distinct functions of pyramidal neurons as well as various interneurons in reinforcement learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72549.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jerry L</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05qwgg493</institution-id><institution>Boston University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Hyung-Bae</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.08.08.455571">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.08.455571v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jerry L Chen (Reviewer #1); Hyung-Bae Kwon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers think that additional control experiments are needed for the revision. In addition, additional data analysis and clarification are needed to strengthen the paper. The following are essential revisions:</p><p>1. To address the question of whether changes are specifically associated with learning, a critical control experiment is missing. The behavioral study lacks a non-paired control – it would be more compelling if there was a CS of the same modality that was not paired with the US so we can be sure that the effects are not cue-specific but specific to conditioning. Then those cues would need to be counterbalanced across animals. This would be important for us to conclude the neural effects reflect associative learning vs some other impact of the cue over time.</p><p>2. Please examine the motor-related activity in the data set and address the following questions raised by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2, (a) As a control, can you quantify the number of licking-related neurons across cell types and confirm that they do not change with learning? (b) Are there neurons that show mixed responses to cue and licking? Do those responses change at all during learning? (c) Are there neurons show mixed responses to licking and reward? Do those responses change at all during learning?</p><p>3. The 2.5s period chosen for analysis covers both tone presentation and delay. Will the conclusions in Figure 2E-H change if the analysis is restricted to the 1s of tone presentation? In addition, it seems better to use the actual duration of reward presentation (see Q2) for analysis. As the statistical analysis is done by random shuffling, there seems no need to match the period for tone and reward analyses.</p><p>4. In Activity Analysis and Tuning Coefficients Calculation, the authors performed a resampling of mice with replacement, and the size of the random sample equals that of the original set of mice. Please clarify why this is done this way. Can the authors simply take all mice into analysis?</p><p>5. Both Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3 pointed out the importance of plotting calcium signals over days without resorting. The authors conclude that &quot;PV-INs that began as highly reliable maintained their reliability to the CS, …, while PV-INs that began as low reliability became significantly more reliable.&quot; However, Figure 4F only shows how the percentage of neurons in the high- or low-reliability category changes overtraining. To draw this conclusion, the authors need to track individual neurons and compare the same neuron's reliability on d1 and d7.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would encourage the authors to examine the motor-related activity in their data set, to help shed light on the following questions. Do the cue and reward related changes really reflect local circuit changes as the authors seem to suggest? Or could they potentially reflect changes outside of M1 that are then inherited and readout by M1 cell type? If local circuit changes are occur, one might expect to see changes in the conjunctive responses of cue, reward, and motor activity within individual cells. Changes in network activity between cue, reward, and motor cells may also be observed. It should be possible and worth examining these relationships to tease apart potential mechanisms and impact of non-motor changes in M1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is helpful to provide further details about the genetic background of the transgenic animals. Are they homozygous or heterozygous? What genetic background are they maintained in? Also, it would be helpful to indicate the number of neurons imaged per mouse.</p><p>2. A question about the behavioral setup. How long is the water reward presented? How many licks does it take the mouse to consume the 10 ul water reward? It seems from Figure 1B that most licks occur when water is no longer available. Also, the example in Figure 2C suggests that post-cue licking is far fewer on d7 than on d1, suggesting that the mouse has learned to inhibit non-rewarded licking. This seems not to agree with Figure 1C.</p><p>3. As imaging is conducted in M1, how is the response of the cells related to licking? Can the authors make a licking-triggered average of Ca traces for comparison?</p><p>4. In Figure 2B: is the scale bar 10% or 10, i.e., 1000%? Many transients show a very slow onset, which is not consistent with the rapid rising phase of GCaMP6f signals as shown in many previous publications. Also, previous publications show that PV and SOM interneurons have very synchronized activity in mPFC (Pinto and Dan, 2015 Neuron) and secondary motor cortex (Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2019 Cell Report). Is it true in M1? Can the authors give some examples of Ca traces of each type of the interneurons? If Ca transients in M1 interneurons exhibit different kinetics from those in pyramidal neurons, how would that affect the choice of analysis criteria?</p><p>5. The 2.5s period chosen for analysis covers both tone presentation and delay. Will the conclusions in Figure 2E-H change if the analysis is restricted to the 1s of tone presentation? In addition, it seems better to use the actual duration of reward presentation (see Q2) for analysis. As the statistical analysis is done by random shuffling, there seems no need to match the period for tone and reward analyses.</p><p>6. In Activity Analysis and Tuning Coefficients Calculation, the authors performed a resampling of mice with replacement, and the size of the random sample equals that of the original set of mice. What is the reason to do this? Can the authors simply take all mice into analysis?</p><p>7. Figure 3A-B: a little clarification is needed. (1) Is each trace a single trial or the average over trials? (2) What does it mean that &quot;each trace is from the same neuron on d7?&quot; Are the five traces from one neuron, or five neurons? If they are from five neurons, are these the same five neurons in A and B? (3) Why does the color of a single trace change with time?</p><p>8. The authors conclude that &quot;PV-INs that began as highly reliable maintained their reliability to the CS, …, while PV-INs that began as low reliability became significantly more reliable.&quot; However, Figure 4F only shows how the percentage of neurons in the high- or low-reliability category changes over training. The authors need to track individual neurons and compare the same neuron's reliability on d1 and d7 to draw this conclusion. The same issue applies to the analysis of all cell types.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First of all, the work is great. Analyzing calcium activity from each interneuron cell type is quite difficult, but authors elegantly performed the experiments. I wonder whether you can plot calcium signals over days (day 1 to day 7) without resorting. I understand it is very difficult, but if you have a good imaging quality enough to trace calcium activity from the same cells over several days, it would be nicer to show. Another concern is the lack of control experiments that show no such changes presented in training groups. Otherwise, it is quite good.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72549.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers think that additional control experiments are needed for the revision. In addition, additional data analysis and clarification are needed to strengthen the paper. The following are essential revisions:</p><p>1. To address the question of whether changes are specifically associated with learning, a critical control experiment is missing. The behavioral study lacks a non-paired control – it would be more compelling if there was a CS of the same modality that was not paired with the US so we can be sure that the effects are not cue-specific but specific to conditioning. Then those cues would need to be counterbalanced across animals. This would be important for us to conclude the neural effects reflect associative learning vs some other impact of the cue over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this control experiment. To properly address this, we conducted 3 sets of experiments using PV-Cre and VIP-Cre mice. In the first experiment, we exposed PV-Cre mice to the same auditory tone used as the CS but we omitted all water rewards, and recorded the response of PV-INs to tone on both Day 1 and Day 7 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A). Additionally, in separate cohorts of animals, we exposed PV-Cre and VIP-Cre mice to tone but with non-paired water rewards (given at randomly varied time intervals) and recorded the responses from PV-INs and VIP-INs on both Day 1 and Day 7 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1D). In all three experiments, tone was presented at the same frequency and duration as previous CS-reward experiments, and the number of trials was also equivalent.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that when mice were not given water rewards, PV-INs did not respond to the tone stimulus on either Day 1 or Day 7, as the mean percent of active cells during the tone response period was not significantly different from the null distribution generated by randomly sampling the session (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B). In comparison, when we examined mice that were exposed to the tone stimulus with non-paired water rewards, we found that PVINs were significantly responsive to the tone stimulus on Day 1, similar to what we observed in Figure 2. Interestingly, by Day 7, PV-INs no longer responded to the tone stimulus (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1G). We next examined if the mice that received the tone stimulus with nonpaired water reward learned to associate the tone with the reward after 7 days. We found the animals did not learn the association, as their conditioned response (anticipatory licking) did not increase at Day 7 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1E). Together, in the first set of experiments where reward was omitted, we demonstrated that PV-INs did not respond to the tone stimulus on either day in the absence of reward. In the second set of experiments, where the tone was not paired with reward and the mice did not learn the CS-reward association, PV-INs were initially responsive to the tone on day 1, but by day 7, they no longer responded. These experiments suggest that PV-INs in M1 do not respond to auditory tone in general, but instead only respond to the tone when the animal is actively associating it with reward. In addition, unlike the mice that learned the association, we did not observe a change in the mean percent of tone-responsive PV-INs from Day 1 to Day 7 in the non-paired mice, and ‘Low Reliability’ PVINs did not show a change in tone reliability (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1H-I). These results further demonstrate that the changes among PV-INs to the CS tone were specific to associative learning.</p><p>Lastly, in Figure 5, we showed that after associative learning, the reward response reliability of ‘Low Reliability’ VIP-INs increased; therefore, we performed an additional control experiment examining VIP-IN responses to reward in the non-paired paradigm. We found that although VIPcre mice did not learn to associate the tone with the random water rewards (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1E), VIP-INs consistently responded to rewards (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1M). However, without learning the association, the reward response reliability of ‘Low Reliability’ VIP-INs did not change from Day 1 to Day 7 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1O).</p><p>In conclusion, these control experiments further support our findings that different cell types in M1 undergo cell-type specific modifications after associative learning, in which PV-INs’ responses became more reliable to the cue stimulus, while VIP-INs’ responses became more reliable to the reward. We have included these results in the manuscript (Line 235 – 260, 279 – 290).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please examine the motor-related activity in the data set and address the following questions raised by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2, (a) As a control, can you quantify the number of licking-related neurons across cell types and confirm that they do not change with learning? (b) Are there neurons that show mixed responses to cue and licking? Do those responses change at all during learning? (c) Are there neurons show mixed responses to licking and reward? Do those responses change at all during learning?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions. To identify licking-related neurons, we took all the active cells within a session and examined their activity during the first lick bout of each ITI. We then took the mean z-score during the lick bouts and compared it to the mean z-score of an equal number of randomly sampled bouts (with equal duration). If the mean lick bout z-score was significantly higher than the mean random bout z-score, we considered the cell to be a lick neuron. We found that on both Day 1 and Day 7, the majority of neurons (from all cell types) were non-lick neurons (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1A). We also tracked individual neurons and performed the same analysis for both Day 1 and Day 7 and examined whether lick and nonlick neurons shift their responses after associative learning. We found that the majority of cells maintained the same responses, and non-lick cells were still the largest group in all cell types (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Next, we examined whether these lick neurons also showed mixed responses to CS and reward on Day 1 and Day 7. Indeed, these lick neurons exhibited mixed responses to CS, reward, or CS + reward (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1C). We then divided the lick neurons into three categories – ‘CS cells’, ‘reward cells’, and ‘CS + reward cells’. When we compared the percentage of neurons in each category between Day 1 and Day 7, we did not observe a significant difference (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1D). Together, our analyses showed that there were not many lick neurons (from all cell types) present in M1, and the percentage of lick and non-lick neurons did not change after associative learning. This is consistent with previous optical and electrical micro-stimulation studies that showed tongue, jaw, and lip are more reliably evoked in the Anterior-Lateral-Motor area (ALM) (PMID: 20376005, 2036613), rather than M1. Furthermore, we found that while these lick neurons also exhibit mixed responses to CS, reward, or CS + reward, the percentage of these mixed response cells did not change after associative learning. Therefore, since the lick cells were stable from Day 1 to Day 7, it is unlikely that they impacted the learning related changes. We have included these results in Figure 7 —figure supplement 1 and Line 322 – 331.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The 2.5s period chosen for analysis covers both tone presentation and delay. Will the conclusions in Figure 2E-H change if the analysis is restricted to the 1s of tone presentation? In addition, it seems better to use the actual duration of reward presentation (see Q2) for analysis. As the statistical analysis is done by random shuffling, there seems no need to match the period for tone and reward analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we calculated the percent of CS-responsive neurons for each cell type on Day 1 and Day 7 using a 1s time window following CS presentation. Surprisingly, we found the percentage of CS-responsive neurons decreased significantly compared to the 2.5s window in all cell types, and the percentages were all around 5% of total active neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). One plausible explanation is that M1 is not a region for direct sensory input related to auditory tone, water, or reward; hence, neuronal responses in M1 could be slightly delayed. This is supported by our no-reward control experiment, in which PV-INs did not respond to auditory tone when no water rewards were given (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B). In combination with the slow kinetics of calcium indicator compared to electrophysiology recording, we believe this explains why a 1s window is not sufficient to capture CS or reward-related activity in M1. Since all cell types only have around 5% of CS-responsive cells, we do not think using the 1-sec time window truly represents the CS responses in M1.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(A) Comparing the percent of CS-responsive cells calculated with a 2. 5s or a 1.0s response window after CS onset. For all cell types, the percent of CS-responsive cells was greatly reduced when using a 1.0s response window for analysis compared to a 2.5s window. Most cell-types were reduced to about 5% of responsive cells.

For each cell type, the null distribution estimates the percent of cells active at baseline using sampling with replacement (top row) and without replacement (bottom row) for Day 1 and Day 7. With replacement: mice were re-sampled with replacement, the session was randomly sampled, and the mean percent of active cells was calculated; this was repeated 1000 times. Without replacement: all mice were sampled once, the session was randomly sampled, and the mean percent of active cells was calculated; this was repeated 1000 times. As random sampling of mice with replacement allows for a more unbiased estimate of between animal variability, the distribution created without replacement is much narrower with a smaller range and standard deviation. PN: n = 1029 cells from 6 mice. PV-IN: n = 316 cells from 6 mice. VIP-IN: n = 407 cells from 4 mice. SOM-IN: n = 189 cells from 7.

However, we noticed that sometimes the water droplet disperses to the sides of the lick port, therefore, it is hard to determine how many licks it will take the mouse to finish the water. Since it varies trial-to-trial, it is difficult to determine the exact reward duration for each trial. The example trace in Figure 2C only reflects that particular trial because in other licking examples in Figure 4B and 5B, mice all showed sustained licking after water delivery on Day 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Activity Analysis and Tuning Coefficients Calculation, the authors performed a resampling of mice with replacement, and the size of the random sample equals that of the original set of mice. Please clarify why this is done this way. Can the authors simply take all mice into analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>In our understanding, it is typical to perform the bootstrap analysis with random sample replacement. Based on two classic papers (Efron, <italic>The Annals of Statistics</italic>, 1979; Sitter, <italic>Comparing three bootstrap methods for survey data</italic>, 1992), the authors’ described the advantage of sampling with replacement to obtain a more accurate and unbiased estimate of variance.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we repeated the analysis in Figure 3 without sample replacement for all cell types. Interestingly, we noticed that after 1,000 repetitions, the distributions using ‘without replacement’ were much narrower compared to ‘with replacement’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). This is in line with the ‘without replacement’ method providing an inherently biased estimate of variance that does not capture the true distribution of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Both Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3 pointed out the importance of plotting calcium signals over days without resorting. The authors conclude that &quot;PV-INs that began as highly reliable maintained their reliability to the CS, …, while PV-INs that began as low reliability became significantly more reliable.&quot; However, Figure 4F only shows how the percentage of neurons in the high- or low-reliability category changes overtraining. To draw this conclusion, the authors need to track individual neurons and compare the same neuron's reliability on d1 and d7.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestion. We performed the suggested analysis focusing on CS-responsive PV-INs and reward-responsive VIP-INs as these two populations showed an increase in reliability after associative learning (Figure 4F and 5F).</p><p>We were able to track each neuron and compare the same neuron’s reliability between Day 1 and Day 7. We first plotted an example mouse to show their reliability increases from Day 1 to Day 7. To do this, we began by sorting the neurons based on their Day 1 reliability and showed each individual neuron’s response to every trial within the session. We then tracked the same neuron to Day 7 and again showed each neuron’s response to every trial while maintaining the same order as Day 1 (without re-sorting on Day 7). We can see that many of the low reliability neurons on Day 1 had more active trials on Day 7 (Figure 4H and 5H).</p><p>To quantify that the increase in reliability of individual neurons is significant, we isolated the ‘Low Reliability’ neurons on Day 1 and calculated the change in reliability (Δreliability) for each individual neuron between Day 1 and Day 7. As a control, we randomly sampled the Day 7 session irrespective of the behavioural task and calculated a reliability value. We then subtracted that value from the actual Day 1 reliability value to generate a random Δreliability value for each neuron. By comparing the two distributions, we found the Δreliability from Day 1 to Day 7 in both PV-INs’ responses to CS and VIP-INs’ responses to reward were significantly greater than the random Δreliability in control (Figure 4I and 5I). Together, by tracking the same neurons from Day 1 to Day 7, we showed that the increase in reliability also occurs at the individual neuron level. We have included these results in the manuscript (Line 218 – 234, 271 – 278).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would encourage the authors to examine the motor-related activity in their data set, to help shed light on the following questions. Do the cue and reward related changes really reflect local circuit changes as the authors seem to suggest? Or could they potentially reflect changes outside of M1 that are then inherited and readout by M1 cell type? If local circuit changes are occur, one might expect to see changes in the conjunctive responses of cue, reward, and motor activity within individual cells. Changes in network activity between cue, reward, and motor cells may also be observed. It should be possible and worth examining these relationships to tease apart potential mechanisms and impact of non-motor changes in M1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important issue. Please find a detailed response above in ‘Essential Revision #2’. In brief, we identified lick cells in all the cell types and further examined their responses to CS, reward, or CS + reward (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). We found the majority of active neurons (in all cell types) were non-lick neurons, and the percentage remained stable from Day 1 to Day 7. Moreover, among the lick cells that showed responses to CS, reward, or CS + reward, the percentage of cells in each category also did not change significantly after associative learning. Our working hypothesis is that the changes in CS and reward representations observed in M1 are happening outside of M1, and long-range inputs from other brain regions to a specific cell type in M1 (CS for PV-INs or reward for VIP-INs) are increased and/or strengthened after associative learning. This hypothesis is supported by our control experiments, in which in the no-reward paradigm, PV-INs in M1 did not respond to auditory tone when no water rewards were given. Also, while VIP-INs consistently responded to water rewards on both day 1 and day 7 in the non-paired behavioral paradigm, their reliability did not change when the animals did not learn the association. Future work will involve identifying the brain regions that provide these specific inputs to M1; however, we think that is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We have included a brief discussion of our working hypothesis in the Discussion section (Line 412 – 417).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The figure legends indicate the total number of ROIs across all mice for each experimental condition, and the table provides further details including the number of active cells on day 1 (irrespective of the behavioral task), and the number of active cells tracked from day 1 to day 7 from each individual mouse for all experimental conditions used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A question about the behavioral setup. How long is the water reward presented? How many licks does it take the mouse to consume the 10 ul water reward? It seems from Figure 1B that most licks occur when water is no longer available. Also, the example in Figure 2C suggests that post-cue licking is far fewer on d7 than on d1, suggesting that the mouse has learned to inhibit non-rewarded licking. This seems not to agree with Figure 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. The 10µL water reward was delivered all at once. However, we noticed that sometimes the water droplet gets dispersed to the sides of the lick port, and the mouse continues to lick although no additional water was delivered. Hence, it is hard to determine how many licks it takes for the mouse to finish the water. Since it varies trialto-trial, it is difficult to determine the exact reward duration for each trial. The example in Figure 2C only reflects that particular trial because in other licking examples provided in Figure 1C, 4B, 5B, mice all showed continuous licking after water delivery on Day 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As imaging is conducted in M1, how is the response of the cells related to licking? Can the authors make a licking-triggered average of Ca traces for comparison?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important issue. Please find a detailed response above in ‘Essential Revision #2’. In brief, we did not find many lick neurons (from all cell types) present in M1, and the percentage of lick and non-lick neurons did not change after associative learning. This is consistent with previous optical and electrical micro-stimulation studies that showed tongue, jaw, and lip are more reliably evoked in the Anterior-Lateral-Motor area (ALM) (PMID: 20376005, 2036613), rather than M1.

In Figure 2B: is the scale bar 10% or 10, i.e., 1000%? Many transients show a very slow onset, which is not consistent with the rapid rising phase of GCaMP6f signals as shown in many previous publications. Also, previous publications show that PV and SOM interneurons have very synchronized activity in mPFC (Pinto and Dan, 2015 Neuron) and secondary motor cortex (Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2019 Cell Report). Is it true in M1? Can the authors give some examples of Ca traces of each type of the interneurons? If Ca transients in M1 interneurons exhibit different kinetics from those in pyramidal neurons, how would that affect the choice of analysis criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. The ‘10’ in Figure 2B is the z-score value, which means 10 standard deviations from the mean of the neuron’s entire trace.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have provided ca<sup>2+</sup> traces of each cell type (PN, PV-INs, VIP-INs, SOM-INs). We showed 5 cells during one lick bout and during one trial on Day 1. We then tracked the same cells to Day 7 and showed the ca<sup>2+</sup> trace of the same neurons during one trial on Day 7. In general, we did not notice much difference in the kinetics between cell types during ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). We also assessed published work from other groups using GCaMP6f for in vivo Ca imaging in inhibitory neurons to further verify the kinetics we observed. When we compared the kinetics of our calcium traces from PN, PV-IN, VIP-IN and SOM-IN to those featured in Pinto and Dan, <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2015 (PMID: 26143660), Puscian et al., <italic>Cell Reports</italic>, 2020 (PMID: 32726633) and Poort et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2021 (PMID: 34906356), we did not observe a notable difference. In addition, since we utilized a threshold to determine active events, the rise kinetics should not influence the quantification of active events. We employed a similar active event criterion as Kato et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2015 (PMID: 26586181), where they used GCaMP6s for ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in PV-INs and SOM-INs in the auditory cortex and a threshold of over 1.0 z-score for 3 consecutive frames to identify active events. In our paper, we used GCaMP6f (which has faster kinetics than GCaMP6s), and we used a longer criterion for active events (above 1.0 z-score for 5 consecutive frames) than theirs. Hence, we do not believe that the kinetics of different neuron types will affect our analyses.</p><p>In regard to synchrony, we generated similar visualization plots as Pinto and Dan, 2015 and Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2019 following the reviewer’s question. In Pinto and Dan, 2015, the authors show ca<sup>2+</sup> traces from different PV-IN and SOM-IN neurons in mPFC are highly correlated. We qualitatively compared these to our own individual traces (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1) and did not observe synchrony. In Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2019, the authors used heatmaps to visualize PV-IN population activity in M2 over extended periods of time. They found synchrony within two PV-IN subpopulations – one group that was highly active when the mouse was running, and another group that was highly active during stationary periods. Therefore, we performed a similar analysis and used heatmaps to visualize the activity of all PV-Ins within each mouse over 1,000s periods (similar time course as in Garcia-JuncoClemente et al.,); however, we did not observe any synchrony. We also did not observe any synchrony in SOM-INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A-B</xref>). It is possible that synchrony is specific to certain brain regions, specific tasks and/or specific behavioural states.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>(A-B) Examining if PV-INs or SOM-INs in M1 showed synchronized activity.

We included calcium traces from 5 example neurons for each cell type on Day 1 during one lick bout and during one trial. We then showed the same neurons again on Day 7 during another trial (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). However, the limitation of showing calcium traces is that we can only visualize one trial at a time. In order to demonstrate that PV-INs and VIP-INs increase their response reliability to CS and reward, respectively, we decided to show every single trial from all neurons from one example mouse. To do that, we first sorted the neurons (of one mouse) based on their Day 1 reliability, and we tracked the same neurons to Day 7 without re-sorting and showed whether each trial was active or not (Figure 4H and 5H).

In brief, we altered the reward contingencies in the behavioral task and performed control experiments in three separate cohorts of mice. First, we found that tone presentations in the absence of water rewards did not activate PV-INs in M1, as the percent of active PV-INs during the tone response period was not different from that at baseline. In another cohort of mice, we presented the tone with non-paired, randomly-timed water rewards. Intriguingly, PVINs were significantly responsive to the tone on Day 1 but not Day 7, suggesting PV-INs in M1 do not have pure sensory responses to the tone, but instead, they respond to reward-predicting cues. In contrast, VIP-INs remained significantly responsive to randomly timed water rewards, but the response reliability of the VIP-INs in the ‘Low Reliability’ to reward group did not change from Day 1 to Day 7. Together, our results suggest that the increase in reliability in PV-INs to the CS and VIP-INs to reward are specific to associative learning.</p></body></sub-article></article>
