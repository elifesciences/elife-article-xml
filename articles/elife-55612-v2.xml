During <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic cellularization, heterochromatin rapidly appears over repetitive sequences, but the molecular details of how heterochromatin is established are poorly understood. Here, we map the genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin in individual embryos of <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic> at precisely staged developmental time points. We find that canonical H3K9me3 enrichment is established prior to cellularization and matures into stable and broad heterochromatin domains through development. Intriguingly, initial nucleation sites of H3K9me3 enrichment appear as early as embryonic stage 3 over transposable elements (TEs) and progressively broaden, consistent with spreading to neighboring nucleosomes. The earliest nucleation sites are limited to specific regions of a small number of recently active retrotransposon families and often appear over promoter and 5’ regions of LTR retrotransposons, while late nucleation sites develop broadly across the entirety of most TEs. Interestingly, early nucleating TEs are strongly associated with abundant maternal piRNAs and show early zygotic transcription. These results support a model of piRNA-associated co-transcriptional silencing while also suggesting additional mechanisms for site-restricted H3K9me3 nucleation at TEs in pre-cellular <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>piRNA</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>satellite DNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56AG057029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachtrog</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachtrog</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM076007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachtrog</surname><given-names>Doris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heterochromatin is established at nucleation sites associated with open chromatin and RNA transcripts and matures into stable domains if they are found near transposable elements targeted by maternally deposited piRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The separation of eukaryotic genomes into transcriptionally active euchromatin and silenced heterochromatin is a fundamental aspect of eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allshire and Madhani, 2018</xref>). Heterochromatin is the gene-poor, transposon-rich, late-replicating, and tightly packaged chromatin compartment that was first cytologically defined over 90 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heitz, 1928</xref>), in contrast to euchromatin, the gene-rich, lightly packed form of chromatin. These domains show characteristic distributions across eukaryotic genomes and are distinguished by unique sets of histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peng and Karpen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>). Heterochromatin is found predominately at repetitive sequences, which mainly correspond to pericentromeres, the dot and the Y chromosome in flies, and is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Heterochromatin formation, and the boundary between heterochromatic and euchromatic domains is established during early development. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, constitutive heterochromatin is not observed cytologically in the initial zygote, but emerges during blastoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vlassova et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1998</xref>) (developmental stage 4; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Chromatin assembly during this period is prior to any widespread zygotic transcription and dependent on maternally loaded RNA and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elgin and Reuter, 2013</xref>). Analysis of an inducible reporter gene has found that silencing occurs at the onset of gastrulation (end of stage 6), about 1 hr after heterochromatin is visible cytologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1998</xref>). The extent of silencing increases as embryonic development progresses, and by stage 15 (dorsal closure, between 11.5 and 13 hr of development), silencing patterns reminiscent of those for third-instar larvae are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1998</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The repeat-rich genome of <italic>Drosophila miranda</italic> as a model to characterize heterochromatin establishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of embryonic development.

H3K9me3 is deposited by a conserved class of histone methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>) and provides a high-affinity binding site for HP1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lachner et al., 2001</xref>). HP1 proteins can oligomerize, resulting in local chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hiragami-Hamada et al., 2016</xref>), and help establish heterochromatin domains possibly via phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strom et al., 2017</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erdel et al., 2020</xref>). HP1 proteins can also recruit additional histone methyltransferases, thereby enabling spreading of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canzio et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, H3K9me3 deposition is a crucial step in the formation of heterochromatin and the suppression of repetitive sequences, but the molecular mechanisms of H3K9me3 targeting and recruitment are not fully understood.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that small RNA-mediated silencing pathways can initiate the formation of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allshire and Madhani, 2018</xref>). This was first identified in fission yeast, where mutations in components of the RNAi pathway showed disrupted heterochromatin silencing in centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Volpe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies revealed that siRNAs with sequence homology to repeats bind to their nascent transcripts to direct the recruitment of chromatin-associated silencing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Djupedal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bühler et al., 2006</xref>). In flies and mammals, a different class of small RNAs, PIWI-associated small RNAs (piRNAs; 23-29nt in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), are involved in the silencing of transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olovnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ninova et al., 2019</xref>). piRNAs are derived from TE sequences and provide heritable libraries that target TE transcripts for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brennecke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czech et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Independent of the post-transcriptional cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darricarrère et al., 2013</xref>), the piRNA pathway is required for transcriptional silencing of TE insertions in the ovary. In flies, loss of PIWI causes the loss of H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatic repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klenov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darricarrère et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klenov et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to yeast, piRNA-guided heterochromatin formation requires transcription of the target locus (co-transcriptional silencing); Piwi–piRNA complexes bind to complementary, nascent TE transcripts and induce heterochromatin formation by recruiting heterochromatin factors, including histone methyltransferases for H3K9me3 deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sienski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang and Elgin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Thomas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batki et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the developing embryo, maternally deposited PIWI is similarly required for the formation of H3K9me3 at the maternal-zygotic transition during late blastoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Elgin, 2013</xref>). However, the process and precise mechanism of rapid heterochromatin establishment across a large fraction of the genome such as the pericentromere and the Y chromosome remains poorly understood. Early cytological studies showed that heterochromatin becomes visible during blastoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vlassova et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, in vivo immunofluorescence staining on the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo has shown that heterochromatin appears as early as cell cycle 13 (late stage 4) and rapidly increases through blastulation (cell cycle 14, stage 5) and requires the histone methyltransferase SetDB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yuan and O'Farrell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seller et al., 2019</xref>). However, such imaging approaches lack resolution at genome-scale and are necessarily limited by the concentration and density of the targeted sequence and proteins. Emerging heterochromatin, therefore, may not yield strong enough signal for fluorescent detection. Hence, highly sensitive genome-wide analyses of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin dynamics in early embryos are needed.</p><p>Here, we investigate the establishment of heterochromatin during early embryogenesis in <italic>Drosophila miranda.</italic> While this species lacks the genetic tools available in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, several features make <italic>D. miranda</italic> ideal for studying repetitive sequences and heterochromatin on a genome scale. <italic>D. miranda</italic> has a large repeat-rich neo-Y chromosome, which formed through the fusion of an autosome (Muller-C) with the ancestral Y around 1.5 million years ago and has since more than doubled in size due to the accumulation of TEs. The high-quality genome assembly has near end-to-end assemblies of most chromosome arms that include large fractions of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahajan et al., 2018</xref>): roughly 30 Mb of pericentromeric heterochromatin at the X and autosomes, and over 100 Mb of the repeat-rich Y chromosome have been assembled. In contrast, the most repeat-rich genome assembly of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> contains only 14.6 Mb of Y-linked sequence scattered across 106 contigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Larracuente, 2019</xref>). <italic>D. miranda</italic>’s neo-Y chromosome is predominantly assembled into two massive contigs (53.8 and 37.2 Mb) and harbors an abundance of active single-copy genes interspersed in repeats; the mixture of genes and repeats create nonredundant junctions facilitating sensitive read mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, unlike <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that contains Mb-sized blocks of simple satellite DNA, this species has few simple satellites in its genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), thus allowing us to map most heterochromatic regions using ChIP-seq technology. To study the formation of H3K9me3-dependend heterochromatin during early development, we adapted an ultra-low input ChIP-seq protocol using single precisely staged embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our dense sampling during early embryogenesis (genome-wide H3K9me3 profiles for &gt;70 individual embryos) allowed us to infer spatiotemporal heterogeneity in heterochromatin establishment and evaluate the relationship between the nucleation and spreading of H3K9me3 marks to zygotic genome activation and maternally deposited piRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide profiling of H3K9me3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> across an embryonic time course</title><p>To define the chromatin landscape before, during, and after the establishment of heterochromatin, we collected <italic>D. miranda</italic> (MSH22) embryos from population cages at 18°C between 210 and 420 min, to target embryonic stage 3 (before the onset of heterochromatin formation), early and late stage 4 (when some heterochromatin is first detected), stage 5 (when heterochromatin becomes cytologically visible), and stage 7 (when heterochromatin exerts its silencing effect), respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Note that embryonic development is highly stereotypical across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus, with nearly identical morphological landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuntz and Eisen, 2014</xref>). Embryos were examined under a light microscope to only select embryos of the correct stages, based on major morphological features to classify developmental stages (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lott et al., 2014</xref>). For each stage, we collected between 8 and 20 embryos, which were subjected to single-embryo, ultra-low input ChIP-seq library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brind'Amour et al., 2015</xref>), with antibodies against the repressive histone mark H3K9me3. The large numbers of replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) ensure robust and sensitive profiles of H3K9me3 enrichment across the stages. We initially performed two independent IPs on individual embryos, targeting both H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, their enrichment profiles are very similar and highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we spiked the libraries with stage 7 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos, so that enrichment profiles can be compared across samples and stages after spike-in normalization (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bulk of heterochromatin establishment occurs during early stage 4 of embryonic development</title><p>Based on cytology and microscopy, heterochromatin is first detectable at the last cell cycles in stage 4 (that is around nuclear cycle 12/13) and then becomes established rapidly during cellularization at stage 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vlassova et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yuan and O'Farrell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strom et al., 2017</xref>). However, we already see clear H3K9me3 enrichment around the pericentric regions of each chromosome at early stage 4 (that is, nuclear cycle 10/11), followed by subsequent increases in enrichment through stage 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The same pattern of establishment at early stage 4 is also apparent when we inferred regions of the genome with H3K9me3 enrichment peaks; the number of H3K9me3 peaks identified sharply increases from stage 3 (n = 2202) to early stage 4 (n = 51,202), followed by proportionally smaller increases in peak numbers through the later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, as development progresses, peak sizes broaden and become less sharp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). After stage 3, we see a gradual increase of H3K9me3 enrichment around early peaks as embryos age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Concordantly, regions of the genome where peaks are inferred in late stage 4, stage 5, and stage 7 already show positive H3K9me3 enrichment at early stage 4, on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), even though they are depleted, on average, at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In fact, nearly 60% of the 116,791 peaks inferred for stage 7 are already enriched for H3K9me3 at early stage 4, even if the enrichment level is below the detection limit of peak calling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, an additional 27% of the peaks also show enrichment at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, for late stage 4 and stage 5, the majority of the peaks are enriched in early stage 4. Altogether, these results indicate that pericentric heterochromatin establishment in <italic>D. miranda</italic> likely starts at or before stage 4, followed by increases in heterochromatin levels during subsequent stages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Developmental trajectory of heterochromatin enrichment and peaks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome-wide H3K9me3 enrichment landscape through five embryonic stages.

Since a single nucleosome is wrapped by ~147 bp of DNA, the narrow width of the stage 3 peaks (median width of 125 bp) suggests that they predominantly represent single nucleosomes that nucleate the deposition of H3K9me3 in neighboring nucleosomes in subsequent stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). 47.8% and 26.2% of the stage 3 peaks overlap with annotated TEs and microsatellites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Interestingly, 25.6% (n = 256) of the stage 3 peaks appear to become depleted of H3K9me3 enrichment over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>), possibly indicating that some nucleating sites fail to initiate and/or maintain heterochromatin spreading, but they could also be phantom peaks that remained after filtering.

We utilized embryonic RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lott et al., 2014</xref>) and sequenced the piRNAs in 0–1 hr embryos to test for an association between H3K9me3 targeting and silencing of maternal or nascent TE transcripts by small RNAs. We find sparse RNA-seq reads from stage 2 or stage 4 embryos mapping to or around H3K9me3 peaks at embryonic stage 3 or 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Most of the RNA-seq reads around stage 3 peaks result from maternal transcripts of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), with 40% of the 175 genes overlapping stage 3 peaks producing maternal transcripts. This is similar to the proportion of maternal genes genome-wide (39.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), arguing against the possibility that maternal transcripts induce nucleation. However, we find that genomic regions containing persistent stage 3 peaks have abundant piRNAs mapping around them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Median piRNA reads per million (RPM) for 5 kb windows overlapping persistent stage 3 peaks is 15.55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>); this is substantially and significantly higher than for the rest of the genome (median RPM = 1.48), and also for pericentromeric windows lacking stage 3 peaks (medium RPM = 10.36; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; Wilcoxon rank sum test p&lt;2.2e-16).

In contrast, the new peaks show a single summit flanked by depletion, consistent with H3K9me3 at single nucleosomes. Both sets of peaks increase in H3K9me3 enrichment across developmental stages with the new peaks having significantly lower enrichment across all stages; however, the difference in enrichment between the two sets of peaks decreases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The gradual increase in H3K9me3 enrichment across stages likely reflects increasing numbers of nuclei/cells in the embryo with H3K9me3 deposited around nucleating sites as heterochromatin becomes stably established, with older peaks reaching saturation as the new peaks catch up. To determine whether increases in H3K9me3 enrichment are associated with expected decreases in chromatin accessibility, we generated ATAC-seq libraries from single embryos for the same developmental stages (absent stage 7). Indeed, we find that both sets of peaks show decreasing accessibility over development, with the old peaks being significantly less accessible across all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Expectedly, most of the stage 4 peaks (84.2%) overlap with annotated TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) and 82.6% of them are concentrated at the pericentromere and the repeat-rich Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These distributions are drastically different from stage 3 peaks, revealing that nucleation at stage 4 is more localized to canonically heterochromatic sites and TEs. Again, we looked for associations of stage 4 peaks with transcripts and piRNAs. As with the stage 3 peaks, very few stage 2 or 4 embryonic RNA-seq reads map to or around the peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar to persistent stage 3 peaks, we find that genomic (5 kb) windows with stage 4 peaks have abundant piRNAs mapping, with median RPM of 17.21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Again, this is significantly higher than both windows without peaks (median RPM = 0.56, Wilcoxon’s rank sum tests, p&lt;2.2e-16) or windows in the pericentromere but without peaks (median RPM = 5.55, Wilcoxon’s rank sum tests, p&lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Furthermore, genomic windows with old stage 4 peaks have slightly but significantly more piRNA (median RPM = 20.36) than new peaks (median RPM = 17.95; Wilcoxon’s rank sum tests, p=6.57e-05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These results again show that heterochromatin establishment during early embryogenesis is associated with maternal piRNAs and support a model of PIWI/piRNA-mediated targeting of heterochromatin. However, many windows with stage 4 peaks have no piRNAs mapping, and many windows without peaks have high piRNAs mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting that additional signals are likely at play (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Heterochromatin nucleation at TEs is restricted at stage 3 but wide at stage 4</title><p>As TEs dominate stage 3 and early stage 4 nucleation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>), we further characterized patterns of nucleation and spreading at specific TE families annotated across the genome.

We looked at the placement of H3K9me3 peaks with respect to the full-length TE consensus sequence and overall H3K9me3 enrichment of all the annotated insertions for each TE in the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome. For TEs with large numbers of stage 3 peaks, the peaks are typically highly restricted to a specific region of TEs. For example, the vast majority of stage 3 peaks localize between 3500 and 4000 bp of the R1-6 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This starkly contrasts from the early stage 4 peaks, which are scattered across the entirety of the R1-6 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As expected, the position of the cluster of stage 3 peaks also corresponds to the region with the highest H3K9me3 enrichment across the R1-6 element, producing spikey and heterogeneous H3K9me3 enrichment profiles at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). However, at later stages, H3K9me3 enrichment becomes more evenly elevated around the peak region, indicative of spreading of heterochromatin for robust silencing during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Similarly, the TRAM element shows highly restricted H3K9me3 enrichment and peaks localized to the 5’ (0–300 bp) region at stage 3 followed by broad heterochromatin enrichment at early stage 4 and peaks spread throughout the element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). The 5’ region of TRAM, where the early nucleating peaks reside, continues to increase in H3K9me3 over development as enrichment levels at the rest of the TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Notably, the 5’ region of nearly all of the 748 TRAM copies found in the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome show elevated H3K9me3 enrichment even though only 27 peaks have been called there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that peak calling is highly conservative and substantially underestimates the number of nucleation sites. This pattern of localized stage 3 nucleation is also observed in other TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and for LTR-retrotransposons, nucleation appears restricted to the 5’ end of the TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>For TEs like CR1-1 that have few to no stage 3 peaks, H3K9me3 establishment at early stage 4 is nonetheless very broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). When looking at H3K9me3 enrichment at stage 3 across all CR1-1 insertions, we noticed low but consistent patterns of localized H3K9me3 enrichment at multiple positions of the TE (e.g. ~1800 bp,~2200 bp, and ~4000 bp); these regions also show some of the most elevated H3K9me3 enrichment at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These patterns suggest that despite the absence of H3K9me3 peak calls at stage 3, localized nucleation likely is in progress at this stage, but possibly in only a subset of nuclei, causing low overall enrichment. Thus, we conclude that nucleation begins first as targeted H3K9me3 enrichment at TE insertions followed by wide H3K9me3 deposition and spreading across the rest of the element.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>High maternal piRNA abundance and early zygotic transcription are associated with early nucleation at TEs</title><p>The piRNA pathway allows for sequence-specific targeting of TEs for both co-transcriptional silencing and post-transcriptional degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malone and Hannon, 2009</xref>).

H3K9me3 re-establishment in somatic tissues is crucial for normal development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. A number of different pathways have been identified that recruit H3K9 methyltransferases to target loci and include a diversity of guides such as DNA binding proteins and non-coding RNAs. For example, in fission yeast, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) matching pericentric repeats are required for recruitment of the silencing machinery to pericentric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Volpe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2002</xref>). In mammals, a parallel pathway exists based on DNA sequence-based recognition and silencing of mobile elements by KRAB- zinc-finger DNA-binding proteins. These proteins bind DNA via an array of zinc-fingers and recruit the universal co-repressor KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) through their KRAB domain. In turn, KAP1 recruits histonemethyltransferases to TE insertions to promote deposition of repressive chromatin marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The role of H3K9me3 in early somatic development has been studied in mouse, and H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin was shown to undergo dramatic reprogramming during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fadloun et al., 2013</xref>). Targeting of H3K9me3 during fly embryogenesis is poorly understood. We find that establishment of heterochromatin begins with limited H3K9me3 deposition at single nucleosomes at or before stage 3. These nucleating sites expand gradually by H3K9me3 deposition to neighboring nucleosomes in subsequent stages to form mature heterochromatin. Unexpectedly, we find that early nucleation sites may not be restricted to the pericentric regions and can be lost through development. Nevertheless, the majority of nucleating sites are localized to specific regions of TEs such that across different insertions, the same positions show elevated H3K9me3 enrichment. Interestingly, truncated insertions that lost these positions show significantly reduced H3K9me3 enrichment across the remainder of the TE and maintain elevated accessibility across development, revealing that these nucleating positions are important for subsequent local spreading of heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential mechanisms for targeted nucleation in TEs</title><p>The restricted positioning of nucleation suggests a targeted mechanism for H3K9me3 deposition.

Chromatin-associated transcripts may recruit silencing factors to their genomic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>), and co-transcriptional silencing by PIWIi–piRNA complexes has led to a model where piRNAs provide sequence specificity for PIWI to target nascent TE transcripts and guide co-transcriptional heterochromatin formation at TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the piRNA pathway is thought to be primarily active in gonadal tissue, yet mutations of key factors in the pathway, including Piwi, affect heterochromatin formation in somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pal-Bhadra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Elgin, 2013</xref>). Both piRNAs and PIWI protein are maternally loaded into the egg, consistent with maternal piRNA/PIWI complexes guiding initial heterochromatin establishment in the early embryo, which is later maintained independently of piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pal-Bhadra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu and Elgin, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Supporting the requirement of nascent transcription for heterochromatin formation, we find that TEs showing early nucleation have significantly higher zygotic expression than the rest during early development (between stages 2 and 4 for TEs with stage 3 peaks, or stages 4 and 5 for TEs with stage 4 peaks). In addition, we find that early nucleating TEs are associated with high abundance of both sense and anti-sense maternally deposited piRNAs. Early zygotic transcription during embryogenesis and high maternal piRNA counts are consistent with this model of co-transcriptional silencing of TEs and highlight the importance of small RNAs in establishing heterochromatin in flies.</p><p>While piRNA may guide the recruitment of the co-transcriptional repression machinery, it cannot account for the restricted nucleation of heterochromatin on TE inserts. We find that TEs have specific regions that are targeted first for heterochromatinization, and the positions of abundant piRNA read mapping show little correspondence to the positions of H3K9me3 nucleation along TEs. Our observation that early nucleating TEs also show early zygotic transcription raises the possibility that the act of transcription at these TEs may provide specificity; indeed, extensive chromatin remodeling occurs at promoters during zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>). Supporting this, the strong H3K9me3 enrichment (and large number of peaks) around the 5’ LTR of TRAM and other LTR-retrotransposons is consistent with a model where histone methyltransferases are recruited to the promoter of the TE insertions perhaps by transcription initiation. Clustering of H3K9me3 to the 5’ end of a subset of TEs was also observed in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Walter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, this does not appear to be a general rule across all early nucleating TEs, as non-LTR elements like R1-6 and LOA-2 have restricted nucleation sites close to their 3’ end or near the middle of insertions, respectively. These discrepancies may suggest that alternative targeting mechanisms are involved in early heterochromatin deposition in flies. KRAB- zinc-fingers are confined to mammals, but an analogous protein family exists in flies: ZAD- zinc-fingers (ZAD-ZNFs). ZAD-ZNFs are a poorly characterized gene family that has dramatically expanded within insect lineages (Chung et al. 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasinathan et al., 2020</xref>). Approximately half of all ZAD-ZNF genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are highly expressed in ovaries and early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2002</xref>) and several interact with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasinathan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swenson et al., 2016</xref>).

While it remains unclear how these proteins localize to heterochromatin, it raises the possibility that maternally deposited DNA-binding factors can recruit histonemethyltransferases for H3K9me3 deposition in flies. The localized nature of the early nucleating sites is suggestive of a targeting mechanism such as motif recognition by DNA-binding proteins. Future research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> will show whether specific sequences on TEs are targeted by maternally deposited DNA-binding proteins that act in concert with the piRNA pathway to cause site-specific H3K9me3 deposition at recently active TEs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Early and robust silencing against highly active TEs</title><p>Early nucleating TEs are under robust silencing; they appear sufficiently silenced during oogenesis with the lowest maternal transcript abundance, and their expression remains significantly lower than the remaining TEs as zygotic transcription ramps up.

Interestingly, we find that these TE are significantly more abundant with higher copy numbers and insertions across the genome. Elevated copy number on the neo-Y chromosome further indicates that these TEs had high transposition activity within the past 1.5 million years since the formation of the neo-Y. Altogether, these results suggest that the early nucleating TEs have high transposition potential and strong genomic silencing in the form of piRNA defense and targeted nucleation may have evolved to maintain genome integrity.

Library concentration was determined using Qubit (Thermofisher), and the library quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer by the Functional Genomics Lab at UC Berkeley.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ChIP sequencing and data processing</title><p>All libraries were (100 bp) paired-end sequenced with the Hi-Seq 4000 at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Lab at UC Berkeley. To differentiate between spike-in and sample from each ChIP-seq library, raw paired-end reads are aligned to a reference file that contains both the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome (r2.1) and the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (r6.12) using bwa mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>) on default settings. Since bwa mem, by default, only reports the highest quality alignment, each read will align to one of the two genomes only once. When there are more than one alignment of equal mapping quality, the read will be randomly assigned to one of the targets. Using a custom Perl script, reads are then differentiated based on which of the two genomes they align to, and ambiguous alignments are discarded. For read mapping statistics, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Reads are then sorted using samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>), and the coverage per site is determined with bedtools genomecoverge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) (-d -ibam options).</p><p>Sex of embryos were inferred from the ratio of the median autosomal coverage: median × coverage of the inputs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Median coverages were inferred from distribution of average coverages in 1 kb sliding windows.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sample and enrichment normalization</title><p>For normalization without spike-in, we first took the average coverage of the ChIP and input samples in 1 kb windows and then determined the median of all the autosomal windows to obtain the median autosomal coverage. The per-site coverages in the ChIP and input samples were then divided by their respective median autosomal coverage, thus normalizing for library size. The per-site enrichment is then estimated as:</p><p>Enrichment = (ChIP/ChIP median + 0.01) / (input/input median + 0.01), with 0.01 being a small pseudo-count.</p><p>For normalization with spike-in, we first generated a reference spike-in enrichment profile by using the same procedure as above for all spike-in ChIPs and spike-in inputs in 1 kb windows, and then took the average log<sub>2</sub> enrichment across all spike-ins, generating a reference. This reference is meant to be a standard to which all other spike-ins will be normalized, and the extent of normalization in the spike-ins will be applied to the actual samples. To do so, we used a method akin to quantile normalization, whereby the distribution of the spike-in sample is matched with that of the reference. However, instead of matching the distributions identically as with typical quantile normalization, we binned the enrichment values into quantiles of 0.1, allowing us to match the quantiles by bins. For example, if the 98.1th quantile has a log<sub>2</sub> enrichment of 3.2 and 4.0 in the spike-in sample and reference, respectively, all points of the spike-in within the quantile will be increased by 0.8. Since the spike-in and the actual sample should have the same pull-down efficiency, this then allows us to determine the extent of normalization to apply to each log<sub>2</sub> enrichment in the actual latter; for example, points with log<sub>2</sub> enrichment of 3.2 will similarly be elevated by 0.8 in the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ChIP-seq peak calling</title><p>We used macs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) to call H3K9me3 enrichment peaks. For each stage containing multiple replicates, we called peaks using sorted bam files with the spike-in reads removed, where the spike-in reads are removed with the command below: macs2 callpeak -t replicate1.chip.sort.bam replicate2.chip.sort.bam... <monospace>-c replicate1.input.sort.bam replicate2.input.sort.bam</monospace>... <monospace>-n output_name -g 1.8e8</monospace> <monospace>--call-summits.</monospace></p><p>For peak calling in individual replicates, only the chip and corresponding input bam files are used for the -t and <monospace>-c parameters</monospace>. Peaks in different replicates that are less than 100 bp away from each other are deemed the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Enrichment analysis around peaks</title><p>For each developmental stage, we averaged the H3K9me3 enrichment per site (or bin) across the replicates to generate a representative enrichment. To determine the developmental progression of enrichment around peaks, we averaged the representative enrichment at 100 bp upstream and downstream of the summit of the peak (reported by macs2) for each stage. Regions are deemed enriched if log<sub>2</sub>(enrichment) &gt; 0.5. Enrichment on the neo-Y is averaged from only male embryos. For the enrichment heatmaps, we took the per-base enrichment 1000 bp upstream and downstream of the summits and sorted the peaks from highest enrichment to lowest enrichment. We then plotted each base as a dot using colors that scale with the enrichment with a custom R script. Colors are generated using the R package RColorBrewer. Heatmaps around peaks of ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and DNA-seq are also generating using this method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Repeat annotations, contents, and overlap with peaks</title><p>We used Repeatmasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2021</xref>) with a TE index specific to the <italic>obscura</italic> group (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage to which <italic>D. miranda</italic> belongs) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hill and Betancourt, 2018</xref>. Simple repeats were identified using the simple repeat setting in Repeatmasker, which lists them and can be identified in the annotation file (.gff) as (motif)n where the ‘motif’ is the repeating unit (e.g. (AGAT)n). To determine the %repeat content, we used the repeat masker annotation and determined the number of bases annotated by either a TE or a simple repeat in nonoverlapping sliding windows. To determine overlap between annotated repeats and H3K9me3 peaks, we used bedtools intersect -a annotatedrepeats.gff -b macs2.peaks -wa -wb. Distance between repeats and peaks is inferred using the R package IRange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>H3K9me3 enrichment at full length and truncated annotated TE insertions</title><p>The Repeatmasker annotation (gff) provides the positions of the TE insertions in the genome as well as the positions matching the TE consensus sequence; for each TE entry, these coordinates are used to create a table of enrichment values where each row is an annotated insertion in the genome and each column is a position of the consensus from the repeat index. Because the LTR and internal sequences of LTR retrotransposons are separate entries in the repeat index, we identified full-length insertions of TRAM in the genome by identifying internal sequences flanked by LTRs requiring that all three features must have the same direction (all forward/reverse) and are within 10 bp of each other. To identify 5’ and 3’ truncated insertions, we identified internal sequences where the respective LTRs are either missing or greater than 5 kb away. For statistical comparisons, we averaged the H3K9me3 enrichment across the last 1 kb of the element of each full length and truncated insert and compared the distribution of averaged enrichment between full length and 5’ insertions. The opposite was done for 3’ truncated insertions, where we averaged across the first 1 kb.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>DNA-seq and RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Sexed DNA-seq and RNA-seq data are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahajan et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lott et al., 2014</xref>. Raw reads were aligned using bwa mem on default settings to either the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome or the Repeat index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hill and Betancourt, 2018</xref>) and sorted with samtools. After samtools sort, the per-base coverage is determined with bedtools genomeCoverageBed and then normalized by the number of mapped reads in the library. For copy-number-scaled TE transcript abundance, we tallied the RNA-seq and DNA-seq read count mapping to each TE entry in the repeat library; the former was normalized by the median read count at autosomal genes and the latter normalized by the median autosomal coverage. Mapping statistics for the RNA-seq samples can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>. For TE expression scaled by copy number, RNA-seq read counts were then divided by the DNA-seq read counts for each TE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Embryo collection for piRNA sequencing and piRNA isolation</title><p>Flies were allowed to lay on molasses plates with yeast paste for 1 hr, and embryos were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. We used Trizol (Invitrogen) and GlycoBlue (Invitrogen) to extract and isolate total RNA. piRNA is isolated using NaIO<sub>4</sub> reaction and beta elimination with a protocol modified from (Kirino and Mourelatos 2007; Ohara et al. 2007; Cao et al. 2009; Simon et al. 2011; Abe et al. 2014; Gebert et al. 2015). We started with 20 µg total RNA in 13.5 µl water and added 4 µl 5× borate buffer (148 mM borax, 148 mM boric acid, pH 8.6) and 2.5 µl freshly dissolved 200 mM sodium periodate. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction is quenched with 2 µl gylcerol for an additional 10 min. We poked holes in the tops of the tubes with sterile needles, then vacuum dried the reaction for 1 hr. We then added 50 µl 1× borax buffer (30 mM borax, 40 mM boric acid, 50 mM NaOH, pH 9.5, and 200 mM sodium periodate) and incubated the samples for 90 min at 45°C. For RNA precipiration, we added 1.33 µl GlycoBlue (Invitrogen) and 200 µl ice cold 100% EtOH and place the samples in −80°C overnight. We centrifuged down the samples at 4°C, maximum speed, for 15 min, removed the supernatant, and let the RNA pellet dry, and resuspended the RNA in 20 µl H<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>Twenty microliters of RNA prepared as described above was resolved on a 15% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen). Custom 18-nt and 30-nt ladders were used to size select 19–29 nt long RNA, which was purified and used as input for library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit to ligate adapters, reverse transcribe and amplify libraries, and purify the cDNA constructs. The protocol included an additional size selection step after library preparation on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen). Fifty base-pair single-end sequencing of our samples was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 at the Vincent J.

Using samtools view and awk, we then extracted reads that are 23–29 bp in length. For mapping to the repeat index, we further used samtools view to separate forward and reverse mapping reads with the –F 16 and –f 16, respectively. We then used bedtools genomeCoverage to obtain piRNA coverage at each position in the genome or repeat index. piRNA reads mapping statistics can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. To determine the amount of piRNAs mapping to 5 kb windows across the genome, we used bedtools coverage. Overlap (and lack of) between the resulting bed files and peaks are then determined using bedtools intersect. RPM is calculated as the number of reads mapping to window/position divided by million of 23–29 bp piRNA reads mapped.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ATAC-seq sample preparation</title><p>Single-staged embryos were collected as above. ATAC-seq preparation was done according to a modified protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>. Embryos were homogenized into a cell suspension using a 200 µl pipette tip in 20 µl of Nuclei EZ lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog No. N3408). The supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 4°C. The nuclei were the resuspended in the transposition buffer (2× reaction buffer, Illumina Cat #FC-121–1030, Nextera Tn5 Transposase, Illumina Cat #FC-121–1030) and PCR amplified (KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, cat# KK2600) for 12 cycles. PCR products were cleaned up with AMPure XP beads (cat# A63881) at 1:1 concentration. Samples were sequenced with the Novaseq 6000 S1 with 100 bp pair-end reads at the Vincent J.

After sorting with samtools, we used bedtools genomeCoverageBed with the -pc flag for fragment count instead of read count, generating the per base fragment coverage. The fragment coverage for each sample is then normalized by the median autosomal coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The sex of the embryos is then determined based on the coverage on the sex chromosomes; i.e., males will have ~0.5× coverage on the X and Y chromosomes. Since our analyses focused on repetitive heterochromatin where read coverage deviates highly due to copy number differences, we controlled for copy number by dividing the ATAC-seq fragment counts by fragment counts of sex-matched DNA-seq samples, generating ATAC enrichment. This also simultaneously controls for the coverage differences of sex chromosomes between males and females.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data availability</title><p>All ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data generated have been deposited on SRA under BioProject PRJNA601450.

They identify a subset of H3K9me3 peaks, frequently proximal to transposon-targeted by piRNAs, that progressively broaden into stable heterochromatin at Stage 7 of development. Thus, they propose that early peaks of H3K9me3 represent nucleation sites for stable heterochromatin domains, and that piRNA-associated co-transcriptional silencing is involved in their establishment.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors characterize H3K9me3 establishment during embryonic development in <italic>D. miranda</italic>. The authors find that at Stage 3 there are multiple, frequently stochastic, H3K9me3 peaks. A subset of these sites, frequently proximal to transposon-targeted by piRNAs, are characterized by stable heterochromatin at Stage 7 of development. Thus, they propose that early peaks of H3K9me3 represent nucleation sites for stable heterochromatin domains, and that piRNAs are involved in their establishment.</p><p>The reviewers recognize the value of these studies particularly with respect to providing a collection of H3K9me3 profiles in narrow developmental stages. However, they also points to major issues that question the validity of the conclusions and need to be addressed for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers are concerned that 'stage 3' peaks might be 'phantom peaks'. These typically appear near open regions such as promoters and enhancers even when normalized to input. This is a well-known issue (PMID:26117547), and these peaks are particularly apparent when actual peaks are sparse (such as in stage 3 embryos). A clear demonstration that 'stage 3' peaks are not phantom peaks is essential to support the validity of the authors' claims and for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Experiments suggested by the reviewers to address this point include:</p><p>– Providing ChIP-seq data from embryos without the target of interest, in this case H3K9 histone methyltransferase mutants;</p><p>– Providing parallel H3K9me3 and &quot;mock&quot; IPs, e.g., with IgG, to test whether these peaks are a technical artifacts.</p><p>3) A clear characterization of embryo staging for <italic>D. miranda</italic> is required. In contrast to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the biology of early embryogenesis in D.miranda is not well studied and the authors should first demonstrate by immunocytology that their staging really is correct in respect to the drawings provided in Figure 1B.</p><p>4) Limiting the ChIP-seq analysis to H3K9me3 could mask the establishment of silencing. The conclusion that so-called 'temporary H3K9me3 peaks' indicate regions not establishing heterochromatin might be a misinterpretation because it is not shown whether these are only initiated by H3K9me3 but maintained in their heterochromatic state by H3K9me2 indexing. This would be resolved by investigating H3K9me2 peaks during development.</p><p>Related to this point, the authors should show also H3K9me3 staining in salivary glands of <italic>D. miranda</italic>, as the two markers might look distinct.</p><p>5) No direct evidence is provided to support the claim that piRNAs has a role in heterochromatin formation. The claim is based on the observation that 'persistent' H3K9me3 peaks are proximal to piRNA-enriched TEs, but the authors should either provide direct evidence (such as by deleting or introducing piRNA-enriched TEs into the genome near some of the stage 3 peaks and see how this affects heterochromatin formation), or significantly tone down their claims, including by removing this conclusion from the title.</p><p>6) The reviewers have additional concerns about data analysis/interpretation, most of which can potentially be addressed by text changes or additional data analyses. Specifically:</p><p>a. Figure 5B: The spreading of H3K9me3 appears to follow a different pattern in different replicates. In repl. 7-8, the sharp H3K9me3 peaks remain sharp at stage7. This suggests that heterochromatin spreading does not take place around these peaks. On the contrary, repl 1-2 show that almost half of the less robust H3K9me3 peaks expand into their surrounding regions at stage7. The authors should try to explain why heterochromatin spreading is observed only in a few replicates and how do they reconcile their model with the observation that sharp peaks appear to result in less spreading. This would also influence the interpretations of Figure 6 D and Sup. 7.</p><p>b. The authors showed the patterns of stage3 H3K9me3 peaks vary depending on replicates. Does this epigenetic variegation during stage3 affect the final landscape of H3K9me3 after heterochromatin formation is completed? Although the stage3 H3K9me3 peaks are not identical between replicates, all the replicates may share the regions where the peaks are observed; in that case heterochromatin formation takes place at similar regions, which would result in very similar H3K9me3 patterns at stage7. Did the author compare the patterns of H3K9me3 at stage7 between replicates-are they identical, or different?</p><p>c. What is happening to the peaks and the surrounding regions where signals are invisible (the lower parts of each panel) in Fig6 F and G? Are the signals completely absent, or do they have weak signals with a similar tendency as observed at the peaks of the upper parts? If former is the case, how do the authors apply their model to those peaks?</p><p>d. The spike-in normalization is potentially problematic. From methods: &quot;when there is more than one alignment of equal mapping quality, the read will be randomly assigned to one of the targets&quot; – wouldn't this cause reads derived from real H3K9me3 peaks from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to get assigned to identical sequences of <italic>D. miranda</italic> due to the randomization? Are the results (especially for stage 3 peaks) reproducible without spike-ins? Will the results hold if all reads mapping to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are discarded prior to mapping to <italic>D. miranda</italic>?</p><p>Another reviewer notes that additional caveats might arise from using <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos for spike-in normalization. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, heterochromatin formation by H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 becomes visible around cycle 9-10. In stage 7 embryos gastrulation is already progressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and spike-in normalization with these embryos might be problematic if earlier embryos of <italic>D. miranda</italic> (cycle 10-13) are compared as well as by the significant differences in repeated sequences between the two species.</p><p>e. The authors note that the early non-persistent peaks are highly variable, only appearing in a few of the libraries. Two key questions arise: could the random assignment of reads to different mapping sites cause peaks and could the number of microsatellite copies in the genome be underestimated in the assembly? Random assignment of repetitive sequences to mapping sites might result in stochastic appearance of peaks, especially if there are many repeat copies and few reads. Would these peaks continue to be strong and stochastic if reads were mapped to all sites weighted by mapping site number? The authors mention that some peaks are present with unique mapping, but don't mention whether uniquely mapping peaks are similarly or less stochastic than ones that map to multiple loci. Do the authors ever observe &quot;apparent&quot; depletion at any of these sites compared to input (i.e., if peaks are due to random assignment there should also be &quot;random peaks&quot; in the input)? How certain are the authors about the exact copy number of the microsatellites? If microsatellite copies are underestimated, then peaks could appear due to &quot;apparent&quot; oversampling. While the authors attempted to account for this issue using DNA-seq libraries, the combination of random assignment of reads and unmapped microsatellite sequences might lead to apparent enrichments, which could appear stronger or more wide-spread due to unidentified microsatellite copies.</p><p>f. The authors argue that &quot;technical noise does not account for the observation that peaks are enriched for microsatellites, and only a small fraction of repeats are enriched with H3K9me3 at stage 3&quot;. However, given how widespread microsatellites are across the genome (&gt;200,000 loci), I wonder if the overlap with the stage 3 H3K9me3 is by random chance. Would random sampling of the genome with equal number of genomic regions as the stage 3 H3K9me3 TR-associated peaks result in similar overlap with TRs? If it is not random, what is special about the occupied TRs compared to the remaining ~99% of TRs in the genome – e.g., do they have higher accessibility, transcription, specific sequence?</p><p>g. While piRNA-initiated heterochromatin spreads, it is hard to imagine how a single nucleosome (143bp or 124bp genomic length) can be targeted by a TE that is hundreds or even up to 10 kb away. Spreading from this distance would result in broad peaks (like the authors observe at later stages) and not targeting of distant specific individual nucleosomes.</p><p>h. The authors should also more carefully interpret accessibility differences using ATAC-seq because significant transitions in chromatin indexing during early embryonic development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were recently demonstrated occurring before and during heterochromatin establishment. This might also occur in <italic>D. miranda</italic> and could contribute to the findings reported.</p><p>7) Several citations are missing. The reviewers are particularly concerned about:</p><p>– Missing references to studies highlighting heterochromatin establishment in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, including studies on the role of H3K9me2 in gene silencing and heterochromatin formation.</p><p>– Poor citation of studies on piRNA-mediated H3K9me3 establishment.</p><p>– Missing citations of the literature of <italic>D. miranda</italic>, to justify why the study was done in this organism (e.g., it might be interesting to compare the model species <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with the evolutionary very distant species <italic>D. miranda</italic> with interesting specificities like sex chromosome evolution).</p><p>8) The fact that this study as performed in <italic>D. miranda</italic> should be better clarified, including mentioning it in the title. The authors should also clarify what is new in this study compared to what has already been resolved in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Establishment of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin during embryogenesis in <italic>Drosophilamiranda</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Both reviewers agree that the study is interesting and conducted with rigor, supporting its publication. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. No additional experiments are required, but some data reanalysis might be needed. The reviewers also raise significant concerns about data presentation and interpretation, and about missing or incorrect citations, which need to be addressed before publication. Please carefully address the points raised by the reviewers in a revised version of the manuscript, with a specific attention to the comments highlighted here.</p><p>Both reviewers have issues with the authors' claims about the role of piRNAs in heterochromatin nucleation. Specifically, the concern refers to the claim that on one hand piRNAs are important for nucleation, but on the other hand piRNAs do not map at sites where the nucleations occur. The reviewers also offer somewhat different interpretation of the presented data, suggesting that he point the authors would like to make is not clear. I am copying here the comments on this point, which require significant revision of the main text, a clearer model/conclusion, and editing of the abstract.</p><p>Reviewer 2: Based on the fact that piRNA mappings along the TEs show no correlation with nucleation sites the authors speculate that some other mechanism might be responsible for nucleation (transcription itself or Zn-finger proteins) and piRNAs induce spreading. While this can certainly not be excluded, I am not sure where the expectation that a complex that binds nascent transcript would induce changes on the DNA at the same sequence as where it associates with the RNA comes from. In fact that seems relatively unlikely to me. Instead, I would think that recruitment of the complex on nascent transcript will induce nucleation in the proximity and that other factors (e.g., location of txn initiation or binding of other chromatin factors) determine where chromatin modification nucleates. Antisense piRNAs are mostly derived from piRNA clusters, which contain fragments of TEs, often lacking intact promoters (keeping all the TE promoters would increase transcriptional interference within the cluster). Thus, if nucleation occurs at promoters (as the authors observe for several TEs), piRNAs might predominantly not be able to target this region as clusters might be deprived of TSSs.</p><p>Reviewer 4: The correlation between piRNAs and H3K9me3 peaks seems marginal if at all. The last sentence of the abstract, while most likely true, seems a gross over-interpretation of the results. While I can well imagine how small RNA at one stage guide H3K9me3 at a later stage, the absence of correlation with H3K9me3 peaks make this scenario a long stretch. Therefore, the reasoning in the manuscript becomes pretty confusing. That maternally deposited piRNAs may be instrumental in suppressing this group of TEs is interesting and well possible but hard to conclude from the presented data.</p><p>On the piRNA data presentation: I don't see the value in showing correlation lines and r-values in figures 6D, E, F, 4H when there is no correlation visible. 3H, S9 (x-axis = kb from peak?) make the reader wonder how piRNA distribution look like further (than 2kb) away from the peak of H3K9me3. Is there any accumulation around peaks? Perhaps piRNA accumulation and distribution could be better grasped in browser shots like S5 and S7 with an additional piRNA track?</p><p>What is the y-axis unit in Figure 5D, G, J? For small RNAs, it is common to calculate normalized read counts in RPM (reads per total mio mapped). However, 5000RPM would be a lot?! (10,000RPM = 1% of the library) Readers need to be able to judge expression strength and depth.</p><p>Figure 6 is confusing: while it looks like lots of piRNAs map to stage 3 TEs in panel A and B, panel D (and E) shows no correlation whatsoever. Maybe it could be pointed out more clearly that A+B are about distinct TEs, while D+E are about H3K9me3 position within an element? I took the conclusion that piRNAs &quot;mark&quot; stage 3 high copy number TEs from panel F.</p><p>On the other hand, the authors speculate that specificity for nucleation might be provided by the act of transcription of TEs (line 396-98), which from an evolutionary arms race perspective I really don't like, as TEs like to evade repression and thus would likely change their expression profile to later stages if very early transcription initiation is the cause of more robust silencing.</p><p>Additional comments that need careful consideration, text rewriting, and potentially some re-analyses:</p><p>1) I am a little confused by the logic of how transcription is responsible for K9me3 peak initiation when the authors describe that both for stage 3 and stage 4 nucleating peaks the transcript level increases later, at stage 4 and 4-5, respectively. To me the data suggests that nucleation induces transcription (admittedly, this is going against the assumed function of K9me3) rather than the other way around.</p><p>2) Around line 308 the authors describe that the weak fold difference in K9me3 levels between the truncated and full length copies is likely a sever underestimation because non-unique mappings are distributed evenly amongst copies. Why did the authors not look at unique mappers?</p><p>3) In Figure 7B-C it is perplexing that the H3K9me3 enrichment in the last 1kb of internal sequence of TEs is higher in the full-length, while in the first 1kb internal sequence it is higher in the truncated copies. How do the authors explain this difference?</p><p>4) The H3K9me3 patterns along TEs are intriguing and very interesting. The authors may want to group and present TEs by class, at least discuss them by class in the text. This may explain &quot;discrepancies&quot; between transposon families. It seems LTR-retroelements show 5'-nucleation while non-LTR elements have a 3'-bias? The findings could be further elevated by discussing patterns in other organisms, perhaps data in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is available? In mouse and primates, 5'-nucleation has been observed by: Rebollo, 2011 Plos Genetics; Wolf, 2015 Genes Dev; Walter, 2016 <italic>eLife</italic>; Imbeault 2017 Nature; Wolf, 2020 <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In mouse and human, this nucleation is often (but perhaps not always) guided by ZFP which the authors point out are not conserved in flies. Given the similar patterns, this may still point to a highly conserved targeting mechanism for H3K9me3.</p><p>H3K9me3 induction at several LTR-retroelements in mouse have been shown to initiate at their highly conserved tRNA primer binding site and spread from there (Rebollo, 2011 Plos Genetics; Wolf, 2015 Genes Dev). It would be helpful if the authors state more precisely what they defined as a &quot;5'-truncation&quot;. How many nucleotides were missing in these copies? Only 5'-LTRs or perhaps additional nucleotides from the 5'-UTR?</p><p>5) Much of the RNA expression data is plotted like one would plot chromatin peaks and a bit odd presentation of &quot;no expression&quot;. In Figure S6 and 3G (upper third coordinates) there are a couple of loci that are expressed throughout stages. What are they? Are they independent of H3K9me3 and are they a specific transposon family? Genic? The obtained RNAseq data should be more accessible, which portions of the genome are expressed at the stages sampled? Perhaps some pie charts or supplemental tables of where in the genome reads map to at which stage could provide an overview of what the RNAseq actually revealed other than negative correlation with H3K9me3 at select loci.</p><p>6) Many references are missing (especially for piRNAs and k9me nucleation) as detailed in the 'recommendations for the authors' section. The authors also identify several errors or missing text in the main text and figure, as clarified in the 'Recommendations for the authors' section that follows.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The resubmitted version of the manuscript makes less profound claims than the original one. This is mostly due to the fact that many of the original peaks they found in early embryos turned out to be artifacts. Based on the current results, the main claims are that nucleation at TEs starts as early as stage 3 of embryonic development and that early nucleation is predominantly on active TEs (often at their promoters) and leads to more robust H3K9 methylation at later stages. The authors find that early nucleating TEs are highly targeted by maternal piRNAs and show early zygotic transcription consistent with the prevailing model that piRNA-induced transcriptional silencing requires transcription.</p><p>The new version of the manuscript is toned down and makes claims that are consistent with the data. The authors have addressed all the concerns except for proper references, although this mainly is due to removing a large fraction of the previous data that was fund to be a technical artifact and by toning down claims that were based on correlations. Whether these current results are still sufficiently interesting for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is not my responsibility to decide. I do find the observation of very early nucleation, which is consistent with piRNA-mediated early establishment of K9-methylation over TEs, interesting and, although not very surprising, still worth publishing.</p><p>I have a few remaining comments, which mostly indicate some level of sloppiness and the lack of familiarity with the piRNA field as well as some disagreement with the author's interpretations of the data.</p><p>1) I am a little confused by the logic of how transcription is responsible for K9me3 peak initiation when the authors describe that both for stage 3 and stage 4 nucleating peaks the transcript level increases later, at stage 4 and 4-5, respectively.

How do the authors explain this difference?</p><p>5) References remain insufficient and often wrong or at least not referring to the primary/first discovery. It is very apparent that the authors have not obtained a broad knowledge of the piRNA field and/or have done a sloppy job with the references even after this was raised in the first round of review. Here are some examples:</p><p>– Line 42: While I am not sure why the authors bring phase separation into this story, if they do, they should also be aware of counter-arguments to HP1 inducing phase separation (Erdel et al., 2020. PMID: 32101700).</p><p>– Line 51-53: The authors refer to results in flies and mice but only reference a single fly paper. Shortly after (line 57), they cite 3 papers (not correctly formatted) for Piwi causing H3K9 methylation, yet one of them, Derricarrere et al., only showed that Piwi cleavage activity is needed and did not provide any analysis of its role in H3K9 methylation, while some relevant papers are missing.</p><p>– Line 59-61: The authors say that the piRNA-Piwi complex recruits heterochromatin factors, including histone methyltransferases for H3K9me3 deposition. The papers cited refer to Piwi inducing H3K9me3, without either of them showing recruitment of the HMT. On the other hand, they miss citing the paper that comes closest to showing recruitment mechanism of the HMT. In addition, they cite one of two papers describing Panx (why not the paper by Brennecke?) and one on the SFINX complex (this time only the Brennecke paper out of 4 parallel papers), the first a factor of unknown function and the 2nd an RNA binding complex. This seems like a random choice of factors (excluding Arx, the RDC complex, etc.) and a random choice of references for those.</p><p>6) Figures and figure legends:</p><p>– Figure legend 5: panel &quot;C&quot; is missing.</p><p>– Color scheme in Figure 4H is missing?</p><p>– Figure 7B-D it would help if the panels would indicate what the difference is so one does not have to look in the figure legend.</p><p>– For suppl. figure 5 and 7Y axis label is missing. Are these different stages?</p><p>– For suppl. figure 11 the colors are not indicated (for the different stages, so one hast to look at the main figures to know what stage is which color). Also, the &quot;position of called peaks&quot; indicated at the top of panels would need to be mentioned in the figure legends in all figures.</p><p>Just a suggestion: While the figures are very nice in color (and consistent throughout the manuscript), the color choices are making it essentially impossible to look at the data on a black and white printout. While this is by itself not a huge issue, I generally prefer plots that do not depend on color printouts. E.g., in Figure 3E-F the two colors look identical in BandW and, accordingly, it is impossible to determine what the lower and upper half of the chromosome arm markings are in 3F. If the colors are left the same, it would help to better describe this in the figure legends. Numerous other examples of colors being hard to evaluate in BandW are found, that I do not list.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wei et al., determined genome-wide repressive histone H3 lysine K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) marks during precisely timed developmental stages in <italic>Drosophila</italic> miranda embryos. Heterochromatin formation by H3K9me3 was profiled starting 3.5 hours post fertilization (9 cell divisions, &quot;stage 3&quot;) up to gastrulation (14 cell divisions, &quot;stage 7&quot;). While a proportion of stage 3 were transient, early stage 4 H3K9me3 peaks seem to nucleate and correlate very well with repressive chromatin spreading in later stages.</p><p>The authors profile RNA expression at several stages as well as maternally deposited small RNAs right after fertilization (&quot;stage 1&quot;). The RNA expression data confirms silencing of loci that nucleate heterochromatin formation at stage 4. Wei et al. find abundant PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that target transposon sequences and examine their potential to guide H3K9me3 deposition as previously observed in Drosphila <italic>melanogaster</italic> and other organisms. Transposons that have repressive H3K9me3 marks at stage 3 are piRNA targets, suggesting maternally deposited piRNAs may guide this early heterochromatin induction. However, piRNA target sites do not correlate with H3K9me3 positions at these loci, making the link between stage 1 piRNAs and transcriptional silencing at stage 3 rather speculative.</p><p>The detailed H3K9me3 data in <italic>D. miranda</italic> reveals interesting patterns of heterochromatin establishment over transposable elements (TEs). Several LTR-retrotransposons exhibit nucleation at their 5'-end, while other non-LTR elements show early enrichment at their 3'-ends.

As suggested, we performed additional ChIP analysis using different antibodies, and indeed, a substantial number of stage 3 peaks (especially temporary peaks) are indeed phantom peaks. We therefore have considerably re‐worked our current paper and re‐analyzed all of our data. Indeed, elimination of the former phantom peaks has allowed us to uncover nucleation sites in transposable elements that target initial H3K9me3 deposition, followed by spreading around those nucleation sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A clear characterization of embryo staging for D. miranda is required. In contrast to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the biology of early embryogenesis in D.miranda is not well studied and the authors should first demonstrate by immunocytology that their staging really is correct in respect to the drawings provided in Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously done careful developmental staging of <italic>D. miranda</italic> (and its sister species <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>) (Lott et al., PLoS Genetics 2014), which our current staging is based on.

Furthermore, Kuntz and Eisen, (PLoS Genetics 2014) showed that across the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus, embryonic development is highly stereotypical with consistent timing of developmental landmarks. These two papers are now cited to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Limiting the ChIP-seq analysis to H3K9me3 could mask the establishment of silencing. The conclusion that so-called 'temporary H3K9me3 peaks' indicate regions not establishing heterochromatin might be a misinterpretation because it is not shown whether these are only initiated by H3K9me3 but maintained in their heterochromatic state by H3K9me2 indexing. This would be resolved by investigating H3K9me2 peaks during development.</p></disp-quote><p>Silencing could indeed be achieved by other means, including H3K9me2, and we made sure not to claim otherwise. Importantly, we no longer focus on temporary H3K9me3 peaks, and instead focus on how H3K9me3 is established during early embryogenesis. Note, we now show (supplementary figure 1) that H3K9me2 enrichment is almost identical to H3K9me3, albeit at later developmental stages (stage 5), but with much lower enrichment, as the H3K9me2 antibody is likely less sensitive for the purpose of ChIPseq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this point, the authors should show also H3K9me3 staining in salivary glands of D. miranda, as the two markers might look distinct.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously published salivary gland squashes of <italic>D. miranda</italic>, stained for H3K9me2 and HP1a (Zhou et al., PLoS Biol 2013; Figure 1). As expected for heterochromatin, these regions don’t polytenize and all the staining is observed in the chromocenter in females (apart from the heterochromatic island on Mulller B and E which correspond to former centromeres, and were described in previous publications; Mahajan et al., 2018 PLoS Bio, Bracewell et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2019; these islands are also found in our H3K9me3 profiles; see Figure 2A). In males, the euchromatic parts of the neo‐Y show some structure and are interspersed by heterochromatin, but it is not possible to localize anything on these messy chromosome squashes (see Zhou et al., PLoS Biol 2013; or Bachtrog, MBE, 2003, Figure 4 for an attempt to map TEs on the neoY). As mentioned, we have also done H3K9me2 ChIP‐seq at embryonic stage 5, which shows highly similar enrichment pattern to H3K9me3 (supplementary figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) No direct evidence is provided to support the claim that piRNAs has a role in heterochromatin formation. The claim is based on the observation that 'persistent' H3K9me3 peaks are proximal to piRNA-enriched TEs, but the authors should either provide direct evidence (such as by deleting or introducing piRNA-enriched TEs into the genome near some of the stage 3 peaks and see how this affects heterochromatin formation), or significantly tone down their claims, including by removing this conclusion from the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We tone down our claims, and also changed the title. Please note that <italic>D. miranda</italic> is a non‐model species, and it is currently not possible to do any of these experiments. We have extended our analyses of piRNA (sense and antisense piRNA) mapping to TEs and expression analysis, and show that early nucleating TEs are highly targeted by maternal piRNAs and show early zygotic transcription, consistent with a model of co‐transcriptional silencing of TEs by small RNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The reviewers have additional concerns about data analysis/interpretation, most of which can potentially be addressed by text changes or additional data analyses. Specifically:</p><p>a. Figure 5B: The spreading of H3K9me3 appears to follow a different pattern in different replicates. In repl. 7-8, the sharp H3K9me3 peaks remain sharp at stage7. This suggests that heterochromatin spreading does not take place around these peaks. On the contrary, repl 1-2 show that almost half of the less robust H3K9me3 peaks expand into their surrounding regions at stage7. The authors should try to explain why heterochromatin spreading is observed only in a few replicates and how do they reconcile their model with the observation that sharp peaks appear to result in less spreading. This would also influence the interpretations of Figure 6 D and Sup. 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this figure and the corresponding analyses, and we no longer draw conclusions based on between replicates analyses. Also, we have de‐emphasized the difference between persistent and temporary peaks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors showed the patterns of stage3 H3K9me3 peaks vary depending on replicates. Does this epigenetic variegation during stage3 affect the final landscape of H3K9me3 after heterochromatin formation is completed? Although the stage3 H3K9me3 peaks are not identical between replicates, all the replicates may share the regions where the peaks are observed; in that case heterochromatin formation takes place at similar regions, which would result in very similar H3K9me3 patterns at stage7. Did the author compare the patterns of H3K9me3 at stage7 between replicates-are they identical, or different?</p></disp-quote><p>See previous reply.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. What is happening to the peaks and the surrounding regions where signals are invisible (the lower parts of each panel) in Fig6 F and G? Are the signals completely absent, or do they have weak signals with a similar tendency as observed at the peaks of the upper parts? If former is the case, how do the authors apply their model to those peaks?</p></disp-quote><p>These plots/analyses are no longer employed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The spike-in normalization is potentially problematic. From methods: &quot;when there is more than one alignment of equal mapping quality, the read will be randomly assigned to one of the targets&quot; – wouldn't this cause reads derived from real H3K9me3 peaks from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to get assigned to identical sequences of D. miranda due to the randomization? Are the results (especially for stage 3 peaks) reproducible without spike-ins? Will the results hold if all reads mapping to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are discarded prior to mapping to D. miranda?</p></disp-quote><p>In our mapping strategy, only regions of the genomes with 100% sequence homology will result in misassignments between the genomes. This is very rare given that the species have over 20 million years of divergence. In fact, using our strategy to map and assign a <italic>D. miranda</italic> male WGS sample, only 0.08% of reads are misassigned to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (19,064/22,080,589 reads). Reciprocally, if we map a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> male sample to the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome, the incorrect assignment rate is 0.035% (14,396/40,672,211 reads). The issue with sequential mapping is that reads originating from regions with moderate homology between the species will successfully map to the other species, and we avoid this by mapping reads to a concatenated genome. Mapping the <italic>D. miranda</italic> male sample to the <italic>D. melanogster</italic> genome, we get mapping rates of 8.86% (1,957,202/22,080,589 reads), which means that these reads would be tossed regardless of the fact that they map better to the <italic>D. miranda</italic> genome. Even if we filter the reads by a very stringent mapping quality score (MAPQ &gt;= 50), the mapping rate is 5.47% (1,208,224/22,080,589).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer notes that additional caveats might arise from using <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos for spike-in normalization. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, heterochromatin formation by H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 becomes visible around cycle 9-10. In stage 7 embryos gastrulation is already progressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and spike-in normalization with these embryos might be problematic if earlier embryos of D. miranda (cycle 10-13) are compared as well as by the significant differences in repeated sequences between the two species.</p></disp-quote><p>In Vlassova et al., 1991, C‐banding shows differentiation of heterochromatin and euchromatin during blastoderm embryos but the nuclear cycle is not well defined. Based on Yuan and O’Farrell, (2016), H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 only becomes cytologically visible at interphase 12 and 13, respectively. Our use of a spike‐in was to ensure that the enrichment in our <italic>D. miranda</italic> samples can be compared and normalized to a standard. Using later stages where the H3K9me3 signal is robust is actually preferable because it provides more consistent signal of enrichment in the spike‐in. We are unsure as to why differing repeat content between the species would be problematic; in fact, it is beneficial when mapping ChIP‐seq reads, as it avoids problems with putative cross‐mapping between species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. The authors note that the early non-persistent peaks are highly variable, only appearing in a few of the libraries. Two key questions arise: could the random assignment of reads to different mapping sites cause peaks and could the number of microsatellite copies in the genome be underestimated in the assembly? Random assignment of repetitive sequences to mapping sites might result in stochastic appearance of peaks, especially if there are many repeat copies and few reads. Would these peaks continue to be strong and stochastic if reads were mapped to all sites weighted by mapping site number? The authors mention that some peaks are present with unique mapping, but don't mention whether uniquely mapping peaks are similarly or less stochastic than ones that map to multiple loci. Do the authors ever observe &quot;apparent&quot; depletion at any of these sites compared to input (i.e., if peaks are due to random assignment there should also be &quot;random peaks&quot; in the input)? How certain are the authors about the exact copy number of the microsatellites? If microsatellite copies are underestimated, then peaks could appear due to &quot;apparent&quot; oversampling. While the authors attempted to account for this issue using DNA-seq libraries, the combination of random assignment of reads and unmapped microsatellite sequences might lead to apparent enrichments, which could appear stronger or more wide-spread due to unidentified microsatellite copies.</p></disp-quote><p>This part has been removed from the manuscript (see our reply to 6a). Random assignment of reads at repetitive sequences will actually cause less stochasticity in peaks. For example, if there are two identical repetitive regions and only one region has enrichment, stochastic mapping will cause similar number of reads to be assigned to both copies causing two similar looking peaks. By necessity, repetitive sequences create a lot of reads which will therefore be more evenly assigned across copies by chance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. The authors argue that &quot;technical noise does not account for the observation that peaks are enriched for microsatellites, and only a small fraction of repeats are enriched with H3K9me3 at stage 3&quot;. However, given how widespread microsatellites are across the genome (&gt;200,000 loci), I wonder if the overlap with the stage 3 H3K9me3 is by random chance. Would random sampling of the genome with equal number of genomic regions as the stage 3 H3K9me3 TR-associated peaks result in similar overlap with TRs? If it is not random, what is special about the occupied TRs compared to the remaining ~99% of TRs in the genome – e.g., do they have higher accessibility, transcription, specific sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>This part has been removed from the manuscript (see our reply to 6a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. While piRNA-initiated heterochromatin spreads, it is hard to imagine how a single nucleosome (143bp or 124bp genomic length) can be targeted by a TE that is hundreds or even up to 10 kb away. Spreading from this distance would result in broad peaks (like the authors observe at later stages) and not targeting of distant specific individual nucleosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>The majority of the earliest nucleation sites at stage 3 (figure 3E) are found within TEs, and our paper now focuses on these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. The authors should also more carefully interpret accessibility differences using ATAC-seq because significant transitions in chromatin indexing during early embryonic development in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were recently demonstrated occurring before and during heterochromatin establishment.

We generated ATACseq from single embryos at the same developmental stages as the ChIP‐Seq. The use of single embryo here is to account for coverage differences between sex chromosomes in male and female embryos. We used the metric ATAC‐enrichment, which is number of ATAC‐seq reads divided by number of DNA‐seq reads. This accounts for the difference in read coverage of sex chromosomes and copy number in repeats.

The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. No additional experiments are required, but some data reanalysis might be needed.

Please carefully address the points raised by the reviewers in a revised version of the manuscript, with a specific attention to the comments highlighted here.</p><p>Both reviewers have issues with the authors' claims about the role of piRNAs in heterochromatin nucleation. Specifically, the concern refers to the claim that on one hand piRNAs are important for nucleation, but on the other hand piRNAs do not map at sites where the nucleations occur. The reviewers also offer somewhat different interpretation of the presented data, suggesting that he point the authors would like to make is not clear. I am copying here the comments on this point, which require significant revision of the main text, a clearer model/conclusion, and editing of the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our wording on the role of piRNAs in heterochromatin nucleation was a bit confusing. We have reworded several sentences in the manuscript, and include new panels in Figure 3 and Figure 4, to clarify our observations and interpretations (which have been clearly spelled out by reviewer 2 as well). We find that piRNA’s are highly enriched in genomic regions containing H3K9me3 nucleation sites (Figure 3G, Figure 4H). In addition, the association between early nucleation and abundant piRNA at specific TEs (Figure 6A) as well as inferred zygotic transcription of these TEs (Figure 6C, D) is consistent with the proposed model of co‐transcriptional silencing of TEs, where PIWI/piRNA complexes bind to nascent TE transcripts and induce heterochromatin in the proximity. We de‐emphasize the fact that early H3K9me3 peaks and the positions of piRNA’s don’t overlap, since, as reviewer 2 points out as well, this may not be expected, and does not mean that piRNAs are not important in targeting heterochromatin. What we were trying to say in our manuscript is that heterochromatin nucleation happens at particular sequences on TEs (as shown in Figure 5), and this site‐specificity is not driven by piRNA. Thus, we favor a model where</p><p>PIWI/piRNAs recruit the heterochromatin machinery to nascent transcripts, and targeted nucleation at particular sequences nearby is then driven by other factors (possibly transcription initiation for TRAM TE, Figure 5, Figure 7). We are also cognizant that our results do not directly show these things, so we have toned down our wording in presenting these results in the abstract and main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2: Based on the fact that piRNA mappings along the TEs show no correlation with nucleation sites the authors speculate that some other mechanism might be responsible for nucleation (transcription itself or Zn-finger proteins) and piRNAs induce spreading. While this can certainly not be excluded, I am not sure where the expectation that a complex that binds nascent transcript would induce changes on the DNA at the same sequence as where it associates with the RNA comes from. In fact that seems relatively unlikely to me. Instead, I would think that recruitment of the complex on nascent transcript will induce nucleation in the proximity and that other factors (e.g., location of txn initiation or binding of other chromatin factors) determine where chromatin modification nucleates. Antisense piRNAs are mostly derived from piRNA clusters, which contain fragments of TEs, often lacking intact promoters (keeping all the TE promoters would increase transcriptional interference within the cluster). Thus, if nucleation occurs at promoters (as the authors observe for several TEs), piRNAs might predominantly not be able to target this region as clusters might be deprived of TSSs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree that it is not quite clear what the expectation should be regarding piRNA reads mapping and nucleation sites even if piRNA is the targeting mechanism to TEs. We fully agree that piRNA may direct the recruitment of HMTs to nascent transcript bringing it to the proximity of TE; nucleation at specific positions may then be signaled by other features (e.g. TSS or Znf). As mentioned above, what we were trying to say is that it is not piRNA that confer the sequence-specificity for heterochromatin formation, and we have reworded our manuscript to make this point more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 4: The correlation between piRNAs and H3K9me3 peaks seems marginal if at all. The last sentence of the abstract, while most likely true, seems a gross over-interpretation of the results. While I can well imagine how small RNA at one stage guide H3K9me3 at a later stage, the absence of correlation with H3K9me3 peaks make this scenario a long stretch. Therefore, the reasoning in the manuscript becomes pretty confusing. That maternally deposited piRNAs may be instrumental in suppressing this group of TEs is interesting and well possible but hard to conclude from the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out above, we have rephrased several statements and added new figure panels to make our point more clearly. We see several lines of evidence linking piRNA and TEs suppression: We find that genomic regions that contain early nucleating sites are enriched for piRNA’s (Figure 3G, Figure 4H). Further, we find that early nucleating TEs are highly enriched for high sense and anti‐sense maternal piRNA (Figure 6A) and that piRNA abundance is significantly correlated with the extent of H3K9me3 enrichment across TEs and this correlation becomes stronger over developmental stages (Figure 6B). This in conjunction with our finding that early nucleating TEs show early zygotic transcription (Figure 6C) led us to suggest that maternally deposited piRNAs are important for the co‐transcriptional silencing of TEs via H3K9me3 deposition, which is consistent with previously suggested models. As suggested by reviewer 2 (and we are in full agreement), these results can be interpreted as (or is consistent with the model) piRNAmediated recruitment to nascent transcripts which brings the machinery in close proximity to other features on or around TE insertions (TSS or ZNF) that direct nucleation. Nevertheless, we have toned down our conclusion/interpretation: The last sentence of the abstract now reads:</p><p>“These results support the model of piRNA‐associated co‐transcriptional silencing while also raising the possibility of additional mechanisms for site‐restricted H3K9me3 nucleation at TEs during early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the piRNA data presentation: I don't see the value in showing correlation lines and r-values in figures 6D, E, F, 4H when there is no correlation visible. 3H, S9 (x-axis = kb from peak?) make the reader wonder how piRNA distribution look like further (than 2kb) away from the peak of H3K9me3. Is there any accumulation around peaks? Perhaps piRNA accumulation and distribution could be better grasped in browser shots like S5 and S7 with an additional piRNA track?</p></disp-quote><p>For figures 3H, S9, 6D, we show the regression lines and Pearson’s correlation coefficients precisely to show the lack of correlation. However, for figures 6E and F, we do not agree that the correlations are of no value. For 6F, there is a visually clear and strongly statistically significant negative correlation between piRNA abundance and TE transcript abundance; this is visible even without the regression line. For 6E, we show increasing correlation between mean enrichment across TE and mean piRNA mapping to the TE. The associations here are visibly noisy but the correlations are strong for the later developmental stages (4e and 7) as per the p‐values and correlation coefficients.</p><p>We also added piRNA distribution of up to 10kb around the peaks in Figure 3 —figure supplement 4 and Figure 4 —figure supplement 3B, which do not show piRNA enrichment around peaks (or specific positions near peaks), but as pointed out above, genomic regions containing H3K9me3 peaks are strongly enriched for piRNA (Figure 3G, Figure 4H).

We are not trying to say that early transcription per se is responsible for silencing, but the current model of co‐transcriptional silencing of TEs invokes nascent transcript for piRNAs to target their genomic region. We are showing that TEs that are early transcribed are exactly the ones that are silenced the earliest (TEs with stage 3 peaks also show zygotic transcription between stage 2 and 4). For the TEs that nucleate after stage3 (stage4 TEs in figure 6), they show increase in expression between stage 4 and stage 5 (Figure 6C). We interpret this to mean that even if a TE like TRAM evolve to become late expressing, the same mechanism for transcription‐associated nucleation is likely also present. These results are consistent with the current model for cotranscriptional silencing of TEs where piRNA and PIWI target TE nascent transcripts (Ozata et al., 2019). From an arms‐race stand point, we would actually speculate that early expressing TEs may have more time to remain highly expressed prior to full heterochromatin establishment, despite having early nucleation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments that need careful consideration, text rewriting, and potentially some re-analyses:</p><p>1) I am a little confused by the logic of how transcription is responsible for K9me3 peak initiation when the authors describe that both for stage 3 and stage 4 nucleating peaks the transcript level increases later, at stage 4 and 4-5, respectively. To me the data suggests that nucleation induces transcription (admittedly, this is going against the assumed function of K9me3) rather than the other way around.</p></disp-quote><p>The model of co‐transcriptional silencing of TEs involves targeting of the PIWI/piRNA complex to nascent transcripts, which in turn recruits the silencing machinery, including HMT, that induce H3K9me3.

How do the authors explain this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>For these boxplots, we are averaging across only parts of the elements in both the full length and (most of the) truncated elements; this is meant to provide comparison between homologous regions between the truncated and full‐length copies. For 7B (5’truncations), we are averaging across 1000‐2708bp of the internal coding sequence of both of the full‐length insertions. However, for 7C (3’ truncations), we are averaging across 1‐1708bp of full‐length elements. Because of this, the enrichment in 7C includes the 5’ nucleation (elevated H3K9me3) sites thus elevating the averaged enrichment, while those in 7B lack the 5’ nucleation sites thus lowering the averaged enrichment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The H3K9me3 patterns along TEs are intriguing and very interesting. The authors may want to group and present TEs by class, at least discuss them by class in the text. This may explain &quot;discrepancies&quot; between transposon families. It seems LTR-retroelements show 5'-nucleation while non-LTR elements have a 3'-bias? The findings could be further elevated by discussing patterns in other organisms, perhaps data in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is available? In mouse and primates, 5'-nucleation has been observed by: Rebollo, 2011 Plos Genetics; Wolf, 2015 Genes Dev; Walter, 2016 eLife; Imbeault 2017 Nature; Wolf, 2020 eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now grouped TEs by their classes in Figure 5A.

For the non‐LTR retrotransposons, we see nucleation in various positions. The R1 variant in figure 5 show nucleation near 3’, however another variant in Supp figure 11 shows nucleation near 5’.

In Figure S6 and 3G (upper third coordinates) there are a couple of loci that are expressed throughout stages. What are they?

Figure 3 – supplement 3B shows the breakdown (in pie chart) of the proportion of the genes overlapping stage 3 peaks that have maternal transcripts compared to that of all genes. Consistent with our conclusion that maternal transcripts of these genes are unlikely to contribute to early stage 3 nucleation, no difference (40% vs 39.8%) was observed. We also now added a supplementary file 2 documenting the mapping statistics (to TEs, genes) of the RNA‐seq data, and adjusted the color scheme of the heatmaps to make them more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Many references are missing (especially for piRNAs and k9me nucleation) as detailed in the 'recommendations for the authors' section. The authors also identify several errors or missing text in the main text and figure, as clarified in the 'Recommendations for the authors' section that follows.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added all the recommended literature (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The resubmitted version of the manuscript makes less profound claims than the original one. This is mostly due to the fact that many of the original peaks they found in early embryos turned out to be artifacts. Based on the current results, the main claims are that nucleation at TEs starts as early as stage 3 of embryonic development and that early nucleation is predominantly on active TEs (often at their promoters) and leads to more robust H3K9 methylation at later stages. The authors find that early nucleating TEs are highly targeted by maternal piRNAs and show early zygotic transcription consistent with the prevailing model that piRNA-induced transcriptional silencing requires transcription.</p><p>The new version of the manuscript is toned down and makes claims that are consistent with the data. The authors have addressed all the concerns except for proper references, although this mainly is due to removing a large fraction of the previous data that was fund to be a technical artifact and by toning down claims that were based on correlations. Whether these current results are still sufficiently interesting for publication in eLife is not my responsibility to decide. I do find the observation of very early nucleation, which is consistent with piRNA-mediated early establishment of K9-methylation over TEs, interesting and, although not very surprising, still worth publishing.</p><p>I have a few remaining comments, which mostly indicate some level of sloppiness and the lack of familiarity with the piRNA field as well as some disagreement with the author's interpretations of the data.</p><p>1) I am a little confused by the logic of how transcription is responsible for K9me3 peak initiation when the authors describe that both for stage 3 and stage 4 nucleating peaks the transcript level increases later, at stage 4 and 4-5, respectively. To me the data suggests that nucleation induces transcription (admittedly, this is going against the assumed function of K9me3) rather than the other way around.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on the fact that piRNA mappings along the TEs show no correlation with nucleation sites the authors speculate that some other mechanism might be responsible for nucleation (transcription itself or Zn-finger proteins) and piRNAs induce spreading. While this can certainly not be excluded, I am not sure where the expectation that a complex that binds nascent transcript would induce changes on the DNA at the same sequence as where it associates with the RNA comes from. In fact that seems relatively unlikely to me. Instead, I would think that recruitment of the complex on nascent transcript will induce nucleation in the proximity and that other factors (e.g., location of txn initiation or binding of other chromatin factors) determine where chromatin modification nucleates. Antisense piRNAs are mostly derived from piRNA clusters, which contain fragments of TEs, often lacking intact promoters (keeping all the TE promoters would increase transcriptional interference within the cluster). Thus, if nucleation occurs at promoters (as the authors observe for several TEs), piRNAs might predominantly not be able to target this region as clusters might be deprived of TSSs.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, the authors speculate that specificity for nucleation might be provided by the act of transcription of TEs (line 396-98), which from an evolutionary arms race perspective I really don't like, as TEs like to evade repression and thus would likely change their expression profile to later stages if very early transcription initiation is the cause of more robust silencing.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Around line 308 the authors describe that the weak fold difference in K9me3 levels between the truncated and full-length copies is likely a sever underestimation because non-unique mappings are distributed evenly amongst copies. Why did the authors not look at unique mappers?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 7B-C it is perplexing that the H3K9me3 enrichment in the last 1kb of internal sequence of TEs is higher in the full-length, while in the first 1kb internal sequence it is higher in the truncated copies. How do the authors explain this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) References remain insufficient and often wrong or at least not referring to the primary/first discovery. It is very apparent that the authors have not obtained a broad knowledge of the piRNA field and/or have done a sloppy job with the references even after this was raised in the first round of review. Here are some examples:</p><p>– Line 42: While I am not sure why the authors bring phase separation into this story, if they do, they should also be aware of counter-arguments to HP1 inducing phase separation (Erdel et al., 2020. PMID: 32101700).</p></disp-quote><p>We include the citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 51-53: The authors refer to results in flies and mice but only reference a single fly paper. Shortly after (line 57), they cite 3 papers (not correctly formatted) for Piwi causing H3K9 methylation, yet one of them, Derricarrere et al., only showed that Piwi cleavage activity is needed and did not provide any analysis of its role in H3K9 methylation, while some relevant papers are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We include more citations. Citation of Derricarrere et al., was meant for “Independent of the posttranscriptional cleavage activity” at the beginning of the sentence. We have moved the citation to right after it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 59-61: The authors say that the piRNA-Piwi complex recruits heterochromatin factors, including histone methyltransferases for H3K9me3 deposition. The papers cited refer to Piwi inducing H3K9me3, without either of them showing recruitment of the HMT. On the other hand, they miss citing the paper that comes closest to showing recruitment mechanism of the HMT. In addition, they cite one of two papers describing Panx (why not the paper by Brennecke?) and one on the SFINX complex (this time only the Brennecke paper out of 4 parallel papers), the first a factor of unknown function and the 2nd an RNA binding complex. This seems like a random choice of factors (excluding Arx, the RDC complex, etc.) and a random choice of references for those.</p></disp-quote><p>We include more citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figures and figure legends:</p><p>– Figure legend 5: panel &quot;C&quot; is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Color scheme in Figure 4H is missing?</p></disp-quote><p>Added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7B-D it would help if the panels would indicate what the difference is so one does not have to look in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For suppl. figure 5 and 7Y axis label is missing.

While this is by itself not a huge issue, I generally prefer plots that do not depend on color printouts. E.g., in Figure 3E-F the two colors look identical in BandW and, accordingly, it is impossible to determine what the lower and upper half of the chromosome arm markings are in 3F. If the colors are left the same, it would help to better describe this in the figure legends. Numerous other examples of colors being hard to evaluate in BandW are found, that I do not list.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately given the number of stages to compare using other means of discriminating them (like dotted lines or different shaped points) just end up being even harder to interpret. We changed the colors in 3E and F for better discrimination. For F the two colors are actually plotted separately – one on top and one on the bottom.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The H3K9me3 patterns along TEs are intriguing and very interesting. The authors may want to group and present TEs by class, at least discuss them by class in the text. This may explain &quot;discrepancies&quot; between transposon families. It seems LTR-retroelements show 5'-nucleation while non-LTR elements have a 3'-bias? The findings could be further elevated by discussing patterns in other organisms, perhaps data in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is available? In mouse and primates, 5'-nucleation has been observed by: Rebollo, 2011 Plos Genetics; Wolf, 2015 Genes Dev; Walter, 2016 eLife; Imbeault, 2017 Nature; Wolf, 2020 eLife.</p><p>In mouse and human, this nucleation is often (but perhaps not always) guided by ZFP which the authors point out are not conserved in flies. Given the similar patterns, this may still point to a highly conserved targeting mechanism for H3K9me3.</p><p>H3K9me3 induction at several LTR-retroelements in mouse have been shown to initiate at their highly conserved tRNA primer binding site and spread from there (Rebollo, 2011 Plos Genetics; Wolf, 2015 Genes Dev).

The last sentence of the abstract, while most likely true, seems a gross over-interpretation of the results. While I can well imagine how small RNA at one stage guide H3K9me3 at a later stage, the absence of correlation with H3K9me3 peaks make this scenario a long stretch. Therefore, the reasoning in the manuscript becomes pretty confusing. That maternally deposited piRNAs may be instrumental in suppressing this group of TEs is interesting and well possible but hard to conclude from the presented data.</p><p>On the piRNA data presentation: I don't see the value in showing correlation lines and r-values in figures 6D, E, F, 4H when there is no correlation visible. 3H, S9 (x-axis = kb from peak?) make the reader wonder how piRNA distribution look like further (than 2kb) away from the peak of H3K9me3. Is there any accumulation arounds peaks? Perhaps piRNA accumulation and distribution could be better grasped in browser shots like S5 and S7 with an additional piRNA track?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the y-axis unit in Figure 5D, G, J? For small RNAs, it is common to calculate normalized read counts in RPM (reads per total mio mapped). However, 5000RPM would be a lot?!
