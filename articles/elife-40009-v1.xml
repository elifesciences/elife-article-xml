post-transcriptionally regulated by sterol-accelerated degradation. Under cholesterol-replete conditions, HMGCR is ubiquitinated and degraded, but the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) responsible for mammalian HMGCR turnover remains controversial. Using systematic, unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screens with a sterol-sensitive endogenous HMGCR reporter, we comprehensively map the E3 ligase landscape required for sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation. We find that RNF145 and gp78 independently co-ordinate HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation. RNF145, a sterol-responsive ER-resident E3 ligase, is unstable but accumulates following sterol depletion. Sterol addition triggers RNF145 recruitment to HMGCR via Insigs, promoting HMGCR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. In the absence of both RNF145 and gp78, Hrd1, a third UBE2G2-dependent E3 ligase, partially regulates HMGCR activity. Our findings reveal a critical role for the sterol-responsive RNF145 in HMGCR regulation and elucidate the complexity of sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Yet, it also has a reputation for clogging arteries and causing heart attacks and strokes. Our organism can adjust the amount of cholesterol it creates through an enzyme called HMGCR, which is found in all cells. Switching off HMGCR, for instance by taking drugs called statins, reduces the amount of cholesterol made by cells. To regulate the activity of HMGCR, the body uses proteins known as E3 ubiquitin ligases, which can label the enzyme for destruction. However, the identity of the ligases that target HMGCR is a matter of intense debate.</p><p>Here, Menzies, Volkmar et al. addressed this issue by using an approach called a genome-wide CRISPR forward genetic screen. First, HMGCR was marked inside the cells with a fluorescent tag to watch how its levels change in response to different amounts of cholesterol. Then, each gene in the cell was deleted, and the effects recorded. This allowed Menzies, Volkmar et al. to find the genes responsible for the rapid destruction of HMGCR.</p><p>The experiments revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF145 and gp78 are independently responsible for the degradation of the majority of HMGCR, with a third ligase, Hrd1, getting involved if the first two are absent. In particular, RNF145 builds up when a cell is starved of cholesterol, but it immediately marks HMGCR for destruction once cholesterol becomes more abundant. This ligase can therefore both sense and respond to the amount of cholesterol in a cell, making it a perfect candidate for regulating HMGCR based on what the body needs.</p><p>Identifying the proteins that adjust the levels of HMGCR sheds light on how a cell controls the amount of cholesterol it creates. This knowledge could be relevant in the fight against the health problems associated with this molecule.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNF145</kwd><kwd>gp78</kwd><kwd>HMGCR</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>ER associated degradation</kwd><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210688/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102770/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathan</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Menzies</surname><given-names>Sam A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screens using sterol-sensitive endogenous HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) reporter identify the sterol-responsive RNF145 and gp78 as independently responsible for sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis. As an abundant lipid in the eukaryotic plasma membrane, it modulates vital processes including membrane fluidity and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haines, 2001</xref>) and serves as a precursor for important metabolites including steroid hormones and bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Payne and Hales, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang, 2013</xref>). The cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in mammalian cells also provides intermediates for essential non-steroid isoprenoids and therefore requires strict regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>). The endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) resident, polytopic membrane glycoprotein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) is central to this pathway, catalysing the formation of mevalonate, a crucial isoprenoid precursor. As the rate-limiting enzyme in mevalonate metabolism, HMGCR levels need to be tightly regulated, as dictated by intermediates and products of the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson and DeBose-Boyd, 2018</xref>). The statin family of drugs, which acts as competitive inhibitors of HMGCR, represents the single most successful approach to reducing plasma cholesterol levels and therefore preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heart Protection Study Collaborative Group, 2002</xref>). Understanding how HMGCR is regulated is therefore of fundamental biological and clinical importance.</p><p>Cholesterol, together with its biosynthetic intermediates and isoprenoid derivatives, regulates HMGCR expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson and DeBose-Boyd, 2018</xref>). Low cholesterol induces transcriptional activation of HMGCR through the sterol response element binding proteins (SREBPs) which bind SREs in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osborne, 1991</xref>). In a cholesterol-rich environment, SREBPs are inactive and held in the ER in complex with their cognate chaperone SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in association with the ER-resident Insulin-induced genes 1/2 (Insig-1/2) anchor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong and Tang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yabe et al., 2002</xref>). A decrease in membrane cholesterol triggers dissociation of the SCAP-SREBP complex from Insigs and translocation to the Golgi apparatus, where the SREBP transcription factor is proteolytically activated by Site-1 and Site-2 proteases, released into the cytosol and trafficked to the nucleus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horton et al., 2002</xref>). Low sterol levels therefore dramatically increase both HMGCR mRNA and extend HMGCR protein half-life, ensuring the resultant elevated enzyme levels stimulate the supply of mevalonate to re-balance cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown et al., 1973</xref>). Once cholesterol levels are restored, excess HMGCR is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in a process termed sterol-accelerated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hampton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ravid et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>). This joint transcriptional and translational regulation of HMGCR is controlled by a host of ER-resident polytopic membrane proteins and represents a finely balanced homeostatic mechanism to rapidly regulate this critical enzyme in response to alterations in intracellular cholesterol. While the ubiquitin-mediated, post-translational regulation of HMGCR is well-established, the identity of the critical mammalian ER-associated degradation (ERAD) E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) responsible for sterol-accelerated HMGCR ERAD remains controversial.</p><p>In yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> encodes three ERAD E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which Hrd1p (HMG-CoA degradation 1), is named for its ability to degrade yeast HMGCR (Hmg2p) in response to non-sterol isoprenoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hampton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bays et al., 2001</xref>). The marked expansion and diversification of E3 ligases in mammals makes the situation more complex, as in human cells there are 37 putative E3 ligases involved in ERAD, few of which are well-characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaneko et al., 2016</xref>). Hrd1 and gp78 represent the two mammalian orthologues of yeast Hrd1p. Hrd1 was not found to regulate HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nadav et al., 2003</xref>). However, gp78 was reported to be responsible for the sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR as (i) gp78 associates with Insig-1 in a sterol-independent manner, (ii) Insig-1 mediates a sterol-dependent interaction between HMGCR and gp78, (iii) overexpression of the transmembrane domains of gp78 exerted a dominant-negative effect and inhibited HMGCR degradation, and (iv), siRNA-mediated depletion of gp78 resulted in decreased sterol-induced ubiquitination and degradation of HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2005</xref>). The same laboratory subsequently suggested that the sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR was mediated by two ERAD E3 ubiquitin ligases, with TRC8 involved in addition to gp78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jo et al., 2011</xref>). However, these findings remain controversial as, despite confirming a role for gp78 in the regulation of Insig-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>), an independent study found no evidence for either gp78 or TRC8 in the sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the E3 ligase(s) responsible for the sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGCR remain disputed.</p><p>The introduction of systematic forward genetic screening approaches to mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) has made the unbiased identification of E3 ubiquitin ligases more tractable, as demonstrated for the viral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van den Boomen and Lehner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van de Weijer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stagg et al., 2009</xref>) and endogenous regulation of MHC-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To identify the E3 ligases governing HMGCR ERAD, we applied a genome-wide forward genetic screen to a dynamic, cholesterol-sensitive reporter cell line, engineered to express a fluorescent protein fused to endogenous HMGCR. This approach identified cellular genes required for sterol-induced HMGCR degradation, including UBE2G2 and the RNF145 ERAD E3 ubiquitin ligase. The subtle phenotype observed upon RNF145 depletion alone suggested redundant ligase usage. A subsequent, targeted ubiquitome CRISPR/Cas9 screen in RNF145-knockout cells showed RNF145 to be functionally redundant with gp78, the E3 ligase originally implicated in HMGCR degradation. We confirmed that loss of gp78 alone showed no phenotype, while loss of both E3 ligases significantly inhibited the sterol-induced ubiquitination and degradation of HMGCR. Complete stabilisation required additional depletion of a third ligase - Hrd1. We find that endogenous RNF145 is an auto-regulated, sterol-responsive E3 ligase which is recruited to Insig proteins under sterol-replete conditions, thus promoting the regulated ubiquitination and sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGCR. Our data resolve the controversy of the E3 ligases responsible for the post-translational regulation of HMGCR and emphasise the complexity of the mammalian ubiquitin system in fine-tuning sterol-induced HMGCR turnover and cholesterol homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeted knock-in at the endogenous HMGCR locus creates a dynamic, cholesterol-sensitive reporter</title><p>To identify genes involved in the post-translational regulation of HMGCR, we engineered a cell line in which Clover, a bright fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam et al., 2012</xref>), was fused to the C-terminus of endogenous HMGCR, generating an HMGCR-Clover fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The resulting HMGCR-Clover Hela single-cell clone expresses a dynamic, cholesterol-sensitive fluorescent reporter that is highly responsive to fluctuations in intracellular cholesterol. Basal HMGCR-Clover levels in sterol-replete tissue culture media were undetectable by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and phenocopy endogenous WT HMGCR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 4). Following overnight sterol depletion, a ~ 25 fold increase in HMGCR-Clover expression was detected (shaded grey to blue histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (lanes 2 and 5)), representing a combination of increased SREBP-induced transcription and decreased sterol-induced HMGCR degradation. Reintroduction of sterols induced the rapid degradation of HMGCR-Clover (~80% decrease within 2 hr), confirming the sterol-dependent regulation of the reporter (blue to red histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Residual, untagged HMGCR detected by immunoblot analysis in the reporter cells under sterol-depleted conditions suggested that at least one HMGCR allele remained untagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 5), which was confirmed by PCR-amplification and sequencing of the genomic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The unmodified allele allowed us to monitor both tagged and untagged forms of HMGCR. Inhibiting the enzymatic activity of HMGCR with mevastatin also stabilised HMGCR-Clover expression, as did inhibition of the proteasome (bortezomib) or p97/VCP (NMS-873) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), confirming the rapid, steady-state degradation of the HMGCR reporter. Furthermore, we showed that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of both Insig-1 and −2 together induced a dramatic increase in HMGCR-Clover expression, equivalent to levels seen following sterol depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Under these conditions, the SREBP-SCAP complex is not retained in the ER, leading to constitutive SREBP-mediated transcription of HMGCR-Clover, irrespective of the sterol environment. CRISPR-mediated gene disruption of either Insig-1 or −2 alone caused only a small, steady-state rescue of HMGCR-Clover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which was more pronounced with the loss of Insig-1 than Insig-2. While Insig-1-deficient cells were unable to completely degrade HMGCR upon sterol addition, only a minor defect in HMGCR degradation was seen in the absence of Insig-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that Insig-1 is dominant over Insig-2 under these conditions. Finally, we confirmed that HMGCR-Clover was appropriately localised to the ER by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, HMGCR-Clover is a dynamic, cholesterol-sensitive reporter, which rapidly responds to changes in intracellular cholesterol and is regulated in a proteasome-dependent manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40009.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent protein tagging of endogenous HMGCR generates a cholesterol-sensitive dynamic reporter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing generation of the HMGCR-Clover reporter.

Interestingly, RNF145 also harbours a YLYF motif at its N-terminus, which is similar to the YIYF motif present in the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) of SCAP and HMGCR required for their binding to the Insig proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sever et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

Since the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligases regulating HMGCR turnover remains controversial, the modest effect of RNF145 loss on HMGCR-Clover sterol-induced degradation suggested the involvement of additional ligase(s).

This reporter cell line has the advantage of being able to identify both complete and partial phenotypes and helps explain why the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for the sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGCR has remained controversial. We find that three E3 ubiquitin ligases - RNF145, gp78 and Hrd1 - are together responsible for HMGCR degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The activity of the two primary ligases, RNF145 and gp78 is partially redundant as the loss of gp78 alone did not affect HMGCR degradation, while loss of RNF145 showed only a small reduction on HMGCR degradation. In the absence of both RNF145 and gp78, a third ligase, Hrd1, can compensate and partially regulate HGMCR degradation, but this effect of Hrd1 is only revealed in the absence of both RNF145 and gp78, and in no other identified combination.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40009.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Sterol-induced HMGCR degradation by RNF145, gp78 and Hrd1.</title><p>(i) Under sterol-depleted conditions (shaded orange), HMGCR, Insigs and RNF145 are transcriptionally induced leading to accumulation of RNF145 and HMGCR. Insigs are continually turned over by gp78-mediated polyubiquitination, extracted from the membrane by VCP and degraded by the 26S proteasome. HMGCR stability is dramatically increased as it is not engaged by either RNF145, gp78 or their shared E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2G2 (G2). In the presence of sterols (shaded blue), RNF145 and gp78 are recruited to HMGCR in an Insig-assisted fashion, mediating the sterol-accelerated and UBE2G2-dependent degradation of HMGCR by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Under these conditions both RNF145 and gp78 can independently ubiquitinate HMGCR, which is then extracted from the ER membrane in a VCP-dependent manner. The stoichiometry and make-up of the different Insig complexes within the ER membrane are unknown.

Our initial genome-wide screen successfully identified a single E3 ligase (RNF145) as well as many of the components known to be required for sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation (e.g. Insig-1/2, UBE2G2, AUP1, FAF2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sever et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jo et al., 2013</xref>), thus validating the suitability of this genetic approach.</p><p>For a small number of validated hits from our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), the effects on sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation were unanticipated and likely reflect wide-ranging alterations to the protein and lipid environment. Trans-2,3-enoyl CoA reductase (TECR) catalyses the final steps in the synthesis of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moon and Horton, 2003</xref>) as well as the saturation step in sphingolipid degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wakashima et al., 2014</xref>). Polypeptide N-acetylgalctosaminyltransferase 11 (GALNT11) initiates protein O-linked glycosylation, suggesting that a protein involved in HMGCR regulation requires O-linked glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwientek et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, our screen revealed that loss of the LDLR impaired HMGCR-Clover degradation. This finding is unexpected as the cholesterol added to the cells to induce HMGCR degradation was not in the form of LDL. EH domain-containing protein 1 (EHD1) is required for the internalisation and recycling of several plasma membrane receptors, including the LDLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naslavsky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naslavsky and Caplan, 2011</xref>) and loss of EDH1 impairs LDLR trafficking with decreased intracellular cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naslavsky et al., 2007</xref>). The other significant hits in the screen (PPAP2C, FER) have not been validated.</p><p>The screen also identified the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2G2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF145. Depletion of UBE2G2 prevented HMGCR degradation, implying that all ligases involved in HMGCR degradation utilise this E2 enzyme. In contrast, and despite being a high confidence hit in our screen, depletion of RNF145 caused a highly reproducible but small inhibition of sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation, confirming the sensitivity of the screen to detect partial phenotypes and predicting the requirement for at least one additional UBE2G2-dependent ligase. A subsequent, targeted ubiquitome library screen in an RNF145-knockout reporter cell line confirmed a role for gp78 in HMGCR degradation. Gp78 has previously been shown to use UBE2G2 as its cognate E2 enzyme in the degradation of ERAD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). During preparation of this manuscript, the combined involvement of RNF145 and gp78 in Insig-mediated HMGCR degradation in hamster (CHO) cells was also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>), confirming the role for these ligases in other species.</p><p>The availability of an RNF145-specific polyclonal antibody provides further insight into the expression and activity of endogenous RNF145, without the concerns of overexpression artefacts. RNF145 is an ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase with several unique features that make it well-suited for HMGCR regulation. A challenge facing all proteins responsible for cholesterol regulation is that the target they monitor, cholesterol, resides entirely within membranes. Like HMGCR and SCAP, RNF145 contains a putative sterol-sensing domain in its transmembrane region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that sterols may facilitate RNF145’s association with Insigs. In contrast to Jiang et al., 2018, who reported a constitutive, sterol-independent association between ectopically expressed RNF145 and Insig-1 or −2, we find that endogenous RNF145 interacts with endogenous Insig-1 in a sterol-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), as reported for the interaction of SCAP and HMGCR with the Insig proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2007</xref>). The binding of RNF145 to Insig-1 is HMGCR-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of Insigs, the RNF145-HMGCR association is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), implying that the interaction between these two proteins is absolutely Insig-dependent. Therefore, sterols trigger the recruitment of RNF145 to HMGCR via Insigs, leading to HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation. This ability of RNF145 to rapidly bind Insigs following sterol availability supports a key role for this ligase in HMGCR regulation.</p><p>A striking feature of RNF145 is its short half-life and rapid proteasome-mediated degradation, which contrasts with the long-lived gp78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A/B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). RNF145 is an intrinsically unstable ligase whose half-life is regulated through autoubiquitination and was not prolonged on binding to Insig proteins (data not shown). Its stability and turnover is RING- and UBE2G2-dependent, but independent of either the gp78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A- C</xref> ) or Hrd1 E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As cells become sterol-depleted, the transcriptional increase in RNF145 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C/D</xref>) likely anticipates the need to rapidly eliminate HMGCR, once normal cellular sterol levels are restored.</p><p>While this sterol-dependent transcriptional increase in RNF145 expression may at first seem counterintuitive, under sterol-deplete conditions the RNF145 ligase is not engaged with Insigs or its HMGCR substrate. The build-up of RNF145 predicts the restoration of sterol concentrations allowing RNF145 to immediately engage with, and degrade its HMGCR substrate. Thus the build-up of RNF145 anticipates its critical role in the restoration of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</p><p>RNF145 transcription was reported to be regulated by the sterol-responsive Liver X Receptor (LXR) family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), which transcriptionally activate cholesterol efflux pumps (ABCA1, ABCG1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards et al., 2002</xref>) and the IDOL E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets the LDLR for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zelcer et al., 2009</xref>). Pharmacological treatment of HeLa cells with the LXR inducer (GW3965) increased protein levels of ABCA1, but RNF145 transcript levels were not significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5 – figure supplement 2A/B</xref>). In HeLa cells, therefore, the increased expression of RNF145 following cholesterol starvation is not primarily driven by the LXR pathway.</p><p>While it is not unusual for more than one ligase to be required for substrate ERAD degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christianson and Ye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stefanovic-Barrett et al., 2018</xref>), the redundancy in HMGCR turnover is intriguing. This may simply reflect the central role of HMGCR in the mevalonate pathway and the importance of a fail-safe mechanism of HMGCR regulation to both maintain substrates for non-sterol isoprenoid synthesis and prevent cholesterol overproduction. Alternative explanations can also be considered, particularly as the properties of RNF145 and gp78 are so different. Under sterol-deplete conditions gp78 also regulates the degradation of Insig-1, but following addition of sterols, the association of Insigs with SCAP displaces Insigs binding to gp78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Different Insig-associated complexes are therefore likely to co-exist within the ER membrane, under both sterol-replete and -deplete conditions, and will reflect the sterol microenvironment of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>). Under these circumstances it might be advantageous to have more than one ligase regulating HMGCR. Alternatively, gp78 may provide basal control of the reductase, which can then be ‘fine-tuned’ by the sterol-responsive RNF145, reflecting the sterol concentration of the local ER environment. Further understanding of the stoichiometry and nature of the different Insig complexes within the ER membrane will be important. While all cells need to regulate their intracellular cholesterol, the contribution of each ligase to sterol regulation may also depend on their differential tissue expression. In this regard, liver-specific ablation of gp78 in mice has been reported to lead to increased steady-state levels of hepatocyte HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), whereas gp78 knockout MEFs show no apparent impairment in HMGCR degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Further delineation of the contribution of each ligase to HMGCR degradation in different tissues and cell types will be important.</p><p>A role for the Hrd1 E3 ligase in HMGCR regulation was unanticipated, and both orthologues (gp78 and Hrd1) of yeast Hrd1p, which regulates yeast HMGCR (Hmg2p), are therefore involved in mammalian HMGCR turnover. The best recognised function of Hrd1 is the ubiquitination of misfolded or unassembled ER-lumenal and membrane proteins targeted for ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christianson et al., 2008</xref>). Our finding that Hrd1 is only involved in HMGCR regulation when the other two ligases are absent, suggests that under sterol-rich conditions, and in the absence of RNF145 or gp78, conformational changes in the sterol-sensing domains of HMGCR may lead to a less ordered state and be recognised and targeted by the Hrd1 quality control pathway. Ligand-induced selective and reversible local misfolding in Hmg2p, dubbed ‘mallostery’, is a suggested mode of recognition by Hrd1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wangeline et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wangeline and Hampton, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism underlying recognition of HMGCR by Hrd1 is unclear, and whether the Hrd1 complex directly recognises sterol-induced structural changes as seen with Hmg2 degradation in yeast is unknown. Hrd1 might utilise the Insig proteins as scaffolds for HMGCR binding. This is partially borne out in the complete rescue of HMGCR in Insig-1 and −2 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and suggest that the contributions by different ligases may represent a regulated misfolding event as part of a ligand-mediated control of HMGCR stability. Further investigation is needed to clearly determine their contribution to HMGCR regulation.</p><p>In summary, our unbiased approach to identify proteins involved in sterol-regulated HMGCR degradation resolves the ambiguity of the responsible E3 ubiquitin ligases, and uncovers additional control points in modulating the activity of this important enzyme in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-gp78 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">ProteinTech, 16675–1-AP</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2226463">AB_2226463</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-ubiquitin <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Life Sensors, <break/>VU101</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2716558">AB_2716558</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-V5 tag (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam, ab27671</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_471093">AB_471093</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Insig-1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam, ab70784</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1269181">AB_1269181</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Hrd1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abgent, <break/>AP2184a</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2199838">AB_2199838</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-TRC8 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz, <break/>sc-68373</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2238721">AB_2238721</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HMGCR (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz, sc-271595</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10650274">AB_10650274</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-UBE2G2 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology, <break/>sc-100613</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1130984">AB_1130984</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pSpCas9(BB)−2A- <break/>Puro V1 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Addgene #48139</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pSpCas9(BB)−2A-Puro V2 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Addgene #62988</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pKLV-U6gRNA(BbsI)-PGKpuro2ABFP (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Addgene #

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Wade Harper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Randy Y Hampton (Reviewer #2). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper employs a clever assay to perform a genome-wide CRISPR screen for genes that control sterol-dependent turnover of HMGCR in the ER membrane. This is an exciting paper that uncovers a clear role for RNF145 in turnover of HMGCR, with additional roles for gp78 and Hrd1. The identity to E3s regulating HMGCR turnover in mammals has been controversial, with some evidence for gp78 and TRC8 in its turnover, and some evidence against these proteins being involved. Given the important of the pathway in controlling lipid regulatory mechanisms, understanding the key regulatory mechanisms is important. A second interesting aspect of the paper is the autoregulation of RNF145 itself, probably through an auto-ubiquitylation mechanism, although the data need further clarification as described below. Overall, the biochemical and screening data is of very high quality and convincing.</p><p>The reviewers were all quite positive about the paper.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Most of the comments raised had to do with aspects of the text. Several suggestions were made on ways to improve clarity and to explain particular aspects of what can be concluded from the results or what prior work might say. In particular, the sterol regulation of RNF145 is a bit counterintuitive, as indicated by both reviewers 2 and 3. So we would strongly suggest that this be addressed, at a minimum through changes in the text, and if possible through an experiment (see reviewer 3 comments). The reviewers also suggest that you discuss the previous paper on RNF145 in greater detail. We also feel that addressing point 5 by reviewer 3 would improve the paper, in the event that this data is available or could be obtained quickly.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper reports a crispr screen leading to the identification of genes that control sterol-dependent turnover of HMGCR. The authors set up a cell line that reports on the abundance of a fluorescently tagged HMGCR protein (Figure 1) and performed a crispr screen (Figure 2). The identity to E3s regulating HMGCR turnover in mammals has been controversial, with some evidence for gp78 and TRC8 in its turnover, and some evidence against these proteins being involved. Given the important of the pathway in controlling lipid regulatory mechanisms, understanding the key regulatory mechanisms is important.</p><p>Through the genome wide screen, the authors identified Ube2g2 and RNF145 as regulators of HMGCR turnover. The show that gp78 and RNF145 are functionally redundant, and are backed up to a small degree by the Hrd1 E3. RNF145 itself has a relatively subtle phenotype and a secondary ubiquitylome screen in RNF145 null cells led to the identification of gp78 as the partially redundant function.</p><p>The authors have also found that RNF145 may be auto-regulated and is rapidly turned over under steady state conditions in a manner that requires its RING domain. They also found that its transcription and abundance is regulated by sterols and that the interaction of RNF145 with insig is sterol dependent, which are interesting findings and provide novel mechanistic insight.</p><p>Overall the paper is clear and to a large degree straightforward. The screening design is good. The results clarify the role for various E3s in HMGCR turnover, identify a new component, and deduce several regulatory aspects of the pathway. Overall, the paper is appropriate for <italic>ELife</italic>.</p><p>Minor:</p><p>1) The deltaR/deltaG nomenclature is a bit confusing and it might be better to simply write RNF145-/-;gp78-/-.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>All the CRISPR screening data (Sequence reads) should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Menzies et al. out of the Lehrner lab is a typical example of the interesting and beautiful work that is routinely produced by this group. The experimental approach is clear and elegant (and I have never even heard of that fluorescent protein!). The data are clean and very informative, and the results are surprising and take us…some…or maybe most…of the way to resolving the Great Mammalian HMGcR Mystery.</p><p>If I understand the instructions to the reviewers, it is the case is that we are simply to provide suggestions; that this is an example of a new experimental mode of reviewing that makes it entirely up to the authors to accept suggestions and to respond or not as they see fit. That is a great development in terms of lessening the stranglehold that reviewers have on the fates of authors, and I approve, since I, and probably everyone who is reading this be them author or reviewer, has had that situation, where 50-60 thousand dollars later, the &quot;requested additional experiment&quot; didn't work or did work but didn't really enhance the strength of the paper. So good for <italic>eLife</italic>!</p><p>On the other hand, shoot, we already aren't getting paid, now we don't really have any authoritative say either. I feel more like a spectator in the courtroom, or a viewer of a newsfeed than a bone fide reviewer. But not a problem! This work is sufficiently well crafted that my optional suggestions will be offered in the spirit of optimistic encouragement.</p><p>1) The TRC8 problem: so the one issue missing is the absence of any TRC8 dependence in these effects. I am comfortable with that; I think a lot of these differing results are due to subtilties of gene expression that change which ligases, or regulating factors, appear or do not in a given experiment. Any discussion-based explanations for this?</p><p>2) A physiological model for RNF145's regulation: It is odd, is it not, that depleted sterols induce the E3 that will get rid of HMGCR induced by depleted sterols. What do you think the function may be? It would be interesting to hear what you think.</p><p>3) RNF145 information: It might be useful to emphasize (I didn't see it in the paper but perhaps I missed it) that RNF145 has a large transmembrane domain with an SSD. The SSD is an incredibly interesting module in biology, and especially sterol biology, and it should at least be mentioned.</p><p>4) The misfolding/quality control connection to HMGCR regulation: One of the very lovely things about this work is that the authors, through estimable and intense hard work, unveiled a role for the eponymous E3 of HMGCR regulation, namely Hrd1, when enough ligases are taken out of the picture. This is very cool. Two things. First, it is worth mentioning the earlier Debose-Boyd work showing that when mammalian HMGCR is expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells with the corresponding mammalian INSIG, one can observed, amazingly enough, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hrd1 dependent. sterol-regulated degradation of the exogenous HMGCR. In fact this is a feature of a &quot;misfolding-based&quot; explanation for the HMGCR ligase dilemma that is also nicely supported by the work of these new studies. The idea being that in the original HRD system, that is yeast Hmg2 regulation by Hrd1 (nicely referenced in this new work), regulated misfolding is at the heart of that version of HMGCR regulation. Since protein quality control often can be mediated by a number of ligases that share ability to recognize misfolding, in the case of the mammal, perhaps regulated misfolding also plays a role: maybe the ability of different groups to observed different ligase dependencies is due to a certain shared ability among distinct ligases to recognize a regulated misfolding event as part of ligand-mediated control of HMGCR stability. Thus, the higher flexibility of quality control based regulation might allow a number of distinct quality control ligases to participate depending on details of presence, levels, and cell type. It is only one explanation, but it is an interesting one, and one we described in some detail and would appreciate you referencing from our Annual Reviews of Cell and Developmental Biology (Wangeline, Vashistha and Hampton, 2017). In fact we even suggest that this would be one place where CRISPR based analysis would provide some tests and resolution of this idea. Of course, I am biased a little, since I am Hampton, one of the authors. But it would be resonant with your new work and my recently graduated, first author student would also really appreciate it too.</p><p>Anyway, beautiful work. Congratulations!</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>Very rigorous.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Starting from a clever CRISPR screen, the authors report that the ER E3 ligase RNF145 cooperates with gp78 to control the sterol-regulated degradation of HMGCR. In their absence, Hrd1 acts in this role. Together, these 3 ER E3 ligases account for HMGCR sterol-regulated degradation in HeLa cells. The data are clearly presented and support the conclusions. The findings are consistent with a JBC paper published in March 2018 showing a role for RNF145 in HMGCR degradation in CHO cells. These findings are clinically important since they pertain to control of HMGCR protein levels and statin therapy and will be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Authors conclude that the HMGCR-Clover gene is present at a single locus and that these cells express endogenous HMGCR from another allele. This is based on the presence of HMGCR that co-migrates with HMGCR in parent cells. However, this could be due to proteolytic cleavage between HMGCR and Clover. This conclusion should be validated by PCR-sequencing.</p><p>2) The authors should include in their discussion comments on whether other genes identified in screens are likely to be positive hits and why. For example, is GALNT11 a true positive? Why might they have gotten EHD1? Could this disrupt LDLR trafficking, which was also found?</p><p>3) Zelcer and colleagues reported that RNF145 is an LXR target gene and induced by LXR agonist (Cook et al., 2017). LXR is typically activated under conditions of cholesterol excess. However, the authors find the opposite. Rather RNF145 is induced under sterol depleted conditions. To address this discrepancy, suggest that authors test effects of LXR agonist in parallel to sterol depletion in their cells and discuss these results.</p><p>4) These studies were obviously performed in parallel to those described in Jiang et al., 2018. While the authors mention this paper, they should discuss their own results in the context of this other study.</p><p>5) Evidence for a RNF145-Insig-HMGCR complex is strong. However, the authors depict RNF145 binding to Insig directly and not HMGCR in Figure 8. Suggest that authors test whether the RNF145-HNGCR interaction requires Insig1/2 to support this model or cite the work of others as support for this specific depiction.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Please describe in the results why the p97 inhibitor was included in Figure 6 experiments and whether addition is required for interaction.</p><p>2) Figure 8 is a beautiful figure. However, the arrows next to STEROLS in the center are somewhat confusing and appear to indicate that sterols are moving between the top and bottom panels. Suggest writing &quot;Low sterol&quot; and &quot;High sterol&quot; or something similar to improve figure clarity.</p><p>3) To improve clarity, please describe in more detail the biology behind the US2-MHC1 assay used to validate TRC8 knockout.</p><p>4) Introduction paragraph three is missing a word, &quot;despite confirming a for gp78&quot;</p><p>5) Results first paragraph subheading, typo HMMGCR.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40009.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Overall the paper is clear and to a large degree straightforward.

Throughout this project, despite extensive testing, we have never seen any involvement of TRC8 in the degradation of HMGCR in HeLa cells – consistent with the findings of the Weissman group. Clearly, we cannot absolutely rule out that TRC8 might play a role in HMGCR degradation in other cell lines or under different conditions. However, we are confident that in all the cell lines that we have tested, where we see a striking role for TRC8 in the HCMV-US2-mediated degradation of MHC-I and a host of other immunoreceptors (Stagg et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2015), we are unable to see any role for TRC8 in HMGCR degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A physiological model for RNF145's regulation: It is odd, is it not, that depleted sterols induce the E3 that will get rid of HMGCR induced by depleted sterols. What do you think the function may be? It would be interesting to hear what you think.</p></disp-quote><p>Our finding that sterol depletion induces RNF145 levels while HMGCR remains stable may at first seem somewhat counterintuitive. However, RNF145 is not associated with either the Insigs or HMGCR under these conditions (Figure 6A-C). We would therefore argue that the build-up of RNF145 under sterol depletion anticipates and facilitates rapid removal of HMGCR, once homeostasis is restored. This point has now been included in the Discussion section:</p><p>“While this sterol-dependent transcriptional increase in RNF145 expression may at first seem counterintuitive, under sterol-deplete conditions the RNF145 ligase is not engaged with Insigs or its HMGCR substrate. The build-up of RNF145 predicts the restoration of sterol concentrations allowing RNF145 to immediately engage with, and degrade its HMGCR substrate. Thus the build-up of RNF145 anticipates its critical role in the restoration of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) RNF145 information: It might be useful to emphasize (I didn't see it in the paper but perhaps I missed it) that RNF145 has a large transmembrane domain with an SSD. The SSD is an incredibly interesting module in biology, and especially sterol biology, and it should at least be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an incredibly interesting module and did mention the presence of a putative SSD in RNF145 in both the results and the Discussion section of the original submission. We were, and still are, excited by this module and have made a number of mutations in the SSD of RNF145. Unfortunately this so destabilised the RNF145 protein that it was impossible to obtain any meaningful results. We have emphasised the potential contribution of the SSD to RNF145 activity:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Like HMGCR and SCAP, RNF145 contains a putative sterol-sensing domain in its transmembrane region (Cook et al., 2017), suggesting that sterols may facilitate RNF145’s association with Insigs. In contrast to Jiang et al., who reported a constitutive, sterol-independent association between ectopically expressed RNF145 and Insig-1 or -2, we find that endogenous RNF145 interacts with endogenous Insig-1 in a sterol-dependent manner (Figure 6C), as reported for the interaction of SCAP and HMGCR with the Insig proteins (Lee et al., 2007). The binding of RNF145 to Insig-1 is HMGCR-independent (Figure 6D). Furthermore, in the absence of Insigs, the RNF145-HMGCR association is lost (Figure 6E), implying that the interaction between these two proteins is absolutely Insig-dependent. Therefore, sterols trigger the recruitment of RNF145 to HMGCR via Insigs, leading to HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation. This ability of RNF145 to rapidly bind Insigs following sterol availability supports a key role for this ligase in HMGCR regulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The misfolding/quality control connection to HMGCR regulation: One of the very lovely things about this work is that the authors, through estimable and intense hard work, unveiled a role for the eponymous E3 of HMGCR regulation, namely Hrd1, when enough ligases are taken out of the picture. This is very cool. Two things. First, it is worth mentioning the earlier Debose-Boyd work showing that when mammalian HMGCR is expressed in Drosophila cells with the corresponding mammalian INSIG, one can observed, amazingly enough, Drosophila Hrd1 dependent. sterol-regulated degradation of the exogenous HMGCR.

Thus, the higher flexibility of quality control based regulation might allow a number of distinct quality control ligases to participate depending on details of presence, levels, and cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting hypothesis and, we agree, not necessarily mutually exclusive with Insig-mediated HMGCR degradation in mammals. We have adjusted our Discussion section to that effect and included additional references:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Our finding that Hrd1 is only involved in HMGCR regulation when the other two ligases are absent, suggests that under sterol-rich conditions, and in the absence of RNF145 or gp78, conformational changes in the sterol-sensing domains of HMGCR may lead to a less ordered state and be recognised and targeted by the Hrd1 quality control pathway. Ligand-induced selective and reversible local misfolding in Hmg2p, dubbed “mallostery”, is a suggested mode of recognition by Hrd1p (Wangeline et al., 2017; Wangeline and Hampton, 2018).”</p><p><italic>“</italic>The mechanism underlying recognition of HMGCR by Hrd1 is unclear, and whether the Hrd1 complex directly recognises sterol-induced structural changes as seen with Hmg2 degradation in yeast is unknown. Hrd1 might utilise the Insig proteins as scaffolds for HMGCR binding. This is partially borne out in the complete rescue of HMGCR in Insig-1 and -2 depleted cells (Figure 1F). These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and suggest that the contributions by different ligases may represent a regulated misfolding event as part of a ligand-mediated control of HMGCR stability. Further investigation is needed to clearly determine their contribution to HMGCR regulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is only one explanation, but it is an interesting one, and one we described in some detail and would appreciate you referencing from our Annual Reviews of Cell and Developmental Biology (Wangeline, Vashistha and Hampton, 2017).

For example, is GALNT11 a true positive? Why might they have gotten EHD1? Could this disrupt LDLR trafficking, which was also found?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. Genes identified in the genome-wide screen did include a number of unexpected hits. Several of these candidates were subsequently validated, therefore representing true-positives. A discussion of their involvement in HMGCR degradation has now been included in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“For a small number of validated hits from our screen (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), the effects on sterol-accelerated HMGCR degradation were unanticipated and likely reflect wide-ranging alterations to the protein and lipid environment. Trans-2,3-enoyl CoA reductase (TECR) catalyses the final steps in the synthesis of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) (Moon and Horton, 2003) as well as the saturation step in sphingolipid degradation (Wakashima et al., 2014). Polypeptide N-acetylgalctosaminyltransferase 11 (GALNT11) initiates protein O-linked glycosylation, suggesting that a protein involved in HMGCR regulation requires O-linked glycosylation (Schwientek et al., 2002). Interestingly, our screen revealed that loss of the LDLR impaired HMGCR-Clover degradation. This finding is unexpected as the cholesterol added to the cells to induce HMGCR degradation was not in the form of LDL. EH domain-containing protein 1 (EHD1) is required for the internalisation and recycling of several plasma membrane receptors, including the LDLR (Naslavsky et al., 2007; Naslavsky and Caplan, 2011) and loss of EDH1 impairs LDLR trafficking with decreased intracellular cholesterol levels (Naslavsky et al., 2007). The other significant hits in the screen (PPAP2C, FER) have not been validated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Zelcer and colleagues reported that RNF145 is an LXR target gene and induced by LXR agonist (Cook et al., 2017). LXR is typically activated under conditions of cholesterol excess. However, the authors find the opposite. Rather RNF145 is induced under sterol depleted conditions. To address this discrepancy, suggest that authors test effects of LXR agonist in parallel to sterol depletion in their cells and discuss these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and we are aware of this discrepancy. Data presented in our study (Figure 5C, D) show a clear transcriptional induction of RNF145 under conditions of sterol depletion, correlating with a comparable fold-increase of RNF145 protein levels. We agree that this finding suggests a different mechanism of RNF145 transcriptional control from the Zelcer lab study (Cook et al., 2017), where treatment with an LXR agonist induced a small increase in RNF145 transcription. Despite the claims in the title of this paper this increase (Figure 1B Cook et al., 2017) was only 1.2 – 1.8 fold. Since LXRs are usually active under conditions of cholesterol excess, this is at odds with our observations. To clarify this discrepancy, we tested the effect of LXR induction on endogenous RNF145 mRNA and protein levels under sterol-depleted or –replete conditions in our system. Our new findings are now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and summarised below.</p><p>Treatment of HeLa cells with the LXR inducer GW3965 (also used in Cook et al., 2017), did not affect RNF145 mRNA levels, in clear contrast to the <italic>bona fide</italic> LXR target gene ABCA1, whose gene product was markedly increased (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4 with lanes 1 and 3). Similarly, we did not observe a significant potentiating effect of LXR induction on RNF145 transcript levels under sterol-depleted conditions (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). Our results clearly demonstrate that sterol depletion – not excess – favours RNF145 transcription.</p><p>These new findings have been incorporated into the Discussion section:</p><p>“RNF145 transcription was reported to be regulated by the sterol-responsive Liver X Receptor (LXR) family of transcription factors (Cook et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017), which transcriptionally activate cholesterol efflux pumps (ABCA1, ABCG1) (Costet, 2000; Edwards et al., 2002) and the IDOL E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets the LDLR for degradation (Zelcer et al., 2009). Pharmacological treatment of HeLa cells with the LXR inducer (GW3965) increased protein levels of ABCA1, but RNF145 transcript levels were not significantly increased (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A/B). In HeLa cells, therefore, the increased expression of RNF145 following cholesterol starvation is not primarily driven by the LXR pathway.”</p><p>A new figure legend for Figure 5—figure supplement 2 has been added:</p><p>“Figure 5—figure supplement 2.

JBC 2018. While the authors mention this paper, they should discuss their own results in the context of this other study.</p></disp-quote><p>Where appropriate, we have now placed our findings in context of the parallel study (Jiang et al., 2018):</p><p>“During preparation of this manuscript, the combined involvement of RNF145 and gp78 in Insig-mediated HMGCR degradation in hamster (CHO) cells was also reported (Jiang et al., 2018), confirming the role for these ligases in other species.”</p><p>“In contrast to Jiang et al., who reported a constitutive, sterol-independent association between ectopically expressed RNF145 and Insig-1 or -2, we find that endogenous RNF145 interacts with endogenous Insig-1 in a sterol-dependent manner (Figure 6C), as reported for the interaction of SCAP and HMGCR with the Insig proteins (Lee et al., 2007). The binding of RNF145 to Insig-1 is HMGCR-independent (Figure 6D). Furthermore, in the absence of Insigs, the RNF145-HMGCR association is lost (Figure 6E), implying that the interaction between these two proteins is absolutely Insig-dependent. Therefore, sterols trigger the recruitment of RNF145 to HMGCR via Insigs, leading to HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation. This ability of RNF145 to rapidly bind Insigs following sterol availability supports a key role for this ligase in HMGCR regulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Evidence for a RNF145-Insig-HMGCR complex is strong. However, the authors depict RNF145 binding to Insig directly and not HMGCR in Figure 8. Suggest that authors test whether the RNF145-HNGCR interaction requires Insig1/2 to support this model or cite the work of others as support for this specific depiction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our model, as depicted in Figure 8, shows RNF145 binding to HMGCR via the intermediary Insig proteins, and we did not exclude a direct interaction between RNF145 and HMGCR. Our initial attempts to assess this issue with endogenous proteins were technically unsuccessful. However, spurred on by the reviewers’ comments, this experiment has now been successful and we now include additional data which supports our model (Figure 6D, E, and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 for validation of the Insig1+2 knockout cell line). Using the immunoprecipitation strategy employed in Figure 6C, we show that (i) RNF145 still binds Insig-1 in the absence of HMGCR (Figure 6D), and importantly, (ii) RNF145 binding to HMGCR is lost upon Insig deletion (Figure 6E).</p><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 1 describes how Insig-1+2 knockout cells have been derived and validated. In short, combined CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of both Insigs resulted in constitutive, sterol-independent upregulation of the HMGCR-Clover reporter (see Figure 1F). This strong phenotype was used to enrich for an Insig-1 and -2 depleted population (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B(i)) and isolation of ΔInsig-1+2 single cell clones (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B(ii), C).</p><p>We reference these findings in the Results section:</p><p>“Binding of RNF145 to Insig-1 was HMGCR-independent (Figure 6D), and in the absence of Insigs, RNF145 was unable to bind HMGCR (Figure 6E, see Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C for generation of Insig-1+2 knockout cells). Insigs are therefore indispensable for the interaction between RNF145 and HMGCR. These findings emphasize the central role of Insig proteins as scaffolds in the sterol-induced engagement of HMGCR by RNF145.”</p><p>The legend accompanying Figure 6 has been expanded appropriately:</p><p>“(D – E) Insigs mediate binding between RNF145 and HMGCR.</p><p>(D) HeLa UBE2G2 knockout cells (ΔUBE2G2 #1) transfected with a pool of 4 sgRNAs targeting HMGCR (gHMGCR) or sgRNA targeting B2M (gCTR), transfected cells enriched by puromycin selection, and sterol-depleted for 20 h, before adding back sterols for 1 h + NMS-873 (10 μM, 1.5 h).

Generation of Insig knockout cell lines.</p><p>(A) HeLa HMGCR-Clover cells expressing Cas9 were transfected with 4 sgRNAs targeting Insig-1 and Insig-2 (ΔInsig-1+2), and selected with puromycin. Due to the low initial enrichment of Insig-1+2 double knockouts in this experiment, double knockouts were further enriched by two consecutive rounds of FACS (‘sort #1’ and ‘sort #2’), selecting cells with high constitutive HMGCR-Clover expression (‘sorted’, red box) after overnight sterol depletion (SD) and sterol repletion (S) for 2 h. r.u., relative units.</p><p>(B) Immunoblotting for endogenous Insig-1 in cells isolated from sort #1 and #2 in (A) (i) and in the Insig-1+2 double knockout clone (ΔIn-1+2 clone) isolated from the enriched population in sort #2 (ii).

Loss of both Insigs was confirmed by presence of sterol-independent, constitutive expression of HMGCR-Clover due to de-repression of the SCAP-SREBP2 complex (red line). HMGCR-Clover expression under steady-state conditions in Insig-1+2 double knockout cells is comparable to that of the sterol-depleted (SD, 20 h) parental WT cell line (blue line). Loss of Insig-1 in the Insig-1/2 double knockout single cell clone was further confirmed by immunoblotting (see (B) and Figure 6E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Please describe in the results why the p97 inhibitor was included in Figure 6 experiments and whether addition is required for interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We show that RNF145 interacts with HMGCR and Insig proteins in a sterol-dependent manner. Once RNF145 binds HMGCR, it would mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of its substrate. The VCP inhibitor is therefore necessary to efficiently capture this transient interaction and prevent otherwise rapid HMGCR degradation. A similar strategy has been described to facilitate the efficient enrichment and identification of ERAD substrates (Huang et al., 2018). Of note, the VCP inhibitor can be omitted in UBE2G2 knockout cells since the ubiquitination reaction is blocked by the lack of the E2 enzyme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 8 is a beautiful figure.

Cell-surface MHC-I staining and FACS analysis were performed on day 10 <italic>post</italic> transfection. US2 is a herpes cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded gene product which directs TRC8 to degrade MHC-I in the ER lumen (Stagg et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2015). Loss of TRC8 renders cells resistant to US2-mediated MHC-I loss (green line in histogram) and therefore serves as a functional readout for TRC8 status.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction paragraph three is missing a word, &quot;despite confirming a for gp78&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, the amended sentence now reads:</p><p>“However, these findings remain controversial as, despite confirming a role for gp78 in the regulation of Insig-1 (Lee et al., 2006; Tsai et al., 2012), an independent study found no evidence for either gp78 or TRC8 in the sterol-induced degradation of HMGCR (Tsai et al., 2012). Therefore, the E3 ligase(s) responsible for the sterol-accelerated degradation of HMGCR remain disputed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results first paragraph subheading, typo HMMGCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have corrected this typographical error to “HMGCR”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
