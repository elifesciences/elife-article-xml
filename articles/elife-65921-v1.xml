activated after injury, contributing to cardiac healing by secretion of paracrine factors. Here, we analyzed by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with RNA in situ hybridization and lineage tracing of Wilms tumor protein 1-positive (WT1<sup>+</sup>) cells, the cellular composition, location, and hierarchy of epicardial stromal cells (EpiSC) in comparison to activated myocardial fibroblasts/stromal cells in infarcted mouse hearts. We identified 11 transcriptionally distinct EpiSC populations, which can be classified into three groups, each containing a cluster of proliferating cells. Two groups expressed cardiac specification markers and sarcomeric proteins suggestive of cardiomyogenic potential. Transcripts of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-responsive genes were enriched in EpiSC consistent with an epicardial hypoxic niche. Expression of paracrine factors was not limited to WT1<sup>+</sup> cells but was a general feature of activated cardiac stromal cells. Our findings provide the cellular framework by which myocardial ischemia may trigger in EpiSC the formation of cardioprotective/regenerative responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>epicardium</kwd><kwd>cardiac fibroblasts</kwd><kwd>ScRNAseq</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>236177352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grandoch</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerdes</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Jens W</given-names></name><name><surname>Schrader</surname><given-names>Jürgen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>220652768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owenier</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009400</institution-id><institution>Medizinische Fakultät, Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hesse</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptional landscape of epicardial cells revealed 11 cell populations that differentially expressed early cardiac genes and numerous cardioprotective paracrine factors defining their regenerative potential.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI), still the most frequent cause of death in western societies, is associated with massive activation of cardiac fibroblasts, ultimately resulting in excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components that finally impair cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017</xref>). During development, the majority of cardiac fibroblasts are derived from the epicardium, which forms the thin outermost epithelial layer of all vertebrate hearts and exhibits extensive developmental plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao and Poss, 2018</xref>). A subset of epicardial cells undergoes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and those epicardial progenitor cells can give rise to various cardiac cell types. In addition to cardiac fibroblasts, these include vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes, which contribute to the coronary vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao and Poss, 2018</xref>). Embryonic epicardial heterogeneity was recently studied at the single-cell level in the developing zebrafish heart and uncovered three epicardial populations, functionally related to cell adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the adult heart, the epicardium is a rather quiescent monolayer that becomes activated after MI by upregulating embryonic epicardial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quijada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masters and Riley, 2014</xref>). In the injured heart, epicardial cells form via EMT a multi-cell layer of epicardial stromal cells (EpiSC) at the heart surface that can reach a thickness of about 50–70 µm in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Wijk et al., 2012</xref>). It is generally assumed that the activated epicardium recapitulates the embryonic program in generating mesenchymal progenitor cells, although there may be major molecular differences with respect to their embryonic counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bollini et al., 2014</xref>). On the functional side, adult EpiSC secrete paracrine factors that stimulate cardiomyocyte growth and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>) and play a key role in post-MI adaptive immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramjee et al., 2017</xref>). When stimulated with thymosin β4, Wilms tumor protein 1-positive (WT1<sup>+</sup>) adult EpiSC can form cardiomyocytes; however, the rate of conversion is only small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smart et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the epicardium is a signaling center regulating cardiac wound healing and may have cardiogenic potential in the adult injured heart.</p><p>Despite its importance in cardiac repair, little is known on cell heterogeneity and molecular identifiers within the epicardial layer of the adult heart. Yet, this knowledge is essential to map the epicardial progeny and attribute meaningful functions. While the single-cell landscape of activated cardiac fibroblasts (activated cardiac stromal cells, aCSC) in the post-MI heart has been explored in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farbehi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forte et al., 2020</xref>), these studies did not assess epicardial heterogeneity because of a lack of specific identifiers. In a previous study, we have reported a novel perfusion-based technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owenier et al., 2020</xref>), which permitted the simultaneous isolation of EpiSC and aCSC with high yields and only minimal cell activation. The isolation of viable, purified preparations of aCSC and EpiSC from the infarcted heart permitted the first direct comparison of the two cardiac stromal cell fractions. We have combined single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) with lineage tracing of WT1-expressing cells and localization of cell populations by RNA in situ hybridization, characterized cellular hierarchy of adult EpiSC, defined similarities and differences to cardiac fibroblasts, and explored in detail the individual EpiSC populations in the activated epicardium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNAseq of post-MI stromal cells</title><p>EpiSC and aCSC were isolated from the same mouse hearts (<italic>n</italic> = 3) 5 days after MI (50 min ischemia followed by reperfusion) by combined collagenase perfusion and bathing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This recently developed technique selectively removes the majority of EpiSC from the aCSC-containing myocardium by applying gentle shear forces to the cardiac surface and has been validated for cell yield, viability, and purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owenier et al., 2020</xref>). Day 5 was chosen because the epicardial cell layer had reached its maximal dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) and fetal epicardial genes as a measure of epicardial activation were re-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). CSC were isolated from uninjured hearts of sham-operated animals (<italic>n</italic> = 3) without separation of epicardial cells (see 'Materials and methods'). Cell preparations were depleted of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells prior to scRNAseq using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. Transcriptional profiles of 13,796 EpiSC, 24,470 aCSC, and 24,781 CSC were captured after quality control filtering. Unbiased clustering using the Seurat R package with visualization in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimension reduction plots was performed to identify cells with distinct lineage identities and transcriptional profiles.

The contribution of EpiSC, aCSC, and CSC fractions to CCA clusters is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

Despite these similarities, there were multiple significant differences in average gene expression levels when comparing <italic>Wt1</italic>-negative EpiSC and aCSC within individual CCA clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). <italic>Wt1</italic>-expressing CCA clusters A–D were excluded from this comparative analysis, since <italic>Wt1</italic> expression was only found at the heart’s surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), strongly suggesting that aCSC assigned to these clusters probably represent epicardial contamination in the aCSC fraction (see above).

Individual single-cell analysis of this monolayer is technically not feasible, because the number of cells liberated by shear forces from uninjured hearts is only rather small (estimated ~5600 cells/heart) and there is shear-independent release of cells (background) of unknown origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owenier et al., 2020</xref>).

This amazing degree of cellular heterogeneity is similar to that of myocardial cardiac fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farbehi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forte et al., 2020</xref>). The widely used epicardial lineage marker gene <italic>Wt1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quijada et al., 2020</xref>) was selectively expressed in three populations (EpiSC-1, -7, -8), which were localized on the outer surface of the activated epicardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Other commonly used lineage markers and recently identified epicardial population markers of the developing zebrafish heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinberger et al., 2020</xref>) were rather heterogeneously distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), suggesting that they mark different stages of differentiation, commitment, or activity in the adult heart.</p><p>The quality of scRNAseq critically depends on the cell isolation technique, which ideally should preserve the native state of cells as close as possible. To minimally perturb the native expression profile of cardiac stromal cells, we used a recently elaborated perfusion protocol for the simultaneous isolation of EpiSC and aCSC from the same infarcted heart, which is short (8 min) and results in a high yield of viable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owenier et al., 2020</xref>). The application of mild shear forces on the cardiac surface by a simple motor-driven device permitted the rather selective removal of the EpiSC fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owenier et al., 2020</xref>). As compared to a commonly used mincing protocol (30–40 min), we found the yield of aCSC to be considerably higher with our technique, and this was associated with significant lower induction of immediate early response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Owenier et al., 2020</xref>). Because of these reasons, our data are difficult to compare with published studies at single-cell resolution of the post-MI heart, which relied on a mincing protocol. These studies have identified either no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Skelly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gladka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kretzschmar et al., 2018</xref>) or only one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farbehi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asp et al., 2019</xref>) epicardial cell population.</p><p>RNA velocity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and cell cycle scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) suggest that the EpiSC populations can be classified into three different independent population groups, each containing a cluster of proliferating cells. Marker genes of group I, comprising <italic>Wt1</italic>-expressing EpiSC-1 and -7, have been reported in healthy adult mouse epicardium obtained by laser capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bochmann et al., 2010</xref>) and have been exclusively used in previous single-cell studies to identify epicardial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bujak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Surprisingly, group I cells accounted for only 26% of the EpiSC fraction from the injured heart. Furthermore, the expression of several paracrine proangiogenic factors that were previously considered specifically derived from WT1<sup>+</sup> epicardial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>) was not limited to group I EpiSC, but was even higher in other EpiSC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, about two-third of all epicardial cells were <italic>Wt1</italic>-negative, but they are likely to be also involved in the secretion of paracrine factors. Furthermore, aCSC expressed numerous paracrine factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Therefore, secretion of paracrine factors appears to be a general feature of both epicardial and myocardial stromal cells, which all can contribute to cardioprotection. Group II, consisting of four cell populations, represented 40% of the EpiSC fraction and showed enriched expression of chemokines known to be involved in attraction of monocytes and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). The expression of these chemokines was a general feature of EpiSC in comparison to aCSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This finding points to a role of epicardial cells in the modulation of the innate immune response post MI, as was already suggested with regard to adaptive immune regulation during the post-MI recovery phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramjee et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Cells with the transcriptional profiles of group I and II populations were generally prevalent in EpiSC in comparison to aCSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Group I and II populations also showed the highest number of potential ligand–receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Interestingly, EpiSC-8, characterized by expression of <italic>Wt1</italic> and high transcript levels of HOX transcription factors, also highly expressed thymosin β4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), which has tissue-regenerating properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smart et al., 2011</xref>). The pronounced expression of cardiogenic factors and contractile proteins in group I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the parallel expression of WT1 and thymosin β4 suggest that this cellular network has cardiogenic potential and was involved in the previously reported formation of cardiomyocytes from WT1<sup>+</sup> cells after thymosin β4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, group I and II also shared high expression of HIF-1-responsive glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), which again was a general feature of EpiSC compared to aCSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This is in support of the epicardium being a hypoxic niche, which was based on the immunostaining of dispersed HIF-1α-positive cells in the epicardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura and Sadek, 2012</xref>). Since WT1 expression is HIF-1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>), this is consistent with the view that epicardial HIF-1 signaling is likely to be an important trigger in the ischemic heart to promote cardioprotection.</p><p>Group III comprised five cell populations accounting for 34% of all EpiSC. In contrast to group I, group III EpiSC were found localized throughout the activated epicardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and group III population identifiers also labeled stromal cells within the myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the transcriptional profile of group III EpiSC, which was quite similar to that of major aCSC and CSC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This demonstrated that group III cells exhibit a fibroblast-like phenotype. In addition, group III EpiSC showed the lowest numbers of predicted cell–cell interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and expressed a lower number of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting a less active cell state. Another remarkable feature of group III was the expression of a second set of cardiogenic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, these cardiogenic factors were prevalently expressed in aCSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which is consistent with the postulated cardiogenic potential of cardiac fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furtado et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>That there are different and genuine cellular identities of EpiSC and aCSC is supported by CCA space alignment analysis and gene regulatory network analysis, which revealed distinct expression of epicardial vs mesenchymal/fibroblast genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and individual patterns in transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>), respectively. That a direct comparison of cellular expression signatures between EpiSC and aCSC also revealed many transcriptional similarities was not surprising in view of their close developmental relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doppler et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Histological observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quijada et al., 2020</xref> found no evidence for migration of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells into the infarcted myocardium even after longer periods of time. That WT1<sup>+</sup> cells most likely do not migrate into the infarcted heart appears to be in contrast with a study using lentiviral labeling of epicardial cells after pericardial injection of virus expressing fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gittenberger-de Groot et al., 2010</xref>). Along the same line we have previously shown, that tracking of epicardial cells after labeling with fluorescently marked nanoparticles revealed migration into the injured heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). Since group II and III EpiSC constitute the majority of post-MI epicardial cells, it is well conceivable that populations of <italic>Wt1</italic>-negative cells were preferentially marked by the above-mentioned labeling techniques, and this may explain the reported migration into the injured myocardium. Our histological analysis of the epicardial post-MI multi-cell layer revealed that especially cells of group III populations are located in close proximity to the underlying myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Wt1</italic>-expressing group I cells were located in the outmost part of the activated epicardium. Furthermore, our lineage tracing data suggest that until day 5 post MI, WT1<sup>+</sup> cells have not contributed to <italic>Wt1</italic>-negative group II and group III populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, group I cells appeared to be spatially restricted to the surface layers, while the major epicardial expansion seemed to be driven by <italic>Wt1</italic>-negative EpiSC of groups II and III with their respective proliferative cell (sub)populations. It is also conceivable that the fibroblast-like cells in group III represent myocardial stromal cells that have migrated into the epicardial multi-cell layer. The notion of a compartmentalization of the epicardial multi-cell layer is supported by the differential expression of hypoxia/HIF-1-responsive glycolytic genes among EpiSC populations, which is suggestive of an exposition to different local oxygen levels.</p><p>In summary, our study explored post-MI epicardial cell heterogeneity in the context of all cardiac stromal cells at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Important epicardial properties in post-MI wound healing/regeneration can now be attributed to specific cell populations. A deeper understanding of adult epicardial hierarchy may help decipher the signaling mechanisms by which individual epicardial cell populations interact to specifically stimulate cardiac repair processes originating in the epicardium.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Janvier Labs</td><td valign="top">Strain name: C57BL/6JRj</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">STOCK <italic>Wt1<sup>tm2(cre/ERT2)Wtp</sup></italic>/J</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory;

In brief, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and hearts were excised for preparation of the aortic trunk in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Isolated hearts were immediately cannulated and perfused with PBS (3 min), followed by perfusion with collagenase solution (8 min; 1200 U/ml collagenase CLS II (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany)) in PBS at 37°C.</p><p>EpiSC were simultaneously isolated from post-MI hearts by bathing the heart in its collagenase-containing coronary effluat while applying mild shear forces to the cardiac surface. The effluat was collected, centrifuged (300 g, 7 min), and cells were resuspended in PBS/2% fetal calf serum (FCS)/1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Application of shear force and effluat collection were omitted for uninjured sham control hearts due to the absence of an activated, expanded epicardial layer. aCSC and CSC were isolated by mechanical dissociation of the digested myocardial tissue, followed by resuspension in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)/10% FCS. The cell suspensions were meshed through a 100 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 55 ×<italic>g</italic> to separate cardiomyocytes from non-cardiomyocytes. The supernatants were again passed through a 40 µm cell strainer, centrifuged (7 min, 300 ×<italic>g</italic>), and cell pellets resuspended in PBS/2% FCS/1 mM EDTA. Cells were immediately stained for surface markers and applied to fluorescence-activated cell sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title><p>Cell fractions (EpiSC, aCSC, CSC) were isolated as described above and stained at 4°C (15 min) with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against surface markers of endothelial cells (APC-conjugated rat monoclonal anti-CD31 [BioLegend, San Diego, USA]) and myeloid cells (PE-Cy7-conjugated rat monoclonal anti-CD45 [BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA]) in the presence of 7AAD (viability marker [BioLegend]). Sorting was performed with a MoFlo XDP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, USA), where dead cells (7AAD<sup>+</sup>) and CD31<sup>+</sup>/CD45<sup>+</sup> cells were excluded by gating on 7AAD<sup>-</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup>/CD45<sup>-</sup> cells. Sorting of cells isolated from the <italic>Wt1<sup>CreERT2</sup>Rosa<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mouse line followed the same gating strategy with one minor change. Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience, San Diego, USA) was used instead of 7AAD to avoid fluorescence spill-over.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>scRNAseq</title><p>The sorted single-cell suspensions were directly used for the scRNAseq experiments. scRNAseq analysis was performed by using the 10x Genomics Chromium System (10x Genomics, San Francisco, USA). Cell viability and cell number analysis were performed via trypan blue staining in a Neubauer counting chamber. A total of 2000–20,000 cells, depending on cell availability, were used as input for the single-cell droplet library generation on the 10x Chromium Controller system utilizing the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v2 according to manufacturer’s instructions. tdTomato lineage tracing experiments were conducted utilizing the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v3 according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was carried out on a HiSeq 3000 system (Illumina, San Diego, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions with a mean sequencing depth of ~90,000 reads/cell for EpiSC and ~70,000 reads/cell for aCSC. Differences in sequencing depth were necessary in order to achieve a similar sequencing saturation between all samples of ~70%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Processing of scRNAseq data</title><p>Raw sequencing data were processed using the 10x Genomics CellRanger software (v3.0.2) provided by 10x Genomics.

Initial quality control consisted of removal of cells with fewer than 200 detected genes as well as removal of genes expressed in less than three cells. Furthermore, cells with a disproportionately high mapping rate to the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial read percentages &gt; 5.0 for EpiSC and aCSC, &gt;7.5 for CSC) have been removed, as they represent dead or damaged cells. Normalization has been carried out utilizing SCTransform. Biological replicates have been integrated into one data set by identifying pairwise anchors between data sets and using the anchors to harmonize the data sets. Dimensional reduction of the data set was achieved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on identified variable genes and subsequent UMAP embedding. The number of meaningful Principal Components (PCs) was selected by ranking them according to the percentage of variance explained by each PC, plotting them in an ‘Elbow Plot’ and manually determining the number of PCs that represent the majority of variance in the data set. Cells were clustered using the graph-based clustering approach implemented in Seurat v3.0. Doublet identification was achieved by using the tool DoubletFinder (v2.0.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>) by the generation of artificial doublets, using the PC distance to find each cell's proportion of artificial k nearest neighbors (pANN) and ranking them according to the expected number of doublets.

Spatial confirmation of associated markers is performed using in-situ RNA hybridization and discussed in light of other investigations. There is extensive data that provides new insights into the heterogeneity of epicardial stromal and activated cardiac stromal cells post-injury.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell transcriptomics defines heterogeneity of epicardial cells and fibroblasts within the infarcted heart&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hina Chaudhry as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, this letter is to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript is not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form. Essential revisions are required. All 3 reviewers have commented on the organization and flow of the manuscript which needs to be addressed.</p><p>In terms of title, the species needs to be identified according to the rules of <italic>eLife</italic>, thus the title should be changed to: Single-cell transcriptomics defines heterogeneity of epicardial cells and fibroblasts within the infarcted murine heart.</p><p>Other essential revisions include:</p><p>1) Please clarify your control and test conditions as Rev 2 requests. If the purity of the collected samples is described in a previous publication as noted by Rev 1, clarify that in the current manuscript.</p><p>2) Please address concerns regarding organization of the data and clarify cluster identities in Figure 1 as requested by Reviewer 3 and show heatmaps to show top 10 genes to see better segregation of genes across different clusters.</p><p>3) Please address the discrepancy brought up by Rev 3 between Figure 2 and 4: in Figure 2, the Hif1a/Hif1a-related and glycolysis related genes seem more highly expressed in 2 groups (WT1 and chemokine expressing cells). However, the feature plots and Dotplots supporting this need to be added to the figures. Show GO analysis with enrichment for Hif1a/glycolysis related genes in clusters vs. other clusters. It is shown that Hif1a related genes are expressed in clusters 1,7,8,4,2, and 11 but their lineage tracing analysis in Figure 4 suggests that Wt1+ cells (clusters 1,7) did not convert to any other cell type. Please address this discrepancy.</p><p>4) Please show experimental proof of dividing cells in Figure 2 with the use of (preferably) H3P to indicate mitosis or BrDU for DNA synthesis.</p><p>5) Please reorganize Results section: a lot of words are spent on cataloguing the genes identified in scRNA-seq instead of explaining their biological significance. Not until Figure 4 are the EpiSCs grouped into I, II, III based on their cell cycle active states where the whole manuscript begins to come into perspective. Then in Discussion, the authors continue to refer to groups I, II, III from Figures 1-3 where the 'grouping' concept was never introduced until Figure 4. Please implement the 'group' concept starting with Figure 1 so that it flows through the manuscript.</p><p>6) Provide further validations of genes defining cell clusters by in situ hybridization. It would be very interesting to understand more about where the different populations reside in the heart. Are they mixed? Are they at specific locations?</p><p>7) It would be helpful to see a comparison to EpiSc cells from the uninjured or sham control heart. If this is technically challenging, would it be feasible to pool 5-10 hearts to obtain adequate cell number?</p><p>8) It is surprising to see that TAM did not activate WT1+ cells at the chosen administration time window. Why was this time window chosen? Have the authors tested another time window as Day 5 is not really a 'regenerative' time window? If not, can you provide written justification? If 2/3 of all epicardial cells are WT1-negative, but are likely involved in paracrine signaling, is there another identifiable marker to label the WT1- cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Single-cell transcriptomics defines heterogeneity of epicardial cells and fibroblasts within the infarcted heart&quot;, the authors isolated epicardial stromal cells (EpiSC) and cardiac interstitial/stromal cells (termed active CSCs) from the same I/R heart and identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulation of EpiSCs via 10x genomics technology. They also performed transcriptome profile comparison between EpiSCs and aCSCs. This manuscript shows rigorous scientific investigation. Their isolation protocol is supported by their previous publication. Method section documented in detail of step-wise QC process of bioinformatics analysis. In summary, the analysis identified 11 clusters of EpiSC, some of which overlap with the well-established epicardial marker WT1 with confirmed in situ anatomical localization. When compared to aCSC, the two groups showed clear different function/states as expected. In the lineage tracing model, RNA velocity predicts cell hierarchy, cell-cell communication between populations, as well as cell cycle activity. Overall this manuscript provides a ton of information that can be helpful to the field.</p><p>After I/R injury, the first 48-72hrs is the peak of inflammation followed by rapid cardiac function deterioration to one week after infarct. The chosen cell harvest time at 5 days post injury is in the middle of the deteriorating window, too early for any repair or regeneration to begin, especially without gene/cell intervention. My concern is that the EpiSC collected at this time is too early to be regenerative and therefore the manuscript missed peak of when epicardial cells are being most regenerative. This calls for a longitudinal comparison of EpiSCs post injury (eg. 5dpi, 10dpic, 30dpi).</p><p>In result section, authors spent a lot of words on cataloging the genes identified in scRNA-seq in stead of explaining the biological significance of them. It is until Figure 4 where the EpiSCs are grouped into I, II, III, based on their cell cycle active states where the whole manuscript began to come into perspective. Then in Discussion, the authors continued with group I, II, III terms talking about Figure 1-3 where the &quot;grouping&quot; concept was never introduced until Figure 4. It would be helpful if the &quot;group&quot; concept was implemented since Figure 1 and flows through the manuscript.</p><p>Cluster 3, being the 3rd largest EpiSC cluster, is shown to be &quot;no GO enrichment found&quot; in Figure 1E. Are these cells viable? please provide explanation of such observations.</p><p>As EpiSC can be a source of cell repair after injury, it'll be very interesting to see direct comparison of EpiSCs between MI and sham heart. RNA profiling of EpiSC in an injured heart may hold insights of their activity, migration, and paracrine signal during cardiac repair. Though the authors mentioned that isolating EpiSC from uninjured heart is technically challenging (very few cells), would it be feasible if pooling 5-10 hearts together to increase the cell number?</p><p>It is unexpected to see TAM did not activate WT1+ cells at the chosen administration time window.

It is important to explicitly define your control and test conditions. The schematic of Figure 1A needs to be explained in the text. What is the anticipated overlap in cell populations? What is the purity of isolation across these groups? This would need to be benchmarked. Does the isolation of aCSC have EpiSC contamination?</p><p>2. I would highly consider re-working the format of the manuscript. Namely, describing the changes across test conditions – which are unique/enriched to the injured heart, and then what changes are specifically enriched in EpiSC. For example, are EpiSC populations unique to the epidermal tissue but share transcriptomic similarity (i.e overlap of cells in Figure 3) or is there anticipated purity issues in isolation?</p><p>3. Please try to tease out differences between CSC and aCSC?</p><p>4. Walking a reader through the text using a cluster-based designation is difficult to follow because there is a need to constantly refer to a figure for orientation. I would suggest re-naming these with distinct population base names (e.g. Wt1-EpiSC7, Wt1-EpiSC1).</p><p>5. There is an attempt to perform EpiSC and aCSC comparison analysis in Figure 3, however without clarity on the anticipated purity, this is hard to interpret.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following comments should allow the reader to better interpret or understand the significance of the work:</p><p>1) The current data is mostly based on scRNAseq analysis. There is confirmation by in situ hybridization analysis of only a few genes and information on the localization of cell populations within the heart superficially described and not being discussed.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors name the clusters based on 2 genes and show Dotplots for 5 genes. It might help to check for more marker genes to confirm clusters identities, and show heatmaps (as supported by Seurat) to show top 10 genes and see better segregation of genes across different clusters.</p><p>3) The scRNAseq analysis broadly finds three groups of cells with 11 total clusters. It is possible that due to technical issues the resolution to cluster the cells may have been chosen such as to get 11 clusters. The three broad groups remain mostly conserved but 11 sub-groups might change if one changes minor parameters in the analysis.</p><p>4) In Figure 2, the Hif1a/Hif1a related and glycolysis related genes seem more expressed in 2 groups (WT1, and chemokine expressing cells). However, the feature plots and Dotplots supporting the same need to be added to the figures. It would be relevant to show GO analysis with enrichment for Hif1a/ glycolysis related genes in the clusters vs other clusters. The authors show that Hif1a related genes are expressed in clusters 1,7, 8, 4,2 and 11, but their lineage tracing analysis in Figure 4 suggests that Wt1+ cells (clusters 1,7) did not convert to any of the other cell type. It would be great to discuss this apparent discrepancy.</p><p>5) Groups defined as dividing cells were not corroborated experimentally by e.g. BrDu experiments (Figure 2).</p><p>6) In the cluster analysis for aCSC (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) similar to EpiSC, the cluster calling is based on only 2 genes. However, many of the clusters show overlapping gene expression patterns (cluster 4,5, clusters 7,10). The authors try to separate cluster 4, 5 based on differential expression patterns of Sca1, Smoc2, Sparcl1, but no-evidence for the same has been provided. Feature plots or Dot plots for such genes for Clusters 4,5 and 7,10 would improve cluster definition.</p><p>7) In Figure 3, authors club EpiSC and aCSC together, while in another analysis (Figure 3—figure supplement 5) they club EpiSC and CSC together. Such an approach would normalize the data for aCSC to EpiSC and CSC to EpiSC. However, this would not normalize the data for aCSC to CSC. The way the data is currently presented affects results interpretation. A better way to analyse this data would be to club all three datasets together and then perform the normalizations. If such an approach seems difficult it might be useful to perform clubbing of aCSC and CSC and analyse the levels of the genes in EpiSC in this condition.</p><p>8) The label transfer performed in Figure 4 (from analysis done in Figure 1) could also include the labels from the sub-clustering performed on Wt1+ EpiSC cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This would help to understand better the RNA velocity data and help visualize and understand the lineage tracing to the more specific sub clusters- whether they originate from the more cell cycle associated what is the origin/fate of high protein expressing cells, etc.</p><p>9) The authors performed a ligand receptor analysis after the lineage tracing analysis, where they identify some pairs, which might be expressed in different groups. It would be useful to show at the analysis level the feature plot of the ligand receptors that indeed the expression levels of these pairs differs in the different groups. There is not confirmation by e.g. immunofluorescence that these proteins are expressed at different levels in different cells.</p><p>10) The manuscript seems to jump from EpiSC to comparisons of EpiSC with aCSC and again to analysis of EpiSC. The lineage tracing part of EpiSC of the manuscript could be clubbed after the clustering analysis of the EpiSCs. This would make all the EpiSC analysis stick together and the comparisons with aCSC at the end, making the flow of the story better.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65921.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript is not suitable for publication in eLife in its current form.

As to the dynamics of the multi-cell layer of EpiSC we know that it is formed within the first several days after I/R and does not further increase in thickness after 4 days post MI in the murine heart (1). Furthermore, the re-expression of fetal epicardial genes as measure of epicardial activation peaks 1 and 5 days after MI and declines afterwards (2). Because of these reasons, we chose day 5 post I/R for the scRNAseq analysis of EpiSC. The rational for selecting day 5 post MI is now better explained in the revised manuscript (page 4 line 87-89). We certainly agree that it also would be interesting to analyze the composition of EpiSC populations at later time points in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In result section, authors spent a lot of words on cataloging the genes identified in scRNA-seq in stead of explaining the biological significance of them.

EpiSC-3 marker genes show enrichment of GO terms for Molecular Function and Cellular Component, however, no GO term for Biological Process was found (which was displayed in Figure 1E of the original manuscript). This finding seems to be consistent with the observation of a reduced number of expressed genes per cell in EpiSC-3 (Figure 1G), suggesting a rather quiescent cell state. Triggered by your question we have removed the presentation of manually selected Biological Process terms in original Figure 1E and replaced this panel by an unbiased visualization of enriched GO terms using the Seurat wrapper Scillus. This latter information is now in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As EpiSC can be a source of cell repair after injury, it'll be very interesting to see direct comparison of EpiSCs between MI and sham heart.

We think that this contamination is the most critical issue rather than the low number of cells. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be overcome by pooling heart samples. However, in our CSC data set from uninjured hearts, a small yet defined population of epithelial/epicardial cells are visible as CSC-12, likely representing the epicardial monolayer. In CCA space alignment CSC-12 clustered together with cells of post-MI EpiSC-7 in CCA cluster A (Figure 4A and B). The direct comparison of CSC-12 and EpiSC-7 within CCA cluster A revealed differential expression of proliferation-associated and hypoxia-responsive genes pre and post MI and is now included in the manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 7D with source data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unexpected to see TAM did not activate WT1+ cells at the chosen administration time window.

Since the spatial distribution of <italic>Wt1</italic>-negative EpiSC in the epicardial post-MI multi-cell layer was verified by in situ hybridization, this most likely indicates that they are derived from cells already present in the epicardial monolayer of the uninjured heart, or might have migrated from the myocardium into the epicardial layer after injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

In the present study, aCSC‑6 was identified as residual EpiSC according to high gene expression of WT1+ together with other epicardial/epithelial genes (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). As is now better explained in the Results section “Post-MI aCSC in comparison to EpiSC”, the EpiSC layer is likely not completely removed from the myocardium during the cell isolation procedure. However, changing the protocol to extended digestion times would amplify the probability of non-epicardial cells in the EpiSC fraction.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we have rearranged data presentation – as requested by the other reviewers – and have carefully revised the text for clarity to avoid misunderstandings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For example, are EpiSC populations unique to the epidermal tissue but share transcriptomic similarity (i.e overlap of cells in Figure 3) or is there anticipated purity issues in isolation?</p></disp-quote><p>The epicardium of adult healthy hearts is a monolayer of epithelial cells. Myocardial ischemia is a prerequisite for generation of stromal cells in the epicardium, forming the EpiSC multilayer. As mentioned above in the response to reviewer 1, we identified epithelial cells of the epicardial monolayer in CSC-12 of our CSC data set from the uninjured heart. There was no other CSC population with expression of epicardial/epithelial markers (Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E). In the CCA space alignment of cell fraction data sets, CSC-12 overlapped with the epithelial cells of the post-MI heart (EpiSC-7) in CCA cluster A. We have included a comparative analysis of CSC-12 and EpiSC-7 revealing the MI-induced transcriptional changes in these epithelial cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 7D with source data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please try to tease out differences between CSC and aCSC?</p></disp-quote><p>Since there are already elaborate scRNAseq studies specifically addressing the activation of CSC after MI published (5,6). We therefore refrained from comparing CSC and aCSC again and instead focused on the novel scRNAseq data of the post-MI epicardium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Walking a reader through the text using a cluster-based designation is difficult to follow because there is a need to constantly refer to a figure for orientation. I would suggest re-naming these with distinct population base names (e.g. Wt1-EpiSC7, Wt1-EpiSC1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this very helpful comment. We have re-structured and revised the manuscript and now use the classification of EpiSC populations in group I, II, and III throughout the Results and Discussion sections as was also suggested by reviewer 1 (2.). We are confident that this has significantly improved the general readability of our text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is an attempt to perform EpiSC and aCSC comparison analysis in Figure 3, however without clarity on the anticipated purity, this is hard to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made an attempt to clarify the text in the Result sections “ScRNAseq of post-MI stromal cells” and “Post-MI aCSC in comparison to EpiSC” regarding the issue of purity (see also answer to 1.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The following comments should allow the reader to better interpret or understand the significance of the work:</p><p>1) The current data is mostly based on scRNAseq analysis. There is confirmation by in situ hybridization analysis of only a few genes and information on the localization of cell populations within the heart superficially described and not being discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a text passage specifically addressing the location of EpiSC populations in the post-MI epicardium in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors name the clusters based on 2 genes and show Dotplots for 5 genes. It might help to check for more marker genes to confirm clusters identities, and show heatmaps (as supported by Seurat) to show top 10 genes and see better segregation of genes across different clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>Heat maps visualizing the expression of top 10 marker genes are now included for EpiSC (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), aCSC (Figure 4—figure supplement 3), and CSC (Figure 1—figure supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The scRNAseq analysis broadly finds three groups of cells with 11 total clusters. It is possible that due to technical issues the resolution to cluster the cells may have been chosen such as to get 11 clusters. The three broad groups remain mostly conserved but 11 sub-groups might change if one changes minor parameters in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>You are absolutely correct that changing the resolution parameter during cluster identification will lead to a different number of detected clusters. We have discussed this issue and finally decided for the chosen resolution because this resulted in the most biological meaningful results. We have tested different resolution parameters during data analysis, but this either leads to over-clustering, resulting in multiple biological non-meaningful clusters, or to under-clustering, leading to significant loss of cellular heterogeneity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2, the Hif1a/Hif1a related and glycolysis related genes seem more expressed in 2 groups (WT1, and chemokine expressing cells). However, the feature plots and Dotplots supporting the same need to be added to the figures. It would be relevant to show GO analysis with enrichment for Hif1a/ glycolysis related genes in the clusters vs other clusters. The authors show that Hif1a related genes are expressed in clusters 1,7, 8, 4,2 and 11, but their lineage tracing analysis in Figure 4 suggests that Wt1+ cells (clusters 1,7) did not convert to any of the other cell type. It would be great to discuss this apparent discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>To resolve this issue, we have added supporting violin plots to the Figure (now Figure 3). GO enrichment analysis of the genes with significantly higher expression in group I and II populations <italic>vs</italic>. group III populations (Supplementary file 6) indeed yielded terms associated with the hypoxia/HIF-mediated metabolic switch towards glycolysis, such as Glycolytic Process (FDR q-value: 3.05E-02), Glucose Metabolic Process (FDR q-value: 3.22E-02), and Pyruvate Biosynthetic Process (FDR q-value: 2.66E-02). This information is now included in the Results (section “Expression of cardiomyogenesis-associated genes, HIF-1-responsive genes, and paracrine factors”).</p><p>There is no discrepancy at all in the observations that these populations share enriched expression of HIF-1-responsive genes and that the WT1- among them do not derive from the Wt1+ ones. The highly conserved HIF-1 response is due to the tight regulation of HIF-1α protein stability only transient and strongly depends on environmental conditions (acute hypoxia). Therefore, if cells are located in a microenvironment with low oxygen levels, HIF-1 will be induced and its target genes will be expressed, but the cells don’t need to be of the same lineage. We have clarified this in the Results (section “Expression of cardiomyogenesis-associated genes, HIF-1-responsive genes, and paracrine factors”) and the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Groups defined as dividing cells were not corroborated experimentally by e.g. BrDu experiments (Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Van Wijk et al. have already nicely shown the presence of proliferating cells in the epicardial post-MI multi-cell layer by BrdU incorporation (7). We have now added this information to the text (Results section “Spatial mRNA expression of EpiSC population identifiers”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the cluster analysis for aCSC (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) similar to EpiSC, the cluster calling is based on only 2 genes. However, many of the clusters show overlapping gene expression patterns (cluster 4,5, clusters 7,10). The authors try to separate cluster 4, 5 based on differential expression patterns of Sca1, Smoc2, Sparcl1, but no-evidence for the same has been provided. Feature plots or Dot plots for such genes for Clusters 4,5 and 7,10 would improve cluster definition.</p></disp-quote><p>As already mentioned above (2.), we have now included a heat map of aCSC top 10 marker genes (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) that confirms cluster identities. Additionally, we included feature plots of selected marker genes visualizing the segregation of aCSC-4, 5 and aCSC-7,10, respectively (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3, authors club EpiSC and aCSC together, while in another analysis (Figure 3—figure supplement 5) they club EpiSC and CSC together. Such an approach would normalize the data for aCSC to EpiSC and CSC to EpiSC. However, this would not normalize the data for aCSC to CSC. The way the data is currently presented affects results interpretation. A better way to analyse this data would be to club all three datasets together and then perform the normalizations. If such an approach seems difficult it might be useful to perform clubbing of aCSC and CSC and analyse the levels of the genes in EpiSC in this condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for making us aware of this issue. To avoid potential misinterpretation due to separate normalization, we replaced the individual CAA space alignments (EpiSC and aCSC or EpiSC and CSC) by a combined analysis of all three fractions. This information is now displayed in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The label transfer performed in Figure 4 (from analysis done in Figure 1) could also include the labels from the sub-clustering performed on Wt1+ EpiSC cells in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This would help to understand better the RNA velocity data and help visualize and understand the lineage tracing to the more specific sub clusters- whether they originate from the more cell cycle associated what is the origin/fate of high protein expressing cells, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We have added the label transfer of the <italic>Wt1</italic>-expressing subclusters (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors performed a ligand receptor analysis after the lineage tracing analysis, where they identify some pairs, which might be expressed in different groups. It would be useful to show at the analysis level the feature plot of the ligand receptors that indeed the expression levels of these pairs differs in the different groups. There is not confirmation by e.g. immunofluorescence that these proteins are expressed at different levels in different cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Feature plots visualizing the expression levels of selected receptor-ligand pairs across different EpiSC populations are now included as Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The manuscript seems to jump from EpiSC to comparisons of EpiSC with aCSC and again to analysis of EpiSC. The lineage tracing part of EpiSC of the manuscript could be clubbed after the clustering analysis of the EpiSCs. This would make all the EpiSC analysis stick together and the comparisons with aCSC at the end, making the flow of the story better.</p></disp-quote><p>Very good point, thank you! We have re-structured the manuscript (as was also suggested by reviewer 1), so that now the comparison of EpiSC, aCSC, and CSC is at the end in Figure 4 and the lineage tracing results are incorporated in Figure 2.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
