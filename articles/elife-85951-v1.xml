The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for top-down modulatory processes, and despite previous studies adopting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over this region provided encouraging results in enhancing extinction, no studies have hitherto explored the effects of stimulating the medial anterior PFC (aPFC, encompassing the Brodmann area 10) on threat memory and generalization. Here we showed that rTMS over the aPFC applied before threat memory retrieval immediately decreases implicit reactions to learned and novel stimuli in humans. These effects enduringly persisted 1 week later in the absence of rTMS. No effects were detected on explicit recognition. Critically, rTMS over the aPFC resulted in a more pronounced reduction of defensive responses compared to rTMS targeting the dorsolateral PFC. These findings reveal a previously unexplored prefrontal region, the modulation of which can efficiently and durably inhibit implicit reactions to learned threats. This represents a significant advancement toward the long-term deactivation of exaggerated responses to threats.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>TMS</kwd><kwd>anterior prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>threat memory</kwd><kwd>threat generalization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007388</institution-id><institution>Compagnia di San Paolo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSTO167503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacchetti</surname><given-names>Benedetto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009701</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Giovanni Goria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manassero</surname><given-names>Eugenio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007364</institution-id><institution>Fondazione CRT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacchetti</surname><given-names>Benedetto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003770</institution-id><institution>Banca d'Italia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacchetti</surname><given-names>Benedetto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006747</institution-id><institution>Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Verona Vicenza Belluno e Ancona</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacchetti</surname><given-names>Benedetto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian Ministry of University and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sacchetti</surname><given-names>Benedetto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Implicit defensive reactions to a learned threat-predictive cue and novel stimuli may be significantly downregulated through a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation procedure over the medial anterior prefrontal cortex in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Emotional memories related to past threat experiences allow humans to predict future dangers and trigger adaptive defensive reactions when encountering learned threat-signaling cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiFazio et al., 2022</xref>). However, extremely dangerous situations may lead to psychological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilker et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the ability to generalize defensive reactions to new stimuli enables organisms to anticipate potential threats and respond to them based on similar perilous experiences lived in the past. On the other hand, evaluation mechanisms excessively biased toward threat generalization (i.e. overgeneralization) may underlie anxiety disorders and trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dunsmoor and Paz, 2015</xref>). At the base of these processes, in a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manassero et al., 2019</xref>). we observed that autonomic-implicit and cognitive-explicit tunings may diverge when humans are exposed to the same new stimuli, where cognitive generalization may enable a flexible evaluation of incoming cues to develop adaptive predictions of potential dangers. The crosswise presence of overgeneralization in anxiety diseases and the dissociation between autonomic and cognitive defensive response patterns highlight the importance of including both implicit and explicit generalization tasks to characterize fear-related processes in humans.</p><p>Attempting to downregulate the emotional overreactions toward threat-predictive and new stimuli is one of the main routes for developing effective treatments for anxiety and post-traumatic disorders. Common approaches such as pharmacological treatments and cognitive-behavioral therapy have demonstrated partial efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>), and recent evidence suggests that the functional outcome of behavioral methods may depend on the extent to which the prefrontal cortex is recruited during these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fonzo et al., 2017a</xref>). Hence, new intervention strategies influencing the prefrontal dynamics would represent an important advance in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marković et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies adopted transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) to disrupt the consolidation of these memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asthana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mungee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mungee et al., 2016</xref>), potentiate extinction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abend et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van ’t Wout et al., 2016</xref>), and narrow threat generalization patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roesmann et al., 2022</xref>), leading to contradictory results. According to one work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asthana et al., 2013</xref>), cathodal stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) disrupted threat memory consolidation, with no enhancing effect of anodal stimulation. In contrast, other studies found an increase in implicit responses with anodal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mungee et al., 2014</xref>) and no effect of cathodal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mungee et al., 2016</xref>) over the same site. Moreover, one study employing anodal stimulation over the dlPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">van ’t Wout et al., 2016</xref>) revealed an improvement in extinction learning but no delayed effects on the recall of the extinction memory. A further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abend et al., 2016</xref>) reported that low-frequency alternating-current (AC) stimulation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) augmented the defensive responses, whereas direct-current (DC) stimulation widened threat generalization profiles.</p><p>An alternative neurostimulation approach is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which ensures greater focality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miniussi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elder and Taylor, 2014</xref>). Some rTMS studies targeted the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guhn et al., 2014</xref>) and the posterior PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raij et al., 2018</xref>) to obtain a successful enhancement of extinction learning, while others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgomaneri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 2022</xref>) targeted the dlPFC to disrupt threat-memory reconsolidation. Indeed, most rTMS-based research targeting the PFC has pursued an improvement of fear extinction, which may be followed by a return of fear with a change of context (i.e., renewal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vervliet et al., 2013</xref>) where prevention of relapse over time is the main challenge for therapies dedicated to post-traumatic and anxiety disorders. No previous studies reported significant effects in downmodulating the defensive responses triggered by a learned threatening stimulus without adopting fear extinction.</p><p>So far, human brain stimulation studies have been mainly focused on the dorsolateral region of the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marković et al., 2021</xref>), partly because other prefrontal areas involved in the top-down regulation of subcortical threat-detection systems ‒ such as the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), are too deep to be reached with TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raij et al., 2018</xref>). However, within the PFC, a brain structure that is emerging to be engaged in downstream emotional regulation is the anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), also known as the frontopolar cortex or rostral frontal cortex. The aPFC encompasses the most anterior portion of the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10 [BA 10]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ramnani and Owen, 2004</xref>) and extends over a wider cortical space in humans than in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Semendeferi et al., 2001</xref>). Even if it has not been included in fear network models so far, many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Volman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bramson et al., 2020</xref>) highlighted its role in emotional downregulation. Anatomical projections have been found between the lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bramson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Folloni et al., 2019</xref>) and the medial aPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peng et al., 2018</xref>) and the amygdala, and functional connectivity has been detected between the aPFC and the vmPFC during fear downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klumpers et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, hypoactivation, reduced connectivity, and altered thickness of aPFC were reported in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lanius et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sadeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sadeh et al., 2016</xref>), whereas a longitudinal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaldewaij et al., 2021</xref>) showed that strong activation of the aPFC resulted in a higher resilience against PTSD onset. Accordingly, enhanced aPFC activity and potentiated aPFC-vmPFC connectivity were detected after an effective therapy in PTSD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fonzo et al., 2017b</xref>). Crucially, the aPFC is a surface area easily accessible with rTMS. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted so far to explore the effects of aPFC stimulation on the expression of a threat memory without extinction learning in humans.</p><p>In the current study, we posited that applying rTMS to the aPFC could influence implicit defensive responses to a learned threat-predictive stimulus and/or the conscious recognition of it. Subsequently, we explored additional hypotheses. The second hypothesis centered on the potential extension of rTMS dampening effects to new stimuli, thereby reducing threat generalization. The third hypothesis focused on the enduring persistence of rTMS effects on defensive responses over time. The final hypothesis proposed that the dampening effects achieved by stimulating the aPFC might surpass those observed when targeting the dorsolateral PFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>aPFC-focused rTMS effects on implicit defensive reactions toward threat-predictive and new cues</title><p>To explore the effects of an aPFC-centered rTMS on the implicit responses to a learned threat, we designed a three-session experiment starting with a threat learning session followed by an implicit retention test and a follow-up implicit retest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram depicting the experimental outline and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) conditions.</title><p>In the first session (day 1, context A), participants underwent a single-cue threat conditioning in which a tone (CS) was paired with a mild electrical shock (US). In the second session (day 8, context B), a 1 Hz-rTMS procedure was actively applied over the medial anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC, n = 30; aPFC-E, n = 21), sham-applied over the same site (sham, n = 30; sham-E, n = 21), actively applied over the left occipital cortex (OC, n = 30) and over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, n = 30). In the implicit conditions (aPFC, sham, OC, dlPFC), subjects underwent an implicit test during which they were presented with the CS and two new stimuli (NS<sub>1</sub> and NS<sub>2</sub>) and then an unconditioned threat test while being recorded in their skin conductance responses (SCRs). In the explicit conditions (aPFC-E, sham-E), participants underwent an explicit two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) recognition task during which they were presented with tone pairs each composed of the CS and one of the two NSs, and they were asked to recognize the CS providing a confidence level for each choice. Last, participants underwent a 2AFC perceptual discrimination test, in which they had to judge whether the two tones in each pair (CS and/or NSs) were ‘the same tone’ or ‘different tones’. The third session (day 15, context A) was identical to the second one except for the absence of the rTMS.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85951-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>During the learning session, participants learned to associate an auditory cue (conditioned stimulus [CS], 800 Hz) with a mild electric stimulation (unconditioned stimulus [US], individually calibrated intensity) in a given environment (context A).

Indeed, the context shift for this session mirrors a real-life treatment setting, which unlikely takes place in the threatening location. To test implicit threat memory, we performed an implicit recognition task in which subjects were exposed to the CS while being recorded in their evoked autonomic reactions (i.e., electrodermal SCRs). No US shocks were delivered during this phase. Besides the CS, participants were presented with two novel but perceptually similar tones (NS<sub>1</sub>, 1000 Hz; NS<sub>2</sub>, 600 Hz) to study threat generalization. Auditory frequencies of NSs were selected to obtain a slowly decaying gradient of defensive tunings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manassero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Onat and Büchel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laufer et al., 2016</xref>). To test the effects of rTMS on memory retention, we compared the between-group differences as well as the within-group differences from the acquisition phase to the testing phase through a 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA. This analysis yielded a nonsignificant main effect of group (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 2.015, p=0.161, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.034), a nonsignificant main effect of phase (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 0.053, p=0.818, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.001), and a significant group × phase interaction (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 13.445, p=0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.188). Simple main effects analysis revealed no significantly different mean CS-evoked SCRs between groups during the conditioning phase (p=0.506; Bonferroni corrected). On the contrary, during the test phase subjects who received rTMS over the aPFC exhibited weakened CS-related SCRs than those observed in the sham group (p=0.006; Bonferroni corrected). Moreover, the aPFC group showed reduced autonomic responses to the CS from conditioning to test (p=0.008; Bonferroni corrected), whereas the sham group displayed increased mean SCRs to the CS from conditioning to test (p=0.018; Bonferroni corrected) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). This data indicates that the rTMS procedure affected SCRs triggered by memory retrieval performed shortly after rTMS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that brain stimulation may promptly attenuate implicit defensive reactions during memory retrieval.</p><p>In the test session, we also analyzed threat generalization to the NSs through a 2 × 3 mixed ANOVA, which showed a significant main effect of group (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 5.310, p=0.025, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.084), a nonsignificant main effect of tone (F<sub>(2,116)</sub> = 0.690, p=0.504, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.012), and a nonsignificant group × tone interaction (F<sub>(2,116)</sub> = 1.301, p=0.276, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.022), revealing that the aPFC group displayed overall attenuated responses to tones relative to the sham condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to disambiguate whether the rTMS effects were due to a general downregulation of electrodermal responsivity or whether they specifically targeted the threat memory. To this end, subjects were presented with an unconditioned threatening stimulus consisting of a female scream sample (unconditioned stimulus 2 [US<sub>2</sub>]) while being recorded in their SCRs. No significant differences emerged between conditions (<italic>t</italic><sub>(58)</sub> = 0.334, p=0.739, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.002), indicating that the rTMS did not cause an overall inhibition of electrodermal reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>To test whether and to what extent rTMS-related outcomes endured beyond the aftereffect window and persisted over a long-term period, we planned a follow-up session. One week after the threat memory retrieval test, all participants returned to the conditioning room (context A) and underwent a re-testing phase, identical to the testing one except for the absence of rTMS administration. This phase also allowed us to test a possible renewal effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vervliet et al., 2013</xref>) since subjects were re-exposed to the original threatening environment.</p><p>Concerning the implicit responses to the CS, a 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA showed a nonsignificant main effect of group (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 1.952, p=0.168, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.033), a significant main effect of phase (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 7.690, p=0.007, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.117), and a significant group × phase interaction (F<sub>(1,58)</sub> = 9.966, p=0.003, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.147). Simple main effects analysis revealed that participants of the aPFC group persisted in displaying weaker SCRs than those observed in the sham group (p=0.006; Bonferroni corrected). Moreover, the aPFC group persisted in showing a decrease of defensive reactions to the CS from conditioning to follow-up (p&lt;0.001; Bonferroni corrected), while the sham group did not display significantly different SCRs in the two phases (p=0.787; Bonferroni corrected) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).</p><p>These findings support an enduring effect of the aPFC-rTMS in attenuating the long-term implicit defensive responses to the learned threat-predictive cue, even with the re-exposition to the environment where threat learning had occurred. We next analyzed the autonomous response patterns to the female scream sample (unconditioned stimulus 2 [US<sub>2</sub>]) and again we found that reactions did not differ between groups (<italic>t</italic><sub>(58)</sub> = 0.057, p=0.955, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, the persistent effect was expressed notwithstanding an unaffected electrodermal overall reactivity.</p><p>An important aspect to consider is that rTMS application over the forehead can be subjectively perceived as unpleasant. We, therefore, investigated whether an rTMS-related discomfort before memory retrieval might have provoked habituation to unpleasant stimulations, leading to a reduction in SCR levels during CS presentations. We repeated the entire experiment in one further group (ctrl discomfort, n = 10) by replacing the rTMS procedure with a 10 min discomfort-inducing procedure over the same site of the forehead to mimic the rTMS-evoked unpleasant sensations in the absence of neural stimulation effects. This group showed no significantly different CS-evoked SCR levels to those of the sham group during the test session as well as during the follow-up session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the discomfort experienced during the rTMS procedure did not contribute to the reduction of electrodermal responses observed in the aPFC-stimulated group.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>aPFC-focused rTMS effects on the explicit memory recognition and perceptual discrimination</title><p>We then investigated the effect of rTMS over the aPFC on the retention of explicit-declarative threat memories. A further group of subjects that received the identical 1 Hz-rTMS procedure over the aPFC (aPFC-E, n = 21) and a further control group (sham-E, n = 21) underwent an explicit two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) recognition task, in which they were presented with a random sequence of tone pairs, each composed of the CS and one of the two NSs.

A study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guhn et al., 2014</xref>) administering one session of 10 Hz-rTMS over the mPFC observed enhancement of extinction learning. These behavioral results were mirrored by the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) findings, which revealed increased mPFC activity in the stimulated group relative to the sham group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guhn et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raij et al., 2018</xref> delivered brief 20 Hz-rTMS trains over the left posterior PFC ‒ a region that showed robust functional connectivity with the vmPFC‒ during extinction learning and found a reduction of defensive responses during extinction recall.</p><p>Our study differs from the previous ones because we tested rTMS effects over the medial aPFC (medial BA 10), and we did not include extinction training before retrieval. We observed a significant decrease in defensive reactions shortly after rTMS, and this effect was maintained until the follow-up session. Thus, we identified a previously unexplored prefrontal region, the modulation of which can efficiently and durably inhibit implicit reactions to learned threats. These dampening effects may be due to the fact that rTMS over the aPFC have directly modulated the defensive responses activated by the implicit threat memory trace. Alternatively, the rTMS procedure over the aPFC may have inhibited the recall of the CS-US association, preventing the defensive responses from being activated by the CS. This possibility would be in line with a large body of literature on humans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hiser and Koenigs, 2018</xref>), which demonstrates the importance of the medial PFC for value-based processing.</p><p>Autonomic reactions to the new tones in the aPFC group relative to the sham control group did not support the conclusion that rTMS targeted threat generalization, leaving open the question of the specificity of rTMS effects. However, the lack of between-group differences in the autonomic responses to the US<sub>2</sub> seems to suggest that the observed effect may be memory-related and not due to a general dampening of autonomic reactivity. Interestingly, defensive responses toward the NSs were decreased following the stimulation of the left occipital cortex (OC group, BA18/19). This effect might be explained by the fact that anatomical and functional reciprocal projections between the medial BA10 and visual association cortices (including BA17/18/19) have been traced via the fronto-occipital fasciculus (FOF) of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Orr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the persistence of inhibitory effects during the follow-up session, different factors may have contributed to this result. Firstly, the inhibition of SCR responses induced by rTMS during the mnemonic retention test could have persistently reduced such conditioned responses even at a distance from the treatment. Moreover, the inhibition of these responses during the test might have boosted the extinction of these responses, contributing to keeping them low over time. On this possibility, it should be pointed out that one core knowledge about extinction is that under certain circumstances ‒ such as a simple passage of time (i.e., spontaneous recovery) or a change in surrounding context (i.e., renewal) ‒ extinguished reactions triggered by the CS may reoccur, giving rise to the phenomenon known as return of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vervliet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rachman, 1966</xref>). To test potential renewal phenomena, which have not been investigated in the aforementioned studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guhn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raij et al., 2018</xref>), we opted for a context-shift amongst the learning (context A), the test (context B), and the follow-up phase (context A), and we found downregulated defensive reactions in both the test and the follow-up phases. These data demonstrated that the aPFC-rTMS protocol long-term reduced threat memory expression in a different context as well as in the context in which the threatening experience had occurred, thus preventing the return of fear. Finally, we cannot exclude that the rTMS applied immediately before the mnemonic retention test interfered with the reconsolidation process that is known to occur after this test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 2022</xref>), resulting in a persistent impairment in the retention of this mnemonic trace.</p><p>To potentiate the neural activity of the PFC, both the aforementioned studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guhn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raij et al., 2018</xref>) adopted high-frequency rTMS protocols, which are conventionally considered excitatory of proximal brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pascual-Leone et al., 1998</xref>). In our study, we adopted a low-frequency rTMS protocol, which is conventionally considered inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pascual-Leone et al., 1998</xref>). Recent evidence, however, challenged this common frequency-dependent rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luber and Deng, 2016</xref>). Resting-state functional MRI studies demonstrated that 1 Hz-rTMS protocols may also induce downstream distal effects and enhance functional connectivity amongst the brain regions located underneath the coil and remote brain areas of the stimulated neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beynel et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisenegger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nahas et al., 2001</xref>) reported that 1 Hz-rTMS procedures delivered over the PFC may paradoxically increase regional cerebral blood flow.</p><p>The dorsolateral PFC is another prefrontal region that is assumed to be critically involved in threat learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunsmoor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunsmoor et al., 2008</xref>) and the downregulation of the cortico-meso-limbic network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vicario et al., 2019</xref>). One investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgomaneri et al., 2020</xref>) probed the effects of a 1 Hz-rTMS over the dlPFC after memory reactivation to disrupt threat-memory reconsolidation. Stimulated groups failed to discriminate between threatening and safe stimuli, with an increase in autonomic responses to these last ones. A more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 2022</xref>) adopted the continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over the right dlPFC during the reconsolidation window and successfully decreased the defensive responses for threat memories. In our study, we found an immediate and long-term reduction of defensive responses to the CS only in subjects that were stimulated over the aPFC, while reactions to the NSs were decreased in both conditions. This evidence suggests that targeting the aPFC might represent a more promising approach for therapeutic applications. The lack of any downregulation of CS-evoked reactions that we found in the dlPFC group, at odds with previous studies targeting the same cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgomaneri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 2022</xref>), might be due either to the fact that we did not adopt an extinction paradigm or to the different brain stimulation approach (rTMS vs. cTBS).</p><p>The neural mechanisms by which rTMS over the aPFC decreases threat-conditioned responses can be manifold.

Through the direct or indirect connections of the aPFC with these areas, it might be that the effects of focal manipulations of aPFC activity reflect complex and dynamic changes in the overall neural network state and/or influence the activity of some of these areas.</p><p>Although previous studies enlightened the role of the medial BA10 and BA10‒posterior hippocampus functional connectivity in episodic memory retrieval (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faran, 2023</xref>), we did not detect any rTMS-driven effect on explicit recognition memory. The observed divergence between autonomous and declarative patterns might have been due to a selective rTMS action upon the neural system supporting implicit threat processing, which has been widely dissociated from the neural system underlying explicit memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bechara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LaBar and Cabeza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knight et al., 2009</xref>). Critically, an rTMS procedure that shapes implicit overreactions to learned threats without affecting conscious knowledge of danger might represent a strategic advantage for therapeutic applications.</p><p>Since prevention of relapse is the main challenge for therapies dedicated to post-traumatic and anxiety disorders, our findings may represent an advance in this direction by providing a potential strategy to deactivate emotional overreactions and, most of all, to prevent the return of fear. Future research perspectives might consist of exploring this rTMS application over the aPFC in clinical populations displaying high levels of anxiety or suffering from anxiety disorders and PTSDs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>All participants (n = 183) were healthy volunteers (mean age: 23.86 ± 2.90, 74 males and 109 females) with no history of psychiatric disorders, neurological illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, illegal drug use, musical training, or any other exclusion criteria for rTMS administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>).

The rTMS intensity was set at 80% of the rMT for subjects whose rMT was ≤50% of the machine’s maximum deliverable power (e.g., the intensity corresponded to 40% of the maximum power when the rMT was equal to 50% of the same parameter). For subjects with an rMT &gt; 50%, the stimulation intensity was always set to a ceiling corresponding to 40% of the machine’s maximum deliverable power (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for each group’s mean rMT and mean stimulation intensity).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions (for the authors):</italic></p><p>General summary</p><p>This study presents the useful observation that repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the medial prefrontal cortex exerts dampening effects of conditioned responses and generalization of these responses to similar cues. However, the evidence supporting the claims of the authors is incomplete. If the observations hold with the recommended analyses, the work will be of interest to psychologists and neuroscientists and neuropsychiatrists.</p><p>Comments and recommendations:</p><p>The reviewers indicate many strengths of the study, including the use of multiple stimulation sites (including sham and active control) and the inclusion of a follow-up test and a generalization tests. However, several conceptual, methodological and interpretational issues remain that currently limit the value of potential conclusions drawn from this work. There are a number issues that have to be addressed, those include an alternative analysis approach (rev 1 and 2), issues related to the stimulation sites, and the effects of potential sensory confounds (rev 2). I have summarized the most important issues underneath. There were also a number of specific recommendations by each of the reviewers that we would like you to take into account (see individual review reports for those suggestions).</p><p>1) Pre-processing should be in line with accepted standards in the fear conditioning field: Start out to range correct each individual SCR datapoint (and clarify what exact value (e.g., average, maximum) of the US during acquisition is used to do so). Differences scores with a preconditioning phase are very uncommon, and also not necessary when a comparison with the acquisition data is being made in the main analyses. No matter what, only as a final step, should the data be square root transformed.</p><p>2) Critical analyses are lacking, namely within subject analyses. Thus, the main analyses should incorporate a within-subject factor of Time (pre and post intervention), possibly also with the within- subject factor Trial Number (e.g., the last 4 trials of acquisition and the four test trials) such that an omnibus test can be performed to assess whether there is an interaction with Time and Group (and or Trial Number). If so, this can be followed-up with relevant planned contrasts investigating whether fear is significantly reduced in the mPFC group, and whether the DIFFERENCE in fear reduction is higher in the mPFC group as compared to such difference scores in the other groups.</p><p>This also counts for the follow-up analyses: there should be within-subject comparisons.</p><p>3) The generalization analyses should consist of the within subject factor Stimulus Type (CS, NS1, NS2) and between subject factor Group. Again, only in the case of a significant omnibus test, these should be followed up by relevant planned comparisons.</p><p>4) Even if the pattern of results holds, then the claim that the long- term follow-up reductions of fear were achieved in the absence of any extinction cannot be made with confidence: after all, upon mPFC stimulation during the second session, the CS was presented four times, and so were each of the two generalization stimuli. So perhaps extinction was not complete, but almost certainly some extinction has taken place: it is well-known that the strongest extinction-learning typically takes place in the first trials (e.g., due to higher prediction errors). The authors do not give any alternative theoretical explanation for the enduring reduction of fear reduction, which would be interesting to learn their thoughts on.</p><p>5) There is a discrepancy between the background in the introduction and the eventual aim to stimulate BA10: In the introduction the authors sketch that what they call 'mPFC' is involved in regulation of threat responses. The authors make a convincing case, however, almost all of the evidence they present concerns the ventromedial part of the prefrontal cortex (refs 18-25). Then they mention they aim to stimulate BA10, however, BA10 is anatomically, cytoarchitectonically and functionally a completely different area than vmPFC. This raises the question whether the rationale holds given that they stimulate BA10.</p><p>The authors should be more precise in their nomenclature throughout the manuscript. In the introduction clarify nomenclature and mention limitations discrepancy of previous literature, ideal aim and operationalization limitations.</p><p>6) Although the authors are praised for including both sham and active control regions, the controls might not be optimally chosen to control for the potential confounds of their condition of interest (mPFC-TMS). Namely, TMS on the forehead can be unpleasant, if not painful, whereas sham-TMS or TMS applied to the back of the head or even over dlPFC is not (or less so at the very least). Given that the SCR results after mPFC TMS show exactly the same temporal pattern as the sham-TMS but with a lower starting point, one could wonder whether a painful stimulation prior to the retrieval might already have caused habituation to painful stimulation observed in SCR in consequent CS presentations. A control region that would have been more obvious to take is the lateral part of BA10, by moving the TMS coil several centimeters to the left or right, circumventing all things potentially called medial but giving similar unpleasant sensations (pain etc).</p><p>The authors should consider to add simulations of the TMS effects on the neural tissue. That will make it easier for non-experts in TMS to judge the success of your manipulation. In addition, they should discuss in the discussion clearly that one cannot rule out the possibilities that effects may be the consequence of pain in the experimental stimulation condition (and not in control conditions) as this may have 'masked' the 'threat of shock' in the test session.</p><p>7) To increase transparency and credibility, ideally, the paper should adopt a complete open science approach: the raw data along with the code to arrive at results should be openly accessible. The acquisition data should also be presented in graphs, both with all trials and the relevant averages that are chosen to compare for the pre-post intervention effect.</p><p>8) To further strengthen the theoretical framework of the paper, the rationale to include the explicit memory tests as well as a substantiation of the hypotheses should be included in the introduction. Also, a clear and substantial reasoning behind the inclusion of the generalization tests is required. Currently is seems a bit as if the study was actually set-up as some sort-of reconsolidation intervention. I am saying this because the introduction is oblivious as to per what mechanism could mediate the long-term effects of the intervention, if not extinction of reconsolidation. So a clear reasoning why the long-term test was implemented and why the authors hypothesize what they hypothesize should be added.</p><p>9) The discussion could reflect more on what mechanisms may be behind the long-term effect, and how the absence of any effects of the explicit memory tests should be interpreted. A critical reflection on what exact theoretical constructs these tests represent is also required.</p><p>To conclude:</p><p>There is a possibility that a re-analysis of the data using properly preprocessed SCR data along with analyses that include comparisons with the conditioned responses during acquisition reveal a different pattern of results. Therefore, whether the authors truly achieved their aims and whether the results support their conclusions is as of yet undecided. If the results hold and all of the above issues can be addressed, this study could be a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The suggestions that I'd like to present here build on the concerns I have raised in the public review, along with some further suggestions to generally strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>– Pre-processing should be in line with accepted standards in the fear conditioning field: Start out to range correct each individual SCR datapoint (and clarify what exact value (e.g., average, maximum) of the US during acquisition is used to do so). Differences scores with a preconditioning phase are very uncommon, and also not necessary when a comparison with the acquisition data is being made in the main analyses. No matter what, only as a final step, should the data be square root transformed.</p><p>– The main analyses should incorporate a within-subject factor of Time (pre and post intervention), possibly also with the within-subject factor Trial Number (e.g., the last 4 trials of acquisition and the four test trials) such that an omnibus test can be performed to assess whether there is an interaction with Time and Group (and or Trial Number). If so, this can be followed-up with relevant planned contrasts investigating whether fear is significantly reduced in the mPFC group, and whether the DIFFERENCE in fear reduction is higher in the mPFC group as compared to such difference scores in the other groups.</p><p>– The generalization analyses should consist of the within subject factor Stimulus Type (CS, NS1, NS2) and between subject factor Group. Again, only in the case of a significant omnibus test, these should be followed up by relevant planned comparisons.</p><p>– Very important: to increase transparency and credibility, ideally, the paper should adopt a complete open science approach: the raw data along with the code to arrive at results should be openly accessible. The acquisition data should also be presented in graphs, both with all trials and the relevant averages that are chosen to compare for the pre-post intervention effect.</p><p>– Generally, the factors and their levels of performed ANOVAs should always be reported.</p><p>– Pay attention to using consistent numbers after the comma's, this currently varies widely.</p><p>– For transparency, always report the exact p-value (so not p&gt;0.05)</p><p>– To strengthen the theoretical framework of the paper, the rationale to include the explicit memory tests as well as a substantiation of the hypotheses should be included in the introduction. Also, a clear and substantial reasoning behind the inclusion of the generalization tests is required.

Differences scores with a preconditioning phase are very uncommon, and also not necessary when a comparison with the acquisition data is being made in the main analyses. No matter what, only as a final step, should the data be square root transformed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for raising this important point. To align our data analysis with the accepted standards in the fear conditioning field, we re-analyzed our data starting by range-correcting each participant’s SCR raw data point, dividing it by the same participant’s average US response during the conditioning phase. We finally applied a square-root transformation of each scaled data point (see Methods section).</p><p>As usefully suggested, we have also analyzed the responses elicited by the CS during the conditioning phase and we then processed them in the same manner. In line with previous studies in the same field (Raij <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018), the trials in which the US shock was delivered (12 out of 15 trials) were excluded to avoid artifacts/confounds induced by the electric shock itself. Therefore, the remaining 3 out of 15 trials were analyzed. The data we obtained (with a sample of <italic>n</italic> = 21 participants) were not normally distributed, preventing us from running the suggested omnibus ANOVA analysis. Thus, we reasoned to perform a new power analysis and repeat the experiments to reach a sample width of <italic>n</italic> = 30 (for the aPFC ) Throughout the manuscript, we have changed the denomination of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with the term “medial <italic>anterior</italic> prefrontal cortex” (aPFC, anatomically corresponding to the medial portion of the Brodmann area 10, BA10) in accordance with the suggestion of the Reviewer 2., sham, OC, and dlPFC groups. With this sample width, we reached a normal distribution of the data and we were able to perform the suggested analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The main analyses should incorporate a within-subject factor of Time (pre and post intervention), possibly also with the within-subject factor Trial Number (e.g., the last 4 trials of acquisition and the four test trials) such that an omnibus test can be performed to assess whether there is an interaction with Time and Group (and or Trial Number). If so, this can be followed-up with relevant planned contrasts investigating whether fear is significantly reduced in the mPFC group, and whether the DIFFERENCE in fear reduction is higher in the mPFC group as compared to such difference scores in the other groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this useful suggestion. After preprocessing the data as indicated in the previous point, we ran omnibus 2 × 2 mixed ANOVAs by incorporating a within-subject factor of Time/Phase (pre- and post-intervention) both in the case of the test (i.e., conditioning <italic>vs</italic> test) and the follow-up (i.e., conditioning <italic>vs</italic> follow-up). Therefore, we included in the omnibus analysis the averaged SCRs level evoked by the CS during these phases. These analyses allowed us to assess whether there was an interaction with Time/Phase and Group, and to run relevant planned contrasts accordingly. By singularly comparing the aPFC group with all the other conditions (sham, OC, and dlPFC) we were able to observe that the CS-elicited fear was significantly reduced in the aPFC group (both in the test and the follow-up phases) relative to the conditioning phase. This dampening effect from the acquisition phase was selective for this region and thus was not observed in all the other groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The generalization analyses should consist of the within subject factor Stimulus Type (CS, NS1, NS2) and between subject factor Group. Again, only in the case of a significant omnibus test, these should be followed up by relevant planned comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this indication. We performed the suggested analysis by running 2 × 3 mixed ANOVAs with a within-subject factor of Stimulus Type/Tone (CS, NS<sub>1</sub>, and NS<sub>2</sub>) and a between-subject factor of Group (aPFC <italic>vs</italic> sham, aPFC <italic>vs</italic> OC, and aPFC <italic>vs</italic> dlPFC). This approach led to the confirmation of the previous findings that, during the test session, rTMS over the aPFC significantly decreased the defensive responses to all the stimuli (CS, NS<sub>1</sub>, and NS<sub>2</sub>) relative to the sham condition (we found a significant main effect of Group and no Group × Tone interaction effect), supporting a dampening effect of threat generalization processes. Finally, we confirmed the previous finding that the difference between the aPFC group and the dlPFC group pertaining to rTMS effects was selective for the CS, and no between-group differences were observed for defensive reactions to the NSs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Very important: to increase transparency and credibility, ideally, the paper should adopt a complete open science approach: the raw data along with the code to arrive at results should be openly accessible. The acquisition data should also be presented in graphs, both with all trials and the relevant averages that are chosen to compare for the pre-post intervention effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer about the importance of transparency. To this aim, the raw data of this study have been uploaded along with the manuscript files.

To more precisely denominate the prefrontal target of our rTMS procedure, throughout the manuscript, we corrected “medial prefrontal cortex” (mPFC) with “medial anterior prefrontal cortex” (aPFC). Indeed, the coil placement that we adopted (i.e. over Fpz according to the international 10‒20 EEG coordinate system) directly focused on the medial portion of the BA 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I would suggest to plot the SCR timeseries in addition to the deviation from baseline.

To this purpose, we have now added within-group comparisons (through 2 × 2 mixed ANOVAs) that show, for each group, the amount of change in CS-evoked SCRs from the conditioning phase to the test phase, as well as from the conditioning phase to the follow-up phase.

Indeed, a <italic>return of fear</italic> following extinction training is often caused by a change of context, due to the fact that extinction learning is context-dependent (Vervliet et al., 2013). Therefore, we sought to test whether rTMS (delivered in context B) may induce enduring effects, observable even during a re-exposition to the original threatening environment (context A). To better clarify this point, we have included more explanations in the Introduction section, the Results section, and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why is the time for the peak-to-trough deflection different for US2 as compared to the CS and US?</p></disp-quote><p>The reason why the time for peak-to-through deflection is different for the US<sub>2</sub> compared to that of the other stimuli (CS, NSs) relies on the different duration of the selected stimuli (6s for the CS/NSs and 4s for the US<sub>2</sub>). Since we considered as event-related the SCRs in which the trough-to-peak deflection started at least 1s from the onset and before the offset of each stimulus, then the time window in which an event-related deflection had to begin was 1–6s (for the CS and the NSs) or 1–4s (for the US<sub>2</sub>) after the stimulus onset.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved and the addition of control experiments has many of the concerns raised by reviewer 2 who has no further comments.

As requested, we have analyzed the CS-related SCR data during the acquisition phase on a trial-by-trial basis ‒including both the 15 trials of the conditioning procedure separately as well as their average in the graphs (see Figure 2-S1, Figure 4-S1, and Figure 5-S1). Collectively, we found no differences in how the aPFC group responded relative to the sham, the OC, and the dlPFC groups, allowing us to exclude potential pre-existing learning differences between groups.

As we mentioned in the Results section (lines 101-102), we chose to adopt a single-cue conditioning protocol ‒instead of a differential conditioning procedure‒ because it more ecologically reflects real-life traumatic experiences. It is true that the consequent lack of a control stimulus (CS-) make it more challenging to reveal the efficacy and precision of the conditioning. However, one possibility to observe the efficacy of fear learning may consist of comparing the CS-evoked SCRs of the sham control group before the conditioning (preconditioning phase), during the conditioning, and after the conditioning (implicit test). In this way, it has been possible to observe a progressive enhancement of the magnitude of the autonomic responses through these three experimental phases. With the same logic, the aPFC group showed an enhancement of SCRs from the preconditioning to the conditioning phase, but a following decrease of SCRs after the rTMS procedure (during the implicit test) which restored the magnitude of CS-related responses to preconditioning levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please confirm that the shock electrodes were attached during the test phases and indicate so in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm that the shock electrodes were attached during all the test and follow-up phases, and we have added this specification also for the US<sub>2</sub> test and the perceptual test in the Methods section (lines 521-522 and 550), which were previously missing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear what tests were Bonferroni corrected and which ones were not (and why), this should be done consistently.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm that we had performed Bonferroni-corrected tests throughout the manuscript, and now we have included this specification for all the <italic>post-hoc</italic> comparisons in the Results section.

Autonomic reactions that we observed towards the new tones in the aPFC group relative to the sham control group did not allow the conclusion that the rTMS intervention targeted threat generalization, leaving open the question of the specificity of rTMS effects (mediated by memory or more general dampening effect). However, the lack of between-group differences that we observed in the autonomic responses to the US<sub>2</sub> seems to suggest that the observed effect may be memory-related and not due to a general dampening of autonomic reactivity. We added this reasoning in the Discussion section (lines 340-344).</p></body></sub-article></article>
