apparatus is mediated by cisternal maturation, but it remains largely unclear how the <italic>cis</italic>-cisternae, the earliest Golgi sub-compartment, is generated and how the Golgi matures into the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we use high-speed and high-resolution confocal microscopy to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of a diverse set of proteins that reside in and around the Golgi in budding yeast. We find many mobile punctate structures that harbor yeast counterparts of mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) proteins, which we term ‘yeast ERGIC’. It occasionally exhibits approach and contact behavior toward the ER exit sites and gradually matures into the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi. Upon treatment with the Golgi-disrupting agent brefeldin A, the ERGIC proteins form larger aggregates corresponding to the Golgi entry core compartment in plants, while <italic>cis</italic>- and medial-Golgi proteins are absorbed into the ER. We further analyze the dynamics of several late Golgi proteins to better understand the Golgi-TGN transition. Together with our previous studies, we demonstrate a detailed spatiotemporal profile of the entire cisternal maturation process from the ERGIC to the Golgi and further to the TGN.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ERGIC</kwd><kwd>GECCO</kwd><kwd>Golgi apparatus</kwd><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd><kwd>cisternal maturation</kwd><kwd>super-resolution live imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 19K06669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tojima</surname><given-names>Takuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 19H04764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tojima</surname><given-names>Takuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 22K06213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tojima</surname><given-names>Takuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREST JPMJCR21E3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tojima</surname><given-names>Takuro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 17H06420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakano</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 18H05275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakano</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 23H00382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakano</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatiotemporal mapping of a variety of proteins in and around the Golgi apparatus in budding yeast was performed using super-resolution live imaging microscopy and identified the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment that matures into the Golgi.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Golgi apparatus plays a central role in membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glick and Nakano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakano, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakano and Luini, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019</xref>). It consists of a series of flattened membrane sacs that can be classified into <italic>cis</italic>, medial, and <italic>trans</italic> cisternae. Newly synthesized cargo proteins that departed the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enter the Golgi at the <italic>cis</italic> cisternae and move progressively through the medial and <italic>trans</italic> cisternae, and then proceed to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN), a tubular-reticular membrane network that is joined to the <italic>trans</italic>-face of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ford et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakano, 2022</xref>). This four-class classification of Golgi cisterna, i.e., <italic>cis</italic>, medial, <italic>trans</italic>, and TGN, is now widely used (sometimes the former two and the latter two are grouped together as early Golgi and late Golgi, respectively), but drawing clear boundaries between them is difficult because the cargo traffic through the Golgi/TGN is mediated by cisternal maturation: an individual cisterna gradually changes its nature from an earlier to a later one, while the cargo proteins remain inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). The Golgi cisternal maturation has been studied extensively in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This is because, unlike other eukaryotic species, the Golgi in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does not form stacks but exists as separate, individual cisternae scattered throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beznoussenko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Preuss et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rambourg et al., 2001</xref>), which gives us a great advantage in analyzing the dynamics of individual cisternae by live-cell imaging. Now, the next intriguing question is where and how <italic>cis-</italic>Golgi cisternae, the earliest sub-compartment of the Golgi maturation, is generated.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the ER-derived cargoes are carried by tubular-vesicular membrane clusters, termed the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), to achieve long-distance cargo transport from the ER exit sites (ERES), distributed at the cell periphery, to the Golgi ribbon, a huge structure composed of interconnected Golgi stacks located near the centrosome. In plant cells, such long-distance transport is not necessary because separate Golgi ministacks are almost always in contact with the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takagi et al., 2020</xref>). We have recently identified the Golgi entry core compartment (GECCO), a specialized membrane compartment in plant cells, which appears to play similar roles to the mammalian ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito et al., 2012</xref>). The GECCO is located at the interface between the Golgi stack and ERES, and receives ER-derived cargoes for Golgi stack regeneration. However, it remains unclear whether such ER-Golgi intermediates (mammalian ERGIC or plant GECCO) also exist in budding yeast.</p><p>Another important issue that should be examined in budding yeast is the maturation process at the late Golgi. We have previously shown that, by live-cell imaging of a variety of late Golgi proteins, the yeast TGN can be classified into two distinct, sequential stages, early TGN and late TGN, which mediate cargo reception and export, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). However, there are several additional important proteins that reside in the late Golgi but have not been well investigated.</p><p>In the present study, we address these challenges by the super-resolution confocal live imaging microscopy (SCLIM) that we developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kurokawa and Nakano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tojima et al., 2023</xref>).

A comparison of the amino acid sequences of human ERGIC-53 and yeast Emp46 (with an Emp46 paralog, Emp47) is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We compared the spatiotemporal dynamics of EGFP-tagged Emp46 versus mCherry-tagged Mnn9, a mannnosyltransferase, in living yeast cells using SCLIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Four-dimensional (4D; xyz plus time) SCLIM imaging showed many mobile Mnn9-mCherry-positive and EGFP-Emp46-positive punctate compartments (~0.5 μm in diameter) appearing and disappearing with a lifetime of a few minutes. Dual-color analysis revealed that the punctate signals of EGFP-Emp46 appeared first and then Mnn9-mCherry signals showed up on the pre-existing EGFP-Emp46-positive compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As the Mnn9-mCherry signal gradually increased, the EGFP-Emp46 signal decreased and eventually became invisible. The fluorescence intensity of EGFP-Emp46 peaked earlier than that of Mnn9-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The transition from EGFP-Emp46 to Mnn9-mCherry proceeded by a gradual decrease of the area of the Emp46-positive zone and a complementary increase of the area of the Mnn9-positive zone.

In mammalian cells, Rab1 is involved in ER-Golgi cargo traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nuoffer et al., 1994</xref>) and is used as another ERGIC marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sannerud et al., 2006</xref>). Using SCLIM, like Emp46, many mobile GFP-Ypt1-positive puncta were detected in a cell. Dual-color 4D analysis showed that the GFP-Ypt1 signal appeared first and then Mnn9-mCherry came up on the pre-existing GFP-Ypt1-positive compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). As the Mnn9-mCherry signal gradually increased, the GFP-Ypt1 signal decreased and eventually became invisible. Close-up images and their fluorescence line profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) showed that GFP-Ypt1- and Mnn9-mCherry-positive areas exhibit segregated distribution patterns during their transition period.</p><p>Next, we examined the dynamics of Golgi-resident retrieval receptors or gatekeepers for ER-resident proteins, Rer1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sato et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–N</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and Erd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lewis et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Semenza et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–R</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Using SCLIM, we detected many mobile EGFP-Rer1- and Erd2-GFP-positive puncta in a cell. Dual-color 4D imaging showed that the peak time-points of EGFP-Rer1 and Erd2-GFP fluorescence signals came earlier than that of Mnn9-mCherry, consistent with the fact that ER-resident proteins are retrieved from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment before reaching the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stornaiuolo et al., 2003</xref>). We also observed that EGFP-Emp46 appeared at almost the same timing as Rer1-iRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S-V</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that Emp46, Ypt1, Rer1, and Erd2 appear earlier than Mnn9.</p><p>We further examined the dynamics of Grh1, a yeast homolog of the mammalian Golgi stacking protein GRASP65, which is located at the ER-Golgi interface in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kinseth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In budding yeast, Grh1-positive puncta were observed in the vicinity of the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levi et al., 2010</xref>). Our dual-color 4D SCLIM imaging versus Mnn9 showed that the punctate Grh1-2xEGFP fluorescence signal first appeared and then changed into Mnn9-mCherry-positive compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, D</xref>). We also found that Grh1-2xmCherry appeared before EGFP-Rer1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>) and GFP-Ypt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). These results indicate that Grh1 was the earliest protein to appear during cisternal maturation among those examined in our present and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ishii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Suda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>), supporting a hypothesis that Grh1 acts early in membrane traffic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levi et al., 2010</xref>). At present, GRASP65 (Grh1 in yeast) is known as a typical <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker in mammals, but we find in the present study that Grh1 appears prior to the ERGIC markers Emp46 and Ypt1 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Therefore, we believe that Grh1 should be defined as another ERGIC marker rather than a <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker, at least in yeast.

Three-dimensional (3D; xyz) SCLIM imaging showed that the ERES labeled by Sec13-2xmCherry were distributed as many punctate signals (~0.5 μm in diameter). Using dual-color imaging, we found that some of the Grh1-2xGFP- and EGFP-Rer1-positive puncta were located adjacent to Sec13-2xmCherry-positive puncta, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruns et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Levi et al., 2010</xref>). EGFP-Sed5-positive puncta were also found near Sec13-2xmCherry signals, although less frequently. In contrast, we could hardly detect such adjacent localization between Sec13-2xmCherry versus GFP-Vrg4 or Sec7-GFP. Quantitative correlation analysis (Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>) indicated that the degree of co-localization with Sec13 was relatively higher for Grh1 and Rer1, but moderate for Sed5 and lower for Vrg4 and Sec7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that the earlier-appearing proteins during cisternal maturation tend to be located closer to the ERES. This suggests that the ERGIC is generated near the ERES, presumably by fusion of multiple ER-derived COPII vesicles carrying cargo. Alternatively, based on our previous finding that Sed5-positive cisterna exhibits approach and contact (hug-and-kiss) behavior toward the ERES to capture the cargo from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurokawa et al., 2014</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that Grh1- and Rer1-positive cisternae also exhibit the hug-and-kiss. To test this possibility, we performed dual-color 4D-SCLIM observations of Sec13-2xmCherry versus Grh1-2xEGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found that some Grh1-positive puncta (ERGIC) approached to Sec13-positive puncta (ERES) and temporarily associated with them for a certain period of time (2–3 s), and then dissociated.

All the DMSO-treated cells had many small punctate fluorescence signals (~0.5 μm in diameter) that correspond to the ERGIC or Golgi. In BFA-treated cells, the fluorescence signals of Grh1-2xmCherry, EGFP-Rer1, and EGFP-Sed5 were distributed in relatively larger and brighter aggregates (1–2 μm in diameter). On the other hand, GFP-Vrg4 and Mnn2-EGFP signals in BFA-treated cells were distributed in round and tubular structures that overlap with ER marker signals (mCherry-HDEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We next performed dual-color 3D SCLIM observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). In control cells (DMSO), small punctate signals of EGFP-Rer1 and Grh1-2xmCherry were partially segregated, which reflects the spatiotemporal status of cisternal maturation: i.e., if the timing of recruitment of the two proteins to a single cisterna is not perfectly synchronized, the cisterna would harbor only one of them at some time-points of maturation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). In BFA-treated cells, however, the two signals mostly overlapped within larger aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We perfused the cell chamber equipped on the microscope stage with DMSO and BFA sequentially and observed changes in the subcellular distribution of EGFP-Sed5 or GFP-Vrg4. Within 5 min after the change from DMSO to BFA, small punctate signals of EGFP-Sed5 turned to larger aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, 10 min). Subsequently, within 5 min after BFA washout, the larger aggregates reverted to many small punctate structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, 70 min). In contrast, upon perfusion treatment with BFA, GFP-Vrg4 signals initially became larger aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, 10 min) and then were translocated to the ER network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, 20–60 min).

Our previous 3D SCLIM analysis revealed that Apl6-positive punctate signals are segregated from Sec7-positive TGN compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). However, using 4D SCLIM analysis, we found that Apl6 was distributed as multiple small dot structures (&lt;0.2 μm in diameter) on Sec7-positive compartments. Furthermore, we occasionally observed that Apl6-positive small dots already existed prior to the appearance of Sec7-positive compartments. These results suggest that AP-3 can assemble not only at the TGN but also at earlier Golgi stages. To test this possibility, we performed 3D co-localization analysis of Apl6 versus Mnn9, Sec21, Sys1, or Sec7 by dual-color SCLIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and J</xref>). Here, Mnn9, Sec21, Sys1, and Sec7 were used as markers for <italic>cis-</italic>Golgi, <italic>cis</italic>-to-<italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, and TGN, respectively. The degree of co-localization of Apl6-GFP versus Sec21-2xmCherry and Sys1-iRFP was higher, whereas that versus Mnn9-mCherry and Sec7-tagRFP was lower, suggesting that AP-3 is mainly localized to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi rather than the TGN and <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi. We then performed dual-color 4D SCLIM to compare the spatiotemporal dynamics of Apl6 versus Sys1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K–O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Subsequently, the accumulated Apl6-GFP signals gradually decreased in size and fragmented into many small dot-like structures on the Sys1-iRFP-positive compartment, and eventually became invisible.

These facts suggest that the short distance transport through the ERES near the Golgi ribbon and the Golgi-associated ERGIC is a cargo transport mechanism conserved between plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saraste and Marie, 2018</xref>).</p><p>One other amazing feature about ERGIC/GECCO is the insensitivity to the Arf-GEF inhibitor BFA. Most of Golgi-resident proteins are absorbed into the ER upon treatment with BFA, while ERGIC components remain independent as will be discussed in more detail later. This property of ERGIC appears to be common to plant and yeast cells as well as animal cells (even in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujii et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, the new pre-Golgi compartment we have found in yeast in the present study well corresponds to the concept of mammalian ERGIC and plant GECCO in terms of molecular components and functions, so we consider that they are homologous compartments. Since each Golgi cisterna in yeast moves around in the cytoplasm away from the ERES, we feel that the new yeast compartment is more in line with the original concept of mammalian ERGIC, which is based on the mobility as an ER-Golgi carrier. Therefore, we use the term ‘yeast ERGIC’ in this paper and propose that the major functions and molecular components of the ERGIC/GECCO are evolutionarily conserved across species, even though their subcellular distribution looks different.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ERGIC matures into Golgi in yeast</title><p>The ERGIC in budding yeast, which we have identified in the present study, matures into the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). To date, it has been debated whether the mammalian ERGIC represents a transient ER-Golgi transport carrier or a stable pre-Golgi organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saraste and Marie, 2018</xref>). Our results support the former model, at least in budding yeast. Intriguingly, our SCLIM technology revealed that, during the ERGIC-Golgi transition, the early and late markers are often spatially separated in a single cisterna, forming a boundary between two stages. Similar segregation patterns were also observed during the Golgi-TGN maturation process by SCLIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous correlative light and electron microscopy analysis showed that Golgi and TGN markers are segregated within a continuous membrane compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>). We propose that the ERGIC and Golgi, as well as Golgi and TGN, can transiently coexist as structurally and functionally distinct zones within a single, maturing cisterna. The molecular mechanisms of this segregation will be a challenging problem to be addressed in the future.</p><p>At present, it remains unclear whether the mammalian and plant Golgi are also generated from ERGIC/GECCO by maturation. Higher spatiotemporal resolution live imaging is necessary and our second-generation SCLIM technology will be quite helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tojima et al., 2023</xref>; Miyashiro, Tojima, and Nakano, in revision). We consider that cisternal maturation is not a mechanism specific to the yeast Golgi, but rather a universal cargo transfer mechanism that is frequently used in many membrane traffic pathways in diverse organisms. Consistent with this idea, maturation of early endosomes into late endosomes has also been demonstrated in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rink et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effects of BFA on plant, yeast, and mammalian cells</title><p>In plant cells, we have previously identified the GECCO as a <italic>cis</italic>-most Golgi compartment that receives cargoes from the ER, which becomes evident upon BFA treatment. BFA caused the accumulation of a specialized set of proteins located at the <italic>cis</italic>-most cisternae of the Golgi stack, such as SYP31 (Sed5 in yeast) and RER1B (Rer1 in yeast), into small punctate structures (GECCO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, other Golgi proteins such as ST were excluded from the GECCO and absorbed into the ER. After BFA removal, the GECCO received the absorbed Golgi proteins from the ER to regenerate the Golgi stack. These results suggest that the GECCO contains functional components to receive cargoes from the ER. This property is very similar to that of mammalian ERGIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ito et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>When we treated budding yeast cells with BFA in the present study, Grh1, Rer1, and Sed5 accumulated into larger punctate structures (yeast GECCO), whereas Mnn2 and Vrg4 were absorbed into the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). A notable difference between plant and yeast GECCO is their size: the yeast GECCO is larger (1–2 μm in diameter) than the plant GECCO (~0.5 μm in diameter). Time course observation of plant GECCO formation showed that, within 20 min after BFA application, SYP31 temporally congregated and coalesced into several large aggregates (2–10 μm in diameter), and then the aggregates gradually disassembled into many small punctate structures near the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ito et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, Sed5 in budding yeast formed large aggregates soon after BFA treatment (&lt;5 min), but did not lead to their subsequent disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Considering that the plant Golgi forms stacks and are tethered to the ERES, whereas the yeast Golgi cisternae are unstacked and majority of them moves independently of the ERES, we assume that the disassembly of the plant GECCO is regulated by putative ER-Golgi-tethering molecules, the presence of which is suggested by laser trapping experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sparkes et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, previous reports have shown that BFA treatment reversibly induces Golgi disassembly and absorption of many Golgi proteins into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barzilay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Scheel et al., 1997</xref>). However, the ERGIC marker ERGIC-53 (Emp46 in yeast) localizes to punctate structures near the ERES, termed ‘Golgi remnants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990</xref>). Similarly, several other pre/early-Golgi proteins, including GRASP65 (Grh1 in yeast), syntaxin 5 (Sed5 in yeast), and RER1, form punctate structures located adjacent to the ERES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Füllekrug et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamura et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Seemann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Ward et al., 2001</xref>). These results strongly suggest that the GECCO observed in plants and budding yeast are equivalent to the Golgi remnant in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dynamics of ERES and ERGIC in yeast</title><p>The yeast Golgi is unstacked and individual Golgi cisternae move through the cytoplasm in a spatially separated state from the ERES. It has long been thought that <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartment is generated near the ERES, presumably by fusion of multiple ER-derived COPII vesicles carrying cargo. In contrast, we recently found in yeast that the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartment exhibits approach and contact (hug-and-kiss) behavior toward the ERES to capture cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurokawa et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, we found the presence of ERGIC as a pre-<italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartment, and it also exhibits the hug-and-kiss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Considering that ERGIC had a higher probability of localizing near the ERES than <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), it is most likely that yeast ERGIC exhibits the hug-and-kiss behavior more frequently than <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi. The next intriguing questions would be where and how the ERGIC compartment is generated, and whether the molecular mechanisms of ERGIC formation and cargo loading are shared.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Ypt1 appears twice during cisternal maturation</title><p>The functions of Ypt1 at the Golgi have been controversial so far. Earlier studies showed that Ypt1 regulates the ER-Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jedd et al., 1995</xref>). Subsequent studies have demonstrated additional roles for Ypt1 at the late Golgi, including endosome-Golgi transport and cargo export from the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McDonold and Fromme, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sclafani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we revealed that Ypt1 appeared twice during cisternal maturation, at the ERGIC and at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi/TGN interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2I–L</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A–H,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). This suggest that Ypt1 is involved in multiple functions at the different stages of Golgi maturation. In contrast to Ypt1 in budding yeast, Rab1 in mammalian cells has been reported to localize only to the ERGIC/<italic>cis</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tie et al., 2018</xref>). Given that the yeast genome contains only 11 Rab proteins, whereas the human genome contains at least 60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Homma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>), we can speculate that a single Rab protein is evolved to execute multiple functions at multiple stages of the Golgi maturation in budding yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Differential localization and functions of Gea1 and Gea2</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the Arf1-GFFs Gea1 and Gea2 orchestrate the formation of COPI vesicles destined for the ER and earlier Golgi compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peyroche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spang et al., 2001</xref>). It has been suggested that Gea1 and Gea2 have overlapping functions, since deletion of either gene results in no detectable phenotype whereas the double null mutation is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Spang et al., 2001</xref>). However, recent studies have revealed that Gea1 and Gea2 are differentially distributed in the early and late Golgi, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustafson and Fromme, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Highland and Fromme, 2021</xref>). In the present study, we performed the detailed temporal mapping of Gea1 and Gea2 during maturation, and found that Gea1 appeared at the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, whereas Gea2 appeared at the interface between the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and early TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Gea1 and Gea2 have been reported to be recruited by Ypt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustafson and Fromme, 2017</xref>), which is consistent with our observation that the timing of the first and second recruitments of Ypt1 were close to the appearance of Gea1 and Gea2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, the appearance of Gea2 at late Golgi is consistent with a report showing that Gea2 forms a complex with the small GTPase Arl1 and the lipid flippase Drs2 to recruit the Golgin Imh1 to the late Golgi, which is involved in endosome-Golgi traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yu and Lee, 2017</xref>). Our observation that Imh1 appeared around the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>) also supports the involvement of Gea2 for this process. Taken together, Gea1 and Gea2 likely have distinct roles at different stages of Golgi maturation, although they share several molecular interactors and essential functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>AP-3 mainly localizes at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi</title><p>We have previously shown that, in budding yeast, many coat and adaptor proteins that mediate cargo export, i.e., clathrin (Clc1), AP-1 (Apl2), GGA2 (Gga2), and exomer (Chs5), assemble at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, in the present study, we showed that GGA1 (Gga1) assembled at the TGN with similar dynamics as GGA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>). In contrast, only a small fraction of the AP-3 (Apl6) was observed at the TGN, but the majority was located at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–O</xref>). A previous study also showed that Apl5, another AP-3 component, appears prior to Sec7, Apl2, and Gga2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Highland and Fromme, 2021</xref>). These results suggest that AP-3 mediates cargo transport from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, but not from the TGN, to the vacuole. This is consistent with the notion that the AP-3-mediated cargo export is clathrin-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vowels and Payne, 1998</xref>), because clathrin appears at the late TGN but not at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>).

This is reminiscent of our previous study showing that the plant TGN also has discrete zones responsible for distinct cargo sorting: AP-1 and AP-4 zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shimizu et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>The classification of Golgi maturation stages</title><p>Based on our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tojima et al., 2019</xref>) and present studies, we here attempt to update the previous definitions and molecular markers for each Golgi stage in budding yeast. We propose that the Golgi maturation process, from ERGIC to TGN, can be divided into at least five functional stages: (1) the ‘ERGIC/GECCO’ stage, which mediates ER-Golgi traffic; (2) the ‘<italic>cis</italic>- and medial-Golgi’ stage, which mediates carbohydrate synthesis; (3) the ‘<italic>trans</italic>-Golgi‘ stage, which serves as a scaffold for TGN assembly; (4) the ‘early TGN’ stage, which mediates cargo entry into the TGN; and (5) the ‘late TGN‘ stage, which mediates cargo export from the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Now that we define the ERGIC/GECCO stage in budding yeast, several proteins (including Sed5) that were previously categorized as <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi proteins should now be redefined as ERGIC proteins. Although the appearance period of Sed5 largely overlaps with that of <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi proteins such as Mnn9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), the ERGIC and <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi may coexist as spatially distinct zones within a cisterna. There may also be an argument about the role of <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi, because carbohydrate synthesis was attributed to the medial- and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi but not the <italic>cis</italic>-most Golgi in mammalian and plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Day et al., 2013</xref>). Giving a new functional criterion to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi as a scaffold for the TGN assembly is also new, but it is important to consider this role at the Golgi-TGN boundary because there are drastic differences in functions and origins between the Golgi and the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakano, 2022</xref>). The temporal order of the appearance of 25 proteins we examined in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) is well comparable to the spatial order of localization of more than 50 proteins within the Golgi stack in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tie et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a universality of Golgi components, organization, and dynamics across species. Understanding of this universality of Golgi will help comprehend the fundamental basis of Golgi function, structure, and dynamics revealed in many species.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has revealed the dynamic nature of Golgi generation and maturation, in which a wide variety of functional molecules move in and out of the cisternae in a spatiotemporally controlled manner.

In the near future, our advanced imaging techniques, combined with biochemical, genetic, and pharmacological experiments, will further provide a wealth of new information to better understand the conserved molecular mechanisms underlying cargo traffic within the Golgi and between the Golgi and its neighboring organelles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and culture conditions</title><p>The yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 2–4</xref>.

As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed several additional experiments and revised the manuscript. The new data are presented in Figure 1D, 1I, 1N, 1R-V, 2D, 2H, 2H, 3D, 3H, 3L, 3P, 4D, 6D, 6H, 7D, 7H, 7L, 7P, 7T, 8D, 8H, 8N, Figure 1–supplement 1 and 2, Figure 2–supplement 1, Figure 3–supplement 1, Figure 5–supplement 1, Figure 6–supplement 1, Figure 7–supplement 1, Figure 8– supplement 1 and 2, and Supplementary file 1. Also, Figure 9 diagram has been updated based on the new data.</p><p>Our general statements and point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments are as follows.</p><p>General statements</p><p>1. We have tried to revise the manuscript to meet the consensus of the three reviewers as much as possible, but there is one point of disagreement among them: regarding the late Golgi mapping data in the second half of the paper, Reviewer #1 says it should be toned down, while Reviewers #2 and #3 say it should be emphasized. We understand both opinions, but we have revised our manuscript to follow the latter in the current version. However, we can reconsider to conform to the former’s view, depending on the editor’s opinion.</p><p>2. Reviewers #1 and #3 made important comments regarding the definition of the ERGIC. We feel that the three reviewers seem to have different ideas about the concept of ERGIC. The confusion in the definition of ERGIC may make it controversial whether the yeast pre-Golgi compartment we discovered in the present study should be called ERGIC, GECCO, or part of the Golgi.</p><p>The ERGIC was originally identified in mammalian cells as a mobile carrier responsible for long-distance cargo transport from the ER exit site (ERES) at the cell periphery to the Golgi ribbon assembled near the centrosome. However, the cis-most compartment of the mammalian Golgi contains a set of ERGIC marker proteins. In plants, the ERES and the Golgi stack are adjacent, so there is no need for such long-distance carriers as in mammals. However, we have previously shown that the cis-most cisterna of the plant Golgi corresponds to the mammalian ERGIC and is a functionally specialized compartment for cargo reception, which we named GECCO (Ito et al., 2018. J Cell Sci. 131: jcs203893. [PMID: 28839076]; Ito et al., 2012. Mol Biol Cell. 23: 3203-14. [PMID: 22740633]). The yeast pre-Golgi compartment found in the present study well corresponds to mammalian ERGIC and plant GECCO in terms of molecular components, functions, and sensitivity to BFA, so we would like to propose in this paper that they are homologous organelles. Since each Golgi cisterna in yeast moves around in the cytoplasm away from the ERES, we believe that the new yeast compartment is more in line with the definition of ERGIC, which is based on the mobility as an ER-Golgi carrier. Therefore, we use the term “yeast ERGIC” in this paper, but we are also comfortable with calling it “yeast GECCO.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point responses to the Reviewers</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Major comment #1-1: The concept of the ERGIC in mammalian cells was initially proposed based on the protein ERGIC-53 in the 1990s. However, recent nanoscopy imaging data from the Lippincott-Schwartz lab challenges the conventional view of ERGIC by revealing the &quot;ERGIC&quot; is a membrane domain of the ERES (Wegel et al., Cell, 2021; PMID: 33852913), suggesting it might not be appropriate to adopt this concept.</p><p>The authors' observations could be interpreted differently. Since the ERGIC is not molecularly defined in their study, the authors cannot prove its existence in yeast unequivocally. Their data indicate the presence of Golgi cisternae, characterized by Grh1, that precede the earliest known cisternae. Although the authors refer to these Grh1positive cisternae as the &quot;ERGIC&quot;, they are essentially &quot;pre-early&quot; cisternae that progress to become the early Golgi cisternae. Nevertheless, their findings could extend the budding yeast Golgi cisternal progression unit further upstream to include the ERES as the starting point for Golgi cisternal maturation. To further explore this, it would be interesting to investigate the kinetics of COPII subunits in cisternal progression along with Grh1 or Mnn9 and to plot COPII components in the Figure 9 map.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in General statement 2, we think this is a matter of definition. Since the new yeast pre-Golgi compartment found in the present study corresponds well to mammalian ERGIC and plant GECCO in terms of molecular components (e.g., ERGIC53/Emp46 and Rab1/Ypt1), functions (cargo reception from the ER), and sensitivity to BFA, we would like to define it as “yeast ERGIC” in this paper. At present, mammalian GRASP65 (yeast Grh1) is often considered as a marker of cis Golgi, but we found in the present study that Grh1 appeared prior to the ERGIC markers (Emp46 and Ypt1) in yeast. Therefore, we think that Grh1 should be defined as another ERGIC marker rather than a cis-Golgi marker, at least in yeast. We have explained this point in the revised text.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have performed dual-color 4D-SCLIM observations of Sec13 (an ERES marker) vs Grh1 (an ERGIC/GECCO marker) and found that some Grh1-positive puncta (ERGIC/GECCO) exhibited approach and contact (hug-and-kiss) behavior toward the Sec13-positive puncta (ERES). The new data are presented in Figure 4D, and explained in Abstract and text in the revised version. Because the hug-and-kiss behaviors do not fit well into the maturation time course map, we did not place Sec13 in Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #1-2: The second half of the manuscript appears to deviate from the main focus on identifying the ERGIC. This section primarily presents the Golgi localization of four Golgi proteins (Ypt1, Gea1, Gea2, and Alp6) deduced from kinetics. However, it lacks functional studies to substantiate the authors' claims on their cellular functions. As a result, this part of the study remains purely speculative and might not support the authors' claims. Given that Figure 9 provides a highly informative summary of all kinetics and localization data, I recommend the authors keep but significantly abridge this section.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in General statement 1, Reviewers #2 and #3 found the second half of the manuscript to be very important, and they feel that more emphasis should be placed on it. We understand both opinions, but we have revised the manuscript to follow the opinion from Reviewers #2 and #3 in the title, Abstract, and Introduction. However, we can reconsider to follow Reviewer #1’s view, depending on the editor’s opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #1-3: The analysis of only one fluorescent particle or Golgi cisternal punctate structure is insufficient for a Golgi marker, considering the substantial variation of Golgi cisternae. To improve statistical robustness, the authors should select multiple fluorescent particles from multiple cells, displaying plots with averaged intensities, error bars, and sample sizes (n).</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version, statistical information (n and mean peak-to-peak time with SD) was provided only in supplementary material. In the revised version, we have moved this to the main table (Table 1). Also, we have reworked these data as graphs (Figure 1–supplement 1F, Figure 2–supplement 1D, Figure 3– supplement 1E, Figure 6–supplement 1C, Figure 7–supplement 1F, and Figure 8– supplement 1D). Furthermore, we have shown the averaged time course changes in the normalized fluorescence intensities of the green and red channels during maturation (mean ± SEM) (Figure 1D, 1I, 1N, 1R, 1V, 2D, 2H, 2L, 3D, 3H, 3L, 3P, 6D, 6H, 7D, 7H, 7L, 7P, 7T, 8D, 8H, and 8N), and those of representative 6 individual data (Figure 1– supplement 1A-E, Figure 2–supplement 1A-C, Figure 3–supplement 1A-D, Figure 6–supplement 1A,B, Figure 7–supplement 1A-E, and Figure 8–supplement 1A-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #1-4: In Fig. 5A, the BFA-induced lumps positive for Grh1, Rer1, and Sed5 may potentially represent the ERES, as observed in mammalian cells (Ward et al., JCB, 2002; PMID: 11706049). To verify this, the authors should co-label these lumps with COPII subunits.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed an additional experiment examining the effect of BFA on ERES distribution by SCLIM. Upon treatment with BFA, the number of ERES (Sec13positive puncta) did not change, while Rer1-positive compartments formed small numbers of larger structures (GECCO). This indicates that BFA had no effect on the ERES distribution. The new data are presented in Figure 5–supplement 1 and text in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #1-5: The authors previously reported the &quot;hug-and-kiss&quot; model for cargo transport from the ERES to the early Golgi cisternae. As the current study is highly relevant to the &quot;hugand-kiss&quot; model, it is disappointing that the authors did not provide further data and comment on it. The &quot;hug-and-kiss&quot; and &quot;ERGIC&quot; transport modes are two distinct ways for secretory cargo transport from the ERES to the early Golgi cisternae. The authors should verify the &quot;hug-and-kiss&quot; transport and report the relative frequency of the two transport modes.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above (Response to Major comment #1-1), we have performed dual-color 4D-SCLIM observations of Sec13 vs Grh1, and found that some Grh1-positive puncta (ERGIC/GECCO) exhibited approach and contact (hug-and-kiss) behavior toward the Sec13-positive puncta (ERES). On the other hand, we hardly detected ERGIC formation from the ERES, suggesting that cargo transport by hug-and-kiss action is dominant. The new data are presented in Figure 4D, Abstract, and text in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #1-6: The current version has minimal background knowledge of ERGIC in mammalian and yeast cells. Therefore, the authors should provide a comprehensive introduction to ERGIC.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some background knowledge of mammalian ERGIC and plant GECCO in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>Major comment #2-1: There is an enormous amount of patient systematic analysis packed in this paper, following a punctate organelle as it emerges from the dark, evolves over time (following a combination of 2 markers) with fluorescence peaks at specific time points, after which the signal disappears again. I am certain other cell biologists will be impressed, as I was, viewing the individual images and graphs presented, culminating ultimately in figure 9 that could go straight into a textbook to form a starting point for anybody who wishes to study a particular protein of interest and chose the most appropriate markers to compare it with.</p><p>The authors propose that the ERGIC/GECCO/Golgi-remnants compartment is an evolutionary conserved structure even though it has a different subcellular distribution/morphology in different classes of eukaryotes. The data presented here and in earlier work seem to support this notion. In particular, the authors demonstrate that the yeast GRASP 65 homologue Grh1 is the earliest to appear closely followed by Ypt1 and Emp46. The fact that RER1 and ERD2 come slightly later is in line with a proposed gate-keeper function, because if they were instead to recycle continuously they should appear first in line. I agree with the authors that the simple model of ER-derived COPII vesicles fusing with each other and thus creating an ERGIC/GECCO de novo is probably too simplistic. The idea of a more permanent structure, pulsating between cargo-loading and cargo-releasing events, possibly associated with creating zones/subdomains within a single cisterna seems very attractive given the data shown here.</p><p>This work is descriptive, but it is of very high importance to anybody engaged with experimental approaches to study protein sorting from the Golgi-apparatus back to the ER, or on to the plasma membrane or the lytic compartments. The 5 functional stages proposed for Golgi-maturation is an attractive starting point for future research, and I very much like the notion that ERGIC and cis-Golgi cisternae may start as zones/subdomains within a single cisternae, possibly formed via phase separations involving both proteinprotein and protein-lipid interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate very warm and favorable comments from this reviewer. We are very much encouraged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #2-1: The title strongly focusses on the ERGIC and therefore the earliest sorting steps in the ER-Golgi system, but this manuscripts offers so much more. I was fascinated to learn that Ypt1 appears twice during cisternal maturation in yeast. This may be a yeast-specific phenomenon but it is very interesting. The same can be said about the proposal that Gea1 and Gea2 have different roles in the Golgi and act in different cisternae, and the localisation of AP-3 at the trans-Golgi rather than the TGN. The functional distinction between trans-Golgi and TGN and the differences in their origin are important points and it will be a shame if readers don't realise that this manuscript offers further insight into later steps in Golgi-mediated transport. There may be a case to add something to the abstract and/or modify the title accordingly, but then I also feel that long titles are not ideal and the ERGIC/GECCO portion is the more important take-home message. This is a case for the editorial team and the authors to make the most of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in General statement 1, we have revised our manuscript to follow the opinion of Reviewers #2 and #3. As suggested, we have changed the title to emphasize our findings on the late Golgi: &quot;Spatiotemporal dissection of the Golgi apparatus and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment in budding yeast&quot;. We have also changed the condensed title to “Mapping of ERGIC-Golgi-TGN maturation in yeast”. Abstract and Introduction have been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #2-2: Given the importance of ERD2 in sorting soluble proteins to be returned back to the ER, the authors may consider using the biological active XFP-TM-ERD2 fusion instead of ERD2-GFP, but this may be kept for future work. In plants, ERD2-GFP is mainly at the Golgi when overexpressed, its erroneous leakage to the ER is only observed at low expression or when K/HDEL proteins are co-expressed. The XFP-TM-ERD2 construct may be better confined to the ERGIC-GECCO and may have a different temporal pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for suggesting an important experiment to confirm the Erd2 dynamics. As the reviewer pointed out, the C-terminal tagging of plant ERD2 with XFP causes loss of function and mislocalization in plants (Alvim et al., 2023. Nat Commun. 14:1612. [PMID: 36959220]; Silva-Alvim et al., 2018. Plant Cell. 30:2174-2196. [PMID: 30072420]). However, we use a yeast strain in which GFP is integrated into the genome at the C-terminus of the Erd2 gene (BY4741 ERD2-GFP::HIS3MX6; Huh et al., 2003. Nature. 425:686-69. [PMID: 145620951]). We confirmed that this strain is viable and grows normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and has been used successfully by another group previously (e.g., Geva et al., 2017.Traffic. 18:672-682. [PMID: 28727280]). Considering that Erd2 is an essential gene, these results strongly suggest that, at least in yeast, the Erd2 function is maintained even when it is GFP-tagged at the C-terminus. We agree that the use of XFP-TMD-ERD2 would be an interesting experiment. However, since the TMD portion of this construct is derived from ERP1, an ERD2-related protein that is found only in plants (but not in yeast), we need to start with basic assays to verify that this construct functions as endogenous Erd2 in yeast cells, which would be time consuming. In addition, this experiment seems to be a bit too specific from the viewpoint of the main theme of this paper, which is to map a large number of ERGIC/Golgi/TGN proteins. For these reasons, we would like to skip this experiment in the present work.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>C-terminal GFP tagging of Erd2 in genome had no effect on yeast growth.</title><p>Growth assay of serially diluted yeast cells.

We have cited it in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>Major comment #3-1: It is not clear to me how the presented data shows the existence of an ERGIC in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. I understand, and appreciate from this text too, that a clear definition of ERGIC, even in a mammalian system, is unclear. For this reason, I would first suggest that the authors provide a clear definition of what ERGIC means to them. Next, the experiments herein presented are all based on a very careful, thorough and nicely organized spatio-temporal mapping of a large number of early secretory pathway proteins, including the ERGIC53 yeast &quot;counterpart&quot; Emp46 (it would help to add, even as a supplementary figure, an alignment/sequence comparison between the human ERGIC53 and the S. cerevisiae emp46). However, the data presented here does not clearly indicate to me that there is a bona fide ERGIC in yeast. Couldn't it just be that what the authors call ERGIC is a cis-Golgi cisterna? I understand that the BFA experiments show a different behavior for some proteins, which fits with what the authors previously names GECCO in plants, so why not calling this GECCO? Again, it will be important to provide definitions of these compartments for the audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that the definition of ERGIC is elusive and many researchers have different ideas about the concept of ERGIC, even in the mammalian system. However, we think the yeast pre-Golgi compartment found in the present study corresponds well to mammalian ERGIC and plant GECCO in terms of molecular components (e.g., ERGIC53/Emp46 and Rab1/Ypt1), functions (e.g., cargo receiver and carrier), and sensitivity to BFA. Since each Golgi cisterna in yeast moves around in the cytoplasm away from the ERES, we feel that the new yeast compartment is more in line with the original concept of mammalian ERGIC, which is based on the mobility as an ER-Golgi carrier. Thus, we define it as “yeast ERGIC” in this paper. We have added some explanation on this point in the revised version.</p><p>We have shown the alignment data of mammalian ERGIC-53 vs yeast Emp46/47 in the revised version (Supplementary file 1) .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3-2: Next, my main concern here is that this is all based on SCLIM, which is a very nice technique, but the resolution is limited in both space and time (by the way, it would be nice to explicitly measure of quantify the spatial resolution in x-y-z). Hence, it is not possible to discern whether an &quot;independent&quot; ERGIC is formed as compared to cis-Golgi cisterna. Electron microscopy (possibly CLEM) could help somehow resolve that and massively increase the strength of the claims, but I do understand this might be difficult for this group and very time consuming, so it might be important to clearly state the limitation of the herein presented data. A possible alternative to test if protein that are seen segregated are within the same membrane (as claimed here) would be to do trapping experiments where a reagent induces dimerization between the two proteins (when tagged with specific tags, such as FKBP/FRB).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentioned, CLEM analysis is not easy for us to perform in a timely fashion. We have previously performed 3D CLEM analysis through a fruitful collaboration with EM experts and shown that Golgi and TGN markers are segregated within a continuous membrane compartment (Kurokawa et al., 2019. J Cell Biol. 218:1602-1618. [PMID: 30858192]). We have added this information in the revised version. Regarding the spatial resolution of SCLIM, we have added some information.</p><p>To try to address the problem the reviewer suggested, we performed the FKBP/FRB-induced trapping experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We made rapamycin-resistant yeast strain <italic>TOR1-1</italic> and <italic>fpr1∆</italic> in which FRB-GFP is fused to Grh1 (an ERGIC protein), FKBP is fused to Pma1 (a plasma membrane protein), and red fluorescent protein (mCherry or mRFP) is fused to Sed5 (another ERGIC protein), Mnn9 (a cis Golgi protein), Sec21 (a medial Golgi protein), Sec7 (a TGN protein), or Sec13 (an ERES protein), to test whether or not they are located within the same membrane compartment and move together. As a control experiment, we tested Grh1-mCherry. Upon treatment with rapamycin, the Grh1-FRB-GFP-containing compartments were successfully trapped at the plasma membrane where Pma1 is located. However, in this situation, none of these target proteins examined, including control (Grh1-mCherry), were targeted to the plasma membrane together with Grh1-FRB-GFP. These results suggest that, at least in our experimental system, when Grh1-FRB-GFP is captured at the plasma membrane by rapamycin, the membrane compartment (cisterna) on which Grh1 rode does not migrate together with it. In addition, the time scale of Golgi cisternal maturation in yeast is only a few minutes, whereas the assembly of Grh1-FRB-GFP at the plasma membrane after rapamycin treatment takes about 30 minutes. Thus, this type of experiment appears to be inappropriate in terms of time-scales. Therefore, we did not include these results in the revised text.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>FKBP12/FRB-induced trapping experiments.</title><p>(A) The strategy of the experiments. We made rapamycin-resistant yeast strains in which FRB-GFP is fused to Grh1 (an ERGIC protein), FKBP12 is fused to Pma1 (a plasma membrane protein), and red fluorescent protein (mCherry or mRFP) is fused to a target protein. If the Grh1-FRB-GFP is recruited to the plasma membrane (where Pma1-FKBP12 is localized) together with the target protein after treatment with rapamycin, this suggests that they were in the same membrane compartment. (B) Control experiment. Upon treatment with rapamycin, Grh1-FRB-GFP was recruited to the plasma membrane, but Grh1-mCherry was not. (C-G) Sed5 (another ERGIC protein), Mnn9 (a cis-Golgi protein), Sec21 (a medial Golgi protein), Sec7 (a TGN protein), and Sec13 (an ERES protein) were also not recruited to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that, at least in this experimental system, when Grh1-FRB-GFP is captured at the plasma membrane by rapamycin treatment, the membrane compartment on which Grh1 rode does not migrate together with it.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92900-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3-3: I could not find any details (maybe I have missed them) about how many times experiments were replicated and the statistical significance of the findings herein reported. In most figures, examples of microscopy images/videos are shown, and selected lines profiles are presented. However, it is not clear how robust these experiments are. Some ideas:</p><p>(2.1.) The major source of quantification is the peak-to-peak time distance between two proteins. In Table S1 some stdev is presented, but not clear how it is find it is the sted of all n number of puncta? or of the mean duration per cell? or of the mean duration per experiment? I would suggest that the authors provide the results shown in Table S1 plotted as a histogram or superplot see e.g. https://rupress.org/jcb/article/219/6/e202001064/151717/SuperPlots-Communicatingreproducibility- and clearly explain how statistics is performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have reworked the peak-to-peak time data as graphs (Figure 1– supplement 1F, Figure 2–supplement 1D, Figure 3–supplement 1E, Figure 6– supplement 1C, Figure 7–supplement 1F, and Figure 8–supplement 1D). In addition, we have presented the averaged time course changes in normalized fluorescence intensities of green and red channels (mean ± SEM) (Figure 1D, 1I, 1N, 1R, 1V, 2D, 2H, 2L, 3D, 3H, 3L, 3P, 6D, 6H, 7D, 7H, 7L, 7P, 7T, 8D, 8H, and 8N), and those of representative 6 individual data (Figure 1–supplement 1A-E, Figure 2–supplement 1A-C, Figure 3–supplement 1A-D, Figure 6–supplement 1A, B, Figure 7– supplement 1A-E, and Figure 8–supplement 1A-C). We have also added explanations about statistics performed in the revised text and figure legends. SD values in Table 1 (Table S1 in the original version) is those of all number of puncta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3-4: (2.2) Also, the time-lapse movies are acquired with a 5s gap between time points. How is this included in the incertainty of the peak-to-peak duration in Table S1?</p></disp-quote><p>Individual peak-to-peak time data are discrete, every 5 s. We used the data as they are, including the uncertainty. We have presented all the individual data as scatter plots with mean ± SD (Figure 1–supplement 1F, Figure 2–supplement 1D, Figure 3– supplement 1E, Figure 6–supplement 1C, Figure 7–supplement 1F, and Figure 8– supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3-5: (2.3) In pg. 7 the authors write &quot;Although experimental variation was high, the two zones appeared to be spatially segregated&quot;. Can the authors provide quantitative and statistical support of this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>To show the experimental variation, we have presented many line-profile data in the revised version (Figure 1–supplement 2 and Figure 8–supplement 2). In Figure 1– supplement 2, many cisternae showed segregation patterns of Emp46-positive zone and Mnn9-positive zone, while some others showed overlapping distribution patterns. In Figure 8–supplement 2, all the cisternae examined showed clear segregation patterns of Apl6-positive zone and Sys1-positive zone. We have also changed the descriptions in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comment #3-6: (Figure 9: the arrows should go from protein2.4) It is not clear to me how the puncta for analysis are selected. For example, in Figure 1C, the punctum shown already shows some initial co-localization (it could be e.g. that a peak value was prior or after the duration of the time lapse movie, thereby biassing the computation of the peak-to-peak duration). So, if one would consider those spots e.g., positive for Emp46 that do not contain Mnn9 signal, how often do you see conversion (that is, appearance of Mnn9 signal)? Along the same lines, in pg. 8 the authors write &quot;… signal appeared first and then mnn9-mCherry came up&quot;. Details on how this quantification is done and statistical analysis would be needed, to my opinion, to support the claim.</p></disp-quote><p>To examine the cisternal maturation, we selected cisternae of interest so that they could be tracked continuously and had both red and green fluorescence peaks could be detected during the observation period. It is not easy to quantify exactly how often the Emp46-positive puncta converted to Mnn9-positive ones, because ERGIC/Golgi cisternae in yeast are moving around randomly at high speed, often making it impossible to follow individual cisternae for a long period of time. In addition, two cisternae sometimes came so close that they appeared to overlap even at the resolution of SCLIM. Furthermore, to reduce photobleaching and time-lapse intervals, we acquired 21 XYoptical slices at 0.2 μm apart (total Z-range: 4 m) for a 3D image, which does not cover the entire thickness of yeast cells, resulting in some cisternae to move outside the field of view. Such cisternae were excluded from the analysis, and only a few cisternae were usable to track the entire maturation process for analysis. We have added some explanation on this point in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #3-2: Pg. 8: have the authors tested Rer1 vs Emp46?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the suggested experiment in the revised version. Since we previously found that mCherry-tagged Rer1 mislocalizes to the vacuole, we examined the dynamics of iRFP-tagged Rer1 together with GFP-tagged Emp46 for dual-color 4DSCLIM analysis. The new results have been presented in Figure 1S-V, Figure 1– supplement 1E, F and the revised text. We also included the peak-to-peak time data in Figure 9 and Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #3-3: Pg. 8: I was of the impression that GRASP65 (GORASP1) is considered to be a cisGolgi protein (see e.g., Tie et al. eLife 2018). Then, what the authors call &quot;ERGIC&quot; couldn't it simply be a cis-Golgi cisterna?</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in “General statement 2”, this would be a matter of definition. We agree that mammalian GRASP65 (yeast Grh1) is currently considered by many researchers as a marker of the cis-Golgi, but we found in the present study that Grh1 appears prior to the ERGIC markers Emp46 (mammalian ERGIC-53) and Ypt1 (mammalian Rab1) in yeast. Thus, we would like to propose in this paper that the cis-most cisterna of the mammalian Golgi that harbors GRASP65 corresponds to ERGIC/GECCO. We have added our view on the definition of ERGIC/GECCO across species in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #3-5: The first part of the manuscript (up to mid page 13) is clearly focused on defining ERGIC in yeast, then the paper appears as a set of experiments aimed at adding more components in their spatio-temporal mapping. This is ok, but is should be clearly motivated and explained in the Title, abstract and intro.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title and modified Abstract and Introduction to emphasize the second part of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment #3-6: The visualization of colocalization according to the opacity (as said in the methods) is somehow confusing to me. Are the 3D images projections or 3D renderings (no axes are seen)? In e.g. Figure 6G or 8L, regions where green and magenta (or green and red) are colocalized do not appear white (or yellow), which visually suggests to the inattentive reader that there is no colocalization, when there is.</p></disp-quote><p>“3D opacity” is a display mode of a commercial software “Volocity”. We think this mode is the best to express 3D information and is good because merge areas appear yellow or white to some extent. In the revised version, for clarity, we have added several line scan data (Figure 1–supplement 2 and Figure 8–supplement 2). We have also added axis labels in the revised version (Figure 1E, 1J, and 8O).</p></body></sub-article></article>
