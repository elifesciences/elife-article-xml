differentiation. Here we show that the class II histone deacetylase Hdac6 co-purifies with Tip60-p400 complex from ESCs. Hdac6 is necessary for regulation of most Tip60-p400 target genes, particularly those repressed by the complex. Unlike differentiated cells, where Hdac6 is mainly cytoplasmic, Hdac6 is largely nuclear in ESCs, neural stem cells (NSCs), and some cancer cell lines, and interacts with Tip60-p400 in each. Hdac6 localizes to promoters bound by Tip60-p400 in ESCs, binding downstream of transcription start sites. Surprisingly, Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate histones, but rather is required for Tip60-p400 binding to many of its target genes. Finally, we find that, like canonical subunits of Tip60-p400, Hdac6 is necessary for robust ESC differentiation. These data suggest that Hdac6 plays a major role in the modulation of Tip60-p400 function in stem cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01557.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01557.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryonic stem cells are cells that are able to transform into many other types of cells, such as blood cells and skin cells, as well as being able to divide in order to produce more stem cells. Mature cells lack this ability, which is called pluripotency, which is why there is so much interest in using embryonic stem cells to replace or regenerate human cells that have been lost or damaged through injury or illness.</p><p>The various processes that result in self-renewal (the production of new stem cells) or differentiation (the production of other types of cells) are controlled by a wide variety of pathways, including some that only apply to the regulation of gene expression in stem cells. A number of these processes are known to involve chromatin – the densely packed structure formed by DNA and proteins called histones.</p><p>Now Chen et al. study the means by which chromatin controls the stem cell fates by examining how a large enzyme called Tip60-p400 that interacts with histones – one of the main components of chromatin – in both mature cells and embryonic stem cells. Tip60-p400 is known to switch on genes that cause stem cells to undergo self-renewal, and to switch off the genes that allow stem cells to transform into other cell types, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects have not yet been identified.</p><p>Chen et al. studied the activity of Tip60-p400 in mouse embryonic stem cells, and found that another enzyme, Hdac6, had to be present for Tip60-p400 to regulate the genes in the stem cells. Hdac6 is mostly found in the cytoplasm of cells that have differentiated into other cell types, and in the nucleus of stem cells, which is where the DNA resides. In cells from mice that lack Hdac6, Chen et al. also found that stem cells fail to replicate <italic>or</italic> differentiate properly in culture, underscoring the importance of this particular enzyme, and filling in another piece of the puzzle of stem cell biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01557.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01557.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>Tip60</kwd><kwd>Kat5</kwd><kwd>Hdac6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD072122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzio</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazzio</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Food and Agriculture/US Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H00567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Feixia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-0850008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Zhiping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A normally cytoplasmic deacetylase, Hdac6, localizes to the nucleus in embryonic stem cells, where it regulates the essential Tip60-p400 chromatin remodeling complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ESC self-renewal and differentiation are controlled by multiple pathways: exogenous factors that act through well-defined signaling pathways that are also employed in adult cells, and a network of nuclear factors that regulate the ESC transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>). Regulators of gene expression can be further sub-divided into (i) sequence-specific transcription factors, including ESC-specific master regulators, (ii) non-coding RNAs that act both in cis and in trans to regulate specific subsets of genes, and (iii) chromatin regulatory complexes, most of which are expressed in multiple cell and tissue types, and often act very broadly in the genome to covalently modify histones, remodel nucleosomes, or modify higher-order chromatin folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Young, 2011</xref>). A number of chromatin regulators have been identified from RNA-interference screens or traditional knockout studies that are important for various features of ESC identity. However, for most chromatin regulatory complexes, several key questions remain, including how they find their genomic targets, how their catalytic activities lead to alteration of gene expression, and how the activities of these factors are altered to facilitate differentiation.</p><p>In mammals, several chromatin remodeling complexes are modular, with distinct forms expressed in different cell or tissue types, or sometimes within the same cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramírez and Hagman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fazzio and Panning, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>). For example, the mammalian SWI/SNF-family complex BAF (<underline>B</underline>rg1/Brahma <underline>A</underline>ssociated <underline>F</underline>actor) consists of several related complexes with many shared subunits, plus a few subunits that are specific to each particular cell type. In particular, when neural progenitors differentiate into neurons in mouse, two BAF subunits are replaced with two paralogous subunits that shift BAF from a factor promoting self-renewal to one that promotes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lessard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Young, 2011</xref>). Another unique combination of subunits, different from those observed in differentiated cells, comprises BAF complex from ESCs (esBAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, multiple forms of PRC1 (<underline>P</underline>olycomb <underline>R</underline>epressive <underline>C</underline>omplex 1) have been purified from human and mouse cells that each contain the Ring1a/b ubiquitin ligase, but have different arrays of accessory proteins that confer distinct target specificity and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Tip60-p400 has been purified from cancer cell lines as a 17 subunit chromatin remodeling complex with two chromatin remodeling activities: the Tip60 (also known as Kat5) subunit acetylates the N-terminal tails of histones H2A, H4, and a number of transcription factors, while the p400 subunit mediates exchange of H2A–H2B dimers for H2AZ–H2B dimers within nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Squatrito et al., 2006</xref>). In somatic cells, Tip60-p400 serves mainly as a transcriptional co-activator that functions with numerous sequence-specific transcription factors to activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brady et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Legube et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, while Tip60-p400 promotes expression of some genes required for cellular proliferation and cell cycle regulation in ESCs, its most prominent function is to silence genes that are active during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2008b</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown (KD) of several Tip60-p400 subunits in ESCs individually induces a phenotype in which differentiation and ESC markers are expressed simultaneously, proliferation is reduced, the cell cycle is altered, and cells exhibit diminished self-renewal and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>). Consistent with these phenotypes, mice homozygous for a <italic>Tip60</italic> deletion allele die at the pre-implantation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). It remains unknown why Tip60-p400 functions mainly as a repressor of differentiation gene expression in ESCs rather than an activator of expressed genes, as it does in most cell types examined.</p><p>Similarly, treatment of ESCs with Trichostatin A (TSA), a drug that broadly inhibits class I and II HDACs and results in elevated acetylation of most lysines targeted by HATs, promotes morphological changes similar to those observed upon KD of Tip60-p400 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCool et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karantzal et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, maintenance of proper levels of histone acetylation appears to be essential to perpetuate the pluripotent state, as neither significant increases nor decreases in histone acetylation appear to be compatible with ESC self-renewal. However, TSA also inhibits several HDAC family members known to target acetylated lysines on non-histone proteins, leaving open the possibility that these targets play an equal or greater role in maintenance of ESC self-renewal. Furthermore, deletion or KD of several individual HDACs in ESCs produces phenotypes that differ substantially from those of Tip60-p400 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McBurney et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dovey et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that different HDACs perform different functions in ESC self-renewal.</p><p>In this study, we interrogate the composition of Tip60-p400 complex in mouse ESCs in order to identify unique interacting proteins that might account for its altered functional repertoire in this cell type. We find that the class II histone deacetylase (HDAC), Hdac6, is a stable interaction partner with Tip60-p400 in ESCs, but not mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Subsequent analyses revealed that Hdac6 also interacts with Tip60-p400 in adult neural stem cells from the brain and some cancer cell lines, but is sequestered away from Tip60-p400 in the cytoplasm of most differentiated cell types, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valenzuela-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>). We show that Hdac6 is necessary for regulation of most Tip60-target genes in ESCs, particularly differentiation genes repressed by Tip60-p400 in ESCs. Surprisingly, while its deacetylase domains are required for silencing of differentiation genes, Hdac6 does not regulate gene expression by deacetylating histones near the promoters of Tip60-p400 targets. Instead, the catalytic domains of Hdac6 are required for its interaction with Tip60-p400. Furthermore, we find that Hdac6 is necessary for normal Tip60-p400 enrichment at its gene targets, just downstream of their transcription start sites (TSSs), suggesting that Hdac6 helps recruit Tip60-p400 complex to many target gene promoters. Finally, we show that Hdac6 is necessary for several major functions of Tip60-p400 in ESCs, as both <italic>Tip60-</italic> and <italic>Hdac6</italic>-deficient ESCs have defects in formation of single colonies, reduced proliferation rates, and defects in differentiation. However, unlike <italic>Tip60</italic> KD, <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD does not prevent ESC self-renewal. Thus, Hdac6 is a component of a novel, stem cell-specific, form of Tip60-p400 complex that is necessary for gene regulation and normal differentiation in ESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A class II HDAC, Hdac6, co-purifies with Tip60-p400 complex in ESCs and NSCs</title><p>Tip60-p400 complex has roles in both activation and repression of transcription in most cell types where it has been examined. However, in ESCs, Tip60-p400 is required for repression of many more genes than it activates, raising the possibility that a unique form of Tip60-p400 complex that might be expressed in ESCs that shifts the balance of its activity toward a more repressive role. To test this possibility, we targeted a 36 amino acid 6-histidine-3-FLAG (H3F) tag to the C-terminus of one copy of the endogenous <italic>Tip60</italic> gene in murine ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), performed double affinity purifications from tagged or untagged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and identified proteins that co-purified with Tip60 using LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). By this approach, we identified 16 of 17 known subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altaf et al., 2009</xref>) of Tip60-p400, suggesting that expression of the tagged form of Tip60 from its endogenous locus allowed for normal complex formation. Furthermore, we observed a number of novel Tip60-p400-interacting proteins, including chromatin regulatory proteins and transcription factors. To test for cell type specificity of Tip60-p400 complexes we generated a knock-in mouse harboring <italic>Tip60-H3F</italic>, isolated embryonic fibroblasts and repeated the purification. We observed several bands within Tip60 purifications from ESCs that were not observed in purifications from <italic>Tip60-H3F</italic> MEFs or untagged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with the possibility that ESCs express a distinct form of Tip60-p400 complex.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of Tip60-p400-interacting proteins in ESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Silver stained gel of purified Tip60 complex from Tip60-H3F ESCs and MEFs, along with untagged control cells.

Hdac6 is a class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) that is expressed in many different cell types but is usually localized to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valenzuela-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>), as are its well-established substrates: α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>), Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovacs et al., 2005</xref>), and cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, despite its homology to proteins that deacetylate histone tails, Hdac6 has not been found to target histones in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haggarty et al., 2003</xref>). To confirm that Hdac6 is a bona fide Tip60-p400-interacting protein, we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments in ESCs, observing the Tip60-Hdac6 interaction no matter which protein was immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previously, both Hdac6 and Tip60 were separately found to interact with RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), raising the possibility that the Hdac6-Tip60 interaction we observed in ESCs might be mediated by Pol II. However, there were no peptides corresponding to Pol II in our LC-MS/MS data, and we could not detect Pol II in Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), arguing against this explanation. Furthermore, the Tip60-Hdac6 interaction was independent of DNA and resistant to high salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), verifying that Hdac6 is a stable interaction partner within Tip60-p400 complex. Finally, we tested whether Hdac6 interacts with Tip60-p400 complex in a differentiated cell type, MEFs. Unlike ESCs, Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitated from MEF nuclear extracts or whole cell lysates did not pull down Hdac6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), consistent with the possibility that Hdac6 interacts with Tip60-p400 complex in only a subset of cell types.</p><p>The reported cytoplasmic localization of Hdac6 in multiple types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valenzuela-Fernández et al., 2008</xref>) raised the question of whether its interaction with Tip60-p400 complex was physiologically relevant. To address this issue, we first confirmed that Hdac6 exhibited significant nuclear localization in ESCs, in contrast to MEFs, in which Hdac6 was mainly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we prepared cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions to examine the cellular localization of Hdac6 in ESCs and several adult cell types by Western blotting. Interestingly, while differentiated cells (MEFs, whole brain) exhibited the reported cytoplasmic sequestration, high levels of Hdac6 in undifferentiated cells, including ESCs, NSCs, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPCs), were found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistent with these data, differentiation of either ESCs or NSCs caused a dramatic decrease in nuclear Hdac6, accompanied by increased Hdac6 within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). To test whether nuclear localization of Hdac6 promoted its interaction with Tip60-p400 complex, we immunoprecipitated Tip60 from NSCs isolated from <italic>Tip60-H3F</italic> knock-in mice. Indeed, Hdac6 was present in Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitates from NSC nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data suggest that the interaction of Hdac6 with Tip60-p400 in undifferentiated cells is lost during the course of differentiation of some types of stem cells, due to nuclear exclusion of Hdac6. However, cytoplasmic sequestration in differentiated cells cannot be the sole factor preventing Hdac6 from associating with Tip60-p400, since we did not observe Hdac6 within Tip60-H3F immunoprecipitates from MEF whole cell lysates (in which nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are mixed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these data show that Hdac6 exhibits significant nuclear localization in some types of embryonic and adult stem and progenitor cells, where it associates with Tip60-p400 complex. Furthermore, stem cell differentiation promotes re-localization of Hdac6 to the cytoplasm, where it is sequestered away from Tip60-p400.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hdac6 is partially nuclear in multiple types of undifferentiated cells and interacts with Tip60-p400 in NSCs and cancer cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ESCs (top) or MEFs (bottom) were subjected to immunofluorescence using an antibody recognizing Hdac6.

We therefore tested several human cancer cell lines and found that Hdac6 exhibited significant nuclear localization in each of the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We further tested whether Tip60-p400 interacts with Hdac6 in cancer cells, by transfecting epitope-tagged <italic>Tip60</italic> and <italic>Hdac6</italic> constructs into 293.T cells (to facilitate immunoprecipitation), and found that Tip60 co-precipitated with Hdac6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that, as with ESCs and NSCs, Hdac6 functions within Tip60-p400 complex in some cancer cells. Interestingly, loss-of-function of either <italic>Hdac6</italic> or genes encoding Tip60-p400 subunits within cancer cell lines has previously been shown to elicit defects in anchorage-independent growth and hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), supporting this hypothesis. Finally, we asked whether re-localization of Hdac6 to the nucleus in cancer cells is an early event during transformation, at a time when it might be more likely to contribute to cancer progression. We found that shortly after introduction of SV40 large T antigen into MEFs, a large fraction of Hdac6 re-localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that nuclear localization of Hdac6 is an early event during transformation. Together, these data suggest that Hdac6 functions within Tip60-p400 complex in some types of cancer, and support the idea that stem cells and some cancer cells share several common phenotypes and regulatory pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hdac6 is necessary for normal regulation of most Tip60-p400 target genes</title><p>To test whether Hdac6 is necessary for gene regulation by Tip60-p400 complex in ESCs, we used DNA microarrays to examine the changes in mRNA levels upon <italic>Tip60</italic> or <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD. We observed highly correlated gene expression profiles in ESCs knocked down individually for <italic>Tip60</italic> and <italic>Hdac6</italic> (R = 0.63), suggesting a significant overlap in their sets of target genes, although <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD generally had weaker effects on expression of common targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Next, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mRNA expression data comparing ESCs depleted of Tip60, Hdac6, or both to control KD ESCs. We observed four main clusters of genes differentially expressed in <italic>Tip60</italic> KD cells: genes upregulated upon <italic>Tip60</italic> KD but unaffected by <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, cluster 1), genes upregulated in both single KDs (cluster 2), genes downregulated in <italic>Tip60</italic> KD cells but unaffected by <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD (cluster 3), and genes downregulated in both single KDs (cluster 4). Genes downregulated upon <italic>Tip60</italic> KD were significantly overrepresented (relative to the number expected by chance) among Hdac6-independent Tip60 targets, while genes upregulated upon <italic>Tip60</italic> KD were significantly overrepresented among Hdac6-dependent target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that Tip60-dependent repression in ESCs usually requires Hdac6. Double KD of <italic>Tip60</italic> and <italic>Hdac6</italic> was nearly identical to the <italic>Tip60</italic> single KD, consistent with the model that Hdac6 functions within Tip60-p400 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We next tested individual genes from each cluster by RT-qPCR, which generally confirmed the microarray results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We further validated these results using two <italic>Hdac6</italic> mutant ESC lines: one that harbors a hypomorphic allele that expresses reduced Hdac6 levels (<italic>Hdac6</italic><sup><italic>reduced</italic></sup>), and one that contains an <italic>Hdac6</italic> deletion (<italic>Hdac6</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Finally, we examined which classes of genes were enriched in each regulatory cluster. While Hdac6-independent targets of Tip60-p400 were enriched for genes involved in cellular growth, homeostasis, and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, clusters 1 and 3), the majority of Hdac6-dependent Tip60-p400 target genes were differentiation-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, cluster 2), consistent with the idea that Hdac6 is broadly important for Tip60-p400-dependent repression of developmental genes, although it also plays a smaller role in the activation of some Tip60-dependent proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, cluster 4).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Overlapping effects of <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD and <italic>Tip60</italic> KD on gene expression in ESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatter plot of gene expression (Log2 (fold change) relative to control KD ESCs) upon <italic>Tip60</italic> KD relative to <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD.

Hdac6 is not thought to bind chromatin or regulate gene expression in most cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haggarty et al., 2003</xref>), therefore we considered the possibility that Hdac6 modulates Tip60-p400 function prior to chromatin binding by the complex. To determine whether Hdac6 associates with chromatin-bound Tip60-p400, we tested whether Hdac6 co-localizes with Tip60-p400 on chromatin. To this end, we examined the genome-wide distributions of Tip60 and Hdac6 in ESCs using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing of the precipitated DNA (ChIP-seq). To facilitate these analyses, we generated an ESC line in which the H3F tag utilized above was fused to the C-terminus of Hdac6 at the endogenous <italic>Hdac6</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This line allowed us to directly compare the genomic binding profiles of Tip60 and Hdac6 with untagged control cells using the same antibody, thereby eliminating differences in background.</p><p>We found that Tip60 was enriched at the 5’ ends of many genes in ESCs, with two peaks of binding flanking the promoter regions of most targets, one at approximately 400 base pairs upstream and another at approximately 100 base pairs downstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). This two peak pattern of Tip60 binding and the gene set bound by Tip60 were very similar to previous mapping data examining the distribution of the p400 subunit of Tip60-p400 complex in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>). Interestingly, we found that while Hdac6 was also enriched at p400- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>) and Tip60-target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) near their TSSs, its pattern of binding at each gene was somewhat different, forming one peak of enrichment at approximately 100 base pairs downstream of the TSS that overlapped with the downstream Tip60 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Like p400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>), we found that Hdac6 was enriched at genes marked by H3K4me3, including bivalent genes also marked by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, we found that, on average, Hdac6 and Tip60 were both enriched to significantly higher levels at the promoter regions of genes that are misregulated upon <italic>Hdac6</italic> or <italic>Tip60</italic> KD compared to the genes unaffected by KD of these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that many of these genes are direct targets. Interestingly, while the levels of Hdac6 binding were elevated at genes from clusters 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), whose expression levels are regulated by Hdac6, they were also elevated at cluster 3 genes, whose expression levels are Tip60-dependent but Hdac6-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that Tip60-p400 acts independently of Hdac6 to activate these genes. Together, these data show that Hdac6 binds in an asymmetrical pattern with respect to the transcription start site at its genomic targets. In addition, the overlap between Hdac6 and one of the two peaks of Tip60-p400 binding is consistent with a model in which Hdac6 functions within chromatin-bound Tip60-p400 complex to regulate common target genes in ESCs. Consistent with our finding that Hdac6 does not interact with Tip60-p400 in differentiated cells, we found that Hdac6-dependent Tip60-target genes in ESCs were not bound by Tip60 in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Tip60 and Hdac6 co-localize on chromatin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map representation of ChIP-seq data for H3F-tagged Tip60 and Hdac6 comprising the 2 kb surrounding the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of 10,507 genes for which published p400 ChIP-chip data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>) (p400 enrichment) were available.

First, we considered the possibility that Hdac6 was necessary for complex formation or stability. To test this model, we purified Tip60-H3F in control and <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs, but found that the composition of Tip60-p400 complex was similar in the presence or absence of Hdac6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), arguing against this explanation. Alternatively, Hdac6 might be necessary for localization of Tip60-p400 to its target genes in ESCs. Finally, Tip60-p400 may recruit Hdac6 to its target genes, where it regulates gene expression by deacetylating histones. To distinguish between these latter two possibilities, we performed a series of experiments. First, we tested whether the treatment of ESCs with tubastatin A (TubA), a chemical inhibitor that prevents Hdac6-dependent deacetlyation by binding within the catalytic channel of Hdac6’s deacetylase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2010</xref>), had similar effects on gene expression as <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD.

TubA treatment did not affect expression or nuclear localization of Hdac6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that it acts directly on the Hdac6 deacetylase domains.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The Hdac6 deacetylase domains are necessary for Tip60-p400 binding but do not reverse histone acetylation catalyzed by Tip60.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Treatment of ESCs with Hdac6 catalytic domain inhibitor Tubastatin A causes de-repression of Tip60-p400 target genes.

ChIP-qPCRs using antibodies recognizing histone H4 acetylated at all four N-terminal lysines or acetylated lysine-5 of histone H2A were performed in control, <italic>Tip60</italic> KD, and <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs. Surprisingly, like <italic>Tip60</italic> KD, <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD resulted in a decrease in both H4 and H2A acetylation at most shared targets of Tip60 and Hdac6 that were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings show that Hdac6 does not silence differentiation genes by counteracting Tip60-dependent histone acetylation, despite the fact that treatment with TubA resulted in gene expression changes similar to <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD. <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD had no significant effect on bulk histone H4 acetylation, although tubulin acetylation was strongly enhanced by <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with a model in which Hdac6 is required for Tip60 function only at common target promoters.</p><p>A few subunits of Tip60-p400 complex are known to be acetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>), raising the possibility that Hdac6 regulates Tip60-p400 function by deacetylating the complex, which then leads to altered biochemical activity or chromatin binding by the complex. We tested this possibility by Western blotting Tip60-p400 complex purified from control or <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs with an antibody specific for acetyl-lysine, but we did not observe detectable acetylation of any subunit in either KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Additionally, we performed mass spectrometry on p400, the most highly acetylated subunit in Tip60-p400 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choudhary et al., 2009</xref>), purified from control or Hdac6 KD ESCs, but did not observe any notable differences in acetylation levels (data not shown). Thus, while the loss of <italic>Hdac6</italic> function does not lead to an observable increase in acetylation of Tip60-p400 complex or histone tails, it does lead to de-repression of Tip60-p400 target genes. Next, we considered the possibility that Hdac6 binds Tip60-p400 through one or both of its deacetylase domains. In this scenario, despite the fact that Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate Tip60-p400, TubA could cause de-repression of Tip60- and p400-target genes simply by preventing Hdac6 from binding Tip60-p400. We tested this possibility by immunoprecipitating Tip60-p400 complex from <italic>Tip60-H3F</italic> ESCs treated with either vehicle alone or TubA and determining whether Hdac6 co-precipitates with Tip60. Interestingly, TubA treatment completely abolished Hdac6 association with Tip60-p400 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>We reasoned that if TubA directly inhibited binding of Hdac6 to Tip60-p400, then addition of the drug to purified Hdac6-containing Tip60-p400 complex should disrupt this interaction. In contrast, if Hdac6 deacetylates some unknown protein, which then activates it to bridge the interaction of Hdac6 with Tip60-p400, the treatment of cells with TubA should disrupt the Hdac6 interaction with Tip60-p400, while in vitro TubA treatment of Tip60-p400 complex should not disrupt the Hdac6 interaction. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we immunoprecipitated Tip60-p400 from untreated <italic>Tip60-H3F</italic> ESCs and, after washing unbound proteins away from beads, subjected them to five additional washes with or without TubA. After harvesting the protein eluted in the TubA washes or remaining bound to beads, we examined the distribution of Hdac6 by Western blotting. Interestingly, we found that the TubA washes removed a large fraction of Hdac6 from bead-bound Tip60-p400 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that TubA directly disrupts the interaction of Hdac6 with Tip60-p400, rather than preventing deacetylation of histones or other proteins. Consistent with these findings, we found that mutation of the Hdac6 deacetylase domains had the same effect as TubA treatment: mutation of deacetylase domain 1 partially disrupted Hdac6’s interaction with Tip60-p400 in ESCs, while mutation of both deacetylase domains abolished this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, these data indicate that Hdac6 interacts with Tip60-p400 via its deacetylase domains and that TubA directly disrupts this interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Hdac6 is necessary for maximal Tip60 and p400 recruitment</title><p>The finding that Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate histones or Tip60-p400 subunits, but that its deacetylase domains are necessary for interaction with Tip60-p400 complex, was consistent with a model in which Hdac6 regulates gene expression by helping recruit Tip60-p400 complex to its targets in vivo. We tested this possibility by comparing Tip60 enrichment in control KD and <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs, predicting that if Hdac6 is necessary for Tip60-p400 recruitment, <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD should result in diminished Tip60 enrichment at many of its target genes.

Together, these data support a model in which Hdac6 binds to Tip60-p400 via its deacetylase domains, helping to recruit the complex to target promoters. In addition, these data rule out the possibility that Tip60-p400 represses differentiation genes by recruiting Hdac6 to these sites, since common targets of Tip60-p400 and Hdac6 were misregulated upon <italic>Tip60</italic> KD even though Hdac6 localization was unaffected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Hdac6 is required for normal ESC proliferation, colony formation, and robust differentiation but not self-renewal</title><p>Previously, we showed that ESCs depleted of Tip60-p400 subunits exhibited two prominent phenotypes: a failure to self-renew under conditions favoring ESC growth and a defect in the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) under conditions favoring differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>). In contrast, while deletion of <italic>Hdac6</italic> in ESCs was reported to cause a defect in colony formation, as well as a slight proliferation defect, <italic>Hdac6</italic> KO ESCs could nonetheless continue to self-renew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), and mice derived from <italic>Hdac6</italic> KO ESCs are viable. However, it was unclear from previous reports whether <italic>Hdac6</italic> KO or KD might result in impaired ESC differentiation in vitro, similar to that of <italic>Tip60</italic> KD. To test this possibility, we first confirmed that <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs exhibited colony formation and proliferation defects similar to those described for <italic>Hdac6</italic> KO ESCs. Indeed, we observed a significant decrease in colony formation and size in both <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD and <italic>Tip60</italic> KD ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs had a small but reproducible decrease in proliferation rate, while <italic>Tip60</italic> KD caused a somewhat more severe proliferation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>). Next, we tested whether EB formation or cellular differentiation might be impaired upon <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD, as we previously observed upon KD of genes encoding known Tip60-p400 subunits <italic>Tip60</italic>, <italic>p400</italic>, or <italic>Dmap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazzio et al., 2008a</xref>). EBs are thought to roughly mimic the embryonic state, as cells proliferate within spherical aggregates that subsequently develop cystic structures and differentiate into cells from all three germ layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Evans, 1975</xref>). Indeed we found that, similar to <italic>Tip60</italic> KD ESCs, <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs formed EBs that were significantly smaller and more heterogeneous than control KD ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, both <italic>Hdac6</italic> and <italic>Tip60</italic> KD EBs exhibited delayed induction of several differentiation markers during a time course of ESC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, while <italic>Hdac6</italic> loss results in only modest phenotypes in self-renewing ESCs, it is necessary for normal EB formation and cellular differentiation in vitro, consistent with its role in Tip60-p400 recruitment to differentiation genes.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.030</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hdac6 is necessary for ESC colony and EB formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Colony formation assays.

For a majority of Tip60-p400 target genes, we found that Hdac6 facilitated Tip60-p400 binding to its gene targets. Interestingly, while Hdac6 does not appear to deacetylate histones in vivo, we found that its catalytic domains were necessary for interaction with Tip60-p400 complex. Hdac6 has well established deacetylase activity directed against several cytoplasmic proteins, most notably tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>), leaving open the possibility that, in stem cells, it may deacetylate some nuclear protein(s) that remain to be discovered.</p><p>Tip60-p400 binds chromatin near the 5′ ends of genes in two peaks surrounding the TSS: an upstream peak that does not overlap with Hdac6 and is moderately sensitive to its loss, and a downstream peak that overlaps with and more strongly requires Hdac6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Recruitment of Tip60-p400 is the only apparent function of Hdac6 in gene regulation, since Hdac6 binding is maintained upon <italic>Tip60</italic> KD, while gene silencing is not. These data contrast with previously observed genetic interactions of mammalian Tip60 with other HDACs, in which Tip60 recruitment counteracts the repressive effects of HDACs on common targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2002</xref>), although similarities in gene expression profiles between Tip60 loss of function and chemical inhibition of HDACs have been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schirling et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.032</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for Hdac6- and Tip60-p400-dependent repression of differentiation genes in ESCs.</title><p>In the presence of Hdac6, Tip60-p400 binds both upstream and downstream of TSSs and differentiation genes are silenced.

Consistent with the phenotypes shared by <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD and <italic>Tip60</italic> KD ESCs, both <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD and loss-of-function mutations of Tip60-p400 subunits were previously shown to impair anchorage-independent growth and increase DNA damage sensitivity in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). However, unlike <italic>Tip60</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Hdac6</italic> KO ESCs can self-renew and are competent for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), strongly suggesting that the defect observed for <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD ESCs in vitro is overcome in the embryo by compensatory mechanisms. Since Hdac6 is only partially required for Tip60-p400 function in ESCs, the levels to which Tip60 and Hdac6 target genes are misregulated within the ICM of Hdac6<sup>−/−</sup> embryos may not be severe enough to induce a developmental arrest. In addition, since Hdac6 appears to function within the nucleus in only a subset of cell types (stem and progenitor cells), the effect of <italic>Hdac6</italic> loss on gene regulation is likely much more limited than that of <italic>Tip60</italic> loss throughout the embryo.</p><p>The dynamic regulation of Hdac6 localization during stem cell differentiation suggests that nuclear exclusion of Hdac6 may play a major role in gene regulation by reducing Tip60-p400 binding to specific sets of genes in differentiated cells. Consistent with this model, Hdac6-dependent Tip60-target genes in ESCs were not bound by Tip60 in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that Hdac6 does not play any role in Tip60-p400 regulation in these cells. It remains to be determined whether alternative proteins substitute for Hdac6 in differentiated cells to recruit Tip60-p400 to different promoters, or if alternative mechanisms of recruitment (e.g., binding to histone modifications or interaction with sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins) are more important upon differentiation.</p><p>Together, these studies identify a new, stem cell-specific mechanism by which Tip60-p400 is regulated, and uncover a role for Hdac6 in gene regulation. These findings differ substantially from established models of Hdac6 function as mainly a regulator of cellular motility and clearance of misfolded proteins via deacetylation of a small set of cytoplasmic targets, and suggest that cell type must be carefully considered when examining the phenotypes observed upon <italic>Hdac6</italic> loss of function. In addition, these studies lend support to the idea that different types of stem cells, as well as some cancer cells, share common features of chromatin structure that allow them to maintain their developmental potency, and provide one possible mechanistic link underlying this commonality. Re-localization of Hdac6 to the cytoplasm during stem cell differentiation could lead to expression of an alternate set of Tip60-p400 target genes. Conversely, after Hdac6 is restored to the nucleus upon cellular transformation, it may re-direct Tip60-p400 to a subset of its target genes that are normally stem cell-specific, potentially eliciting changes in gene expression that promote cancer development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>ESCs were grown under feeder-free conditions and used for all ESC experiments.

Briefly, 1 ml aliquot of the digestion mixture was injected into a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano UHPLC system with an autosampler (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and the eluant was connected directly to a nanoelectrospray ionization source of an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). LC-MS data were acquired in an information-dependent acquisition mode, cycling between a MS scan (m/z 310-2000) acquired in the Orbitrap, followed by low-energy CID analysis in the linear ion trap. The centroided peak lists of the CID spectra were generated by PAVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan and Burlingame, 2010</xref>) and searched against a database that consisted of the Swiss-Prot protein database, to which a randomized version had been concatenated, using Batch-Tag, a program in the in-house version of the University of California San Francisco Protein Prospector version 5.9.2. A precursor mass tolerance of 15 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.5 Da were used for protein database search. Protein hits are reported with a Protein Prospector protein score ≥22, protein discriminant score ≥0.0 and a peptide expectation value ≤0.01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalkley et al., 2005</xref>).

The pellets were collected after centrifugation at 1350×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and resuspended in Lysis buffer 2 for sonication. The samples were sonicated in a Bioruptor (UCD-200; Diagenode, Delville, NJ, USA) set to high for three cycles (10 min per cycle with 30 s on/ 30 s off) to generate 300–1000 base-pair fragments. The supernatants were collected after a 13,000 rpm spin for 10 min at 4°C. 50-μl Protein G Magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were washed twice with PBS with 5 mg/ml BSA and 10 μg of anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma) coupled in 500 μl PBS with 5 mg/ml BSA overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with antibody-coupled beads and sonicated supernatants in ChIP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) overnight at 4°C. The magnetic beads were washed twice with ChIP buffer, once with ChIP buffer including 500 mM NaCl, four times with RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 0.25M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na⋅Deoxycholate), and once with TE buffer (pH 8.0). Chromatin was eluted twice from washed beads by adding elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) and incubating for 15 min at 65°C. The crosslinking was reversed at 65°C for 6 hr and RNase A (Sigma) was added for 1 hr at 37°C followed by proteinase K (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) treatment overnight at 50°C. ChIP-enriched DNA was purified using Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol extractions in phase-lock tubes.

The samples were transferred into 15 ml Falcon tubes and sonicated in a Bioruptor set to high for two cycles (10 min for one cycle with 30 s on/ 30 s off). ChIP samples were end-repaired, A-tailed, and adaptor-ligated using barcoded adaptors according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). DNA purification on Zymo Research PCR purification columns was performed following each enzyme reaction (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). The adaptor-ligated material was then PCR amplified with Phusion polymerase using 16 cycles of PCR before size selection of 200–300 bp fragments on a 2% agarose gel. The library was purified using a Zymo Gel Extraction kit, its concentration was determined using a NanoDrop (Thermo), and the integrity of each library was confirmed by sequencing 10–20 individual fragments per library. Libraries with different barcodes were pooled together and single-end sequencing (50 bp) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 at the UMass Medical School deep sequencing core facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Raw FastQ reads were first collapsed by sequence and the read occurrences were kept. The reads were then mapped to the mm9 genome using bowtie allowing at most one mismatch in every alignment. For multimappers, only one alignment was chosen randomly by the M 1 parameter setting. Each aligned location was extended downstream to a length of 150 bp. Any extension that exceeded the end of the chromosome was clipped. The extended mapped locations overlapping with simple repeats annotated by RepBase were removed. For each remaining read along with its occurrence, we calculated the relative distance to the nearest TSS and for each TSS tallied the sum of read occurrence from its upstream 2000 bp to downstream 2000 bp. The occurrences were normalized and binned in 20 bp intervals.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and one of whom, Jerry Workman, has agreed to reveal his identity. The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a very nice paper that deserves to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The paper shows that Hdac6 behaves differently in stem cells (and some de-differentiated cancer cells) by being nuclear and interacting with the Tip60-p400 complex. This interaction with the Tip60-p400 complex, which is surprisingly mediated by the histone deacetylase domain, is necessary for Hdac6 to recruit the Tip60-p400 complex to selected promoters and inhibit transcription. Biologically, this interaction is important for stem cell differentiation. Overall, this paper reports surprising findings, breaks new ground both with respect to histone acetylase and deacetylase complexes in a context related to stem cells. The experiments are well done, the results and conclusions convincing, and the paper well written. The manuscript is essentially accepted, but please look at the comments below and make any modifications that you wish. The paper does not need to be re-reviewed.</p><p>1) It would be interesting to examine the acetylation status of Tip60-p400 more thoroughly. For example, they might want to immunoblot their purifications done in Hdac6 WT vs mutant backgrounds with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Or, they could do metabolic labeling with 3H acetate if the antibody is not adequate.</p><p>2) Hdac6 also binds ubiquitin. Does treatment with the drug affect Hdac6 binding to ubiquitin? More importantly, are any of the complex members ubiquitinated?</p><p>3) It is not clear how Hdac6 might recruit Tip60-p400 to chromatin. <italic>Hdac6</italic> has been shown to regulate ubiquitination of proteins through its ability to bind and protect elongating polyubiquitin chains. The authors should determine whether loss of <italic>Hdac6</italic> alters Tip60-p400 complex ubiquitination and/or degradation. They could also determine whether mg132 treatment can partially rescue Tip60-p400 chromatin localization in the absence of Hdac6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> appears to show that Tip60 shifts up in size.</p><p>4) It might be possible that Hdac6 binds to chromatin though ubiquitinated histones and then recruits Tip60-p400. The data show that Hdac6 is associated with H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and these marks have been associated with H2B ubiquitination, although the pattern of Hdac6 localization looks more like the pattern of H2A ubiquitination implied by Endoh et al. Does knockdown of a histone ubiquitin ligase reduce Hdac6 chromatin localization? Or does mutation of the Hdac6 ubiquitin-binding domain do the same?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01557.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It would be interesting to examine the acetylation status of Tip60-p400 more thoroughly.

We did not observe detectable acetylation of Tip60-p400 complex in the presence or absence of <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD.

These data indicate that if subunits of Tip60-p400 complex are ubiquitinated, the levels of ubiquitination in the cell are below the limit of detection of the anti-ubiquitin antibody, suggesting that this is not the mechanism by which Hdac6 binds Tip60-p400.</p><p><italic>3) It is not clear how Hdac6 might recruit Tip60-p400 to chromatin.</italic> Hdac6 <italic>has been shown to regulate ubiquitination of proteins through its ability to bind and protect elongating polyubiquitin chains.

We did not observe a reduction in the majority of subunits in the complex, suggesting that the levels and stability of most subunits are maintained in the absence of <italic>Hdac6</italic> (consistent with Western blotting data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we did find that one prominent band (besides Hdac6) was reduced upon <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that Hdac6 is not necessary for levels of Tip60-p400 complex, but is required for interaction of at least one protein with the complex. It is not clear if this protein is subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the absence of Hdac6. Additional studies will be necessary to determine the identity of this protein so that we can explore this possibility further.</p><p>Regarding Tip60 mobility, we don’t believe we see a mobility difference upon <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, Tip60-H3F levels are slightly higher in the <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD/Tip60-H3F IP lane. Multiple isoforms of Tip60 are expressed in ESCs, all of which harbor the H3F tag at the C-terminus. The two lowest mobility bands in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref> blur together a bit in the Hdac6 KD lane, perhaps giving the illusion of a mobility shift. This pattern is observed in additional blots of Tip60-H3F in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figures 3B and 5C</xref>), which show no difference in Tip60 mobility or levels upon <italic>Hdac6</italic> KD or inhibition, respectively.</p><p><italic>4) It might be possible that Hdac6 binds to chromatin though ubiquitinated histones and then recruits Tip60-p400. The data show that Hdac6 is associated with H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and these marks have been associated with H2B ubiquitination, although the pattern of Hdac6 localization looks more like the pattern of H2A ubiquitination implied by Endoh et al. Does knockdown of a histone ubiquitin ligase reduce Hdac6 chromatin localization? Or does mutation of the Hdac6 ubiquitin-binding domain do the same</italic>?</p><p>We agree that a thorough examination of which domains of Hdac6 are necessary for chromatin association and which chromatin modifications or transcription factors recruit Hdac6 to chromatin will be of significant interest. However, these experiments will require considerable time and effort to perform in a comprehensive manner. Because of this, and the fact that we were primarily interested in understanding how Hdac6 interacts with and regulates Tip60-p400 in this manuscript, we believe these additional studies would be better suited as the focus of a separate study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
