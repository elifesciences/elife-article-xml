factor family consists of the three members p53, p63, and p73. Both p63 and p73 exist in different isoforms that are well characterized. Isoforms have also been identified for p53 and it has been proposed that they are responsible for increased cancer metastasis. In contrast to the p63 and p73 isoforms, which do not contain truncations in folded domains, most of the p53 isoforms contain only parts of either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the oligomerization domain. To better understand the effect of p53 isoforms in cancer, we provide here a comprehensive biochemical characterization. With the exception of the Δ40p53α isoform, none of the other variants can bind to DNA with high affinity and none can upregulate transcription. Probing with antibodies, DARPins and other interaction partners confirmed that isoforms harbouring deletions in the DBD cannot interact specifically with them, but instead are bound to chaperones and other factors known to interact with misfolded proteins. Expression of isoforms with deletions in the DBD results in upregulation of cellular chaperones. If the expression level surpasses a threshold, the chaperone system can no longer keep these isoforms soluble, resulting in aggregation and co-aggregation with other factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p53 isoforms</kwd><kwd>p53 family</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005972</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Krebshilfe</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>70113956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003495</institution-id><institution>Hessian Ministry of Arts for Science and the Arts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clusterproject ENABLE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dikic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dötsch</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>p53 isoforms induce cellular stress based on their only partially folded states.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tumour suppressor p53 is the most mutated protein in cancer cells with more than 2000 different mutations identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joerger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Funk et al., 2025</xref>). In tumour cells with wild-type p53, its activity is also inhibited for example by the overexpression of E3 ligases such as Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haupt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kubbutat et al., 1997</xref>). p53 is a transcription factor that sequence-specifically binds to DNA to regulate the transcription of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition as the two most direct processes that prevent tumourigenesis. In addition, p53 also regulates genes involved in many other processes such as DNA repair and metabolism. Structurally, it consists of a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (OD) through which it forms tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joerger and Fersht, 2007</xref>). At the very C-terminus, an additional regulatory domain (CTD) is located that binds unspecifically to DNA and contains multiple sites for phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and other post-translational modifications. Mutations can occur in all these domains but mainly cluster in the DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joerger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Funk et al., 2025</xref>). High-affinity DNA binding requires the formation of tetramers which enables dominant negative effects of cancer mutations in the DBD as mutant p53 and wild-type p53 can form mixed tetramers via their ODs with strongly reduced binding affinity. Similar dominant negative effects are known from the p53 family member p63 in which mutations in the DBD result in developmental defects based on a dominant negative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osterburg et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celli et al., 1999</xref>). The discovery of p63 and the third family member p73 has revealed that these two proteins exist in multiple different isoforms that are created by the combination of different promoters with splicing events in the C-terminus which strongly influences the transcriptional activity of these isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterburg and Dötsch, 2022</xref>). Different isoforms have also been identified for p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourdon et al., 2005</xref>) and it has been proposed that these isoforms are responsible for increased cancer metastasis as well as premature aging upon dysregulation. In contrast to the p63 and p73 isoforms, which do not contain truncations in folded domains, most of the isoforms of p53 contain only parts of either the DBD or the OD. All these deletions have strong effects on the biochemical behaviour of the isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourdon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graupner et al., 2009</xref>). A deletion of the OD not only prevents the formation of tetramers which are required for high-affinity DNA binding, it also deletes the nuclear export signal, thereby influencing the subcellular localization of these isoforms. The wild-type p53 DBD is known to be only metastable with a melting temperature of ~43°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joerger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullock et al., 1997</xref>). Many p53 mutations found in tumours destabilize the DBD further, resulting in unfolding and due to the exposure of aggregation-prone peptide sequences in gain of function effects via co-aggregation with other cellular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levine et al., 1995</xref>). This metastability, combined with the in general cooperative folding behaviour of single domain proteins, strongly predicts that the isoforms containing a truncated DBD cannot properly fold but have a high aggregation potential, similar to mutant p53 with destabilizing mutations.</p><p>p53 isoforms have been studied in different cellular systems and individual isoforms have been assigned specific regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horikawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gadea et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mondal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turnquist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">von Muhlinen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong et al., 2015</xref>). However, a comprehensive biochemical characterization of these isoforms is missing and we propose that many of the observed effects can be assigned to co-aggregation of these isoforms with wild-type p53 as well as other cellular factors such as the other members of the p53 protein family. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of the p53 isoforms with respect to their stability, DNA-binding affinity, interaction with chaperones, aggregation and co-aggregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>All isoforms except wtp53 show a low to no transcriptional activity</title><p>So far, a total of 14 p53 isoforms with various truncations have been identified. Compared to the wild-type p53 form (from now on named wtp53) alternative translation start sites create the isoforms Δ40p53, Δ133p53, and Δ160p53, each lacking the indicated number of amino acids from the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>). The Δ40p53 variants have a deletion of the first 40 amino acids of the N‐terminus including the transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krois et al., 2016</xref>) but contain a wild-type DBD and OD. The Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms lack, in addition to the complete TAD, parts of the DBD. These different N-terminal isoforms can be combined with three different C-termini called α, β, and γ. Only the wild-type αC-terminus contains a full OD, the β- and ɣC-termini have a truncated OD with isoform-specific extensions. Furthermore, two isoforms with C-terminal deletions of parts of the DBD (TAΔp53α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rohaly et al., 2005</xref>) and additional deletion of the remaining C-terminus including the entire OD (TAp53ψ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Senturk et al., 2014</xref>) have been described. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows an overview of all these isoforms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Domain organization of p53 isoforms.</title><p>Overview of the so far described p53 isoforms that are formed by a combination of four N-terminal (TAp53, Δ40p53, Δ133p53, and Δ160p53) and three C-terminal variants (α, β, and γ), leading to 12 individual p53 isoforms. The remaining two isoforms p53ψ (or TAp53ψ) and Δp53 (or TAΔp53α) are generated by alternative splicing.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103537-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As an initial experiment, we determined the transcriptional activity of the p53 isoforms in relation to wtp53 and different classes of p53 mutants both in H1299 and in SAOS-2 cells using reporter plasmids containing either the multiple repeats of a p53 RE (pBDS), p21, or Mdm2 promoters. All three promoters are very sensitive to p53. Hence, p53 isoforms which show weak or no response in luciferase assays probably will not show any activity under endogenous protein expression levels on genomic promoters. To exclude the possibility that lower p53 isoform activities are due to reduced expression levels, a titration series with increasing amounts of wtp53 plasmid DNA was measured for comparison. In addition, we investigated artificial constructs that contained various combinations of full-length domains (DBD-OD-CTD; TA-DBD-OD; TA-DBD). wt-p53 showed a strong transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). An even higher activity was seen for the artificial construct TA-DBD-OD, lacking the CTD. As a negative control, we used the p53R175H mutant, which harbours a structural DBD mutation leading to a complete loss of transcriptional activity. TAp53β and TAp53γ still contain the full-length TA and DBD domains but lack the OD and therefore are unable to form tetramers. They showed a slight transactivation capacity, which is, however, several-fold lower than the wtp53 activity. This slight capacity could be due to weak binding of the p53 monomers to DNA and their intact TA domain, since isolated p53 DBDs can still cooperatively bind DNA with low affinity. This result is also consistent with the activity seen for the artificial TA-DBD construct. In agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Poon, 2007</xref>), no transactivation capacity was detected for TAΔp53α which lacks part of its DBD and linker region to its OD as well as the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and for the p53ψ isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Δ40p53α and Δ40p53β showed a slight transactivation capacity (100- to 200-fold below wt-p53). Δ40p53α lacks part of its TAD but preserves its OD while Δ40p53β lacks part of its TAD as well as of its OD domains. The artificial construct DBD-OD-CTD had a lower activity, as it lacks the TAD completely, while the TAD2 part is still present in the Δ40 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterburg and Dötsch, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krois et al., 2016</xref>). The other N-terminal truncations (Δ133 and Δ160) showed no activity at all, independent of their C-terminus (α, β, and γ), consistent with a lack of the entire TAD and parts of the DBD as well as depending on the C-terminus a lack of the OD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activity, oligomerization, and DNA binding.</title><p>Luciferase reporter assay of p53 isoforms and variants either on the pBDS-2 reporter (three repeats of the 14-3-3σ promoter RE) (<bold>A</bold>), or on the Mdm2 promoter (<bold>B</bold>), or on the p21 promoter (<bold>C</bold>).

The γ-isoforms showed the lowest expression of all C-terminal truncations, while the lowest expression levels among the N-terminal isoforms were seen for the Δ133p53 isoforms. These data also demonstrated that the lowest wtp53 concentration had a much higher transcriptional activity compared to all other p53 isoforms, even when these isoforms reached concentrations many times above the concentration of wtp53. Taken together, some p53 isoforms showed a higher transactivation capacity compared to others, but no isoform reached the level of wtp53. Moreover, the titration series with wtp53 indicated that saturation in this assay is achieved above transfection with 50 ng plasmid. As we had used 267 ng for all isoforms, any remaining transcriptional activity should have been detected in this assay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Only wtp53 and Δ40p53α bind DNA in pulldown assays</title><p>Next, we investigated the ability of the various p53 isoforms to bind to DNA using a pulldown experiment with the response elements (REs) of the p21 and the PUMA promoter. Only wtp53 and Δ40p53α showed binding to the p53-REs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For high-affinity DNA binding, p53 family members need a folded DBD and the ability to form tetramers. This requirement is met only by wtp53 and Δ40p53α. As a negative control, we used again the p53αR175H mutant which is unable to bind DNA due to its destabilized DBD. For all other p53 isoforms, no DNA binding could be observed due to the lack of a folded DBD (Δ133, Δ160 constructs, and p53ψ), lack of a functional OD (β- and ɣ-C-termini) or a combination of both. We confirmed the results of these pulldown assays for Δ40p53β by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements with the p21 RE being immobilized on the chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

For all other p53 isoforms, SPR measurements were not feasible because these proteins could not be purified following bacterial expression. Summarizing the transactivation and DNA-binding assays, all p53 isoforms show a behaviour more comparable to mutant p53 than to wtp53. Only Δ40p53α is able to bind DNA without exhibiting a significant transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Only wtp53 and Δ40p53 isoforms have an intact DBD</title><p>We further investigated the integrity of the DBD with binding to different interaction partners – the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) E6 protein, a recently described DARPin and the pAB240 antibody – that probe different interfaces. The E6 protein binds to a region of the p53 DBD different from the DNA-binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and initiates the degradation of p53 by the ubiquitin proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martinez-Zapien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Münick et al., 2025</xref>). Degradation requires the recognition of the p53 DBD by the E6 protein. An unfolded DBD or a DBD with a non-wild-type conformation does not get degraded. We expressed various p53 isoforms in rabbit reticulate lysate and determined the levels of the isoforms 4 hr after the addition of bacterially expressed GST-E6 protein or GST as control. As expected, wtp53 was completely degraded in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The structural mutant p53R175H was only partially degraded. This mutation locally perturbs the structure of the DBD, but also reduces the overall thermodynamic stability. Another structural mutant V157F was not degraded at all. The R273H mutation that is located in the DNA-binding interface did not inhibit degradation, demonstrating that it retains the wild-type fold of the DBD. TAp53ψ and TAΔp53α showed no decreased signal in the presence of HPV E6. Both lack C-terminal parts of the DBD, indicating that these isoforms are not able to fold their DBD correctly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Probing the DNA-binding domain (DBD) fold.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of structures of the p53 DBD (grey) in complex with DNA (orange; PDB: 3TS8), HPV16 E6 (blue; PDB: 4XR8), and DARPin G4 (green; PDB: 7Z7E).

(<bold>C</bold>) Conformation-specific immunoprecipitation (Conf-IP) of p53 isoforms and cancer-related mutants. H1299 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector or N-terminally Myc-tagged p53 variants. p53 was immunoprecipitated (IP) with either α-mouse IgG or an α-p53 antibody (pAB240). The latter binds an epitope in the DBD of p53, which is only exposed when the domain is unfolded. Consequently, pAB240 only recognizes intrinsically unfolded p53 mutants under native IP conditions. Input and IP samples were subsequently analysed by WB using αMyc antibody. For the relative Conf-IP efficiency, each IP signal was normalized to the input signal.

This is consistent with a similar result for the artificial construct TA-DBD. A less efficient degradation might not directly reflect differences in the binding efficiency of the E6 protein but also differences in the accessibility of lysine residues necessary for ubiquitination. This effect can be seen in the less efficient degradation of the TAp53αΔCTD construct in which the lysine-rich CTD is missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The remaining p53 isoforms with deletions in the DBD (Δ133p53α-γ and Δ160p53α-γ) show only low levels or even no degradation, similar to ΔNp63α which we have added as a negative control. While the explanation for the insensitivity of the Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms is that the missing parts of the DBD include part of the binding interface of the E6 protein, this interface is in principle present in the TAp53ψ and TAΔp53α isoforms. Their resistance to degradation shows that the remaining DBD does not adopt a fold that can be recognized by the E6 protein.</p><p>As a further experiment to investigate the conformational state of the DBD, we probed isoforms expressed in H1299 cells by immunoprecipitation with the pAB240 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This antibody detects an epitope in the p53 DBD that becomes accessible only upon unfolding of the domain. The results showed that the two p53 mutants R175H and V157F were efficiently immunoprecipitated (IP). Likewise, all Δ133 and in particular all Δ160 isoforms as well as p53ψ and TAΔp53α interacted with this antibody.</p><p>Finally, to investigate the structural integrity of the DBD, we performed binding studies with the DARPin G4 which we had previously shown to bind to the DNA-binding interface of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strubel et al., 2022</xref>). For pulldown experiments, we bound the biotinylated DARPin to streptavidin beads and expressed different p53 isoforms and mutants either in rabbit reticulate lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) or in H1299 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (Δ40p53 and Δ160p53 isoforms were not further tested as the first ones contain a fully folded DBD and results with Δ133p53 are directly transferable to Δ160p53). The G4 DARPin pulled down wtp53 as well as the R273H mutant. The R175H mutant was also pulled down, albeit with a lower efficiency with H1299 cells expressed protein (due to the higher temperature of cell culture compared to expression in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) which results in a lower level of the DBD with wild-type conformation). The efficiency for the V157F mutant was very low. None of the Δ133 isoforms or the p53ψ and TAΔp53α showed interaction.</p><p>Together, these binding studies demonstrated that only wtp53 and the Δ40p53 variants contain a fully folded DBD.

Thioflavin T binding was confirmed for the ɣ-peptide, while the β-peptide did not show binding above the background level, suggesting that indeed the ɣ-C-terminus has a high aggregation propensity in vitro and in cellulo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Aggregation is a function of the sequence but also of the concentration. In a cellular system, chaperones are present that keep proteins with open hydrophobic stretches soluble, prevent them from aggregation and, if this is impossible, associated E3 ligases will degrade the misfolded protein. To test the dependence on the concentration, we expressed several isoforms under a minimal CMV promoter (selected artificial promoter, p5RPU.Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2017</xref>], was cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmid) which results in reduced expression levels in H1299 cells. Using this system, also Δ133p53α,β could indeed be kept soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that aggregation will only become a problem if the expression level surpasses a certain threshold level. To further test this hypothesis, we overexpressed Δ40p53α, Δ133p53α, and Δ133p53β under the strong promoter in H1299 cells and treated the cells with different HSP70 and HSP90 inhibitors. No effect was seen for Δ40p53α which remained soluble. For both Δ133p53α and Δ133p53β, however, the percentage of the insoluble fraction increased relative to the treatment with only DMSO, suggesting that inhibition of chaperones results in increased aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Interaction with chaperones</title><p>The experiments described above suggested that chaperones are involved in keeping aggregation-prone p53 isoforms soluble. The characterization so far predicted that several of the p53 isoforms have exposed hydrophobic patches due to misfolding of the DBD or as part of isoform-specific new APRs.

To study this question, we measured the transcriptional activity on a reporter plasmid expressing luciferase under an HSP70 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and expressed at the same time different p53 isoforms. If the expression of these isoforms induced cellular stress which would result in the upregulation of chaperone expression, an increase in the luciferase activity should be detectable. These experiments showed that expression of p53 isoforms containing a ɣ-C-terminus, as well as all Δ133p53 versions, led to a strong activation of the HSP70 promoter. Elevated levels were also detected for TAΔp53, p53R175H, and p53V157F, but not for the DNA-binding interface mutant p53R273H. In addition, we investigated the effect of the isoform-specific β- and ɣ-C-termini by fusing them to the protein Scarlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gadella et al., 2023</xref>). We compared the activity on the HSP70 promoter in cells expressing these fusion proteins with the activity in cells expressing Scarlet itself. The results showed that the ɣ-C-terminus strongly induced activity, but not the β-C-terminus. Responsible for the aggregation-promoting effect of the ɣ-C-terminus (which according to the Waltz predictor is potentially amyloidogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beerten et al., 2015</xref>]) is presumably its hydrophobic nature. To investigate this hypothesis, we created the Y327A, L330A, L334A, and L336A mutations in the ɣ-C-terminus which indeed reduced the luciferase expression to background levels.</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that luciferase expression via the HSP70 promoter was induced by the overexpression of certain p53 isoforms, suggesting that their only partially folded state and/or open hydrophobic patches induce a cellular stress response. To exclude the possibility that the p53 isoforms induce luciferase expression by direct DNA binding (although our experiments described above already showed that only wtp53 and Δ40p53α can bind DNA strongly), we repeated the same experiments with a reporter plasmid having three copies of a heat-shock element (HSE) in front of a SV40 promoter and which therefore – in contrast to the full HSP70 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoff et al., 1993</xref>) – does not contain any p53 REs. These experiments confirmed the data obtained with the HSP70 promoter, strongly suggesting that it is the isoform induced cellular stress that triggers the expression of chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>We further investigated the interaction of selected p53 isoforms with chaperones by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. For this purpose, we created stable U2OS cell lines in which the isoforms were fused to the C-terminus of the TURBO-ID biotin ligase with their expression being under control of a Tet Response Element. After induction of expression of the isoforms (with tetracycline) and initiation of biotinylation, we isolated biotinylated proteins with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used a Q Exactive HF coupled to an easy nLC 1200 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to analyse proteins that were in close proximity to these selected isoforms. The results were filtered for the terms ‘chaperone’, ‘unfolded binding’, and ‘misfolded binding’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows that all isoforms interact with a common set of proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition to this common set, TAp53β and Δ40p53α showed only very few additional interaction partners. This situation was very different for Δ133α, Δ133β, and TAp53ɣ, which all showed close proximity to many more proteins involved in binding to un- or misfolded proteins. These data further confirm that Δ133p53 isoforms and isoforms with a ɣ-C-terminus contain hydrophobic patches and that their expression triggers cellular stress.</p><p>p53 itself was one of the most prominent proteins found in the interactome of all five investigated isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is expected as the TurboID ligase was fused to the N-terminus of all isoforms, which results in efficient self-biotinylation. To investigate if these isoforms also interact with wild-type p53, we focused a new mass spectrometry experiment on the identification of p53 peptides and analysed the interactome data for peptide precursors that can be quantified only in wild-type p53 but not in the specific isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For Δ133p53α, we could quantify a peptide precursor between amino acids 102 and 110 that is highly likely to originate from wild-type p53. This result is not surprising as Δ133p53α contains a full oligomerization domain capable of forming mixed tetramers with wild-type p53. These peptides were absent or beyond the detection limit in the Δ133p53β sample, in line with the interpretation that this isoform cannot hetero-oligomerize with wild-type p53. Peptides spanning the region amino acids 319–333 were only quantified in samples of Δ40p53α and Δ133p53α which contain the full-length oligomerization domain themselves, which makes it impossible to determine if these peptides originate from wild-type p53 or from the investigated p53 isoform. For Δ133p53β, TAp53β, and TAp53ɣ, we did not find any peptides in this region (with the exception of a precursor of very low intensity in a single Δ133p53β sample), supporting the interpretation that these isoforms do not interact with wild-type p53. For Δ40p53α, no wild-type peptides originating from the first 40 amino acids were detected despite the presence of a full oligomerization domain. Overall, these data show that Δ133p53α can form mixed tetramers and can thus act dominantly negative towards wild-type p53.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Some p53 isoforms can inhibit wt-p53, p63, and p73 by different mechanisms</title><p>The tetrameric state of p53 is the basis for the dominant negative effect of cancer mutations that inactivate DNA binding. The incorporation of one or more mutated p53 monomers into the tetramer weakens the binding to DNA. We wanted to investigate how the co-expression of selected p53 isoforms affects the activity of wtp53, p73, and p63. Co-expression of known cancer mutants strongly inhibited the activity of wtp53 as expected, as did co-expression of all α-isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expression of the Δ40p53α isoform can inhibit the activity of wtp53 also by blocking DNA binding (promoter squelching). Without a full TAD, this isoform is transcriptionally strongly suppressed. Co-expression of any isoform that is incapable of forming tetramers did not show any inhibitory effect. This includes all β- and ɣ-C-termini regardless of the N-terminal version as well as p53ψ and TAΔp53α. The inability of TAΔp53α to inhibit wtp53 seems surprising as it contains a truncated DBD but a full-length OD, in principle allowing it to form mixed tetramers with wtp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Alai et al., 2008</xref>).

Co-expression of TAp73α with ΔNp63α, a p63 isoform that lacks the transactivation domain and therefore shows very little transcriptional activity on most promoters, inhibits p73’s activity, most likely by promoter squelching as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gebel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Co-expression with ΔNp63αR304W, a mutant form incapable of binding DNA, however, showed that inhibition can also be due to the formation of mixed tetramers with decreased DNA-binding affinity. Co-expression with Δ40p53α again strongly inhibited the activity of TAp73α, not through formation of mixed tetramers but by promoter squelching which could be confirmed from the inability of a R273H mutant of Δ40p53α to inhibit p73. All other p53 isoforms tested had no effect, consistent with their inability to bind to DNA and replace p73. The only exceptions were the Δ133 isoforms that showed an intermediate degree of inhibition. In a previous study, we had shown that the α-C-termini of p73α and p63α can confer co-aggregation with destabilized p53 cancer mutants such as p53R175H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kehrloesser et al., 2016</xref>). To probe if the observed inhibition by the Δ133 isoforms could be due to co-aggregation with this α-C-terminus, we repeated the experiments with TAp73β which lacks this aggregation-prone sequence. The results mirror the data obtained with TAp73α, with the exception that the inhibitory effect of the Δ133p53 isoforms was indeed strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We also investigated the effect of p53 isoforms on p63’s activity. As TAp63α forms inactive dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>), we used TAp63ɣ, a constitutive tetrameric and active isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). The results are very similar to the data obtained with TAp73β, showing an inhibitory effect through promoter squelching only for Δ40p53α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further confirmed the interpretation that promoter squelching is the relevant mechanism by measuring the transcriptional activity of TAp63ɣ in the presence of increasing amounts of Δ40p53α which resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition. The presence of Δ40p53α harbouring mutations in the DBD that inhibit DNA binding did not affect the transcriptional activity of TAp63ɣ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we used co-IP to investigate direct physical interactions between selected p53 isoforms and wtp53, p63 and p73. We transfected H1299 cells transiently with N-terminally HA-tagged p53, p63, or p73 isoforms and with N-terminally Myc-tagged p53 variants (∆40p53α, ∆40p53β, ∆133p53α, and ∆133p53β). p53, p63, or p73 isoforms were IP with an α-HA antibody and co-IP of p53 variants was probed with Western blots using an α-Myc antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Δ40p53α interacted strongly with wtp53 as well as with the p53R175H and p53R273H cancer mutants, while Δ40p53β interacted weakly only with p53R175H, suggesting that these interactions are mediated by the OD. Similarly, interaction with all three p53 variants resulted in co-IPs with Δ133p53α. Interaction with wtp53 was weakest, showing that Δ133p53α can drag wtp53 into insoluble aggregates, but not very efficiently. Of the Δ133p53β co-IPs, the strongest was with the p53R175H cancer mutant which forms co-aggregates. For p63, we tested the dimeric TAp63α, the open tetrameric ΔNp63α and the ΔNp63αV603D version in which the aggregation-prone C-terminus is mutated to reduce the aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kehrloesser et al., 2016</xref>). None of them showed interaction with Δ40p53α or Δ40p53β. The same was true for the co-IP with Δ133p53α. A co-IP could, however, be detected for ΔNp63α and Δ133p53β, which could be reduced by the V603D mutation in the p63 C-terminus, showing that this interaction is based on co-aggregation. Virtually the same results were obtained with co-IP experiments with different p73 isoforms. TAp73α, which is a constitutively open and tetrameric isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luh et al., 2013</xref>), shows co-aggregation with Δ133p53α and Δ133p53β, which can get reduced by a V586D mutation in the α-C-terminus that reduces the aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kehrloesser et al., 2016</xref>).

In the case of p63, very clear biological functions have been assigned to two of these, namely ΔNp63α which plays an important role in organizing the chromatin landscape in the basal cells of epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kouwenhoven et al., 2015</xref>) and TAp63α which is a crucial factor for maintaining the genetic quality in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deutsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). For p73 functions in the development and maintenance of neurons, the development of ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>) and in tumour suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Logotheti et al., 2022</xref>) has been described involving both TA- and ΔN-isoforms with the α- and the β-C-termini. Characteristic for these isoforms is that they contain fully folded domains and differ only in the complete absence or presence of such domains. The p53 isoforms show a different picture. With the exception of Δ40p53α, which lacks parts of the unstructured transactivation domain, all are characterized by containing only parts of the DBD and/or the OD. As protein folding of single domains is in general a cooperative process, this predicts that these domains with missing secondary structure elements are largely unfolded and not capable of fulfilling a normal cellular function. Here, we have used multiple experiments to provide a comprehensive characterization of these p53 isoforms. Our data demonstrate that high-affinity DNA binding requires both a folded DBD as well as a folded OD. Only Δ40p53α fulfils these requirements and might have its own meaningful biological function, potentially as a transcriptional inhibitor of wtp53, similar to ΔNp63 and ΔNp73 isoforms which can inhibit wtp53 by promoter squelching. The potential role of Δ40p53α could be that of fine tuning of wtp53’s activity as the formation of hetero-complexes with a reduced number of TADs influences not only the transcriptional activity directly but potentially also indirectly as a reduced number of TADs can reduce the Mdm2-dependent degradation rate. This can lead to an even increased overall transcriptional activity as shown for titrations of TAp63 and ΔNp63 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). All other p53 isoforms do not bind strongly to DNA either due to lack of a functional DBD, a functional OD or even both. Instead, the unfolded/partial folded states, in particular of the DBD, as well as the hydrophobic nature of the ɣ-C-terminus, increase cellular stress as evidenced by the upregulation of chaperones and the association of chaperones and proteins involved in interaction with unfolded/misfolded proteins with these isoforms. Below a certain expression level, the cellular chaperone systems seem to be able to keep these isoforms soluble, but above this level they accumulate in insoluble aggregates. While the lack of crucial functional domains prevents well-defined physiological roles of these isoforms (with the potential exception of Δ40p53α as mentioned above), they have the potential to inactivate members of the p53 protein family by forming inactive hetero-complexes with wtp53 (Δ133p53α and Δ160p53α), by direct co-aggregation with α-isoforms of p63 and p73 (Δ133p53α,β,ɣ and Δ160p53α,β,ɣ) or promoter squelching (Δ40p53α). The exception to this rule is TAΔp53α, which aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Alai et al., 2008</xref>) and could in theory bind to wtp53 via its OD, but lacks an NLS and therefore cannot be imported into the nucleus to execute its dominant negative effect. Forced translocation of TAΔp53α into the nucleus was shown to establish a dominant negative effect, demonstrating that the lack of the NLS is the main impairment of a negative effect on wtp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Poon, 2007</xref>). The potential interaction mechanisms of p53 isoforms with members of the p53 family are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of inactivation within the p53 family.</title><p>p53 isoforms have the potential to inactivate p53 family members via different mechanisms. (<bold>A</bold>) Either p53α isoforms form inactive hetero-tetramers (and/or aggregate) with wtp53 (Δ40p53α, Δ133p53α, and Δ160p53α) and therefore inhibit wtp53 or inactive wtp53 by promoter squelching (Δ40p53α). (<bold>B</bold>) Furthermore, Δ40p53α isoform can as well inactivate tetrameric p63/p73 via promoter squelching. DNA-binding domain (DBD)-truncated aggregating p53 isoforms can co-aggregate with tetrameric p63α and p73α isoforms, but not with the closed TAp63α dimer.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103537-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Through these mechanisms, expression of many of the p53 isoforms can have detrimental effects, and the literature on these isoforms so far shows a clear correlation with cancer. The least effect is to be expected from Δ40p53β, which is only little more than an isolated p53 DBD and Δ40p53ɣ. This isoform, however, has the ability to aggregate and co-aggregate with other proteins due to the very hydrophobic nature of the ɣ-C-terminus. For all other isoforms, severe effects – increasing with the cellular concentration – can be expected. Depending on which cell types this expression occurs in, different overall physiological effects (cancer, neurodegeneration) can result. While this study is focused on the effects that truncations have on the folded domains of p53, it should be mentioned that deletion of the unfolded N-terminal as well as C-terminal domains also impairs the normal function of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dyson and Wright, 2025</xref>). These domains are the target of a large number of post-translational modifications and are important for the interaction with regulatory proteins, for example p300 and Mdm2 in the transactivation domain.</p><p>The aggregation potential of many of the p53 isoforms has been noticed in several other publications as well. The lab of Curtis Harris has shown by mass spectrometry analysis following co-IP of FLAG-tagged Δ133p53α in MRC-5 fibroblasts that Δ133p53α interacts with members of the Hsp70 chaperone families as well as the chaperone-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 as well as BAG2 and BAG5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horikawa et al., 2014</xref>), similar to our Turbo-ID-based proteomics study reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, Vieler et al. stated that they observed increased aggregation of Δ133p53 without presenting any data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vieler and Sanyal, 2018</xref>), whereas a computational study of the Δ133p53 DBD suggested a lower stability correlated with a high tendency for aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lei et al., 2019</xref>). Experimentally, the aggregation behaviour of Δ133p53β has been investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsic et al., 2021</xref>. They also found that this isoform interacts with the CCT chaperone complex and that depletion of this complex further promotes aggregation. Direct experimental evidence for the instability and aggregation tendency of the TAΔp53 isoform was provided by the Fersht laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">García-Alai et al., 2008</xref>). They confirmed that this isoform cannot bind to the p21 promoter and in mixed states significantly reduces the DNA-binding affinity of wtp53.</p><p>All the data suggesting that deletion of parts of the DBD results in the inability to bind DNA, the exposure of aggregation-prone peptide sequences and aggregation as well as co-aggregation with other cellular factors are supported by a large literature on the effect of structural mutations in the p53 DBD. Numerous studies have shown that the only metastable DBD of p53 gets further destabilized by these mutations leading to loss of DNA binding and aggregation behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Fersht, 2015</xref>). If single point mutations in the DBD can have that strong effects, it is more than likely that deletions of entire parts of the domain will have even stronger effects – consistent with all the data reported here.</p><p>In conclusion, the effects seen in cell culture as well as in patients with overexpression of different p53 isoforms should be interpreted on the background of the aggregation propensity as well as a potential overload of the cellular chaperone system instead of any specific interaction of these isoforms with proteins or DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H1299</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-5803</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SAOS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-85</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U-2OS Flp-In T-Rex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from C.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected and lysed on ice in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) with the addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 0.5 µg of HA-antibody or HSC/HSP70-antibody overnight at 4°C.

In addition, a discussion about the role of isoforms that contain truncations in the IDRs is not available. It is well known that these regions function in an auto-inhibitory manner (e.g. work by Wright/Dyson) and also mediate many PPIs, which likely have functional roles in vivo (e.g. recruiting p53 to various complexes). The discussion could be strengthened by focusing on some of these aspects of p53 as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments. In this paper we have focused on the importance of the integrity of the folded domains of p53 for their function. The unfolded regions in the N- and the C-terminus have not been our main target but the reviewer is right that they play important regulatory functions that are lost in the corresponding isoforms. We have, therefore, added a few sentences in the Discussion section.</p><p>With respect to a better quantification, we have re-evaluated the quantification and adjusted where necessary (see also reviewer 2). With respect to the hetero-oligomerization we have run a new mass spectrometry experiment in which we only focus on the p53 peptides. These have been now quantitatively evaluated and the results are provided in this manuscript Fig. 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;p53 isoforms have a high aggregation propensity, interact with chaperones and lack 1 binding to p53 interaction partners&quot;, the authors suggest that the p53 isoforms have high aggregation propensity and that they can co-aggregate with canonical p53 (FLp53), p63 and p73 thus exerting a dominant-negative effect.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the paper is interesting as it provides some characterization of most p53 isoforms DNA binding (when expressed alone), folding structure, and interaction with chaperones. The data presented support their conclusion and bring interesting mechanistic insight into how p53 isoforms may exert some of their activity or how they may be regulated when they are expressed in excess.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main limitation of this manuscript is that the isoforms are highly over-expressed throughout the manuscript, although the authors acknowledge that the level of expression is a major factor in the aggregation phenomenon and &quot;that aggregation will only become a problem if the expression level surpasses a certain threshold level&quot; (lines 273-274 and results shown in Figures S3D, 6E). The p53 isoforms are physiologically expressed in most normal human cell types at relatively low levels which makes me wonder about the physiological relevance of this phenomenon.</p><p>Furthermore, it was previously reported that some isoforms clearly induce transcription of target genes which are not observed here. For example, p53β induces p21 expression (Fujita K. et al. p53 isoforms Delta133p53 and p53beta are endogenous regulators of replicative cellular senescence. Nat Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;11(9):1135-42), and Δ133p53α induces RAD51, RAD52, LIG4, SENS1 and SOD1 expression (Gong, L. et al. p53 isoform D113p53/D133p53 promotes DNA double-strand break repair to protect cell from death and senescence in response to DNA damage. Cell Res. 2015, 25, 351-369. / Gong, L. et al. p53 isoform D133p53 promotes the efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cells and ensures genomic integrity during reprogramming. Sci.

Cell Death Dis. 2024 Jun 27;15(6):454.) which demonstrates that some isoforms can induce target genes transcription and have defined normal functions (e.g. Cellular senescence or DNA repair).</p><p>However, in this manuscript, the authors conclude that isoforms are &quot;largely unfolded and not capable of fulfilling a normal cellular function&quot; (line 438), that they do not have &quot;well defined physiological roles&quot; (line 456), and that they only &quot;have the potential to inactivate members of the p53 protein family by forming inactive hetero complexes with wtp53&quot; (line 457-458).</p></disp-quote><p>Therefore, I think it is essential that the authors better discuss this major discrepancy between their study and previously published research.</p><p>This manuscript is not about hunting for the next “signal transduction pathway” that is “regulated” by a specific p53 isoform. For such a project work has indeed to be conducted at the endogenous level. However, our manuscript is about the basic thermodynamic behavior of these isoforms in in vitro assays and in some cell culture assays.</p><p>What, however, depends on the expression level is the interaction with chaperones as well as the tendency to aggregate. And this we actually show in our manuscript by using two different promotors with very different strength: Strong overexpression leads to aggregation, much weaker expression to soluble isoforms. For the mass spectrometry experiments we have established stable expressing cell lines and not used transiently overexpressing ones.</p><p>The level from which on the chaperone systems of the cell cannot keep these isoforms soluble and they start to aggregate is certainly an important question, and we have experimental evidence that if we use different chaperone inhibitors the percentage of the aggregating isoforms in the insoluble fraction increases.</p><p>Proteins have to follow the basic physicochemical rules also in cells. And this manuscript sets the stage for re-interpreting the observed cellular effects – not in terms of specific interaction with certain promoters but as causing a stress response and non-specific interaction with other not-well folded domains of other proteins.</p><p>With respect to this discussion about the physiological relevance, it is interesting to look at a study that was published in Cell:</p><p>Rohaly, G., Chemnitz, J., Dehde, S., Nunez, A.M., Heukeshoven, J., Deppert, W. and Dornreiter, I.

These data are now shown in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 6. They show that peptides not present in the Δ133p53α isoform and therefore must come from wild type p53 can be detected. For the Δ133p53β isoform these peptides are absent, suggesting that this isoform does not hetero-oligomerize with wild type p53. Furthermore, all β- and ɣ- isoforms do not show peptides derived from wild type p53, again suggesting that they cannot hetero-oligomerize due to the lack of a functional oligomerization domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There is a typo in Figure 5.

Figure 4 in particular is arranged in a confusing way with A, D, B, C, E, F, G in T-&gt;B L-&gt;R order. Perhaps some figures could be expanded or re-arranged to make better use of the available space. E.g. could move B, C above panel D, and then shift F, G to be next to E. This would give you A, [B, C, D], [E, F, G] in a 2x2 format.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rearranged figures 2, 4, 5 and 6 to be able to enlarge the individual figure panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2C: Why is the p21-Luc reporter assay performed in SAOS-2 cells when all other assays are performed in H1299?</p></disp-quote><p>The assays we have performed in this study are independent of the cell type because we investigate very basic principles of protein folding and stability. If one removes a third of a folded domain, this domain will no longer fold, independent of the cell type it is in. However, to show, that the cell type indeed does not play any role, we have repeated the experiments in H1299 cells. These data are now shown in Figure 2C and the original data in SAOS cells we have moved to Supplementary Figure 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3: I find the statistics on this figure very confusing... It looks like every isoform is compared to the &quot;WT&quot;, but in that case, in Figure 3B for example, how can the Δ40p53β be ****, Δ133p53γ be *** while the Δ133p53α, more different to WT and narrower error bars is non-specific? I guess this comes from the normalization of the GST expression of each isoform but in this case, the isoforms should not be compared to the WT, but to their respective GST sample.</p></disp-quote><p>There was indeed a mistake in the statistics, thank you for pointing this out.</p><p>We repeated the statistical analysis and the relative protein level within each sample is now calculated using the ratio between the respective GST sample and the sample containing E6. Significance for each isoform was assessed by comparing the relative protein level to the protein level of the WT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figures 3D and 3E: the authors did not perform the assays on Δ40p53 isoforms because they &quot;contain a fully folded DBD&quot; (lines 218-219). This may be true for Δ40p53α as shown by the pAB240 binding figure 3C, but it is speculative for Δ40p53β and Δ40p53γ since these were not tested in Figure 3C either... Furthermore, Figure 3B suggests that there may be differences between Δ40p53α, Δ40p53β and Δ40p53γ and therefore these two isoforms should be tested for pAB240 IP at least (and DARPin as well if the pAB240 IP shows differences). Also, why were the TAp53β and TAp53γ not tested in Figures 3D and 3E?</p></disp-quote><p>Here we disagree with the reviewer. The PDB is full of structures of the p53 DNA binding domain. All of them – including many structures of the same domain from other species – span residues ~90 to 294 (or the equivalent residues in other species). That means that the β- and ɣ- versions of p53 contain the full DNA binding domain. In contrast to the DNA binding domain, the oligomerization domain, however, is truncated and therefore does not form functional tetramers. This is the reason for the reduced binding affinity to DNA.</p><p>The pAB240 antibody recognizes and binds to an epitope that becomes exposed upon the unfolding of the DBD. This manuscript shows by multiple experiments that the DBD of the β- and the ɣ-isoforms are not compromised but that the oligomerization domain is not functional. In figures 3D and 3E we have not included the TA β- and the ɣ-isoforms, because, again, they have a folded DBD and their inclusion would not provide any additional information compared to TAp53α.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figures 4B and 4C are small and extremely difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have rearranged and enlarged these and other figures. Please see also answer to comment (5) of reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 5C: the authors claim that &quot;the isoform induced cellular stress that triggers the expression of chaperones&quot; (line 320). However, if the induction of the HSP70 promoter is shown, there is no evidence that this is due to cellular stress. Evidence to support that claim should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression and accumulation of unfolded, aggregation prone sequences is a stress situation for the cell which triggers the expression of chaperones. The expression of isoforms that are not well folded or of p53 mutants that are not well folded increases expression both from the HSP70 promoter and the heat shock promoter. This shows that the expression of unfolded isoforms induces cellular stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 5D: why was this experiment performed in SAOS2 cells when the whole paper was otherwise performed in H1299 cells?</p><p>Also, about this figure, the authors write &quot;In addition to this common set, Δ133p53α and Δ40p53α showed only very few additional interaction partners. This situation was very different for Δ133α, Δ133β and TAp53γ.&quot; (lines 331 to 333). My feeling is that we should instead read &quot;In addition to this common set, TAp53β and Δ40p53α showed only very few additional interaction partners. This situation was very different for Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and TAp53γ&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this mistake. Indeed, the correct wording is TAp53β and Δ40p53α and we have corrected the manuscript.</p><p>The mass spectrometry experiments were actually not carried out in SAOS cells, but in U2OS cells. The reason for not using the H1299 cell line was that these cells do not contain functional p53. In contrast, U2OS cells express wild type p53. We have repeated the mass spectrometry analysis and analyzed the data with a special focus on p53 peptides. This information is now added as Figure 5E. In this analysis we show that the Δ133p53α samples contain peptides from the DBD that are not part of this truncated isoform and must therefore originate from wild type p53 with which this isoform hetero-oligomerizes. The corresponding peptides are absent from Δ133p53β, showing that without a functional oligomerization domain this isoform does not interact with wild type p53. Likewise, the data demonstrate that the β- and the ɣ-isoforms do not form hetero-oligomers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Supplementary Table 2: the authors claim &quot;For Δ133p53α we could identify peptides between amino acids 102 and 132 that must originate from wild type p53&quot;. SAOS2 has a WT TP53 gene and expresses all isoforms endogenously. Therefore, peptides between amino acids 102 and 132 can actually originate from &quot;WT p53&quot; but also TAp53β, TAp53γ, Δ40p53α, Δ40p53β or Δ40p53γ (most likely a mix of these).</p></disp-quote><p>We have not used SAOS cells but U2OS cells. As mentioned above the data show that the Δ133p53α sample contains peptides from wild type p53 and that these peptides cannot be found in the Δ133p53β sample. In addition, peptides originating from the oligomerization domain are only found in the samples of isoforms containing an oligomerization domain but not in samples of β- and ɣ-isoforms. The data are presented in Figure 5 E-G and Supplementary Figure S5.</p><p>Since the Biotin ligase is directly fused to a specific isoform, peptides from other isoforms can only be detected if these directly interact with the isoform fused to the ligase (and contain unique peptides, not present in the isoform fused to the ligase). The data confirm that only isoforms that have a functional oligomerization domain can interact with wild type p53 (or potentially other isoforms with a functional oligomerization domain).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 6: Why not conduct these luciferase reporter assays using the MDM-2 and p21 promoters like in Figure 2B and 2C since there may be promoter-specific regulation?</p><p>This would be particularly important for the p21 promoter as TAp53β is known to induce it (Fujita K. et al. p53 isoforms Delta133p53 and p53beta are endogenous regulators of replicative cellular senescence. Nat Cell Biol. 2009 Sep;11(9):1135-42) and the Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ133p53γ isoforms were shown to reduce p21 transcription by TAp73β when co-expressed in H1299 cells (Zorić A. et al. Differential effects of diverse p53 isoforms on TAp73 transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Carcinogenesis. 2013 Mar;34(3):522-9.). Neither of these regulations appears here on the pBDS2 reporter, which is puzzling.</p></disp-quote><p>The main point of this paper is that all isoforms without a complete DNA binding domain and without a complete oligomerization domain do not bind to DNA with high affinity and do not show transcriptional activity and that is independent of the promotor. There might be effects of expressing certain isoforms in some cells, but that is most likely by inducing a stress response via expression of chaperones etc. High affinity sequence specific DNA binding does not play a role here (see results in Figure 2) and we have therefore not conducted these suggested experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
