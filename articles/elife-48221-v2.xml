restricted by the lack of a system that reconstitutes the <italic>in-situ</italic>activation dynamics of quiescent human antigen-specific T-cells interacting with dendritic cells. Here we report a tissue-like system that recapitulates the dynamics of engineered primary human immune cell. Our approach facilitates real-time single-cell manipulations, tracking of interactions and functional responses complemented by population-based measurements of cytokines, activation status and proliferation. As a proof of concept, we recapitulate immunological phenomenon such as CD4 T-cells' help to CD8 T-cells through enhanced maturation of DCs and the effect of PD-1 checkpoint blockades. In addition, we characterise unique dynamics of T-cell/DC interactions as a function of antigen affinity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human immune system protects the body from infection or cancer by detecting foreign and abnormal elements, known as antigens, and initiating a response to clear them. It relies on a type of white blood cell called a T-cell to distinguish which substances are the body’s own, and which are infectious. Each T-cell is designed to attack a specific antigen, which they recognise using a unique 'T-cell receptor'. During an infection, immune cells called 'antigen presenting cells' hold out antigens for the T-cells to look at. Only when an antigen matches the T-cell's receptor can the T-cell get activated and trigger an immune response.</p><p>There are still gaps in our understanding about how human T-cells interact with antigen presenting cells. Since only a small number of T-cells in the human blood have the same receptor, it is difficult to collect the large number of identical T-cells needed to study this interaction. In addition, it is impractical to image how these interactions occur in a living human body.</p><p>Now, Abu-Shah et al. have developed a new system that engineers human T-cells to have the same specific receptor. T-cells collected from human blood received the genetic information for identical receptors via a technique called electroporation. This involves mixing the cells with a single-strand copy of the receptor gene and then applying electric pulses to make the cell membranes leaky so the code for the receptor can get inside the cells.</p><p>To study the interaction between these genetically engineered T-cells and antigen presenting cells, Abu-Shah et al. created a three-dimensional system that mimics the environment T-cells normally experience inside the body. T-cells cultured using this system behaved similarly to immune cells in the human body, and displayed the characteristics needed to trigger an immune response.</p><p>With this new system, researchers could recreate other aspects of the human immune response outside of the body, incorporating different types of immune cells and different genetic modifications. Not only could this improve our understanding of the human immune system, it could also be used as a way to screen specific drugs during pre-clinical studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T-cells</kwd><kwd>antigen presenting cells</kwd><kwd>3D model system</kwd><kwd>TCR engineering</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100262Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dustin</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011111</institution-id><institution>UCB UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCB-Oxford AZR00960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abu-Shah</surname><given-names>Enas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>207537/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dushek</surname><given-names>Omer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-AdG_670930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bálint</surname><given-names>Štefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayya</surname><given-names>Viveka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0033/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dustin</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demetriou</surname><given-names>Philippos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The use of advanced 3D culture systems with engineered quiescent human T-cells, mimicking in vivo cellular dynamics, paves the way to a new era of much needed pre-clinical research tools.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The field of human immunology has gained much attention in the last few decades with the increasing realisation that despite the tremendous utility of mouse models, they can only provide limited insight for advancing translational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wagar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Council MRC, 2008</xref>). Most of the research in human immunology is based on observational studies, whereby, for example, data sets of gene expression profiles are used to identify disease biomarkers. Although these studies promote our understanding and help in developing hypotheses about disease mechanisms, they fall short, and experimental research is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis, 2008</xref>). The classical tools in experimental human immunology rely heavily on immortalised cell lines, stimulated clonal lines, peripheral blood, and more rarely humanised mouse models. Each of these tools has its limitation. Cell lines have diverged tremendously from primary cells, making their signalling machinery and response thresholds no longer representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colin-York et al., 2019</xref>); bulk peripheral blood assays lack the spatial organisation of tissues; and humanised mouse models have only a portion of their system ‘humanised’, rendering the remaining parts confounding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Theocharides and Manz, 2018</xref>). To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic approach to allow researchers to manipulate and study human immune cells in a tissue-like environment with minimal aberrations to their natural behaviours. We report a toolkit that achieves two critical goals for engineering T-cells: (1) high efficiency TCR expression and maintenance of T-cell motility, activation dynamics and viability using mRNA electroporation and (2) a tissue-like 3D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematics of the experimental system.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Isolation of CD4 T-cells, CD8 T-cells and monocytes from peripheral blood.

One such characteristic is cell motility, which is essential for efficient antigen search in a physiological 3D setting. Here, we have optimised the procedures to engineer naïve human CD4 and CD8 T-cells using mRNA electroporation. The common approach to render T-cells antigen-specific relies on lentiviral transduction of the TCR, which requires prior expansion of T-cells to achieve high expression efficiency and hinders the study of natural quiescent populations, namely naïve and memory T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2009</xref>). To avoid the need for cell expansion, it is possible to use electroporation to deliver the genetic materials. However, reported approaches using electroporation suffer from low efficiency of expression, low viability, and most importantly impaired cell motility, a critical consideration in the context of delivery to target tissues. Using a square-wave electroporation apparatus, we are able to express the <bold>1G4</bold> TCR, specific to the NY-ESO tumour associated antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2000</xref>) in naïve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) CD8 T-cells as well as the <bold>868</bold> TCR specific for the HIV gag protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Varela-Rohena et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), both presented by HLA-A*0201. Successful pairing of the alpha and beta heterodimer of the TCR is important for the expression and assembly at the cell surface, this was achieved by introducing cysteine modifications in the TCR chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>), as well as co-transfection with the human CD3ζ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as the endogenous protein is most likely sequestered by the endogenous TCR limiting the expression of the introduced TCR. The functionality of naïve CD8 T-cells following TCR electroporation was confirmed by the formation of a mature immunological synapse in naïve and activated CD8 T-cells (IS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), and the upregulation of the activation marker CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The efficiency of TCR expression varied among donors with an average value of 81 ± 7% (mean ± SD, n = 13), with more than 90% cell viability and 80–90% cell recovery, both of which were severely reduced using alternative electroporation approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Engineering antigen-specific T-cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Expression of <bold>1G4</bold> TCR in naïve CD8 T-cells upon mRNA electroporation detected using NY-ESO-9V/HLA-A2 tetramer,~80% positive (Representative of N = 13).

However, replacing the constant region of the human TCR with that of mouse TCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>) allowed for successful chain pairing and we were able to achieve expression in 72 ± 8.9% (mean ± SD, n = 15) of the cells detected using H57 mAb against the mouse constant region of the β chain. We have successful expressed three different HLA-DPB1*04 restricted TCRs in naïve CD4s: <bold>6F9</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and <bold>R12C9</bold>, both specific to the MAGE-A3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yao et al., 2016</xref>) and <bold>SG6</bold> specific for NY-ESO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhao et al., 2006a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The expression of <bold>SG6</bold> was consistently lower than <bold>6F9</bold> and <bold>R12C9</bold> in naïve CD4 T-cells. However, when the same TCRs were electroporated into recently activated CD4 T-cells, high expression levels were achieved in 97.8 ± 1% (mean ± SD, n = 15) of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). The functionality of the naïve CD4 T-cells upon TCR electroporation was confirmed by IS formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C–D</xref>) and T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The closest model for <italic>bona fide</italic> DCs is monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) with well-established protocols for their generation. The caveat with those protocols is their extended duration (7–10 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhou and Tedder, 1995</xref>), a time-frame which may alter autologous T-cells’ phenotype. We therefore optimised a 48 hr protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Obermaier et al., 2003</xref>) to generate fully matured moDCs. During the first 24 hr monocyte differentiation into DC was induced, followed by 24 hr maturation to get activated DCs (acDCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The ‘express’ moDCs are able to upregulate MHC and other costimulatory molecules and produce a similar profile of soluble factors as the ‘classical’ moDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Furthermore, accurate control and manipulation of parameters such as antigen dose and cell ratios is limited. Having successfully engineered naïve human T-cells we set out to establish a flexible 3D platform to interrogate their dynamics and interactions with APCs using a multitude of correlated functional readouts. The desired platform should: (1) support the culture of T-cells and APCs for multiple days, (2) support the motility of the cells, (3) allow live imaging, (4) enable downstream analysis and (5) be easy to use. To achieve these goals we chose collagen I -based 3D matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunzer et al., 2000</xref>), which we optimised to support the culture of human immune cells. Culturing cells in the presence of human serum results in better basal motility than FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), which is significantly enhanced by the addition of homeostatic chemokines such as CCL19 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), CCL21 and CXCL12 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). However, only CXCL12 was able to maintain high motility in cultures with FBS. We have explored different sources of collagen I (undigested and trypsin digested bovine and human collagen) and other complex extracellular matrices, ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). All collagens were equally good in supporting motility and interactions, while more advanced ECM may have a marginal advantage for motility. Yet, the larger batch variation, higher background activation and the complexity in extracting cells for downstream analysis weighed against adopting them for our assays. In our view, the use of bovine collagen-I as the 3D scaffold, with human serum, and CXCL12 to enhance motility provides an optimal 3D system with similar movement parameters to T-cells in mouse lymph nodes or explanted human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bougherara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Murooka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Salmon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Woolf et al., 2007</xref>). We have also re-evaluated two additional electroporation methods, namely Lonza-Amaxa and ThermoFisher-Neon. In addition to their lower performance in cell recovery and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), they further resulted in poor motility dynamics and hence activation of cells within the 3D environment, where the search for antigen loaded APCs becomes a confounding factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Three-dimensional culture system to study immune cell interactions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Motility speeds of naïve CD4 and CD8 T-cells and acDCs in collagen gels with different chemokines.

Despite the lack of any change in the motility dynamics of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), there was a clear evidence that the presence of the checkpoint blockade enhances the clustering of CD8 T-cells around their targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This has also been corroborated by enhanced activation, although only observable for late readouts such as 41BB expression and target cell killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, we saw an enhanced expression of PDL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the ligand for PD-1, on CD8 T-cells, which could lead to cis interactions that act as a cell intrinsic regulation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sugiura et al., 2019</xref>).

Our tools are widely applicable to generate T-cells expressing different receptors and other proteins with high efficiency and minimal adverse effects associated with other engineering methods, which are essential for implementation of a successful translational approach. We provide a proof of concept where our system is used to probe the dynamics of T-cell/APC interactions as a function of peptide affinity, recapitulate CD4 help to CD8 T-cells and interrogate PD1 checkpoint blockade. Our experimental approach can be further extended towards reconstitution of more complex biology such as tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and the role of regulatory T-cells in cancer. We believe that the mechanical and biophysical features introduced by our platform provide greater fidelity to in-vivo conditions and will improve predictive power of pre-clinical studies in all human cell-based systems. We propose that our system should be integrated with other classical and computational approaches to enhance translational research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>RPMI 1640 (31870074) was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific.

Cells were imaged using either a Dragonfly Spinning Disk system, a Perkin Elmer Spinning disk or an Olympus FluoView FV1200 confocal microscope using a 30x Super Apochromat silicone oil immersion objective with 1.05 NA. All microscopes included an environmental chamber to maintain temperature at 37°C and CO<sub>2</sub> at 5%. Time-lapse images were acquired every 30 or 60 s. <italic>z</italic>-Scans were acquired every 3 μm.</p><p>SLB imaging was performed on an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a TIRF module and Photomertrics Evolve delta EMCCD camera using an Olympus UApON 150x TIRF N.A 1.45 objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Microscopy data from collagen gels was rendered and analysed using built-in tools in IMARIS software (Bitplane). Speeds bellow 2 μm/min were considered to correspond to stationary cells. Synapse images were analysed using Fiji. Image analysis for micro-contact printing data was done using TIAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mayya et al., 2015</xref>) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mayya et al. (2018)</xref>. In brief, cells were tracked using DIC images. IRM and fluorescence signal-positive segments of the tracks were used to calculate the attachment rate and the number of cells interacting with stimulatory spots to extract the half-life of interactions where a simple first order rate was used dA/dt=-k[A]; where A is cell number and k is the off-rate constant representing the exit from the spots by dissolution of the IS. Data from IMARIS and FlowJo were plotted and analysed in Prism (GraphPad), where all statistical tests were performed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Vincenzo Cerundulo for the <bold>1G4</bold> TCR sequence, Andrew Sewell for the <bold>868</bold> TCR plasmid, Steven Rosenberg for the <bold>6F9</bold>, <bold>R12C9</bold> and <bold>SG6</bold> TCR sequences and James Riley for pGEM-64A plasmid and introducing us to mRNA electroporation.

dendritic cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a well written, clear report that describes a technical advance to study antigen-specific interactions between CD4 and CD8 T cells and dendritic cells.

The method would be of some interest in the field of human immunology for breaking the current experimental limitation in this field, although the presented results seem to have several serious problems.</p><p>The authors mentioned that the square- wave electroporator could maintain the motility of T cells, and also showed the usage of collagen-based 3D matrix resulted in better basal motility of cells. However, it cannot be evaluate these data without appropriate controls. I would recommend the data of cell motility would be presented as comparison between the group using general electroporation and that with the square-wave electroporator. In addition, the authors claim the cell motility is maintained in 3D culture system, but nobody knows if it is similar or different to those seen in vivo LN tissue.

The system relies on square-wave electroporation of primary human CD4 and CD8 T cells with mRNAs coding for optimized TCR α/β (having either a novel Cys-Cys bridge for linking both chains in CD8 cells or a murine transmembrane domain for CD4 cells) and human CD3 Zeta chains. They demonstrate robust expression of a variety of antiviral or anti-tumor TCRs in both, CD4 and CD8 cells. Key point is the fact, that the motility of the T cells is not hampered by the transgenic approach and hence allows to study T cell activation processes by life cell imaging in artificial 3-D collagen matrices.</p><p>The authors are to be complimented on getting such a complicated system going. However, despite some minor technical issues I also miss the application of this approach for the identification of a new biological insight. Specific comments are below:</p><p>The key criticism is that there is essentially only a demonstration of the functionality of the technology. No attempts are being made to find something new in terms of T cell biology by its use. E.g. by the peptide adding assay it could be measured, how long it takes from application until the first measurable response. Modulators could be added to see the effect e.g. of checkpoint blockers or the like etc.. Anything is welcome, but I would really want to see the method applied to a biological question. Currently the manuscript appears a bit uninspired due to this shortcoming.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48221.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Two major points were made by the reviewers:</p><p>1) The format of the paper and its suitability for <italic>eLife</italic>. We would like to emphasise that we have submitted this manuscript as a methods paper under the Tools and Resources section of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers’ comments indicate concerns that this seems like a methodological paper and lacks new biological insight. We would like to highlight that this is indeed meant to be a methodological advancement that is validated by reproducing known biological results. As part of establishing our system, we verified it reproduces known immunological processes, such as CD4 help to CD8 T-cells (Figure 5). To further strengthen the utility of our system, we now also include data using anti-PD1 blockade (see below) showing enhanced CD8 responses. To avoid confusion on the paper’s format, we have included changes to the text to highlight and clarify the aim of the paper.</p><p>2) The structure of the paper, in particular the separation between main figures and supplementary data. We have now re-organised and extended the main figures while maintaining some data in supplementary figures. We are hoping to take advantage of the unique format of <italic>eLife</italic> where the supplementary data are clearly entrained to the main figures, making the presentation a continuous flow and not as strictly separated as traditionally done in other journals where making the link between primary and supplementary figures is not so clear.</p><p>As we have argued, and as the reviewers agree, there is an urgent need to establish simple and robust ways to manipulate human T-cells to facilitate translational research in human immunology. This has been a concern for many researchers working in the field and we believe that our tool will be of great value to the community.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a well written, clear report that describes a technical advance to study antigen-specific interactions between CD4 and CD8 T cells and dendritic cells.

This paper is intended to be a methodological paper and was submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> under the Tools and Resources section, which is equivalent to a methods section. We do believe that a more widely accessible journal like <italic>eLife</italic> will allow for the dissemination of our findings to a larger community including immunologist as well as cancer researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) One of the reported benefits is the ability to electroporate naive or memory T cells, but as far as I can tell only data from naive T cells are reported here – what happens with memory T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we now included measurements of memory T-cells’ responses (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). We have also performed the experiments on PD-1 checkpoint blockade with memory CD8 T-cells as naïve cells do not express this protein (Figure 5, and response to reviewer 3). [subsection “Enhancing CD8 responses through CD4 help and PD1 checkpoint blockade”]. In addition, we have used the cells electroporated with the TCR, both memory and naïve, on supported lipid bilayers in a different manuscript currently on Biorxiv (Demetriou et al., bioRxiv 589440).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A lot of the relevant data seem to be in the supplementary data, making it overall hard to follow what are the most important experiments.

[subsection “Collagen-based 3D model to support immune cell migration and interactions”].</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that it would be helpful to confirm that our results are consistent with dynamics of human T-cells in tissue settings. We have now added reference to two such studies. Human T-cells have been tracked in lymph nodes of immunodeficient mice and the rate of movement is very similar to what we observe here (Murooka et al., 2012). In addition, human T-cells have also been tracked in explanted tissues in which labeled T-cells were applied and allowed to invade. Again, the movement parameters are very similar to what we have measured here (Salmon et al., 2012 and Bougherara et al., 2015). The robustness of these systems is likely due to the switch like response of T-cells to the chemokinetic signals, which are fully activated above a threshold (2007).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The authors are to be complimented on getting such a complicated system going.

As this has been constructed as a methods paper with the aim of making it widely accessible to the research community without further delay, we do not explicitly try to provide a new biological finding. We however opted to reconstituting known immunological responses to establish its validity (e.g. CD4 help to CD8s). However, following the reviewer’s comment we have now included data showing anti-PD1 blockade enhances memory CD8 responses and also observed the upregulation of PDL1 on CD8s in these settings which can be in harmony with data suggesting the existence of a cis interactions between PD1/PDL1 as a mechanism of regulating this inhibitory receptor, furthermore, we identify that the blockade contributes to increasing cell clustering (Figure 5B).</p><p>We see in our data and some of the videos presented as part of this manuscript (specifically CD69 upregulation) that we can detect responses as early as couple of hours from the start of imaging (which is ~3hrs from combining the T-cells with peptide loaded DC in the collagen gels).</p></body></sub-article></article>
