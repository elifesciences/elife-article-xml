GTPase Rabs. As a Rab3/Rab27 effector protein on secretory vesicles, Rabphilin 3A was implicated to interact with SNAP-25 to regulate vesicle exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we have characterized the physiologically relevant binding sites between Rabphilin 3A and SNAP-25. We found that an intramolecular interplay between the N-terminal Rab-binding domain and C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>AB domain enables Rabphilin 3A to strongly bind the SNAP-25 N-peptide region via its C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix. Disruption of this interaction significantly impaired docking and fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane in rat PC12 cells. In addition, we found that this interaction allows Rabphilin 3A to accelerate SNARE complex assembly. Furthermore, we revealed that this interaction accelerates SNARE complex assembly via inducing a conformational switch from random coils to α-helical structure in the SNAP-25 SNARE motif. Altogether, our data suggest that the promotion of SNARE complex assembly by binding the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix of Rabphilin 3A to the N-peptide of SNAP-25 underlies a pre-fusion function of Rabphilin 3A in vesicle exocytosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>SNARE</kwd><kwd>Rabphilin 3A</kwd><kwd>SNAP-25</kwd><kwd>conformational change</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018537</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0202501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32225024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31670846</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry" vocab-identifier="10.13039/open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31721002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Cong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new binding mode between Rabphilin 3A and SNAP-25 enables efficient SNARE complex assembly via inducing a conformation change in SNAP-25 SNARE motif.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells is achieved by a series of intracellular membrane trafficking steps, including recruitment, docking, priming, and fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rettig and Neher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Südhof and Rizo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>). The core machinery governing the process involves the SNARE proteins synaptobrevin-2 (Syb2) on secretory vesicles, and syntaxin-1 (Syx1) and SNAP-25 (SN25) on the plasma membrane, which form the four helical bundle structure called the SNARE complex to bring the two membranes into close proximity and eventually drive membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weber et al., 1998</xref>). Small GTPase Rabs are essential regulators in the secretory pathway, which have specific role in defining the identity of subcellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Rab3A and Rab27A are abundantly expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine cells and associate with the membrane of secretory vesicles in a GTP-bound form to regulate vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geppert and Südhof, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukuda, 2005</xref>). Rabphilin 3A (Rph3A) was originally identified as a GTP-Rab3A-binding protein and found to regulate SNARE-dependent exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shirataki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deák et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies have found that loss of Rph3A is associated with Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease, suggesting a crucial role of Rph3A in synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Rph3A contains an N-terminal Rab-binding domain (RBD) that associates with secretory vesicles via binding to GTP-bound Rab3A or Rab27A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizoguchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2004</xref>), a proline-rich linker (PRL) region bearing multiple phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Foletti et al., 2001</xref>), and two C-terminal C<sub>2</sub> domains (termed C<sub>2</sub>A and C<sub>2</sub>B, respectively) that interact with phospholipids and the SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamaguchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In particular, increasing evidence showed that the C<sub>2</sub>B domain of Rph3A binds SN25 to regulate exocytosis of dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in PC12 cells and fine-tune re-priming of synaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsuboi and Fukuda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deák et al., 2006</xref>), but the underlying mechanism was unclear. It was previously reported that Rph3A binds SN25 via the β3-β4 polybasic region of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsuboi et al., 2007</xref>), while later structural results identified that Rph3A interacts with SN25 via the α-helix at the bottom face of the C<sub>2</sub>B domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deák et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrer-Orta et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, according to the crystal structure of the Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B–SN25 complex, three distinct sites in SN25 were found to participate in binding to Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B, two of which located in the middle region of the SNARE motif of SN25, and one resided at the N-terminus of SN25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrer-Orta et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains elusive which binding mode of the Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B–SN25 interaction is physiologically relevant. Importantly, little is known how this interaction regulates vesicle exocytosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The intramolecular interplay of Rph3A enables strong binding to SN25.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing domain organization and variant fragments of Rph3A.

Furthermore, we found a stimulatory role of Rph3A in SNARE complex assembly dependent on the Rph3A–SN25 interaction. This stimulatory effect of Rph3A arises because Rph3A induces a conformational change of the SN25 SNARE motif from random coils to α-helical structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An intramolecular interplay of Rph3A FL contributes to SN25 interaction</title><p>Given the difficulties in obtaining full-length Rph3A (Rph3A FL, residues 1–681) proteins in vitro, most previous studies alternatively used various Rph3A fragments to map the potential binding sites between Rph3A and SN25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deák et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrer-Orta et al., 2017</xref>).

In contrast, GST-SN25 showed significant interaction with Rph3A (182–681), Rph3A (282–681), and Rph3A (372–681), but failed to bind Rph3A (1–281) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Consistent with previous observations, these data indicate that the C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>AB of Rph3A contributes predominately to SN25 interaction. Intriguingly, GST-SN25 showed much more stronger binding capacity to Rph3A FL than to the above truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), and titration of Rph3A FL to GST-SN25 yielded a Kd of 3.293±0.4787 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As Rph3A (1–281) did not bind SN25, the only explanation is that the N-terminal region of Rph3A cooperates with the C-terminal C<sub>2</sub>AB to enhance SN25 binding.</p><p>To determine which part in the N-terminal region of Rph3A is required for the enhanced SN25 binding, we generated two Rph3A variants, one selectively lacked the middle PRL, that is, Rph3A (Δ185–371), the other additionally removed the N- and C-terminal residues upstream and downstream of the RBD, that is, Rph3A (Δ1–45 and Δ161–371) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both variants bound to GST-SN25 as effectively as Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), revealing that the RBD is important for the enhanced SN25 binding. As Rph3A FL prefers a monomeric state in solution and the RBD alone displayed no detectable binding to GST-SN25 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, we suspect that an intramolecular interplay between the RBD and the C<sub>2</sub>AB may enhance Rph3A–SN25 binding. Indeed, we observed that GST-tagged Rph3A-RBD (40–170) but not GST alone bound to His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>AB (372–681), as detected by pull-down assay combined with immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Next, we sought to explore the binding sites in the RBD that mediate binding to the C<sub>2</sub>AB. We used the crystal structure of the zinc-finger (ZF) of RIM-1 bound to the C<sub>2</sub>A domain of Munc13-1 as a guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2006</xref>), as Rph3A-RBD and Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>AB similarly contain ZF sequence and C<sub>2</sub>-domain sequence, respectively. Superimposition of the structures of Rph3A-RBD and Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B with the structure of the RIM-ZF–Munc13-C<sub>2</sub>A complex points to a region (residues 99–121) in the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Upon screening, we found that mutation of G102/L104 (G102A/L104A, referred to as GLAA) abolished the binding of Rph3A-RBD to Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>AB, as detected by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). To confirm this, we also introduced the GLAA mutation to Rph3A (Δ185–371) and found that it severely impaired GST-SN25 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest a new binding mode between Rph3A and SN25 which relies on an intramolecular interplay of the RBD with C<sub>2</sub>AB in Rph3A.</p><p>The RBD of Rph3A can bind Rab3A (Q81L, GTP-bound form) as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stahl et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999</xref>). Based on the crystal structure of the Rph3A-RBD–Rab3A complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostermeier and Brunger, 1999</xref>), the binding sites for Rab3A position away from residues G102/L104 in the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), suggesting that the intramolecular interplay of the RBD with C<sub>2</sub>AB might be compatible with Rab3A interaction. Indeed, pull-down experiments showed that the involvement of Rab3A did not influence the strong interaction between GST-SN25 and Rph3A FL mediated by the intramolecular interplay of the RBD with C<sub>2</sub>AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). Instead, Rab3A showed significant binding to the Rph3A FL–SN25 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), implying that Rph3A is able to serve as a connector to bridge vesicle-bound Rab3A and plasma membrane-bound SN25.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The N-peptide of SN25 mediates Rph3A FL interaction</title><p>SN25 contains two SNARE motifs, SNARE motif 1 and 2, connected by a linker region, namely SN1, SN2, and LR, respectively. SN25 also comprises an N-terminal peptide preceding SN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Previous structural analysis using the C<sub>2</sub>B fragment of Rph3A showed that both the middle part of SN1 and the N-peptide of SN25 are involved in Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrer-Orta et al., 2017</xref>). According to the binding mode of Rph3A with SN25 as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it is necessary to pinpoint the binding sites on SN25 by using Rph3A FL rather than the C<sub>2</sub>B fragment. To this aim, we designed and obtained a series of SN25 fragments that selectively contains multiple domains, for example, SN25 (1–82), SN25 (1–140), SN25 (141–206), SN25 (83–206), and SN25 (83–140), and compared their binding abilities with Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among these fragments, SN25 (1–82) and SN25 (1–140) significantly bound to Rph3A FL, as effectively as SN25 FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In contrast, GST alone and the other SN25 fragments failed to bind Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

To our surprise, in contrast to the strong interaction of GST-SN25 (1–82) with Rph3A FL, GST-SN25 (7–82) strongly impaired Rph3A FL binding, and GST-SN25 (11–82) failed to bind Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), showing that the N-peptide sequence (<sup>1</sup>MAEDADMRNE<sup>10</sup>) is essential for mediating binding of SN25 to Rph3A FL. However, previous structural and biochemical analysis using the C<sub>2</sub>B fragment of Rph3A suggested the middle portion of SN1 (E38/D41/R45) as the primary binding sites for Rph3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrer-Orta et al., 2017</xref>). To figure this out, we made an SN25 (1–82) mutant which carries E38A/D41A/R45A (EDR) and examined its interaction with Rph3A FL. Similar to SN25 (1–82), the EDR mutant retained strong binding to Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the N-peptide rather than the SN1 mediates Rph3A FL interaction. Taken together, these data indicate that the binding mode between Rph3A FL and SN25 is distinct from the mode between Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B and SN25, in line with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In addition, sequence alignment showed that the negatively charged N-peptide sequence of SN25 is conserved among different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, the N-peptide sequence of SN25 is not conserved in other isoforms such as SNAP-23, SNAP-47, SNAP-29, and Qb SNAREs (e.g., Vti1A, Vti1B, GOSR1, GOSR2, and Sec20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). To identify the key residues in the sequence that mediates Rph3A interaction, we introduced the E3A, D4A, and D6A single mutation to SN25 (1–82), and found that the D4A mutation significantly impaired binding of SN25 (1–82) to Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, we verified this binding modality in the presence of liposomes with physiological lipid composition, we performed lipid sedimentation assay and found that compared to SN25 (1–206), deletion of the N-peptide of SN25 (11–206) remarkably impaired binding to Rph3A FL in the presence of negative membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Endogenous SN25 expression was strongly suppressed by virally delivered shRNAs (see Materials and methods) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cahill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In parallel, neuropeptide Y (NPY)-td-mOrange2 was applied to visualize DCVs. First, we monitored the dynamics of NPY-td-mOrange2-labeled DCVs near the plasma membrane by TIRF microscopy and counted the number of plasma membrane-associated DCVs in resting PC12 cells. As expected, SN25 knockdown cells showed significantly reduced number of plasma membrane-docked DCVs, in comparison with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Expression of SN25 (full length, 1–206) restored the number of docked DCVs, whereas the expression of the SN25 mutant (11–206) that lacks the N-peptide exhibited strongly impaired ability to restore the docked DCVs in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), revealing that the N-peptide of SN25 is required for DCV docking.

As the N-peptide of SN25 mediates Rph3A FL interaction, we suspect whether this interaction would induce potential conformational changes of the SNARE motif (SN1) adjacent to the N-peptide. To this aim, we used a bimane-tryptophan quenching assay to analyze conformational changes of SN1 in SN25, as this assay has been widely used to study the structure and movement of proteins and has shown strong sensitivity in short-distance electron transfer measurements (10 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mansoor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Islas and Zagotta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taraska and Zagotta, 2010</xref>). In this case, a single tryptophan mutation (E55W) located at the middle portion of the SN1 was introduced in SN25 (full length, 1–206), and a single cysteine mutation (R59C) adjacent to E55W was created for bimane labeling. Note that the E55W/R59C double mutation did not influence the activity of SN25 in SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). If a conformational change occurred in SN1, for instance, a transition from random coils to α-helix, this change would shorten the distance between E55W and R59C-bimane thus produces enhanced bimane-tryptophan quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the original state of SN25 (unstructured state), SN25 E55W/R59C exhibited remarkably reduced bimane fluorescence compared to SN25 R59C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating efficient electron transfer in the distance between E55W and R59C. As a positive control, addition of Syx1 and Syb2 to SN25 E55W/R59C led to further reduced bimane fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), consistent with the conformational change of SN1 (from random coils to α-helix) driven by the formation of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutton et al., 1998</xref>). These data confirmed that conformational change of SN1 can be detected by using the bimane-tryptophan quenching assay. Intriguingly, when Rph3A FL was added to SN25 E55W/R59C in the absence of Syx1 and Syb2, we observed further reduced bimane fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), similar to that observed with the addition of Syx1 and Syb2.

Taken together, our data suggest that Rph3A FL promotes SNARE complex assembly via inducing the conformational change of SN1 from random coil to α-helix, and the promotion requires the interaction of the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix of Rph3A with the N-peptide of SN25.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rph3A was initially identified as a specific Rab3A/Rab27A-binding protein on secretory granules that are involved in the control of regulated vesicle secretion, including neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2004</xref>).

In the present study, we identified that the N-peptide sequence (1–10) rather than the SNARE motifs of SN25 mediates interaction with Rph3A FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and this binding specificity might be conferred by synergistic action of the RBD with the C<sub>2</sub>AB of Rph3A as discussed above.</p><p>Actually, according to the recently solved Rph3A-C<sub>2</sub>B/SN25 (Δ1–6) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrer-Orta et al., 2017</xref>), three distinct regions in SN25 were shown to participate in binding to the bottom α-helix of Rph3A C<sub>2</sub>B domain, one involved R8/E10/Q15 in the N-terminal peptide of SN25, the other two included E38/D41/R45 and D51/E55/R59 in the middle of SN1, respectively. However, these binding information need to be interpreted with caution, because in previous work (i) the isolated C<sub>2</sub>B domain, but not Rph3A FL was employed; (ii) the N-peptide residues of SN25 were partially deleted; and (iii) physiological relevance of these interactions had not been tested yet. Our observations that Rph3A FL bound efficiently to SN25 E38A/D41A/R45A mutant and D51A/E55A/R59A mutant but not to SN25 lacking the N-peptide pinpoint the binding specificity between Rph3A FL and the SN25 N-peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently, deletion of the N-peptide of SN25 or disruption of the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix of Rph3A significantly impaired docking and fusion of DCVs with the plasma membrane in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), revealing the physiological relevance of such binding mode.</p><p>Doc2 and Synaptotagmin-1(Syt1), which contain tandem C<sub>2</sub> domains homologous to that of Rph3A, are major Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in neurons responsible for spontaneous, asynchronous, and synchronous release of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaeser and Regehr, 2014</xref>). Doc2 and Syt1 were both implicated to bind SN25 at the middle of SN1 (D51/E52/E55) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). In this circumstance, the preference for binding of Rph3A to the N-peptide of SN25 identified here could make D51/E52/E55 more available for Doc2 and/or Syt1 interaction. In addition, interestingly, our results found for the first time that Rph3A has an ability to promote SNARE complex assembly, which requires binding of the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix of Rph3A to the N-peptide of SN25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As indicated by bimane-tryptophan quenching assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), our results found that Rph3A induces a conformation change in the SNARE motif of SN25, which increases the content of SN1’ α-helical configuration to facilitate its assembly with the SNARE motifs of Syx1 and Syb2. Taken together, we suggest that Rph3A has at least two important roles in prefusion events of exocytosis: one is to promote vesicle docking dependent on its associations with Rab3A and SN25 between the two opposite membranes; the other is to promote vesicle priming via accelerating SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These mechanisms may partly underlie the functional importance of Rph3A in DCV exocytosis in PC12 cells.</p><p>Previous studies have revealed that the N-peptide of Syx1 bound to Munc18-1 plays a regulatory role in exocytosis and that the N-terminal proline-rich sequence of Syb2 bound to intersectin-1 is necessary for the clearance of SNARE complexes required for vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rathore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jäpel et al., 2020</xref>). Combined with these results, the functional importance of the N-peptide of SN25 bound to Rph3A identified here suggests a common feature that the N-terminal regions of the three SNAREs are required for modulating vesicle exocytosis via interactions with multiple regulatory proteins.</p><p>In isolated form, the SNARE motifs of Syx1, SN25, and Syb2 all assume unstructured conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fasshauer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hazzard et al., 1999</xref>). However, as observed in the crystal structures of Munc18-1 bound to Syb2 or Syx1 and of Vps33 bound to Nyv1 or Vam3, the SNARE motifs of Syb2 or Syx1, and Nyv1 or Vam3 display highly ordered α-helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stepien et al., 2022</xref>), resemblance to their conformations in the assembled SNARE complex, suggesting that the prestructured SNARE motif of the SNAREs might be essential for proper SNARE pairing and register. Highly consistent with this notion, our data showed that Rph3A bound to SN25 renders SN1 to assume a prestructured conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These evidence suggests that the prestructured state of the three SNAREs induced by multiple regulatory proteins might be a prerequisite for the efficiency of SNARE complex assembly in exocytosis.</p><p>In contrast to the strong phenotype of Rph3A loss as observed in neuroendocrine cells, Rph3A loss has almost no phenotype in mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schlüter et al., 1999</xref>). It is of note that the synapse has evolved a number of specialized sites beneath the presynaptic membrane (active zones) opposing the postsynaptic density, which are composed of multiple active-zone components required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Such active-zone components may take the place of Rph3A in tethering/docking vesicles at the release sites and priming them for fusion. For example, Rab-binding protein RIMs and other vesicle associated proteins, such as Munc13 and CAPS, have been found to support vesicle tethering/docking via mediating the interaction between synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane and to support vesicle priming via promoting SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quade et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">James et al., 2009</xref>). However, neuroendocrine cells lack compartmentalized active zones on the plasma membrane, in which RIMs, Munc13, CAPS, and so forth, are dominantly distributed in the cytosol instead of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fukuda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabachinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kabachinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Houy et al., 2022</xref>), rendering them unlikely to compensate the loss of Rph3A in DCV exocytosis. A second possibility is that other SN25 binding partners in synapses alternatively promote SN25 assembly into the SNARE complex. For example, Munc13-1 was recently found to bind the linker region of SN25 to accelerate SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalyana Sundaram et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, with multiple components enriched at the active zones, synapses may permit normal exocytosis in a manner independent of Rph3A.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

However, SN25 (11–206 &amp; Δ9) that lacks the N-peptide strongly impaired Rph3A activity in accelerating trans-SNARE complex assembly (new Figure 5I, J).

As expected, Rph3A KD significantly reduced DCV docking and fusion in PC12 cells, and expression of exogenous Rph3A restored the impaired DCV docking and fusion (see new Figure 4D, F-H). Rph3A-K3 mutant exhibited strongly impaired ability to restore DCV docking and fusion (see new Figure 4D, F-H). The GLAA mutant, which disrupted the intramolecular interaction between Rph3A N- and C-terminal part, also failed to restore DCV docking and fusion in PC12 cells (see new Figure 4D, F-H). These results confirmed the conclusion that the Rph3A–SN25 interaction mediated by the C<sub>2</sub>B bottom α-helix is essential for DCV docking and fusion in PC12 cells.

It is of note that the synapse has evolved a number of specialized sites beneath the presynaptic membrane (active zones) opposing the postsynaptic density, which are composed of multiple active-zone components required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Such active-zone components may take the place of Rph3A in tethering/docking vesicles at the release sites and priming them for fusion. For example, Rab-binding protein RIMs and other vesicle associated proteins, such as Munc13 and CAPS, have been found to support vesicle tethering/docking via mediating the interaction between synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane and to support vesicle priming via promoting SNARE complex assembly (Dulubova et al., 2005; Imig et al., 2014; Quade et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019; James et al., 2009). However, neuroendocrine cells lack compartmentalized active zones on the plasma membrane, in which RIMs, Munc13 and CAPS, <italic>etc</italic>, are dominantly distributed in the cytosol instead of the plasma membrane (Fukuda, 2004; Kabachinski et al., 2014; Kabachinski et al., 2016; Houy et al., 2022), rendering them unlikely to compensate the loss of Rph3A in DCV exocytosis. A second possibility is that other SN25 binding partners in synapses alternatively promote SN25 assembly into the SNARE complex. For example, Munc13-1 was recently found to bind the linker region of SN25 to accelerate SNARE complex assembly (Kalyana Sundaram et al., 2021). Hence, with multiple components enriched at the active zones, synapses may permit normal exocytosis in a manner independent of Rph3A.” (pp.18-19, lines 407-427)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Considering that the Rph3A C2B also interacts with negative lipids on the plasma membrane, and this also likely involves the polybasic regions within the C2B domain, it is necessary to verify the binding modality of Rph3A to SNAP25 in the presence of liposomes with physiological lipid composition.

Indeed, we have tried to quantify Rph3A–SN25 interaction using ITC. Unfortunately, Rph3A FL protein was prone to aggregate under stirring in the wells in ITC instrument. Therefore, we alternatively used the GST pull-down assay to estimate the affinity and stoichiometry between Rph3A and SN25 with increasing concentrations of Rph3A FL and 6 µM GST-SN25 or GST (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). We used Hill equation to achieve nonlinear curve fit, where Bmax (the intensity of the bound Rph3A FL when Rph3A was added at the concentration of 10 µM) was set to 1. The dissociation constant (Kd) is 3.293 ± 0.4787 µM with a stoichiometric ratio (n) of 1.262 (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and pp.5, lines 95-96)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The PC12 analysis is carried out using the SNAP25 ∆1-11 only and there is no direct evidence that the impaired docking/fusion is due to Rph3A binding.

Besides, due to the bimane-tryptophan quenching effect is sensitively in short-distance electron transfer measurements (10 Å), we designed the E55W on the nearby helix of where R59C located in SN25 (Figure 6A). Anyway, we also performed the fluorescence anisotropy assay to investigate the influence of these mutants on SNARE complex assembly. Indeed, these SN25 mutants showed similar SNARE complex assembly ability as well as SN25 WT (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and pp.13, lines 286-287).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

To preclude the liposome clustering effect of Rph3A under the condition of ca<sup>2+</sup>, 2 mM EDTA were added in this experiment. Then, we found that Rph3A FL promoted SNARE-mediated lipid mixing in vitro, but Rph3A-K3 mutant failed to do so (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C). In contrast to SN25 FL, SN25 (11–206) that lacks the N-peptide strongly impaired Rph3A activity in membrane fusion (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, E). The results suggest that Rph3A promotes membrane fusion dependent on Rph3A-SN25 interaction.

We performed lipid mixing assay using SN23 instead of SN25, and found that the accelerating effect of Rph3A was eliminated in the presence of SN23 (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, G and pp.12-13, lines 270-274). Thus, the function of Rph3A in vitro is specific to synaptic SNAREs, i.e., SN25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The roles of Rabs and effectors in neuronal exocytosis need further discussion. Is Rabphilin 3A specific for DCV exocytosis? How about the fusion of small synaptic vesicles?</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed these questions as mentioned in Essential Revisions 3 and added this corresponding passage to the Discussion section (pp.18-19, lines 407-427).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How about the Rab effector exocyst?</p></disp-quote><p>In mammalian cells, exocyst is involved in membrane trafficking for cell growth and membrane protein insertion through regulating the trans-Golgi-network (TGN) derived vesicle fusion with plasma membrane (Finger and Novick, 1997; Murthy et al., 2003). However, the functional importance of exocyst in synaptic vesicle fusion has been challenged (Murthy et al., 2003). For instance, a Sec5 mutant, which destroys the exocyst complex, impairs the membrane protein addition, but synaptic transmission continues to be robust (Murthy et al., 2003).</p><p>In PC12 cells, exocyst is essential for GTP-dependent exocytosis but not for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent DCV exocytosis, although DCVs are also derived from the TGN (Wang et al., 2004; Sadakata et al., 2013). Thus, Rph3A and exocyst may function in different pathways of exocytosis in PC12 cells and neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Regarding the analysis of the rabphilin mutants (Figure 4), it would be useful not to use the overexpression of rabphilin mutants and rather rely on a KD-rescue approach, as the this would aid in the interpretation of the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer's advice.
