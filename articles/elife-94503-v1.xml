LRRK2 is a large and complex protein combining a GTPase and protein kinase activity, and disease mutations increase the kinase activity, while presumably decreasing the GTPase activity. Although a cross-communication between both catalytic activities has been suggested, the underlying mechanisms and the regulatory role of the GTPase domain remain unknown. Several structures of LRRK2 have been reported, but structures of Roco proteins in their activated GTP-bound state are lacking. Here, we use single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of a bacterial Roco protein (CtRoco) in its GTP-bound state, aided by two conformation-specific nanobodies: Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. This structure presents CtRoco in an active monomeric state, featuring a very large GTP-induced conformational change using the LRR-Roc linker as a hinge. Furthermore, this structure shows how Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> collaborate to activate CtRoco in an allosteric way. Altogether, our data provide important new insights into the activation mechanism of Roco proteins, with relevance to LRRK2 regulation, and suggest new routes for the allosteric modulation of their GTPase activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>LRRK2</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>nanobodies</kwd><kwd>allosteric mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G005219N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G003322N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004418</institution-id><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRP50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004418</institution-id><institution>Vrije Universiteit Brussel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRP95</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Versées</surname><given-names>Wim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conformation-specific nanobodies enable to capture and solve the first GTP-bound active structure of a bacterial homolog of the Parkinson-associated LRRK2 protein, providing insights into the activation mechanism of these proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Roco proteins are a family of large multidomain GTPases, with representatives in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosgraaf and Van Haastert, 2003</xref>). The minimal domain arrangement that characterizes this family consists of a Roc (Ras of complex proteins) domain bearing the GTPase activity, followed by a COR (C-terminal of Roc) domain that can be further subdivided into a CORA and a CORB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wauters et al., 2019</xref>). This protein family has attracted particular interest since the discovery that mutations in one of the four human Roco representatives, called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), are one of the major causes of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paisán-Ruíz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zimprich et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, genome-wide association studies have also linked this gene to idiopathic PD, as well as to some other diseases such as Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Maio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hui et al., 2018</xref>). LRRK2 is a very large and complex protein, where the central Roc-COR domains are preceded by armadillo (ARM), ankyrin (ANK), and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, and followed by a Ser/Thr protein kinase and a WD40 domain. Several Rab proteins have been identified as physiological substrates of the LRRK2 kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>PD-associated mutations in LRRK2 are concentrated in the catalytic Roc-COR and kinase domains, and commonly lead to an increase in kinase activity and – depending on the experimental set-up – a decrease in GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lewis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">West et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, recent data also suggest a reciprocal cross-talk between both catalytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilsbach et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Störmer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, while the therapeutic targeting of the LRRK2 kinase domain has been a major focus of research in the last two decades, the regulation and targeting of the Roc-COR domains is only recently gaining more attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cogo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pathak et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The first important structural insights into the functioning of the Roc-COR domains and the associated GTPase activity came from work with a Roco protein from the bacterium <italic>Chlorobaculum tepidum</italic> (CtRoco) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gotthardt et al., 2008</xref>). Bacterial Roco proteins are simpler, only consisting of the core LRR-Roc-COR domains, and hence lack the kinase domain. A crystal structure of CtRoco in a nucleotide-free state agrees with earlier biophysical data, showing that CtRoco is a homodimer in the nucleotide-free state, while it monomerizes upon GTP binding and exists in a concentration-dependent monomer–dimer equilibrium in the GDP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deyaert et al., 2017b</xref>). A PD analogous mutation in the Roc domain of CtRoco (L487A) shifts this equilibrium toward the dimer and decreases the GTPase activity, suggesting that monomerization is a requirement for normal GTPase activity.</p><p>Recently, several cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of LRRK2 have provided crucial new insights into the LRRK2 function and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deniston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>). Full-length LRRK2 (FL-LRRK2) appears as a mixture of monomers and homodimers under the experimental conditions used, allowing Myasnikov and colleagues to solve cryo-EM structures of both oligomeric states with the Roc domain bound to GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the symmetrical homodimers are formed through a CORB-CORB interface, very similar to the one found in the CtRoco homodimer. The kinase domain is present in an inactive (‘DYG out’) conformation, with the LRR domain wrapping around the kinase ATP-binding cleft, thereby blocking the entry of globular substrates and providing a mechanism of auto-inhibition. A recently published manuscript reports the structure of FL-LRRK2 bound to Rab29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to kinase-inactive monomers and dimers, an intriguing third form is observed in this study where LRRK2 adopts an asymmetric dimer of dimers. Each of the constituting dimers contains one protomer displaying the kinase in an inactive form and one in an active form. In the kinase-active protomer, the N-terminal (ARM-ANK-LRR) domains become flexible, thus releasing the auto-inhibition provided through the LRR domain. These data thus put forward the LRR domain as an important regulatory element. Nevertheless, while we now have access to structures of full-length Roco proteins in the nucleotide-free form (CtRoco) and bound to GDP (FL-LRRK2), no structural data is available for any Roco protein bound to GTP, leaving the role of the Roc domain and of GTP binding in the regulation of Roco proteins enigmatic.</p><p>Nanobodies (Nbs), the single-domain fragments derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies, form excellent tools to allosterically modify the activity of proteins and enzymes, including LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uchański et al., 2020</xref>). Previously, we generated two Nbs (Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>) that bind preferentially to the monomeric GTP-bound form of CtRoco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>). Correspondingly, binding of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> shifts the dimer–monomer equilibrium to the monomeric state and thereby reverts the decrease in GTPase activity caused by the L487A PD-analogous mutation. However, the mechanism underlying this allosteric modulation provided by Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> is not yet understood.</p><p>Here we use single-particle cryo-EM to solve the structure of full-length CtRoco in its GTP state, stabilized by the binding of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. This structure presents CtRoco in an active monomeric state, featuring very significant conformational changes compared to the dimer structure. These results provide important new insights into the activation mechanism and regulation of Roco proteins, and present potential routes for the allosteric modulation of their GTPase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM structures of nanobody-stabilized CtRoco in the GTP state reveal a monomeric ‘open’ conformation</title><p>While we previously showed that CtRoco undergoes a dimer to monomer transition during its GTPase cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deyaert et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), so far only an X-ray crystal structure of the nucleotide-free dimeric state of the protein is available.

Obtaining well-diffracting crystals of the GTP-bound CtRoco protein is most likely hampered by the high internal flexibility of the protein, as suggested by SAXS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deyaert et al., 2017b</xref>). To reduce this flexibility and stabilize the protein in the monomeric GTP-bound state, we reasoned we could make use of two conformation-specific Nbs (Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>) that preferentially bind the CtRoco GTP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nucleotide-induced conformational changes in CtRoco.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the domain arrangement of CtRoco (top) and its anticipated conformational cycle linked to GTP binding and hydrolysis (bottom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deyaert et al., 2017b</xref>)⁠.

Difficulties in aligning particles during data processing reflect the high flexibility of the N-terminal LRR domain vis-à-vis the C-terminal domains. This can be observed in the 2D classes from both data sets: while some display the full particle, most classes center on one half of the protein with the other half fading away as a result of flexibility. The majority of the 2D classes center on the N-terminal LRR domain and a few on the C-terminal Roc-COR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similarly, 3D classification of the CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> data set produced only one class representing a nearly full reconstruction, but multiple classes centering on the LRR domain with deficient density for the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further refinement with particles that converged in visible density for both domains resulted in the rather low-resolution map reconstructions for the entire protein. To avoid these issues linked to inter-domain flexibility and increase the quality of the local reconstruction of each domain, we created focused maps from the CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> data set by processing separately the N-terminal and the C-terminal centered classes, which produced map reconstructions with mean resolutions of 3.6 Å and 3.9 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These focused maps were used for all further interpretation and model building, and were finally fitted on the 7.7 Å map reconstruction of the (nearly) full protein reconstruction to create a composite map showing the relative orientation of these domains to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This resulted in a good-quality interpretable map for the LRR domain bound to Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>, with unambiguous density for most amino acid side chains on the LRR-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). No density can be assigned to a peptide region linking the LRR domain to the Roc domain, in agreement with the flexible nature of this linker. The quality of the map for the C-terminal part of the protein is more variable. For the Roc domain, unambiguous density allowing side chain interpretation is observed for some parts of the domain, including parts of the region that interacts with Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>. However, while the density for GTPγS and for a large part of the Switch 2 loop could be well interpreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>), the density is ambiguous in some regions around the GTP-binding pocket and absent for most of the Switch 1 loop. The map also allows us to unambiguously place Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>, although it is generally of lower quality in this region. In particular, the CDR loops of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> could be identified but hardly any side chains could be assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Also for the CORA and CORB domains, the quality of the map is variably spread. No density is observed for C-terminal residues of CORB (a.a. 892–940), which are involved in CtRoco dimerization. This is in very good agreement with previous hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) experiment showing that this region becomes highly flexible upon GTP-driven monomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, some weak density for this region can be observed in the full reconstruction map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, no density is observed for the last 150 residues of CtRoco, although in the CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> map some additional density is observed that can account for the C-terminal region. This region is probably highly flexible and also needed to be removed to obtain diffracting crystals of the nucleotide-free CtRoco dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deyaert et al., 2017a</xref>). Taken together, the GTPγS-bound CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> structure clearly shows the protein in a monomeric and elongated ‘open’ conformation, allowing us to interpret the GTP-driven conformational changes, as well as the binding sites and the mechanism of allosteric activation of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Only data from CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> were used for detailed analyses and will be discussed further.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table

CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> with the previously solved structure of dimeric CtRoco in the nucleotide-free (NF) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>) allows us to dissect in detail the conformational changes associated with CtRoco monomerization and activation. To achieve this, protomers of each structure were superposed using their Roc domains as a reference. The most prominent conformational change concerns the position of the LRR domain. In the GTPγS-bound structure, the LRR rotates away from the Roc-COR domains by about 135° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The hinge point for this large movement is the linker region between the LRR and Roc domains, and in particular the so-called α<sub>0</sub>-helix that precedes the actual Roc domain. This helix is a conserved structural element of the Roco proteins, including LRRK2. In the inactive dimeric CtRoco, the α<sub>0</sub>-helix is structurally inserted between the LRR and CORA domains, forming hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with both domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, upon GTPγS binding this helix detaches and becomes entirely solvent exposed, as such disrupting the interaction between the LRR and Roc-COR domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation is in good agreement with our earlier HDX data, which also suggested that the region connecting the LRR and Roc domain becomes solvent exposed in the GTP-bound monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural changes occurring upon GTP-driven CtRoco activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of a subunit of the nucleotide-free CtRoco dimer (labeled ‘NF’; beige) and the GTPγS-bound monomeric CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> (labeled ‘GTP’, colored by domain).

A remarkable feature of the CtRoco dimer structure was the dimer-stabilized orientation of the P-loop, which would hamper direct nucleotide binding on the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Correspondingly, in the current structure the P-loop changes orientation allowing GTPγS to bind, although the EM map does not allow unambiguous placement of the entire P-loop. Also the Switch 1 loop could not be fully modeled in our structure, presumably indicating some flexibility in this region despite the presence of a GTP analog. Interestingly, the Switch 1 loop harbors the site of the PD-analogous L487A mutation that leads to a stabilization of the CtRoco dimer with a concomitant decrease in GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. Unfortunately, an exact interpretation of this effect of the L487A mutation is hampered by the lack of a well-resolved Switch 1 loop. Another region of conformational change regards Switch 2. The EM map for this region and for the preceding interswitch β-strand is of reasonably good quality, allowing to model a large part of the backbone of Switch 2 (including the DxxG motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Compared to the position of the nucleotide-free structure, the Switch 2 shifts to a position much closer to the P-loop that is not compatible with the dimeric arrangement of nucleotide-free CtRoco since it would sterically clash with the adjacent protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, those conformational changes in the P-loop and Switch 2 region could form an initial trigger for nucleotide-induced monomerization. A final important observation in the Roc domain concerns the very C-terminal part of Switch 2 (residues 520–533), which, in contrast to the main part of Switch 2, could not be modeled in the GTP-bound structure, potentially due to flexibility of this region in the new position of the Switch 2. However, in the nucleotide-free dimer structure this region of Switch 2 is structured and located at the interface of the Roc domain with the LRR-Roc linker and CORA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this way, the conformational changes induced by GTPγS binding could be relayed via the Switch 2 toward the LRR and CORA domains, and vice versa.</p><p>In addition to the C-terminal dimerization part of CORB that becomes unstructured, also other large conformational changes are observed in the CORA and CORB domains of CtRoco upon GTPγS binding. The most prominent change in CORA concerns a shift of its N-terminal part (residues 626–693) toward a position that is incompatible with the position of the LRR and the Roc-LRR linker region in the CtRoco dimer structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In particular, the third helix of CORA (residues 666–678) would form sterical clashes with the α<sub>0</sub>-helix that links the LRR and Roc domains, thus linking the conformational changes in CORA to those in the α<sub>0</sub>-helix and LRR domain. The displacements occurring in CORB are even more pronounced. In the GTPγS-bound monomer, the N-terminal part of CORB (residues 798–891) undergoes a global rotational movement of about 30° in the direction of the dimer interface of the nucleotide-free dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Such an orientation would be incompatible with the dimeric arrangement observed in the nucleotide-free state due to severe steric clashes with the Roc domain of the adjacent subunit. Interestingly, this rotational movement of CORB seems to use the H554-Y558-Y804 triad on the interface of Roc and CORB as a pivot point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Mutation of either of the corresponding residues in LRRK2 (N1437, R1441, Y1699, respectively) is associated with PD and leads to LRRK2 activation. Residues H554 and Y558 are located on the Roc α<sub>3</sub>-helix, which was previously suggested to be an important element in the activation of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>)⁠. Indeed, while the orientation of the α<sub>3</sub>-helix with respect to the rest of the Roc domain only undergoes small changes upon GTPγS binding, it can be observed that this helix undergoes a ‘seesaw-like’ movement with respect to the CORB domain. A similar rearrangement was previously also observed for Rab29-mediated activation of human LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Störmer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>)⁠.</p><p>A comparison of the GTPγS-bound CtRoco monomer with the nucleotide-free dimer thus clearly provides several intertwined pathways linking GTP binding to monomerization and large-scale intra-subunit conformational changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> allosterically lock CtRoco in its active conformation</title><p>We previously showed that Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> binds CtRoco in a conformation-specific way, with the highest affinity for the GTP-bound state, while no binding was observed on the nucleotide-free CtRoco dimer. As a result, Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> shifts the CtRoco dimer–monomer equilibrium toward the monomeric state and increases the GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>). Albeit less pronounced, a similar specificity for the GTP-bound state of CtRoco is observed for Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. The current structure of GTPγS-bound CtRoco in complex with both Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> now reveals the mechanism underlying this conformational specificity.</p><p>Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> binds to CtRoco on the interface of the Roc and CORA domains and the hinge region connecting the LRR to the Roc domain (including the α<sub>0</sub>-helix). As such it is strategically positioned to ‘monitor’ the nucleotide-induced conformational changes occurring in CtRoco and to stabilize the active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Specifically, the CDR1 loop of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> is within relatively close distance to the linker region connecting the LRR domain to the Roc domain and to the α<sub>0</sub>-helix, although the local resolution in this area does not allow unequivocal placement of the residue side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The CDR2 loop mainly interacts with the Roc domain, including the interswitch region, while it can potentially also interact with the C-terminal end of the LRR-Roc linker. The CDR3 loop interacts with the region linking the Roc domain to CORA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This binding mode of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> would clearly be incompatible with binding to CtRoco in its inactive nucleotide-free dimeric state. Indeed, superposition of the current structure on the CtRoco dimer shows severe sterical overlap between the Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> CDR3 and the LRR, Roc and LRR-Roc linker of the CtRoco dimer, and, to a lesser extent, also between CDR1 and the LRR-Roc linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, binding of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> to CtRoco would be expected to shift the equilibrium toward the open active state, explaining the observed preference for the GTP-bound monomeric conformation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of the allosteric activation of CtRoco by Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> binds at the interface of the Roc, CORA, and LRR domains, close to the α<sub>0</sub>-helix and the hinge region of the LRR movement.

(<bold>C</bold>) Superposition of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> on the conformation adopted by the nucleotide-free CtRoco shows that the position of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> in the curvature of the LRR domain is not compatible with the closed conformation of CtRoco, due to severe sterical clashes with the CORB domain.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94503-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the density map, Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> can easily be identified and placed on the concave side of the LRR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The main interactions occur between the CDR2 loop and the first two repeats of the LRR domain, and, in particular, between the CDR3 loop and the central region of the LRR (repeats 5–10). From CDR1, only K27 seems to be involved in the binding by making interactions with E243 and Q245 in repeat 11 of the LRR domain. Apart from these contributions of the CDR loops, also framework residues of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> are implicated in the interaction with CtRoco, with in particular its N-terminal and C-terminal β-strands interacting with the very C-terminal repeat of the LRR. When superposing the active and inactive conformations of CtRoco, one can immediately appreciate that the placement of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> is incompatible with the LRR conformation in the inactive nucleotide-free state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the latter state, the LRR folds back on the COR domains and interacts with the CORB through its repeats 9–11. Hence, this provides a mechanism for the conformational specificity of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. Nevertheless, we previously found that Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> does bind to nucleotide-free CtRoco, albeit with a lower affinity compared to the GTP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>). This indicates some flexibility in the position of the LRR domain, regardless of the CtRoco nucleotide state, with Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> playing a more subtle role in shifting the equilibrium toward the monomeric open conformation. The latter is in agreement with our observation that the elongated open CtRoco conformation is also observed as the main species in the CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> structure in the absence of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Crosslinking MS experiments confirm the Nb-binding sites and the induced conformational changes</title><p>To further complement and confirm our structural data, we subsequently used crosslinking mass spectrometry (CX-MS) to map the Nb-induced conformational changes in CtRoco, as well as the binding sites of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>.

Considering the length of the DSSO spacer and the lysine side chains, the theoretical upper limit for the distance between the α carbon atoms of crosslinked lysines is ∼26 Å, while also taking protein dynamics into account leads to a cutoff distance of 35 Å, thus also allowing to draw inter- and intramolecular interactions within this resolution limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erzberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao et al., 2011</xref>). CX-MS was applied to GTPγS-bound CtRoco either in the absence of Nbs, or bound to Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>, Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> or both Nbs. Overall, the obtained crosslinking data for the proteins in solution correspond well with the cryo-EM structures and previous biochemical data. In the GTPγS-bound CtRoco protein, in the absence of Nbs, still a considerable number of crosslinks are observed between the LRR domain and the other CtRoco domains, illustrating the dynamical nature of this protein state, where the LRR most probably samples both the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The number of crosslinks between the LRR domain and the other protein domains is strongly decreased upon binding of either of the two Nbs, indicating that they stabilize the open conformation of CtRoco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). This is most prominent for Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> in agreement with the strong conformational specificity of this Nb. Interestingly, in the presence of both Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>, all the crosslinks between the LRR and C-terminal domains are lost, suggesting an additive effect of both Nbs in stabilizing the CtRoco open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Also, multiple crosslinks between the Nbs and CtRoco, as well as between both Nbs, were found. According to the cryo-EM structure, Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> binds to the LRR-Roc interface, and crosslinks were accordingly observed between Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-K68 and residue K443 in the LRR-Roc (α<sub>0</sub>) linker region. Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-K68 also forms crosslinks with two lysines within the Roc domain (K583 and K611), and Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-K90 is crosslinked to K583 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, surprisingly, no crosslinks were observed between Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> and the LRR domain, while the cryo-EM structure and previous biochemical data unambiguously show binding to the LRR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>). This can be explained by the compact folding of the LRR domain, which allows only very little rotational freedom for the lysine residues and causes a poor coverage by crosslinking data, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guaitoli et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Crosslinking mass spectrometry (CX-MS) experiments show the stabilization of GTPγS-bound CtRoco in its elongated active conformation by Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and/or Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intramolecular disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO)-crosslinks within GTPγS-bound CtRoco in the absence of nanobodies.

The current cryo-EM structure shows that binding of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> to nucleotide-free CtRoco must necessarily evoke a conformational change of the LRR. If this conformational change is relevant for the CtRoco activation mechanism and monomerization, we reasoned that binding of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> might sufficiently weaken the CtRoco closed conformation to allow subsequent binding of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>. To test this hypothesis, we titrated FITC labeled Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> with increasing concentrations of nucleotide-free CtRoco that was pre-incubated with an excess of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>, and we followed the binding using fluorescence anisotropy measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Based on our cryo-EM structure, we linked the C-terminal end of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> to the N-terminus of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> using a (GGGGS)<sub>3</sub> linker, hence obtaining the bi-paratopic construct Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub>.

This affinity of the bi-paratopic construct is threefold higher than that of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> alone, and even 18-fold higher than that of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> in the presence of an excess of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. Thus, this clearly shows the cooperative effect of both Nbs in the bi-paratopic construct with regard to binding and inducing conformational changes in CtRoco.</p><p>Next, we wondered whether both Nbs would also cooperate in increasing the GTPase activity of CtRoco. Indeed, we previously showed that Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> increases the GTPase activity of the slow CtRoco-L487A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>). L487 is located in the Roc Switch 1 loop and the mutation is orthologous to the I1371V PD mutation in LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jagtap et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paisán-Ruíz et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we first performed single-turnover GTPase experiments by mixing 5 µM CtRoco-L487A with 5 µM GTP in the presence of an excess of both Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. In the presence of both Nbs, the hydrolysis rate was increased sixfold compared to CtRoco-L487A alone and twofold compared to CtRoco-L487A in the presence of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> only, again illustrating a collaboration between the Nbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, the single turnover experiment was performed in the presence of the bi-paratopic Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub>. Interestingly, Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub> increases the GTPase turnover rate up to a level where it becomes too fast to determine an accurate k<sub>obs</sub> value. Indeed, while it takes the L487A mutant more than 1 hr to convert all the GTP under the conditions used, in the presence of Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub> nearly all the GTP has been hydrolyzed at the earliest possible sample point (20 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This clearly illustrates the very strong cooperative activating effect of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> within the bi-paratopic construct.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first structure of a protein belonging to the Roco family in a GTP-bound state, allowing us to analyze the conformational changes linked to nucleotide binding. While most attention has been devoted to human LRRK2 due to its link with PD, we used a bacterial homolog from the bacterium <italic>C. tepidum</italic> (CtRoco), which consists of the LRR, Roc, and COR (CORA/CORB) domains, followed by a C-terminal region of about 150 residues with unknown structure. Although this protein lacks the important kinase domain, it has proven to be an excellent model to study the properties of the generally conserved core LRR-Roc-COR domains that bear the GTPase activity, revealing the GTPase-driven dimer–monomer cycle and the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deyaert et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wauters et al., 2018</xref>). Previously, we solved an X-ray crystal structure of this protein in its nucleotide-free state, which displayed a compact dimeric arrangement with the LRR domain folding back on the Roc-COR domains within each protomer. Thus far, however, we have failed to produce well-diffracting crystals of this protein in a GTP-bound state, most probably due to the highly dynamic nature of the protein. To decrease this flexibility, we have now used two previously developed conformation-specific Nbs (Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>) to stabilize the protein in the GTP-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>), allowing us to solve its structure using cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Recently, Nbs have successfully been used to obtain structural insights into the conformational states of a number of highly dynamic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uchański et al., 2020</xref>)⁠. These studies established that Nbs bind antigens primarily by conformational selection rather than by induced fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manglik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smirnova et al., 2015</xref>)⁠. Since Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> were generated by immunization with fully native CtRoco bound to a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, and subsequently selected by phase display using the same functional protein, it is thus safe to assume that these Nbs bind to and stabilize a relevant conformation that is present within the ‘active’ CtRoco conformational space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>)⁠. Moreover, our current structures are also in very good agreement with previous biochemical studies and data from HDX-MS and negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deyaert et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>The cryo-EM structure shows the GTPγS-bound CtRoco as an elongated monomer, where the LRR domain has undergone an approximately 135° rotation away from the Roc and COR domains. A comparison of the nucleotide-free CtRoco dimer with the GTPγS-bound monomer suggests a direct and reciprocal link between monomerization and the conformational changes within the protomers, and allows us to propose several concerted mechanisms linking both events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). An initial trigger for monomerization seems to be the reorganization of the P-loop and Switch 2 region upon nucleotide binding, which is incompatible with the Roc:Roc dimer interface that is observed in the crystal structure of the nucleotide-free CtRoco. Via the Switch 2 loop the conformational changes can be relayed, via the region linking the LRR with the Roc domain and the CORA, toward CORB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, in the GTP-state the CORB domain makes a 30° rotational movement in the direction of the CORB-CORB dimer interface of the CtRoco dimer. Such an orientation would result in severe steric clashes with the Roc domain of the adjacent protomer, which probably forms the major driving force for nucleotide-induced monomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, the pivot point for the CORB rotational movement coincides with the hydroxyl group of Y804, which forms H-bonds with H554 and Y558 within helix α<sub>3</sub> of the Roc domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). H554, Y558, and Y804 correspond to N1437, R1441, and Y1699 in LRRK2, respectively, and mutation of either of these three residues is associated with PD and LRRK2 kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>). In LRRK2, a ‘seesaw-like’ movement of the α<sub>3</sub>-helix of Roc with respect to the CORB domain was observed upon activation by Rab29, and the N1437-R1441-Y1699 triad was proposed as a central region in the activation mechanism of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Störmer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). This thus illustrates that similar domain movements occur in LRRK2 and CtRoco, and that the GTPγS-induced conformational changes that we observe are thus likely also relevant to LRRK2.</p><p>The second prominent conformational change that occurs upon GTPγS binding is the movement of the LRR domain away from the Roc and COR domains. We hypothesize that also this conformational change is initially triggered by changes in the Switch 2 region upon GTP binding. In the nucleotide-free state, the backside of Switch 2 interacts with the LRR domain and the LRR-Roc linker via residues F528 and R532 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>). Rearrangement of Switch 2 upon nucleotide binding would disrupt these interactions. A key element for these conformational changes is the linker region between the LRR and Roc domains, with the α<sub>0</sub>-helix that immediately precedes the Roc domain playing a central role. While the α<sub>0</sub>-helix is buried in between the LRR, Roc, and CORA domain in the dimer, it loses all interactions with these domains in the GTPγS-bound monomer and acts as the swivel point for the rotational movement of the LRR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The conformational changes in the LRR domain upon nucleotide-induced activation of CtRoco are reminiscent of the observed changes in this domain upon activation of LRRK2 by Rab29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, in the kinase-inactive state of LRRK2, the LRR domain wraps around the kinase domain hence obstructing the entry of bulky substrates in the ATP pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>). However, upon activation by Rab29 the N-terminal domains, including the LRR, become disordered liberating the access to the active site of the kinase domain. Superposition of the inactive CtRoco dimer with inactive LRRK2 shows a very similar position of their LRR domains and α<sub>0</sub>-helices, suggesting also comparable conformational changes upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In agreement with these findings, recent molecular dynamics simulations proposed a key role for the LRR-Roc linker in the activation of LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weng et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, a R1325Q variant in the α<sub>0</sub>-helix of LRRK2 was recently identified as a kinase-activating PD mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>). In LRRK2, R1325 interacts with F1284, N1286, and N1305 located at the C-terminus of the LRR domain and with P1524 located in the linker between Roc and CORA, and one could imagine that the R1325Q mutation would weaken the interaction between the LRR and Roc-COR domains and activate the kinase. The above mechanisms thus suggest a strong coupling between CtRoco monomerization and the conformational changes within each protomer. Such a link between monomerization and activation was recently also suggested in LRRK2 by the finding that mutations in the CORB:CORB dimer interface (R1731L/R1731D) enhance LRRK2 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snead et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Similarities in the activation mechanisms of CtRoco and LRRK2.</title><p>A comparison of the conformation of the LRR domain and the α<sub>0</sub>-helix adopted within GTPγS-bound CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> (this work, colored by domain), nucleotide-free CtRoco (beige) (PDB: 6hlu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deyaert et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, and GDP-bound LRRK2 (green) (PDB: 7lhw) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Myasnikov et al., 2021</xref>) is shown⁠.

The most prominent role in this regard seems to be for Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>, which binds in the region of CtRoco that undergoes the largest conformational changes upon GTP-driven monomerization, consisting of the linker regions connecting the LRR to the Roc domain and the Roc to the CORA domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The extended conformation of the CtRoco monomer is further stabilized by the binding of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> in the curvature of the horseshoe-shaped LRR domain, which would sterically exclude the LRR conformation adopted in the compact CtRoco dimer. We also find that Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> and Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> cooperate in shifting the CtRoco dimer–monomer equilibrium toward the activated monomer, since binding of Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> to nucleotide-free CtRoco allows the subsequent binding of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>. This again proves that the conformational changes occurring upon CtRoco activation are closely linked and act in a concerted manner. Correspondingly, the bivalent/bi-paratopic Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub> construct shows an increased affinity towards CtRoco and a very strong stimulation of the GTPase activity of the slow CtRoco-L487A mutant, illustrating the power of the cooperative avidity effects enabled by such bivalent constructs. Considering that the conformational changes of the LRR domain, and the role of the LRR-Roc linker in this regard, are conserved features within the activation mechanisms of CtRoco and LRRK2, one could imagine that a similar mode of action could also be applicable to Nbs binding to LRRK2. Previously, we described Nbs that can allosterically inhibit or activate the kinase activity of human LRRK2, but the exact mechanism underlying this activity is still elusive, and it is unclear whether these Nbs use similar mechanisms to the GTPase-activating Nbs described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). Such a set of Nbs that either modify the GTPase or kinase activity of LRRK2 would form exquisite tools to aid in unraveling the link between both catalytic activities, as well as the role of the GTPase in LRRK2 pathology.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides important new structural insights into the mechanism of activation of Roco proteins with relevance for LRRK2, suggests new avenues for allosteric modulation of Roco activity, and underscores the remaining open questions with regard to the communication between GTPase and kinase activities in LRRK2.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of the bivalent nanobody construct</title><p>To generate the bivalent Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub>, a gene construct was designed that fuses the Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> to the Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> open-reading frame with the following linker sequence:</p><p>5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCGGCGGCGGCAGCGGCGGCGGCGGCAGCGGCGGCGGCGGCAGC</named-content>-3′.</p><p>The gene was synthesized and subcloned by GenScript Biotech (The Netherlands) in the pHEN29 vector, which adds the Sortase-recognition sequence LPETG at the C-terminus, allowing for Sortase A-mediated labeling.

A heterogeneous refinement with four classes, followed by homogeneous refinement of the best class based on density interpretability, yielded an 8.3 Å resolution map reconstruction from 99,460 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>For the CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> data set, particle picking was first performed with Topaz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>), after import of the micrographs to cryoSPARC, using the pretrained model ResNet16 on a small set of 18 random images. Bad particles were removed by 2D classification and the rest were used to train a Topaz model, followed by picking using Topaz Extract on the full data set, which resulted in 716,919 particles extracted on a box size of 389 Å. After three rounds of 2D classification, 371,956 particles were selected. Selected particles were used for multiple ab initio reconstruction using six classes, followed by heterogeneous refinement of the six classes. These jobs yielded one class corresponding to the volume of CtRoco bound to both Nbs and two classes corresponding to good-quality volumes centered on the LRR domain but with little density for the other half of the molecule. The other three classes were also centered on the LRR domain but with overall bad quality. Homogeneous refinement of the class displaying a nearly full CtRoco protein bound to the two Nbs, followed by non-uniform refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Punjani et al., 2020</xref>), resulted in a 7.7 Å resolution map reconstruction from 48,333 particles. To obtain a focused map on the LRR half of the protein, the two classes centered on the LRR domain were merged, particles were re-extracted on a smaller box size of 243 Å, and, after homogeneous and non-uniform refinements, a map was obtained where only the LRR domain bound to Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> is visible with 3.6 Å resolution using 160,925 particles. To obtain a higher resolution map for the other half of the protein, spanning the Roc-COR and Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>, a different approach was used: three 2D classes centered on the Roc-COR domains were selected and fed to a template picker job with the intention to pick this half of the particles only, and extracted on a box size of 243 Å. After extraction and three rounds of 2D classification, again only classes that were centered on the Roc-COR domains were selected for ab initio reconstruction using four classes followed by heterogeneous refinement. These yielded one good-quality volume and the particles in this class were then subjected to non-uniform refinement, yielding a map representing the Roc-COR domains and the Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>. The overall resolution of the map was estimated at 3.9 Å using 38,260 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>The focused maps containing either the LRR domain bound to Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> or the Roc-COR domain bound to Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> were improved by density modification with resolve_cryo_em (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Terwilliger et al., 2020</xref>) in the PHENIX suit (version 1.20.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>), and used for model interpretation and refinement. Initial models of the individual CtRoco domains were taken from the nucleotide-free CtRoco structure (PDB: 6hlu). Nb models were generated using AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Initial rigid body fits were performed for each domain separately on UCSF ChimeraX 1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>), followed by a flexible fitting in Coot 0.9.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), to fit the secondary structure features into density. Manual building and inspection was also done in Coot, and real-space refinement was performed with the phenix.real_space_refine program in PHENIX applying Ramachandran plot restraints. Model-versus-data fit was assessed by curves of the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) as a function of resolution using the refined models and the two half-maps of each focused volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Finally, the focused maps and models were fitted into the lower resolution map of the entire protein in UCSF ChimeraX to obtain an overall interpretation of CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>. Figures containing molecular structures and volumes were prepared with UCSF ChimeraX and PyMOL (The PyMol Molecular Graphic System, version 2.4 Schrödinger, LLC, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org/2/">https://pymol.org/2/</ext-link>). Maps shown in the figures were improved with either Resolve or EMReady (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2023</xref>)⁠.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry</title><p>CX-MS was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, the CtRoco concentration was adjusted to 8 µM in storage buffer. GTPγS-bound CtRoco was crosslinked with DSSO at a molar ratio of 1:50 (protein: crosslinker). In addition, GTPγS-bound CtRoco was mixed with either Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>, Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> or both in a molar ratio 1:5 (CtRoco:Nb) before DSSO crosslinking (molar ratio 1:50). The reaction was carried on for 30 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 10 µl of 1 M Tris at pH 7.5. Proteins were precipitated by chloroform/methanol and subjected to tryptic proteolysis. The tryptic peptide solutions were cleaned up by C18-StageTips (Thermo Fisher) and the volume was reduced to approximately 10 µl in a SpeedVac. 40 µl SEC buffer (30% [vol/vol] acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) was added to the desalted peptides. The entire volume of 50 µl was loaded onto the SEC column (Superdex Peptide column 3.2/300; Cytiva), which was mounted to an Äkta pure system (Cytiva) and equilibrated in SEC buffer. SEC was performed at a flow rate of 50 µl/min. The eluates were collected in 100 µl fractions. Vacuum-dried fractions (remaining volume of 2 µl to avoid complete dryness) containing the crosslinked peptides, were redissolved in a total volume of 10 µl 0.5% TFA, and analyzed individually on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) using the MS2_MS3 fragmentation method with the default settings (version 3.4, build 3072). MS1 scans were performed in the Orbitrap (FTMS, resolution = 60K) at an m/z range of 375–1500. MS2 was performed with CID (CE = 25%) and spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (FTMS) at 30K resolution. The MS3 scans were performed with HCD (CE = 30%) and spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap. Resulting Thermo Raw files were analyzed with the MS2_MS3 workflow provided by in Proteome Discoverer 2.5 (build 2.5.0.400) using XlinkX (version 2.5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence anisotropy titrations</title><p>The affinity of Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>, Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>, and Nb<sub>R2-R1</sub> for CtRoco was determined using fluorescence anisotropy titrations, Nbs were labeled at their C-terminus with a FITC fluorophore using Sortase A-mediated labeling, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leemans et al., 2020</xref>). Fluorescence anisotropy titrations with FITC-labeled Nbs and CtRoco were performed at 25°C using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Agilent) equipped with polarizers and temperature control, at an excitation wavelength of 493 nm and emission wavelength of 516 nm. 50 nM FITC-labeled Nb was titrated with increasing amounts of CtRoco. The anisotropy signal was measured after a 2 min incubation period for each titration. All experiments were performed in triplicate. To obtain <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values (± standard error), the data were fitted using the quadratic binding equation in GraphPad Prism 7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-turnover kinetics</title><p>GTP hydrolysis rates were calculated under single-turnover conditions. 5 μM of CtRoco-L487A was incubated with 5 μM of GTP in the presence of 100 μM of the Nb of interest at 25°C. Samples were taken at different time points ranging from 0 to 180 min and the reaction was stopped by incubation at 95°C for 3 min. Samples were mixed with the same volume of HPLC buffer and 50 µl was injected on a reversed-phase C18 column (Phenomenex, Jupiter 5 mm) attached to an Alliance e2695 HPLC (Waters) using 100 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 6.4, 10 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide, 7.5% acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The 254 nm absorption peaks of GDP were converted to concentrations by using a standard curve, and GDP concentrations were plotted in function of time. All experiments were performed in triplicate and data were fitted on single-exponential equation using GraphPad Prism 7.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94503-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Cryo-EM Density maps and structure coordinates have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with accession codes EMD-18884 and PDB 8R4B for the composite map and structure of CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub>, EMD-18885 and PDB 8R4C for the LRR-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> focused map and structure, EMD-18886 and PDB 8R4D for the Roc-COR-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> focused map and structure, EMD-18882 for the low resolution full CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub>-Nb<sub>Roco2</sub> map, and EMD-18879 for the CtRoco-Nb<sub>Roco1</sub> map.

This helix, which was previously suggested to be an important element in the activation of LRRK2 (Kalogeropulou et al., 2022), is located at the interface of the Roc and CORB domains and harbors the residues H554 and Y558, orthologous to the LRRK2 PD mutation sites N1337 and R1441, respectively.&quot; It is not surprising the a3-helix of the ROC domain only has small changes when the ROC domain is aligned (Figure 2E). However, in the study by Zhu et al (DOI: 10.1126/science.adi9926), it was shown that a3-helix has a &quot;see-saw&quot; motion when the COR-B domain is aligned.

Residues H554 and Y558 are located on the Roc a3 helix, which was previously suggested to be an important element in the activation of LRRK2 (Kalogeropulou et al., 2022). Indeed, while the orientation of the a3 helix with respect to the rest of the Roc domain only undergoes small changes upon GTPgS binding, it can be observed that this helix undergoes a “seesaw-like” movement with respect to the CORB domain.

This flexibility is crucial for protein function, but obviously hampers structure resolution. Forced experiments to reduce flexibility may allow better structure resolution, but at the same time may impede the activation cycle. Therefore, careful experiments and interpretation are very critical for this type of work. This especially relates to the influence of the nanobodies on the structure that may not occur during the &quot;normal&quot; monomerdimer activation cycle in the absence of the nanobodies (see also point 2). So what is the evidence that the nanobody-bound GTPyS-bound state is biochemically a reliable representative of the &quot;normal&quot; GTP-bound state in the absence of nanobodies, and therefore the obtained structure can be confidentially used to interpret the activation mechanism as done in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>See below for an answer to remark 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The obtained structure with two nanobodies reveals that the nanobodies NbRoco1 and NbRoco2 bind to parts of the protein by which a dimer is impossible, respectively to a0helix of the linker between Roc-COR and LRR, and to the cavity of the LRR that in the dimer binds to the dimerizing domain CORB. It is likely the open monomer GTP-bound structure is recognized by the nanobodies in the camelid, suggesting that overall the open monomer structure is a true GTP-bound state. However, it is also likely that the binding energy of the nanobody is used to stabilize the monomer structure. It is not automatically obvious that in the details the obtained nonobody-Roco-GTPyS structure will be identical to the &quot;normal&quot; Roco-GTPyS structure. What is the influence of nanobody-binding on the conformation of the domains where they bind; the binding energy may be used to stabilize a conformation that is not present in the absence of the nanobody. For instance, NbRoco1 binds to the a0 helix of the linker; what is here the &quot;normal&quot; active state of the Roco protein, and is e.g. the angle between RocCOR and LRR also rotated by 135 degrees? Furthermore, nanobody NbRoco2 in the LRR domain is expected to stabilize the LRR domain; it may allow a position of the LRR domain relative to the rest of the protein that is not present without nanobody in the LRR domain. I am convinced that the observed open structure is a correct representation of the active state, but many important details have to be supported by e,g, their CX-MS experiments, and in the end probably need confirmation by more structures of other active Roco proteins or confirmation by a more dynamic sampling of the active states by e.g. molecular dynamics or NMR.</p></disp-quote><p>Recently, nanobodies have increasingly been used successfully to obtain structural insights in protein conformational states (reviewed in Uchański et al, Curr. Opin. Struc. Biol. 2020). As reviewer # 2 points out, the concern is sometimes raised that antibodies could distort a protein into non-native conformations. Here, it is important to note that the nanobodies were raised by immunizing a llama with the fully native CtRoco protein bound to a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, after which the nanobodies were selected by phage display using the same fully native and functional form of the protein. As clearly explained in Manglik et al. Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol. 2017, the probability of an in vivo matured nanobody inducing a non-native conformation of the antigen is low, although it is possible that it selects a high-energy, low-population conformation of a dynamic protein. Immature B cells require engagement of displayed antibodies with antigen to proliferate and differentiate during clonal selection. Antibodies that induce non-native conformations of the antigen pay a substantial energetic penalty in this process, and B cell clones displaying such antibodies will have a significantly lower probability of proliferation and differentiation into mature antibody-secreting B lymphocytes. Hence, many recent experiments and observation give credence to the notion that nanobodies bind antigens primarily by conformational selection and not induced fit (e.g. Smirnova et al. PNAS 2015).</p><p>Extrapolated to the case of CtRoco, which is clearly very flexible in its GTP-bound form, this means that the nanobodies are able to trap and stabilize one conformational state that is representative of the “active state” ensemble of the protein. In this respect, it is clear from our experiments (XL-MS, affinity and effect on GTPase activity) that the effects of NbRoco1 and NbRoco2 are additive (or even cooperative), meaning that both nanobodies recognize different features of the same CtRoco “active state”. Correspondingly, the monomeric, elongated “open” conformation is also observed in the structure of CtRoco bound to NbRoco1 only (Figure1 - supplement 2), albeit that this structure still displays more flexibility. The monomerization and conformational changes that we observe and describe in the current paper at high resolution are also in very good agreement with earlier observations for CtRoco in the GTP-bound form in absence of any nanobodies, including negative stain EM (Deyaert et al. Nature Commun, 2017), hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments (Deyaert et al. Biochem. J. 2019) and native MS (Leemans et al. Biochem J. 2020).</p><p>In the revised manuscript we added the following text to the discussion:</p><p>“To decrease this flexibility, we have now used two previously developed conformationspecific nanobodies (NbRoco1 and NbRoco2) to stabilize the protein in the GTP-state (Leemans et al., 2020), allowing us to solve its structure using cryo-EM (Figure 1). Recently, Nbs have successfully been used to obtain structural insights in the conformational states of a number of highly dynamic proteins (Uchański et al, 2020). These studies established that Nbs bind antigens primarily by conformational selection rather than by induced fit (Manglik et al., 2017; Smirnova et al.,2015). Since NbRoco1 and NbRoco2 were generated by immunization with fully native CtRoco bound to a nonhydrolysable GTP analogue, and subsequently selected by phase display using the same functional protein, it is thus safe to assume that these Nbs bind to and stabilize a relevant conformation that is present within the “active” CtRoco conformational space (Leemans et al., 2020). Moreover, our current structures are also in very good agreement with previous biochemical studies and data from HDX-MS and negative stain EM (Deyaert et al., 2019; Deyaert, Wauters, et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2C: please label the residues with meshes (switch 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Labels have been added to figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A supplemental figure for the following statement will be helpful &quot;A remarkable feature of the CtRoco dimer structure was the dimer-stabilized orientation of the P-loop, which would hamper direct nucleotide binding on the dimer.

An example is found mid-page 8: &quot;A final important observation in the Roc domain concerns the very C-terminal part of Switch 2 (residues 520 to 533), which could not be modeled in our GTP bound structure due to flexibility, while in the nucleotide-free dimer structure this region is structured and located at the interface of the Roc domain with the LRR-Roc linker and CORA.&quot; As written there must be a reference to experiments showing the &quot;due to flexibility&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that additional factors might affect the interpretability of the map, such as the small size of the regions used for the focused refinements (around 50 kDa each) or a preferential distribution of orientation of the particles in the grid. Particle distribution plots are now shown in Figure 1 – Figure supplements 1 and 2. However, due to the intrinsic flexible nature of the Switch 1 and Switch 2 regions, we assume this flexibility to be the major cause of lack of features in the EM maps, especially since some of the neighboring regions display well-resolved maps.</p><p>Nevertheless, in the manuscript we reworded our statements to be more careful.
