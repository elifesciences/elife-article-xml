drive resistance to MET-directed treatments. Determining the most effective inhibitor for each mutational profile is a major challenge for MET-driven cancer treatment in precision medicine. Here, we used a deep mutational scan (DMS) of ~5764 MET kinase domain variants to profile the growth of each mutation against a panel of 11 inhibitors that are reported to target the MET kinase domain. We validate previously identified resistance mutations, pinpoint common resistance sites across type I, type II, and type I ½ inhibitors, unveil unique resistance and sensitizing mutations for each inhibitor, and verify non-cross-resistant sensitivities for type I and type II inhibitor pairs. We augment a protein language model with biophysical and chemical features to improve the predictive performance for inhibitor-treated datasets. Together, our study demonstrates a pooled experimental pipeline for identifying resistance mutations, provides a reference dictionary for mutations that are sensitized to specific therapies, and offers insights for future drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA239604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collisson</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jura</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coyote-Maestas</surname><given-names>Willow</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM013434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capra</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM145238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A deep mutational scan of MET kinase domain variants reveals resistance and sensitizing mutations for 11 inhibitors, providing a mutation-specific reference for precision therapies and drug development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) are critical signaling molecules that activate and regulate cellular pathways. Disruption of typical RTK regulatory mechanisms through point mutations, gene amplification, protein fusions, or autocrine loops can drive the development, maintenance, and spread of cancers. Small molecule inhibitors are designed to disrupt aberrant signaling cascades by selectively targeting the kinase domain, with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like imatinib showing durable treatment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwood et al., 2021</xref>). Inhibitors are generally designed against either a wild-type kinase or a specific mutational profile, yet acquired mutations can alter sensitivity to different inhibitors and undermine efficacy. The most extreme case of this is resistance, which emerges in the treatment of many cancers by TKI selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwood et al., 2021</xref>). These mutations may act by altering kinase stability, expression, conformation, or activity of the target kinase. Although several recurrent mutations at inhibitor-interacting positions have predictable resistance, specific and rare resistance mutations can be associated with the interactions or conformations unique to certain inhibitors.</p><p>An attractive strategy to counter resistance is optimizing the interactions that differ between inhibitors. Small-molecule kinase inhibitors fall into four distinct groups, characterized by their binding modality to the ATP pocket and conformational preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zuccotto et al., 2010</xref>). Among these groups, three are ATP-competitive: type I, type II, and type I½ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Type I inhibitors occupy the adenosine binding pocket, form hydrogen bonds with ‘hinge’ region residues, and favor an active conformation. Type II inhibitors also occupy the adenosine pocket but extend into an opening in the R-spine that is accessible in an inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Type I½ inhibitors combine features from both type I and type II inhibitors, engaging with both the adenosine pocket and the R-spine pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Finally, type III inhibitors are allosteric, non-ATP competitive inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the chemical interaction differences and conformational preferences among TKI groups for distinct kinase states, a general approach to combating resistance is sequential treatment of type I and II inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Recondo et al., 2020a</xref>). However, without understanding the potential sensitivity of an acquired resistance mutation to the subsequent inhibitor, the efficacy of such strategies is not guaranteed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MET kinase inhibitor types and resistance mutations screened against a nearly comprehensive library of kinase domain substitutions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structure of the ATP-bound MET kinase domain (3DKC) overlaid with type Ia (crizotinib, 2WGJ), type Ib (savolitinib, 6SDE), type II (merestinib, 4EEV), type I½ (AMG-458, 5T3Q), and type III inhibitors (tivantinib, 3RHK).

The challenge of acquired resistance following MET inhibitor therapy has been approached with strategies including sequential treatment of type I and type II TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Recondo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahcall et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2021</xref>), and combination therapy with type I and type II TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahcall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fernandes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smyth et al., 2014</xref>). However, without extensive documentation of the behavior of resistance and sensitizing mutations in MET towards specific TKIs, there remains a barrier towards leveraging inhibitors for specific mutational responses, optimizing inhibitor pairings, and informing rational drug design. Thousands of compounds have been screened against the MET kinase domain, and while several have undergone clinical trials, currently four MET inhibitors have received FDA approval: crizotinib, cabozantinib, tepotinib, and capmatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Santarpia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang and Lu, 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance not only limits the efficacy of these drugs but also poses challenges for second-line therapeutic strategies, particularly in the context of rare and novel mutations.</p><p>Previously, we used deep mutational scanning (DMS), a pooled cellular selection experiment, to massively screen a library of nearly all possible MET kinase domain mutations.

Mutations to the hinge position, Y1159, and C-spine residues, including M1211 and V1092, introduce charge or are predicted to change the conformation of the pocket to clash with crizotinib but not ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Outside of direct drug-protein interactions, positions I1084, T1261, Y1093, and G1242 displayed the largest resistance signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Structurally, I1084 is located in β1 at the roof of the ATP-binding pocket, and a mutation to His clashes with crizotinib’s hinge-binding and solvent-front moieties without interfering with bound-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Y1093 is also at the roof of the ATP-binding site, residing in β2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, its structural influence on resistance is unobvious. In all rotameric states, the R-group of Y1093 points away from the catalytic site and does not clash with crizotinib. We speculate that Y1093 mutations may negatively impact crizotinib’s stability in the catalytic site compared to ATP, as ATP’s triphosphate group is stabilized by the P-loop. Therefore, comparing crizotinib to DMSO highlights both known hotspots and rarer sites like I1084 and Y1093, which may contribute to resistance through conformational changes rather than disrupting direct inhibitor-protein contacts. Individual inhibitor resistance landscapes also aid in identifying target residues for novel drug design by providing insights into mutability and known resistance cases. This enables the selection of vectors for chemical elaboration with a potential lower risk of resistance development. Sites with mutational profiles such as R1086 and C1091, located in the common drug target P-loop of MET, could be likely candidates for crizotinib.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Resistance mutations identified for type I, type II, and type I ½ inhibitors</title><p>To assess the agreement between our DMS and previously annotated resistance mutations, we compiled a list of reported resistance mutations from recent clinical and experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pecci et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahcall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Recondo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rotow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fujino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

This specificity can be rationalized based on the role of Y1230 in stabilizing inhibitors through pi-stacking interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cui, 2014</xref>).

For example, I1084 is enriched as a resistance site for type I inhibitors, consistent with previous studies in hereditary papillary renal cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Guérin et al., 2023</xref>). I1084 is located at the solvent front of the phosphate-loop (P-loop) of the kinase N-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is responsible for stabilization of the ATP phosphate groups. This region of the kinase is leveraged for interactions with type I, but not type II inhibitors.

By statistically filtering mutations that are categorized as gain-of-function in one inhibitor, but loss-of-function in the other, a set of 44 mutations were identified as having crizotinib resistance and cabozantinib sensitivity, and 3 mutations with the opposite profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Structural mapping of divergent mutations further revealed enrichment at the N-lobe and typical protein-drug interaction sites like Y1230, G1163, and M1211 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). While these positions have precedence for resistance, as previously noted, they are also resistance hotspots across all inhibitor types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), where even mutations with differential sensitivities may be insufficient targets to counteract the reemergence of resistance, thus limiting the interchangeability of drugs.</p><p>Understanding which mutations have resistance profiles for only type I or type II inhibitors provides better leverage for sequential and combination dosing. To identify such mutations across our dataset, we further filtered variants that met our resistance metrics and were only observed for inhibitors of the same type. In again comparing crizotinib to cabozantinib, Y1093K was a mutation with one of the largest differences between crizotinib and cabozantinib, having a gain-of-function profile for crizotinib and loss-of-function for cabozantinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, Y1093 is located in β2 of the N-lobe, at the roof of the ATP-binding site, and does not directly engage with crizotinib. We speculate this mutation potentially contributes to resistance by perturbing the packing of β1-β2 and altering the conformation of the ATP binding site in a manner that destabilizes crizotinib binding. When comparing the dose-response of Y1093K to the wild-type TPR-MET kinase domain, Y1093K shows a nearly 10-fold shift in crizotinib sensitivity with no difference in cabozantinib sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In identifying mutations with the opposite profiles, resistance to cabozantinib and sensitivity to crizotinib, L1195M displayed the greatest differential scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). L1195 is an ⍺E-helix position with previously recorded resistance (L1195V/F), which our analysis further supports as a type II-only resistance hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Structurally, mutations like Met or Phe at 1195 clash with the fluorophenyl moiety of cabozantinib used to access and stabilize a deep, back pocket of the kinase in an inactive conformation, unlike crizotinib which occupies the solvent front and adenosine binding region of the ATP binding site. In comparing the dose-response of L1195M to the wild-type TPR-MET kinase domain, we find that L1195M is refractory to all concentrations of cabozantinib tested, but still sensitive to crizotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Beyond a type I and type II pairing, such cross-resistance identification can be further applied to identify differential sensitivities within an inhibitor group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), which can further expand opportunities for inhibitor-specific sensitivity in therapy and drug design.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Identification of biophysical contributors to inhibitor-specific fitness landscapes using machine learning</title><p>Machine learning models originally developed for predicting protein structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rives et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2023</xref> have been adapted for predicting protein-ligand complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryant et al., 2023</xref>), and predicting fitness values from DMS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, protein language models have shown the ability to estimate the functional effects of sequence variants in correlation with DMS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rives et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandes et al., 2023</xref>). We observed that ESM-1b, a protein language model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rives et al., 2021</xref>), predicts the fitness of variants in the untreated/DMSO condition (correlation 0.50) much better than it does for the inhibitor treated datasets (correlation 0.28). This difference in predictive ability is likely because the language model is trained on sequences in the evolutionary record and fitness in the presence of inhibitors does not reflect a pressure that has operated on evolutionary timescales.</p><p>To overcome this limitation and improve the predictive properties of the ESM approach, we sought to augment the model with additional features that reflect the interactions between protein and inhibitors that are not present in the evolutionary record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Guestrin, 2016</xref>). While our features can account for some changes in MET-mutant conformation and altered inhibitor binding pose, the prediction of these aspects can likely be improved with new methods. There are several challenges associated with this task, including the narrow sequence space explored, high correlations between datasets, and the limited chemical space explored by the 11 inhibitors. We used an XGBoost regressor framework and designed a test-train-validation strategy to account for these issues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), exploring many features representing conformation, stability, inhibitor-mutation distance, and inhibitor chemical information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid overfitting, we introduced several constraints on the monotonicity and the precision of certain features. The final model uses a subset of the features we tested and improves the performance from 0.28 to 0.37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). The model primarily improves the correlation by shifting the distribution of predicted fitness values to center around drug sensitivity, reflecting the pressures that are not accounted for by ESM-1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

For some mutations, as in Y1230D, we observe a gradual improvement in prediction for each set of features, suggesting that resistance relies on multiple factors. For other mutations, such as N1167K, we see a single set of features driving the improvement, which suggests much more dominant driving forces. Lastly, in other mutations, like G1290D, the models trained with different features can over or under predict the true value, demonstrating the value of combining features together. The reliance on simple features helps identify some of the major factors in drug resistance and sensitization such as distance to the inhibitor and active/inactive conformation; however, improved feature engineering and coverage of both sequence and chemical space will likely be needed to create a more interpretable model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of many diseases, but the development of resistance creates a significant challenge for long term efficacy. Many strategies, including sequential dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Recondo et al., 2020a</xref>), are being explored to overcome resistance. Our DMS of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase domain, performed against a panel of varying inhibitors offers a framework for experimentally identifying resistance and sensitizing mutations in an activated kinase context for different inhibitors. By massively screening the effect of a nearly comprehensive library of amino acid mutations in the MET kinase domain against 11 inhibitors, some generalizable patterns emerged. In concordance with the binding mode of both type I and II inhibitors, residues that commonly confer resistance, or act as ‘hotspots’, were mapped to previously reported sites like D1228, Y1230, M1211, G1163 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and novel sites like I1084, L1140, L1142, T1261, and L1272 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Annotation of hotspots also offers an opportunity to inform inhibitor selection based on likelihood of cross-inhibitor resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For instance, I1084 is a hotspot for type I and II inhibitors within our study that displayed wild-type sensitivity to the type I½ inhibitor screened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Understanding positions with high resistance frequencies that are distal from the ATP-binding site also offers a design opportunity for allosteric inhibitors that can target cancer-associated and resistance-associated regions within the N- and C-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mingione et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, similar to its ability in identifying resistance for inhibitors, our parallel DMS also demonstrated the ability to detect non-selective drugs, with the example of tivantinib. Despite being a proposed MET-selective inhibitor, like several others, tivantinib failed clinical trials, and follow-up studies suggested cytotoxicity and off-target binding as the culprit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Michieli and Di Nicolantonio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basilico et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katayama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fujino et al., 2019</xref>) - a scenario that is not uncommon to antitumor drugs that do not advance to the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). To this effect, the ability of DMS to differentiate between selective compounds provides a unique prospect for developing inverse structure-activity relationships, whereby varying protein sequence both inhibitor specificity and resistance can be learned.</p><p>Reported cancer mutations in databases such as OncoKB or cBioPortal are useful for patient data and cancer type reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suehnholz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakravarty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>). A recent analysis of these databases aided in annotation of mutations observed within patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pecci et al., 2024</xref>). This study used pre-clinical models to examine a subset of these mutations and identified sensitivities to multiple inhibitors and confirmed clinical responses of two rare driver mutations (H1094Y and F1200I) to elzovantinib, a type Ib inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pecci et al., 2024</xref>). Their results are consistent with the predictions of our DMS, illustrating the potential value of having a broad dictionary of inhibitor sensitivity and resistance patterns.</p><p>Finally, a significant challenge of inhibitor screening is the considerable time and cost involved, even at high-throughput. While docking has accelerated the prioritization of compounds for protein targeting and screening in silico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sadybekov and Katritch, 2023</xref>), prediction of drug resistance is of high interest in informing iterative drug design. Screening for resistance in the early stages of drug design is particularly useful for obtaining inhibitors that can be effective in the long-term by optimizing protein-inhibitor interactions in the wildtype and functionally silent mutant context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pisa and Kapoor, 2020</xref>). While base-editor approaches can rapidly screen for inhibitor resistance mutations within full-length, endogenous genes, undersampling of rare variants due to lower coverage is a significant caveat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dorighi et al., 2024</xref>), compared to DMS where nearly full coverage is achieved and controlled. A full landscape of mutational effects can help to predict drug response and guide small molecule design to counteract acquired resistance. The ability to define molecular mechanisms towards that goal will likely require more purposefully chosen chemical inhibitors and combinatorial mutational libraries to be maximally informative. The ideas motivating our ML-model, which combines protein language models and biophysical/chemical features, to novel inhibitors could eventually be used to profile resistance and sensitivity for novel and unscreened small molecules, greatly extending the scale of kinase inhibitor repositioning for second-line therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mammalian cell culturing</title><p>Ba/F3 cells (DSMZ) were maintained and passaged in 90% RPMI (Gibco), 10% HI-FBS (Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 10 ng/ml IL-3 (Fisher), and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The concentrated virus was titered in Ba/F3 to determine the proper volume for a transduction MOI of 0.1–0.3. The viral titer was calculated from the percent of fluorescent cells and viral dilution.

Each batch of cells were grown to a density of 72 million cells to be split into 12 dishes (15 cm) for each selection condition.

Immediately after gDNA was isolated, 5 μg of gDNA was used for PCR amplification of the target MET KD gene to achieve the proper variant coverage. A 150 μl PCR master mix was prepared for each sample using the TakaraBio PrimeStar GXL system according to the following recipe: 30 μl 5 X PrimeStar GXL buffer, 4.5 μl 10 μM forward primer (0.3 μM final), 4.5 μl 10 μM reverse primer (0.3 μM final), 5 μg gDNA, 12 μl 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 mM each NTP), 6 μl GXL polymerase, nuclease free water to a final reaction volume of 150 μL. The PCR master mix for each sample was split into three PCR tubes with 50 μl volumes for each condition and amplified with the following thermocycler parameters: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, followed by 24 x cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 60 °C for 15 s, extension at 68 °C for 14 s, and a final extension at 68 °C for 1 min.</p><p>PCR samples were stored at –20 °C until all time points and replicates were harvested and amplified, so as to prepare all final samples for NGS together with the same handling and sequence them in the same pool to prevent sequencing bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Library preparation and next-generation sequencing</title><p>After all time points were selected, harvested, and PCR amplified, the target gene amplicon was isolated from gDNA by gel purification (Zymo), for a total of 222 samples.

For example, in an ideal experiment, if the wild-type cell doubling rate is 2 and its score is 0 by wild-type normalization, a score of –2 means that the cells are not growing (2^(2-2)) and a score of 1 means that the cells are doubling three times (increasing to 2^(2+1) times the original count) between every contiguous time point.</p><p>The input to Rosace is the filtered count files provided by the AnalyzeSaturationMutagenesis tool described in the above section. From here, we filtered variants by the mean count (≥ 4) and the proportion of 0 count across replicates and time points (≤ 10/12) and before inhibitor selection at T0 (≤ 2/3). Second, we normalized the counts using wild-type normalization with log2 transformation rather than the default natural log transformation to maintain the doubling rate scale. Finally, the normalized count is regressed on time intervals (t = {1, 2, 3, 4}) instead of the entire time span (t = {1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4}) so that the resulting score reflects the growth rate between every contiguous time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Statistical filtering and resistance classification</title><p>In mathematical terms, we define the raw Rosace fitness scores of a mutation in DMSO as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and in a specific inhibitor condition as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Model performance was evaluated using Pearson’s R and mean squared error (MSE).</p><p>Experimental fitness scores of MET variants in the presence of DMSO and AMG458 were ignored in model training and testing since having just one set of data for a type I ½ inhibitor and DMSO leads to learning by simply memorizing the inhibitor type, without generalizability. The remaining dataset was split into training and test sets to further avoid overfitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The following data points were held out for testing - (a) all mutations in the presence of one type I (crizotinib) and one type II (glesatinib analog) inhibitor, (b) 20% of randomly chosen positions (columns) and (c) all mutations in two randomly selected amino acids (rows; e.g. all mutations to Phe, Ser). After splitting the dataset into train and test sets, the train set was used for XGBoost hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. For tuning the hyperparameters of each of the XGBoost models, we held out 20% of randomly sampled data points in the training set and used the remaining 80% data for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization of the models with Optuna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiba et al., 2019</xref>), with an objective to minimize the mean squared error between the fitness predictions on 20% held out split and the corresponding experimental fitness scores. The following hyperparameters were sampled and tuned: type of booster (booster - gbtree or dart), maximum tree depth (max_depth), number of trees (n_estimators), learning rate (eta), minimum leaf split loss (gamma), subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree (colsample_bytree), L1 and L2 regularization terms (alpha and beta) and tree growth policy (grow_policy - depthwise or lossguide). After identifying the best combination of hyperparameters for each of the models, we performed 10-fold cross validation (with re-sampling) of the models on the full training set. The training set consists of data points corresponding to 230 positions and 18 amino acids. We split these into 10 parts such that each part corresponds to data from 23 positions and 2 amino acids. Then, at each of 10 iterations of cross-validation, models were trained on 9 of 10 parts (207 positions and 16 amino acids) and evaluated on the 1 held out part (23 positions and 2 amino acids). Through this protocol we ensure that we evaluate performance of the models with different subsets of positions and amino acids. The average Pearson correlation and mean squared error of the models from these 10 iterations were calculated and the best performing model out of 8192 models was chosen as the one with the highest cross-validation correlation. The final XGBoost models were obtained by training on the full training set and also used to obtain the fitness score predictions for the validation and test sets. These predictions were used to calculate the inhibitor-wise correlations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Kinase domain structural analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all structural analysis was performed on PyMOL. Structural mapping incorporated tools from the Bio3D bioinformatics package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grant et al., 2006</xref>). Inhibitors that lacked an experimental crystal structure were docked into a representative type I (2WGJ) or type II (4EEV) structure with AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eberhardt et al., 2021</xref>). Existing ligands in both the structures were removed in silico and the proteins prepared for docking using AutoDockTools by adding polar hydrogens and Kollman charges. The inhibitors were also prepared using AutoDockTools by adding polar hydrogens and charges and identifying rotatable torsions. A grid box which dictates the search space for the docking tool was defined approximately around the region where the existing ligands in 2WGJ and 4EEV were bound. The energy range and exhaustiveness of docking was set to 3 and 8, respectively. AutoDock Vina was made to output 5 modes for each ligand. Capmatenib and glumetinib (type I inhibitors) were docked on to 2WGJ and glesatinib analog and cabozantinib (type II inhibitors) were docked on to 4EEV.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Consultant at IHP Therapeutics, Valar Labs, Tatara Therapeutics and Pear Diagnostics, reports receiving commercial research grants from Pfizer, and has stock ownership in Tatara Therapeutics, HDT Bio, Clara Health, Aqtual, and Guardant Health</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>A founder of Rezo Therapeutics and a shareholder of Rezo Therapeutics, Sudo Therapeutics, and type6 Therapeutic; is a SAB member of Sudo Therapeutics, type6 Therapeutic and NIBR Oncology; the Jura laboratory has received sponsored research support from Genentech, Rezo Therapeutics and type6 Therapeutics</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>A consultant for, has equity in, and receives research support from Relay Therapeutics and is a consultant for Octant Bio</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-101882-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The sequencing data has been deposited at the NCBI SRA (BioProject PRJNA1136906).

The goal is to identify inhibitor combinations with the lowest overlap in their sensitivity to resistant mutations and determine if certain resistance mutations/mechanisms are more prevalent for specific modes of ATP-binding site engagement. To achieve this, the authors measured the ability of ~6000 single mutants of MET's kinase domain (in the context of a cytosolic TPR fusion) to drive IL-3-independent proliferation (used as a proxy for activity) of Ba/F3 cells (deep mutational profiling) in the presence of 11 different inhibitors. The authors then used co-crystal and docked structures of inhibitor-bound MET complexes to define the mechanistic basis of resistance and applied a protein language model to develop a predictive model of inhibitor sensitivity/resistance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strengths of this manuscript are the comprehensive nature of the study and the rigorous methods used to measure the sensitivity of ~6000 MET mutants in a pooled format. The dataset generated will be a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding kinase inhibitor sensitivity and, more broadly, small molecule ligand/protein interactions. The structural analyses are systematic and comprehensive, providing interesting insights into resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, the use of machine learning to define inhibitor-specific fitness landscapes is a valuable addition to the narrative. Although the ESM1b protein language model is only moderately successful in identifying the underlying mechanistic basis of resistance, the authors' attempt to integrate systematic sequence/function datasets with machine learning serves as a foundation for future efforts.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main limitation of this study is that the authors' efforts to define general mechanisms between inhibitor classes were only moderately successful due to the challenge of uncoupling inhibitor-specific interaction effects from more general mechanisms related to the mode of ATP-binding site engagement. However, this is a minor limitation that only minimally detracts from the impressive overall scope of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101882.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript 'Mapping kinase domain resistance mechanisms for the MET receptor tyrosine kinase via deep mutational scanning' by Estevam et al, deep mutational scanning is used to assess the impact of ~5,764 mutants in the MET kinase domain on the binding of 11 inhibitors. Analyses were divided by individual inhibitor and kinase inhibitor subtype (I,II, I 1/2, and III). While a number of mutants were consistent with previous clinical reports, novel potential resistance mutants were also described. This study has implications for the development of combination therapies, namely which combination of inhibitors to avoid based on overlapping resistance mutant profiles. While one suggested pair of inhibitors with least overlapping resistance mutation profiles was suggested, this manuscript presents a proof of concept toward a more systematic approach for improved selection of combination therapeutics. Furthermore, in a final part of this manuscript the data was used to train a machine learning model, the ESM-1b protein language model augmented with an XG Boost Regressor framework, and found that they could improve predictions of resistance mutations above the initial ESM-1b model.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall this paper is a tour-de-force of data collection and analysis to establish a more systematic approach for the design of combination therapies, especially in targeting MET and other kinases, a family of proteins significant to therapeutic intervention for a variety of diseases. The presentation of the work is mostly concise and clear with thousands of data points presented neatly and clearly. The discovery of novel resistance mutants for individual MET inhibitors, kinase inhibitor subtypes within the context of MET, and all resistance mutants across inhibitor subtypes for MET has clinical relevance. However, probably the most promising outcome of this paper is the proposal of the inhibitor combination of Crizotinib and Cabozantib as Type I and Type II inhibitors, respectively, with the least overlapping resistance mutation profiles and therefore potentially the most successful combination therapy for MET. While this specific combination is not necessarily the point, it illustrates a compelling systematic approach for deciding how to proceed in developing combination therapy schedules for kinases. In an insightful final section of this paper, the authors approach using their data to train a machine learning model, perhaps understanding that performing these experiments for every kinase for every inhibitor could be prohibitive to applying this method in practice.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This paper presents a clear set of experiments with a compelling justification. The content of the paper is overall of high quality. Below are mostly regarding clarifications in presentation.</p><p>Two places could use more computational experiments and analysis, however. Both are presented as suggestions, but at least a discussion of these topics would improve the overall relevance of this work. In the first case it seems that while the analyses conducted on this dataset were chosen with care to be the most relevant to human health, further analyses of these results and their implications of our understanding of allosteric interactions and their effects on inhibitor binding would be a relevant addition. For example, for any given residue type found to be a resistance mutant are there consistent amino acid mutations to which a large or small or effect is found. For example is a mutation from alanine to phenylalanine always deleterious, though one can assume the exact location of a residue matters significantly. Some of this analysis is done in dividing resistance mutants by those that are near the inhibitor binding site and those that aren't, but more of these types of analyses could help the reader understand the large amount of data presented here. A mention at least of the existing literature in this area and the lack or presence of trends would be worthwhile. For example, is there any correlation with a simpler metric like the Grantham score to predict effects of mutations (in a way the ESM-1b model is a better version of this, so this is somewhat implicitly discussed).</p><p>Indeed, this discussion relates to the second point this manuscript could improve upon: the machine learning section. The main actionable item here is that this results section seems the least polished and could do a better job describing what was done. In the figure it looks like results for certain inhibitors were held out as test data - was this all mutants for a single inhibitor, or some other scheme? Overall I think the implications of this section could be fleshed out, potentially with more experiments. As mentioned in the 'Strengths' section, one of the appealing aspects of this paper is indeed its potential wide applicability across kinases -- could you use this ML model to predict resistance mutants for an entirely different kinase? This doesn't seem far-fetched, and would be an extremely compelling addition to this paper to prove the value of this approach.</p><p>Another area in which this paper could improve its clarity is in the description of caveats of the assay. The exact math used to define resistance mutants and its dependence on the DMSO control is interesting, it is worth discussing where the failure modes of this procedure might be. Could it be that the resistance mutants identified in this assay would differ significantly from those found in patients? That results here are consistent with those seen in the clinic is promising, but discrepancies could remain. Furthermore a more in depth discussion of the MetdelEx14 results is warranted. For example, why is the DMSO signature in Figure 1 - supplement 4 so different from that of Figure 1? And finally, there is a lot of emphasis put on the unexpected results of this assay for the tivantinib &quot;type III&quot; inhibitor - could this in fact be because the molecule &quot;is highly selective for the inactive or unphosphorylated form of c-Met&quot; according to Eathiraj et al JBC 2011? These points are addressed in previous work (Estevam et al 2024) or in the detailed methods section, but are not obvious in the main text of the paper.</p><p>This paper is crisply written with beautiful figures, and the complexity of the data is easy to understand from an in depth discussion of the mutants that have been previously reported.</p><p>Finally, the potential impacts and follow-ups of this excellent study could be used as a resource for the community both as a dataset and as a proof of concept. It is exciting that his approach can be altered and/or improved in the future to facilitate the general application of this approach for combination therapies and the understanding of mechanism for other targets.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Thank you for your additions and changes - they have improved the quality of this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101882.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Estevam</surname><given-names>Gabriella O</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Linossi</surname><given-names>Edmond</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Jingyou</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCLA</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Macdonald</surname><given-names>Christian B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ravikumar</surname><given-names>Ashraya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chrispens</surname><given-names>Karson M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCSF</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Capra</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Coyote-Maestas</surname><given-names>Willow</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pimentel</surname><given-names>Harold</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCLA</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Collisson</surname><given-names>Eric A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jura</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors present a cornucopia of data generated using deep mutational scanning (DMS) of variants in MET kinase, a protein target implicated in many different forms of cancer. The authors conducted a heroic amount of deep mutational scanning, using computational structural models to augment the interpretation of their DMS findings.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This powerful combination of computational models, experimental structures in the literature, dose-response curves, and DMS enables them to identify resistance and sensitizing mutations in the MET kinase domain, as well as consider inhibitors in the context of the clinically relevant exon-14 deletion. They then try to use the existing language model ESM1b augmented by an XGBoost regressor to identify key biophysical drivers of fitness. The authors provide an incredible study that has a treasure trove of data on a clinically relevant target that will appeal to many.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for their generous assessment of our manuscript!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, the authors do not equally consider alternative possible mechanisms of resistance or sensitivity beyond the impact of mutation on binding, even though the measure used to discuss resistance and sensitivity is ultimately a resistance score derived from the increase or decrease of the presence of a variant during cell growth.</p></disp-quote><p>For this resistance screen, Ba/F3 was a carefully chosen cellular selection system due to its addiction to exogenously provided IL-3, undetected expression of endogenous RTKs (including MET), and dependence on kinase transgenes to promote signaling and growth under IL-3 withdrawal. Together this allows for the readout of variants that alter kinase-driven proliferation without the caveat of bypass resistance. In our previous phenotypic screen (Estevam et al., 2024, eLife), we also carefully examined the impact of all possible MET kinase domain mutations both in the presence and absence of IL-3 withdrawal, but no inhibitors. There, we identified a small group of mutations that were associated with gain-of-function behavior located at conserved regulatory motifs outside of the catalytic site, yet these mutations were largely sensitive to inhibitors within this screen.</p><p>Here, the majority of resistance mutations were located at or near the ATP-binding pocket, suggesting an impact on resistance through direct drug interactions. However, there was also a small population of distal mutations that met our statistical definitions of resistance. Within the crizotinib selection, sites such as T1293, L1272, T1261, amongst others, demonstrated resistance profiles but were located in C-lobe away from the catalytic site. While we did not experimentally validate these specific mutations, it is possible that non-direct drug binders instead promote resistance through allosteric or conformational mechanisms which preserve kinase activity and signaling. Indeed, our ML framework explicitly included conformational and stability effects as significant in improving predictions.</p><p>We would be happy to further discuss any specific alternative resistance mechanisms Reviewer 1 has in mind! Thank you for highlighting this!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also points of discussion and interpretation that rely heavily on docked models of kinase-inhibitor pairs without considering alternative binding modes or providing any validation of the docked pose. Lastly, the use of ESM1b is powerful but constrained heavily by the limited structural training data provided, which can lead to misleading interpretations without considering alternative conformations or poses.</p></disp-quote><p>The majority of our interpretations are grounded in the X-ray structures of WT MET bound to the inhibitors studied (or close analogs). The use of docked models (note - to mutant structures predicted by UMol, not ESM, that can have conformational changes) is primarily in the ML part of the manuscript. Indeed, in our models, conformational and binding mode changes are taken into account as features (see Ligand RMSD, Residue RMSD). There are certainly improved methods (AF3 variants) emerging that might have even more power to model these changes, but they come with greater computational costs and are something we will be evaluating in the future.</p><p>We added to the results section: “While our features can account for some changes in MET-mutant conformation and altered inhibitor binding pose, the prediction of these aspects can likely be improved with new methods.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of potential resistance mutations within MET Receptor Tyrosine Kinase and defines how specific mutations affect different inhibitors and modes of target engagement. The goal is to identify inhibitor combinations with the lowest overlap in their sensitivity to resistant mutations and determine if certain resistance mutations/mechanisms are more prevalent for specific modes of ATP-binding site engagement. To achieve this, the authors measured the ability of ~6000 single mutants of MET's kinase domain (in the context of a cytosolic TPR fusion) to drive IL-3-independent proliferation (used as a proxy for activity) of Ba/F3 cells (deep mutational profiling) in the presence of 11 different inhibitors. The authors then used co-crystal and docked structures of inhibitor-bound MET complexes to define the mechanistic basis of resistance and applied a protein language model to develop a predictive model of inhibitor sensitivity/resistance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strengths of this manuscript are the comprehensive nature of the study and the rigorous methods used to measure the sensitivity of ~6000 MET mutants in a pooled format. The dataset generated will be a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding kinase inhibitor sensitivity and, more broadly, small molecule ligand/protein interactions. The structural analyses are systematic and comprehensive, providing interesting insights into resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, the use of machine learning to define inhibitor-specific fitness landscapes is a valuable addition to the narrative. Although the ESM1b protein language model is only moderately successful in identifying the underlying mechanistic basis of resistance, the authors' attempt to integrate systematic sequence/function datasets with machine learning serves as a foundation for future efforts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for their thoughtful assessment of our manuscript!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main limitation of this study is that the authors' efforts to define general mechanisms between inhibitor classes were only moderately successful due to the challenge of uncoupling inhibitor-specific interaction effects from more general mechanisms related to the mode of ATP-binding site engagement. However, this is a minor limitation that only minimally detracts from the impressive overall scope of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have added to the discussion: “A full landscape of mutational effects can help to predict drug response and guide small molecule design to counteract acquired resistance. The ability to define molecular mechanisms towards that goal will likely require more purposefully chosen chemical inhibitors and combinatorial mutational libraries to be maximally informative.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript 'Mapping kinase domain resistance mechanisms for the MET receptor tyrosine kinase via deep mutational scanning' by Estevam et al, deep mutational scanning is used to assess the impact of ~5,764 mutants in the MET kinase domain on the binding of 11 inhibitors. Analyses were divided by individual inhibitor and kinase inhibitor subtypes (I, II, I 1/2, and III). While a number of mutants were consistent with previous clinical reports, novel potential resistance mutants were also described. This study has implications for the development of combination therapies, namely which combination of inhibitors to avoid based on overlapping resistance mutant profiles. While one suggested pair of inhibitors with the least overlapping resistance mutation profiles was suggested, this manuscript presents a proof of concept toward a more systematic approach for improved selection of combination therapeutics. Furthermore, in a final part of this manuscript the data was used to train a machine learning model, the ESM-1b protein language model augmented with an XG Boost Regressor framework, and found that they could improve predictions of resistance mutations above the initial ESM-1b model.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall this paper is a tour-de-force of data collection and analysis to establish a more systematic approach for the design of combination therapies, especially in targeting MET and other kinases, a family of proteins significant to therapeutic intervention for a variety of diseases. The presentation of the work is mostly concise and clear with thousands of data points presented neatly and clearly. The discovery of novel resistance mutants for individual MET inhibitors, kinase inhibitor subtypes within the context of MET, and all resistance mutants across inhibitor subtypes for MET has clinical relevance. However, probably the most promising outcome of this paper is the proposal of the inhibitor combination of Crizotinib and Cabozantib as Type I and Type II inhibitors, respectively, with the least overlapping resistance mutation profiles and therefore potentially the most successful combination therapy for MET. While this specific combination is not necessarily the point, it illustrates a compelling systematic approach for deciding how to proceed in developing combination therapy schedules for kinases. In an insightful final section of this paper, the authors approach using their data to train a machine learning model, perhaps understanding that performing these experiments for every kinase for every inhibitor could be prohibitive to applying this method in practice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for their assessment of our manuscript (we are very happy to have it described as a tour-de-force!)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This paper presents a clear set of experiments with a compelling justification. The content of the paper is overall of high quality. Below are mostly regarding clarifications in presentation.</p><p>Two places could use more computational experiments and analysis, however. Both are presented as suggestions, but at least a discussion of these topics would improve the overall relevance of this work. In the first case it seems that while the analyses conducted on this dataset were chosen with care to be the most relevant to human health, further analyses of these results and their implications of our understanding of allosteric interactions and their effects on inhibitor binding would be a relevant addition. For example, for any given residue type found to be a resistance mutant are there consistent amino acid mutations to which a large or small or effect is found. For example is a mutation from alanine to phenylalanine always deleterious, though one can assume the exact location of a residue matters significantly. Some of this analysis is done in dividing resistance mutants by those that are near the inhibitor binding site and those that aren't, but more of these types of analyses could help the reader understand the large amount of data presented here. A mention at least of the existing literature in this area and the lack or presence of trends would be worthwhile. For example, is there any correlation with a simpler metric like the Grantham score to predict effects of mutations (in a way the ESM-1b model is a better version of this, so this is somewhat implicitly discussed).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed we experimented with including these types of features in the XGBoost scheme (particularly residue volume change and distance) to augment the predictive power of the ESM model - see Figure 8 - figure supplement 1; however, we didn’t find them as significant. Therefore, the signal is likely very small and/or incorporated into the baseline ESM model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, this discussion relates to the second point this manuscript could improve upon: the machine learning section. The main actionable item here is that this results section seems the least polished and could do a better job describing what was done. In the figure it looks like results for certain inhibitors were held out as test data - was this all mutants for a single inhibitor, or some other scheme? Overall I think the implications of this section could be fleshed out, potentially with more experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 8A and the methods section contain a very detailed explanation of test data. We have thought about it and do not have any easy path to improve the description, which we reproduce here:</p><p>“Experimental fitness scores of MET variants in the presence of DMSO and AMG458 were ignored in model training and testing since having just one set of data for a type I ½ inhibitor and DMSO leads to learning by simply memorizing the inhibitor type, without generalizability. The remaining dataset was split into training and test sets to further avoid overfitting (Figure 8A). The following data points were held out for testing - (a) all mutations in the presence of one type I (crizotinib) and one type II (glesatinib analog) inhibitor, (b) 20% of randomly chosen positions (columns) and (c) all mutations in two randomly selected amino acids (rows) (e.g. all mutations to Phe, Ser). After splitting the dataset into train and test sets, the train set was used for XGBoost hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. For tuning the hyperparameters of each of the XGBoost models, we held out 20% of randomly sampled data points in the training set and used the remaining 80% data for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization of the models with Optuna (Akiba et al., 2019), with an objective to minimize the mean squared error between the fitness predictions on 20% held out split and the corresponding experimental fitness scores. The following hyperparameters were sampled and tuned: type of booster (booster - gbtree or dart), maximum tree depth (max_depth), number of trees (n_estimators), learning rate (eta), minimum leaf split loss (gamma), subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree (colsample_bytree), L1 and L2 regularization terms (alpha and beta) and tree growth policy (grow_policy - depthwise or lossguide). After identifying the best combination of hyperparameters for each of the models, we performed 10-fold cross validation (with re-sampling) of the models on the full training set. The training set consists of data points corresponding to 230 positions and 18 amino acids. We split these into 10 parts such that each part corresponds to data from 23 positions and 2 amino acids. Then, at each of 10 iterations of cross-validation, models were trained on 9 of 10 parts (207 positions and 16 amino acids) and evaluated on the 1 held out part (23 positions and 2 amino acids). Through this protocol we ensure that we evaluate performance of the models with different subsets of positions and amino acids. The average Pearson correlation and mean squared error of the models from these 10 iterations were calculated and the best performing model out of 8192 models was chosen as the one with the highest cross-validation correlation. The final XGBoost models were obtained by training on the full training set and also used to obtain the fitness score predictions for the validation and test sets. These predictions were used to calculate the inhibitor-wise correlations shown in Figure 8B.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned in the 'Strengths' section, one of the appealing aspects of this paper is indeed its potential wide applicability across kinases -- could you use this ML model to predict resistance mutants for an entirely different kinase? This doesn't seem far-fetched, and would be an extremely compelling addition to this paper to prove the value of this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>This is exactly where we want to go next! But as we see here, it is going to be hard and require more purposeful selection of chemicals and likely combinatorial mutations to be maximally informative (see also reviewer 2 response where we have added text)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another area in which this paper could improve its clarity is in the description of caveats of the assay. The exact math used to define resistance mutants and its dependence on the DMSO control is interesting, it is worth discussing where the failure modes of this procedure might be. Could it be that the resistance mutants identified in this assay would differ significantly from those found in patients? That results here are consistent with those seen in the clinic is promising, but discrepancies could remain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The greatest trade-off of probing the intracellular MET kinase (juxtamembrane, kinase domain, c-tail) in the constitutively active TPR system is that while we gain cytoplasmic expression, constitutive oligomerization, and HGF-independent activation, other features like membrane-proximal effects are lost and translatability of some mutations in non-proliferative conditions may also be limited. Nevertheless, Ba/F3 allows IL-3 withdrawal to serve as an effective variant readout of transgenic kinase variant effects due to its undetectable expression of endogenous RTKs and addiction to exogenous interleukin-3 (IL-3).</p><p>In our previous study, we were also interested in comparing the phenotypic results to available patient populations in cBioPortal. We observed that our DMS captured known oncogenic MET kinase variants, in addition to a population of gain-of-function variants within clinical residue positions that have not been clinically reported. Interestingly, the population of possible novel gain-of-function mutant codons were more distant in genetic space (2-3 Hamming distance) from wild type than the clinically reported variant codon (1-2 Hamming distance).</p><p>For this inhibitor screen, we also carefully compared previously reported and validated resistance mutations across referenced publications to that of our inhibitor screen, and observed large agreement as noted in-text. While discrepancies could definitely remain, there is precedence for consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore a more in depth discussion of the MetdelEx14 results is warranted. For example, why is the DMSO signature in Figure 1 - supplement 4 so different from that of Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study (Estevam et al., 2024), we more directly compared MET and METΔExon14, and while observed several differences, especially at conserved regulatory motifs, the TPR expression system did not provide a robust differential. Therefore, we hypothesize that a membrane-bound context is likely necessary to obtain a differential that captures juxtamembrane regulatory effects for these two isoforms. For that reason, we did not place heavy emphasis on the differences between MET and METΔExon14 in this study. Nevertheless, we performed parallel analysis of the METΔExon14 inhibitor DMS and provided all source and analyzed data in our GitHub repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fraser-lab/MET_kinase_Inhibitor_DMS">https://github.com/fraser-lab/MET_kinase_Inhibitor_DMS</ext-link>).</p><p>In our analysis of resistance, we used Rosace to score and compare DMSO and inhibitor landscapes. We present the full distribution of raw scores in Figure 1 for each condition. However, to visually highlight resistance mutations as a heatmap, we subtracted the scores of each variant in each inhibitor condition from the raw DMSO score, making the heatmaps in Figure 1 - supplement 4 appear more “blue.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And finally, there is a lot of emphasis put on the unexpected results of this assay for the tivantinib &quot;type III&quot; inhibitor - could this in fact be because the molecule &quot;is highly selective for the inactive or unphosphorylated form of c-Met&quot; according to Eathiraj et al JBC 2011?</p></disp-quote><p>The work presented by Eathiraj et al JBC 2011 is a key study we reference and is foundational to tivantinib. While the point brought up about tivantinib’s selective preference for an inactive conformation is valid, this is also true for type II kinase inhibitors. In our study, regardless of inhibitor conformational preference, tivantinib was the only one with a nearly identical landscape to DMSO and exhibited selection even in the absence of Ba/F3 MET-addiction (Figure 1E). This result is in closer agreement with MET agnostic behavior reported by Basilico et al., 2013 and Katayama et al., 2013.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While this paper is crisply written with beautiful figures, the complexity of the data warrants a bit more clarity in how the results are visualized. Namely, clearly highlighting mutants that have previously reported and those identified by this study across all figures could help significantly in understanding the more novel findings of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>To better compare and contrast novel mutation identified in this study to others, we compiled a list of reported resistance mutations from recent clinical and experimental studies (Pecci et al 2024; Yao et al., 2023; Bahcall et al., 2022; Recondo et al., 2020; Rotow et al ., 2020; Fujino et al., 2019), since a direct database with resistance annotations does not exist for MET, to the best of our knowledge. In total, this amounted to 31 annotated resistance mutations across crizotinib, capmatinib, tepotinib, savolitinib, cabozantinib, merestinib, and glesatinib, which we have now tabulated in a new figure (Figure 4) and commentary in the main text:</p><p>To assess the agreement between our DMS and previously annotated resistance mutations, we compiled a list of reported resistance mutations from recent clinical and experimental studies (Pecci et al 2024; Yao et al., 2023; Bahcall et al., 2022; Recondo et al., 2020; Rotow et al ., 2020; Fujino et al., 2019; Figure 4A,B). Overall, previously discovered mutations are strongly shifted to a GOF distribution for the drugs where resistance is reported from treatment or experiment; in contrast, the distribution is centered around neutral for those sites for other drugs not reported in the literature (Figure 4C). However, even in cases such as L1195V, we observe GOF DMS scores indicative of resistance to previously reported inhibitors. Given this overall strong concordance with prior literature and clinical results, we can also provide hypotheses to clarify the role of mutations that are observed in combination with others. For example, H1094Y is a reported driver mutation that has been linked to resistance in METΔEx14 for glesatinib with either the secondary L1195V mutation or in isolation (Recodo et al., 2020). However, in our assay H1094Y demonstrated slight sensitivity to gelesatinib, suggesting that either resistance is linked to the exon14 deletion isoform, the L1195V mutation, or a cellular factor not modeled well by the BaF3 system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the potential impacts and follow-ups of this excellent study could be communicated better - it is recommended that they advertise better this paper as a resource for the community both as a dataset and as a proof of concept. In this realm I would encourage the authors to emphasize the multiple potential uses of this dataset by others to provide answers and insights on a variety of problems.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see below</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, the decision to include the MetdelEx14 results, but not discuss them at all is interesting, do the authors expect future analyses to lead to useful insights? Is it surprising that trends are broadly the same to the data discussed?</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous paper suggests that Ba/F3 isn’t a great model for measuring the differences between MET and METΔEx14, so we haven’t emphasized other than to point to our previous paper. We include the full analysis here nonetheless as a resource. Potentially where the greatest differences between resistance mutant behaviors would be observed is in the full-length, membrane-bound MET and METΔEx14 receptor isoforms. While outside of the scope of this study, there is great potential to use the resistance mutations identified in this study as a filtered group to test and map differential inhibitor sensitivities between receptor isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And finally it could be valuable to have a small addition of introspection from the authors on how this approach could be altered and/or improved in the future to facilitate the general application of this approach for combination therapies for other targets.</p></disp-quote><p>See also reviewer 2 response where we have added text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major points of revision:</p><p>(1) It seems like much of the structural interpretation of the inhibitor binding mode, outside of crizotinib binding, appears to come from docked models of the inhibitor to the MET kinase domain. Given the potential variability of the docked structure to the kinase domain, it would be useful for the authors to consider alternative possible binding modes that their docking pipeline may have suggested. It could also be useful to provide some degree of validation or contextualization of their docking models.</p></disp-quote><p>All individual figures are very carefully inspected based on either existing crystal structures of the inhibitor or closely related inhibitors (ATP, 3DKC; crizotinib, 2WGJ; tepotinib, 4R1V; tivantinib, 3RHK; AMG-458, 5T3Q; NVP-BVU972, 3QTI; merestinib, 4EEV; savolitinib, 6SDE). In total, four structural interpretations were the result of docking onto reference experimental structures (capmatinib, cabozantinib, glumetinib, glesatinib). As we wrote above, different conformations and binding modes are possible in predicted mutant structures (as we did here at scale) and included in the ML analysis already.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the first section, the authors classify an inhibitor as Type Ia on docking models, but mention the conflicting literature describing it as type Ib - it would be helpful to provide a contextualization of why this distinction between Ia and Ib matters, and what difference it might make. It would also be useful to know if their docking score only suggested poses compatible with Ia or if other poses were provided as well. Validation using other method might be beneficial, especially since they acknowledge the conflicting literature for classification. Or at least recontextualization that more evidence would be needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Kinase inhibitors have several canonical structural definitions we use to base the classifications in this study. Specifically, type I inhibitors are classified in MET by interactions with Y1230, D1228, K1110 in addition to its conformation in the ATP-binding site. Type I inhibitors are further subdivided into type 1a in MET if it leverages interactions with the solvent front and residue G1163. In prior literature referenced, tepotinib was classified as type 1b, which would imply it does not have solvent front interactions, like savolitinib (PDB 6SDE) or NVP-BVU972 (PDB 3QTI). However, in the tepotinib experimental structure (PDB 4R1V), we observed a greater structural resemblance to other type 1a inhibitors opposed to type 1b (Figure 1 - figure supplement 1b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The measure used to discuss resistance and sensitivity is ultimately a resistance score derived from the increase or decrease of the presence of a variant during cell growth. This is not a measure of direct binding. It would be helpful if the authors discussed alternative mechanisms through which these variants may impact resistance and/or sensitivity, such as stability, protonation effects, or kinase activity. The score itself may be convolving over all these potential mechanisms to drive GOF and LOF observed behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>See the response to the public review. Indeed, our ML framework explicitly included conformational and stability effects as significant in improving predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) While it is promising to try and improve the predictive properties of ESM1b, it is not exactly clear why the authors considered their structural data of 11 inhibitors a sufficient dataset with which to augment the model. It would be useful for the authors to provide some additional context for why they wished to augment ESM1b in particular with their dataset, and provide any metrics indicating that their training data of 11 inhibitors provided an adequate statistical sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t understand what this means. Sorry!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors use ESM-1b to predict the fitness impact of each mutation and augment it using protein structural data of drug-target interactions. However, using an XGBoost regressor on a single set of 11 kinase-inhibitor interaction pairs is an incredibly sparse dataset to train upon. It would be useful for the authors to consider the limitations of their model, as well as its extensibility in the context of alternate binding poses, alternate conformations, or changes in protonation states of ligand or inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>On the contrary - this is 11 chemicals across 3000 mutations. We have discussed alternative interpretations above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) It would also be useful for the authors to provide more context around their choice of regressor. XGBoost is a powerful regressor but can easily overfit high dimensional data when paired with language models such as ESM-1b. This would be particularly useful since some of the features to train on were also generated using existing models such as ThermoMPNN.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes - we are quite concerned about overfitting and have tried to assess overfitting by careful design of test and validation sets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors also mention excluding their DMSO and AMG458 scores in the model training and testing due to overfitting issues - it would be useful to have an SI figure pointing to this data.</p></disp-quote><p>No - we exclude the DMSO because that is the reference (baseline) and AMG because it has a different binding mode. This isn’t related to overfitting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors mention in their docking pipeline that 5 binding modes were used for each ligand docking, but it appears that only one binding mode is considered in the main figures. It would be useful for the authors to provide additional details about what were the other binding modes used for, how different were each binding mode, and how was the &quot;primary&quot; mode selected (and how much better was its score than the others).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer misinterprets the difference between poses shown in figures, based on mostly crystal structures or carefully selected templates, and the use of docked models in feature engineering for the ML part of the study. Where existing crystal structures do not exist, we performed docking for capmatinib, cabozantinib, glumetinib, glesatinib onto reference structures bound to type I (2WGJ) and type II (4EEV) inhibitors. We selected one representative binding mode based on the reference inhibitor, and while not exact, at a minimum these models provide a basis for structural interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>My main suggestion is for the authors to add a few sentences (in non-technical language) to the results section, specifically before the results shown in Figure 3, defining gain-of-function, loss-of-function, resistance, and sensitivity. While these definitions are present in the materials and methods section, explicitly discussing them prior to the relevant results would significantly improve the overall readability of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We defined “gain-of-function” and “loss-of-function” mutations as those with fitness scores statistically greater or lower than wild-type. Within the DMSO condition, gain-of-function and loss-of -function labels describe mutational perturbation to protein function, whereas within inhibitor conditions, the labels describe the difference in fitness introduced by an inhibitor.</p><p>We have also clarified these definitions where the terms are first introduced: “As expected, the DMSO control population displayed a bimodal distribution with mutations exhibiting wild-type fitness centered around 0, with a wider distribution of mutations that exhibited loss- or gain-of-function effects, as defined by fitness scores with statistically significant lower or greater scores than wild-type, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7D. Please add a bit more detail to the legend on how fold change (y-axis) was calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, fold change represents the number of viable cells at each inhibitor concentration relative to the TKI control, measured with the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) as an end point readout. We have updated the legend of Figure 7D with calculation details: “Dose-response for each inhibitor concentration is represented as the fraction of viable cells relative to the TKI free control.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I must admit, I did not understand what &quot;Specific inhibitor fitness landscapes also aid in identifying mutations with potential drug sensitivity, such as R1086 and C1091 in the MET P-loop&quot; means. These are positions where most mutations lead to greater sensitivity to crizotinib. Is the idea that there are potentially clinically-relevant MET mutations that can be targeted over wild type with crizotinib?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this! The P-loop (phosphate-binding loop) is a glycine-rich structural motif conserved in kinase domains. This motif is located in the N-lobe, where its primary role is to gate ATP entry into the active site and stabilize the phosphate groups of ATP when bound. Therefore, the P-loop is a common target region for ATP-competitive inhibitor design, but also a site where resistance can emerge (Roumiantsev et al., 2002). The idea we’d like to convey is that identifying residues that offer the potential for drug stabilization with the added benefit of having lower risk resistance, is an attractive consideration for novel inhibitor design.</p><p>We have added to the text: “Individual inhibitor resistance landscapes also aid in identifying target residues for novel drug design by providing insights into mutability and known resistance cases. This enables the selection of vectors for chemical elaboration with potential lower risk of resistance development. Sites with mutational profiles such as R1086 and C1091, located in the common drug target P-loop of MET, could be likely candidates for crizotinib.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Suggested Improvements to the Figures:</p><p>a) Figure 4A - T1261 seems to be mislabeled</p><p>b) In Figure 3A it's suggested to highlight mutants determined to be resistance mutants by this scheme.</p><p>c) In Figure 3D it would be informative to highlight which of these resistance mutants have already been previously reported and which are novel to this study</p><p>d) Throughout figures 3A, 3D, and 4G the graphical choices on how to highlight synonymous mutations and mutations not performed in the assay needs improvement.</p><p>The Green vs Grey 'TRUE' vs 'FALSE' boxes are confusing. Just a green box indicating synonymous mutations would be sufficient. Additionally these green boxes are hard to see, and often edges of this green box are currently missing making it even more difficult to see and interpret.</p><p>* In Figure 4A mutants do not seem to be indicated by a line or plus sign, but this is not explained in the legend or the caption. Please add.</p><p>* In 3D and 4G it is not clear if the mutants not performed are indicated at all - perhaps they are indicated in white, making them indistinguishable from scores with 0. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>T1261 and G1242 are now correctly labeled.</p><p>In text we have also highlighted reported resistance mutations for crizotinib, which are inclusive of clinical reports and in vitro characterization: “These sites, and many of the individual mutations, have been noted in prior reports, such as: D1228N/H/V/Y, Y1230C/H/N/S, G1163R.”</p><p>We have adjusted the heatmaps to improve visual clarity. Mutations with score 0 are white, as indicated by the scale bar, and mutations uncaptured by the screen are now in light yellow. The green outline distinguishing WT synonymous mutations have also been adjusted so edges are no longer cut off. In our representations, we only distinguished mutations by the score color scale bar and WT outline. What looked like a “plus” or “line” in the original figure was only the heatmap background, which now should be resolved in the updated figure and legends for Figure 3 and Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Some Minor Suggested Improvements to the Text:</p><p>a) The abbreviation CBL for 'CBL docking site' is used without being defined.</p><p>b) Figure 3G is referenced, but it does not exist.</p><p>c) In the sentence 'Beyond these well characterized sites, regions with sensitivity occurred throughout the kinase, primarily in loop-regions which have the greatest mutational tolerance in DMSO, but do not provide a growth advantage in the presence of an inhibitor (Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 1; Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 2).'.

This mode of regulation was more highlighted in our previous study. However, since Cbl was only mentioned briefly in this study, we have removed reference to it to simplify the text.</p><p>In addition, we have removed the figure 3G reference and corrected the in-text range. We have also removed references to figure supplements where unnecessary and edited the “Enrich2 scoring” method section to now reference missing citations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
