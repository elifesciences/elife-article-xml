The NAc-S is predominantly composed of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that express either the dopamine D1 (D1-SPNs) or the dopamine D2 receptor (D2-SPNs). Yet, the role of these two neuronal subpopulations and their inputs to the VP in stimulus-based decisions remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics in female and male knock-in rats to selectively silence D1- or D2-SPNs and their projections to the VP at a time when the rats were required to use predictive stimuli to choose between two instrumental actions. Silencing either population of NAc-S SPNs disrupted choice. Silencing NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals in the VP also disrupted choice. However, choice was left intact by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals in the VP. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms and circuitry underlying stimulus-based decisions. We discuss how these insights are consistent with a recent model proposing that these decisions are controlled by an opioid-based memory system residing in the NAc-S.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>Pavlovian instrumental transfer</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05mmh0f86</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT220100474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laurent</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-specific manipulations uncover novel mechanisms in the ventral striatum that mediate the influence of environmental stimuli on action selection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our choices and decisions are often influenced by predictive signals available in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollis, 1984</xref>). This influence is studied in the laboratory using the outcome-specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trapold and Overmier, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colwill and Rescorla, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laurent and Balleine, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2024b</xref>), which comprises three stages. The first two stages are Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, which can be administered in any order. In Pavlovian conditioning, two stimuli (S1 and S2; e.g., sounds or lights) are paired with two distinct and motivationally significant outcomes (O1 and O2; e.g., food outcomes). In instrumental conditioning, subjects are trained to perform two actions (A1 and A2), with each earning one of the two outcomes (i.e., A1 → O1 and A2 → O2). The final stage is the PIT test, which evaluates choice between the two actions in the presence (and absence) of the stimuli. Typically, each of the Pavlovian stimuli biases choice toward the action with which it shares an outcome: that is, S1: A1 &gt; A2 and S2: A2 &gt; A1.</p><p>At a neural level, PIT has been found to rely on interactions between a number of structures, including cortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keistler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tensaouti et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lichtenberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>), amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corbit and Balleine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sias et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiflett and Balleine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Derman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prévost et al., 2012</xref>), basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corbit and Janak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corbit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leung et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung and Balleine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leung and Balleine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prévost et al., 2012</xref>), midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sias et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seitz et al., 2022</xref>), and thalamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leung et al., 2024a</xref>) territories. Among these, the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-S) stands out because, unlike the others, it does not itself contribute to learning the stimulus–outcome (S–O) or the action–outcome (A–O) associations formed during the Pavlovian and instrumental stages of the PIT task and appears only to mediate their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it has been proposed that the NAc-S acts as a central hub integrating S–O and A–O information at the time of PIT to guide choice between actions in an outcome-selective manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shiflett and Balleine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertran-Gonzalez and Laurent, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laurent and Balleine, 2021</xref>). Accordingly, PIT is disrupted by manipulations undermining NAc-S function during the PIT test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corbit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The NAc-S is predominantly composed of spiny projection neurons (SPNs), which can be classified into two distinct subpopulations depending on the dopamine receptor they express (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). One population harbors the dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs; D1-SPNs), whereas the other population expresses the dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs; D2-SPNs). To date, only one study has examined whether activity in both populations is recruited during PIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>), finding that PIT is associated with an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in D1-SPNs but not D2-SPNs. Further, blockade of D1Rs in NAc-S during choice between actions disrupted PIT whereas D2Rs blockade had no effect. Although these findings indicate a major involvement of NAc-S D1-SPNs in PIT, caution must be exerted when drawing conclusions on the role of D2-SPNs. While D1Rs are exclusively expressed on NAc-S D1-SPNs, D2Rs are present on cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and local presynaptic dopamine terminals in addition to D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). Additionally, research shows that ERK1/2 phosphorylation may not capture all transcriptional events that occur in D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matamales et al., 2020</xref>). Lastly, pharmacological D2Rs blockade has been found to be quite ineffective at influencing D2-SPNs function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tozzi et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the relative contribution of NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs in driving choice between actions during PIT remains unclear.</p><p>The present experiments, therefore, aimed to provide an unambiguous assessment of the roles played by the two main populations of NAc-S SPNs during choice between actions in an outcome-specific PIT task. This assessment was achieved through optogenetic silencing in two knock-in rat lines that express Cre recombinase in either D1- or D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pettibone et al., 2019</xref>). We first used tract-tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology to confirm our capacity to selectively silence activity in NAc-S D1- or D2-SPNs. We then conducted two experiments that assessed outcome-specific PIT while D1- or D2-SPNs in the NAc-S were silenced during presentations of the predictive stimuli in the choice test. Finally, we assessed the degree to which the influence of the two SPNs populations on outcome-specific PIT depends on their projections to the ventral pallidum (VP). We focused on the VP for two main reasons: First, both NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs send dense projections to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kupchik et al., 2015</xref>); and, second, communication between the NAc-S and VP has previously been found to be critical for outcome-specific PIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leung and Balleine, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anterograde tracing and ex vivo cell recordings in D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rats</title><p>We first examined the connectivity of striatal D1- and D2-SPNs in transgenic rats expressing Cre recombinase in neurons harboring the dopamine D1 receptor (D1-Cre rats) or the adenosine A2a receptor (A2a-Cre rats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pettibone et al., 2019</xref>). A2a receptors are predominantly expressed on striatal D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiffmann et al., 2007</xref>), thereby enabling selective targeting of these SPNs in the A2a-Cre line. D1-Cre (<italic>n</italic> = 1 female and 1 male) and A2a-Cre rats (<italic>n</italic> = 1 female and 1 male) were unilaterally infused with a Cre-dependent eYFP virus in the NAc-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To validate expression in these rat lines, other D1-Cre (<italic>n</italic> = 4 males) and A2a-Cre rats (<italic>n</italic> = 3 males) were given a unilateral infusion in the dorsal striatum (DS) with the same virus. In both transgenic strains, viral expression was largely restricted to local SPNs in the two targeted regions: ~95% of eYFP-positive neurons expressed DARPP-32 (D32 | eYFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). Viral expression was consistent with D1- and D2-SPNs representing two neuronal populations similar in size: in both transgenic strains and targeted regions ~40% of DARPP-32-positive neurons expressed eYFP (eYFP | D32; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). DS infusion in D1-Cre rats resulted in eYFP-positive terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>) in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and the globus pallidus externus (GPe). By contrast, the same infusion in A2a-Cre rats only produced eYFP-positive terminals in the GPe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>). NAc-S infusion in both D1-Cre and A2a-Cre rats resulted in eYFP-positive terminals in the VP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). By contrast, eYFP-positive terminals in the lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>) were only observed in D1-Cre rats. Overall, these results are in line with current knowledge about the cellular composition of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>) and well-established projection patterns of striatal D1- and D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kupchik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>).

However, the capacity of such pharmacological manipulation to reveal the function of D2-SPNs is unclear. For instance, a D2Rs antagonist could be expected to enhance D2-SPN activity, since D2Rs are Gi coupled and so their activation should reduce adenylyl cyclase activity. Further, D2Rs are not exclusively expressed on this cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>), as they can be found on local CINs and presynaptic dopamine terminals. Finally, previous work found that pharmacological treatment targeting D2Rs can leave D2-SPNs activity unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tozzi et al., 2007</xref>). These issues are overcome by the present optical manipulation in A2a-Cre rats, and we are therefore confident that NAc-S D2-SPNs activity is in fact critical for outcome-specific PIT. Importantly, we also found that the impairment produced by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs was restricted to the influence of predictive stimuli on choice between actions.

First, they combined anatomical tract-tracing and ex vivo electrophysiology to demonstrate that two recently developed knock-in rat lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pettibone et al., 2019</xref>) enable selective silencing of activity in either population of NAc-S SPNs. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>), they found that NAc-S D1-SPNs are necessary for PIT since their silencing eliminated outcome-specific choice. Additionally, they showed that this choice is also abolished by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs, providing the first evidence that both SPN populations contribute to PIT expression. Finally, the last two experiments revealed for the first time that outcome-specific choice is likely to involve downstream regulation of VP function by NAc-S D1-SPNs but not NAc-S D2-SPNs. Together, these findings offer novel insights into the cellular mechanisms that govern the outcome-specific influence of predictive stimuli on choice between actions.</p><p>Convincing evidence had been provided for a significant role of NAc-S D1-SPNs in PIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>). The evidence was based on the observations that PIT is associated with an increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation within these SPNs and that pharmacological blockade of NAc-S D1Rs eliminates outcome-specific choice between actions. These findings align with the present study, showing that PIT is eliminated when NAc-S D1-SPNs are silenced during presentations of the predictive stimuli at the time of choice. Importantly, the effect of NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing was specific to the assessment of choice between actions in the presence of predictive stimuli. For instance, the ability of stimuli to elicit approach behaviors toward the magazine remained intact despite NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing, indicating that the silencing effect was not mediated by modulating potential competition between Pavlovian and instrumental responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lovibond, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holmes et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing preserved the capacity to select between actions based on the value of their respective outcomes. This selectivity in the impairment produced by NAc-S D1-SPNs is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that the NAc-S does not contribute to learning and retrieving the S–O and A–O associations produced by Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previous research failed to provide any evidence supporting the involvement of NAc-S D2-SPNs in outcome-specific choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, PIT was found to produce no change in ERK1/2 phosphorylation in these neurons and was left intact by NAc-S D2Rs blockade. However, these assessments have significant limitations, including the widespread distribution of striatal D2Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>) and the inability of ERK1/2 phosphorylation or D2Rs antagonism to capture or distort activity in NAc-S D2-SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tozzi et al., 2007</xref>). Further, pharmacological blockade of D2Rs would be expected to enhance D2-SPNs activity, since D2Rs are Gi coupled and so their activation reduces adenylyl cyclase activity. The present study addressed these limitations by implementing optogenetic silencing in a knock-in rat line giving access to D2-SPNs through the targeting of the A2a receptor that is predominantly expressed in these neurons in the NAc-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schiffmann et al., 2007</xref>). We found that PIT is eliminated when NAc-S D2-SPNs are silenced during presentations of the predictive stimuli at the time of choice. Moreover, the same silencing left intact the ability of the predictive stimuli to elicit magazine approaches and preserved the capacity to choose between actions based on the value of their outcomes. Thus, we conclude that both NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs are indispensable to outcome-specific PIT. Nevertheless, it will be important for future studies to confirm NAc-S D2-SPNs involvement in PIT using alternative approaches, such as chemogenetic or immunohistochemical assessments employing a marker capable of capturing the function of this neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matamales et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kupchik et al., 2015</xref>), we found that both NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs send dense projections to the VP, which is often described as the major efferent of the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heimer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zahm and Heimer, 1990</xref>). Importantly, the VP has been shown to play a crucial role in outcome-specific choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leung and Balleine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung and Balleine, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leung et al., 2024a</xref>). VP neurons exhibit enhanced cFos activation following an outcome-specific PIT test, and their levels of activation correlate with PIT performance. Moreover, pharmacological inactivation of the VP eliminates outcome-specific choice, and the same elimination is observed when the NAc-S is disconnected from the VP. We therefore tested for a role of NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs projections to the VP during choice between actions in our outcome-specific PIT task. We found that PIT was abolished by silencing NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals but not by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals. Neither silencing affected magazine approaches elicited by the predictive stimuli nor choice between actions based on the value of their outcomes. It is important to note that our study does not provide any evidence about the efficacy of NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals silencing in the VP, and future experiments should aim to provide such evidence or adopt other methods to study this pathway. This could involve using opsins with enhanced axonal silencing efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copits et al., 2021</xref>), or employing alternative methods known to disrupt neurotransmitter release such as chemogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rost et al., 2022</xref>). Yet, the same silencing for NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals resulted in PIT elimination. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that NAc-S D1-SPNs, but not NAc-S D2-SPNs, projections to the VP are indispensable to observe outcome-specific choice in a PIT task. Since NAc-S D2-SPNs appear to exclusively project to the VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humphries and Prescott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kupchik et al., 2015</xref>), our findings suggest that these SPNs mediate outcome-specific PIT by locally regulating NAc-S function. By contrast, it remains to be determined whether NAc-S D1-SPNs also coordinate outcome-specific PIT via their projections to the lateral hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O’Connor et al., 2015</xref>) and/or the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humphries and Prescott, 2010</xref>), in addition to the VP.</p><p>The present findings are consistent with a recent model proposing that outcome-specific choice in PIT relies on an opioid-based memory residing in the NAc-S (for full description and illustration of the model see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laurent and Balleine, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>). In this model, as the basolateral amygdala encodes and stores outcome-specific S–O associations across Pavlovian conditioning, it also drives the formation of the NAc-S memory, which involves the durable accumulation of delta-opioid receptors (DOPRs) on the somatic membrane of local CINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>). Although this memory is not necessary for Pavlovian conditioning per se, its expression is later required to enable the predictive stimuli to guide outcome-specific choice during the PIT test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morse et al., 2020</xref>). The model specifically proposes that memory expression is controlled by fluctuations in glutamatergic release from cortical inputs and dopamine release from projections originating from the VTA, as this brain region has been found to be important for outcome-specific PIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corbit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sias et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seitz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung and Balleine, 2015</xref>). One consequence is to activate NAc-S D2-SPNs and enkephalin discharge by these neurons. Enkephalin then binds onto DOPRs that had accumulated on local CINs and dampens acetylcholine secretion from the interneurons. The sudden drop in NAc-S acetylcholine frees D1-SPNs from the inhibitory tone imposed by acetylcholine occupancy of muscarinic M4 receptors that are exclusively found on these SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tayebati et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lobo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeon et al., 2010</xref>). The ultimate consequence is to promote NAc-S D1-SPNs function, including the coordination of outcome-specific choice in PIT by regulating activity in downstream brain regions such as the VP. The model predicts all the findings presented here. NAc-S D2-SPNs silencing eliminates PIT at the time of choice by preventing enkephalin release and thereby expression of the DOPR-based memory. The main consequence of this expression is precluded by NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing at the time of choice, while silencing the terminals of these SPNs in the VP squashes their ability to regulate the activity of this brain region to coordinate outcome-specific choice in PIT. Thus, one fundamental implication of the present findings is to strengthen the proposal that an opioid-based memory system in the NAc-S enables outcome-specific choice between actions.</p><p>In summary, the present experiments found that the two main populations of SPNs in the NAc-S are indispensable for outcome-specific choice between actions in a PIT task. They also revealed that NAc-S D1-SPNs coordinate this choice by downstream regulation of VP activity. By contrast, NAc-S D2-SPNs function in PIT appears to be restricted to modulating local activity. These findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms and circuitry underlying the outcome-specific influence of predictive stimuli on choice between actions and are consistent with a recent model proposing that this influence is mediated by an opioid-based memory system in the NAc-S. Beyond these mechanistic considerations, the findings offer an opportunity to gain novel insights about various disorders in which the outcome-specific influence of predictive stimuli over our choices and decisions is dysfunctional. These disorders include depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geurts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nord et al., 2018</xref>), anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quail et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krypotos and Engelhard, 2020</xref>), substance-use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hogarth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hogarth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steins-Loeber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garbusow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garbusow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hogarth et al., 2019</xref>), gambling disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genauck et al., 2019</xref>), anorexia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vogel et al., 2020</xref>), and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lehner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meemken and Horstmann, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>135 rats from two genetically modified knock-in lines were used and obtained from the breeding facility at the University of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia). D1-Cre rats (Rat Research &amp; Resource Center, Columbia, MO, USA; LE-Drd1<sup>em1(iCre)Berke</sup>, RRRC#: 00856) expressed Cre recombinase in neurons expressing the dopamine D1 receptors (D1R). A2a-Cre rats (Rat Research &amp; Resource Center, Columbia, MO, USA; LE-<italic>Adora2a<sup>em1(iCre)Berke</sup></italic>, RRRC#: 00857) expressed Cre recombinase in neurons expressing the adenosine A2A receptors (A2R). All rats were heterozygous and generated by crossing a heterozygous male with a Long-Evans wild-type female obtained from a colony maintained by the University of New South Wales (founding animals were sourced from Envigo/Inotiv, Blue Spruce outbred; HsdBlu:LE). Genotyping was completed by sending ear clippings to Transnetyx (Cordova, TN, USA). The rats were at least 8 weeks old at the beginning of each experiment. Efforts were made to allocate an equal number of female and male rats in each group. However, these efforts were hampered by exclusions following post-mortem assessments of viral spread and fiber-optic cannula placement. The final number of female and male rats did not provide sufficient power to analyze an effect of sex (our previous work found no influence of sex on PIT or value-based choice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, all test data present individual performance for female and male rats. Rats were housed in transparent plastic boxes with their littermates (up to four rats per box) throughout, and in a climate-controlled colony room maintained on a 12-hr light–dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am). Behavioral procedures were conducted during the light phase (8:00 am to 6:00 pm). Water and standard lab chow were available ad libitum prior to the start of each experiment. Rats were food restricted to maintain them at ~90% of their ad libitum body weight during the behavioral protocols. Food restriction was initiated 3–5 days prior to the start of the protocols and was maintained throughout all training and testing phases. Rats received a daily food amount, which was adjusted based on body weight measurements recorded every 2 days. This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia. All of the animals were handled according to approved Animal Care and Ethics Committee (ACEC) protocols of the University of New South Wales. The experimental protocols were approved by the UNSW ACEC (Permit Number: 20/35A). All surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental timeline</title><p>Rats underwent initial stereotaxic surgery for viral infusion, followed by 7–11 days recovery. After recovery, rats received 8 days of Pavlovian conditioning and 8 days of instrumental conditioning, except in the VP experiments (NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs → VP projection experiments) where only 7 days of instrumental conditioning were given. Following a 3- to 4-day interval, rats received a second surgery to implant fiber-optic cannulas and 3–4 days additional recovery. Rats then completed reminder sessions: one Pavlovian and two instrumental conditioning sessions, except in the VP experiments (NAc-S D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs → VP projection experiments) where three instrumental sessions were given. Testing began the following day with the PIT test, followed by two instrumental conditioning reminder sessions over the next 2 days. Finally, rats underwent outcome devaluation using sensory-specific satiety and choice tests over two consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Viruses</title><p>The following viruses were used: AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP (eYFP; AddGene; Watertown, MA, USA) and AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP (eNpHR3.0; UNC Vector Core; Chapel Hill, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Surgeries</title><p>Stereotaxic surgery was conducted under isoflurane gas anesthesia (0.8 l/min; induction at 4–5%, maintenance 2–2.5%). Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), the surgical area was shaved, and betadine iodine antiseptic solution was applied. At the incision site, bupivacaine hydrochloride (0.5%; 0.1–0.2 ml) was injected subcutaneously. In the lower flank, Metacam (1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously. An incision was made along the midline to expose the skull, the membrane on top of the skull was cleared, and the skull was adjusted to align bregma and lambda on the same horizontal plane.</p><p>For viral infusion, small holes were drilled in the skull above the DS or NAc-S. The following coordinates (indicated in mm from bregma) were used for the DS: –0.45 anteroposterior (A/P); ±2.6 (M/L); –4.85 dorsoventral (D/V). For the NAc-S, the coordinates were: +1.8 or +1.9 A/P; ±0.85 or ±0.95 mediolateral M/L; –7.7 or –7.85 D/V. An Infuse/Withdraw Pump (Standard Infuse/Withdraw Pump 11 Elite; Holliston, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) in combination with glass 1 µl syringes (86200; Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA) was used to perform infusions. 0.5 µl of the virus was infused in each hemisphere at a rate of 0.1 µl/min. Following each infusion, the needle was left in position for 5–10 min to allow for diffusion. The incision site was closed and secured with surgical sutures (684G; Ethicon, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) or surgical staples (59027; Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA), and betadine antiseptic ointment was applied to the area. Animals then received subcutaneous injections of the antibiotic Duplocillin (0.15 ml/kg) and sodium chloride (0.9%, 2 ml) and placed on a heat mat for recovery. Once alert and responsive, animals were returned to their home cages and monitored daily as they recovered for a minimum of 1 week following surgery with ad libitum access to food and water.</p><p>Rats received a second surgery to bilaterally implant fiber-optic cannulas (10 mm length, 0.48 mm diameter; Doric Lenses, Québec, QC, Canada) after completion of the initial 15–16 days of training (Pavlovian and Instrumental). The surgical area was prepared using the same method as described for viral surgeries. Three jewelers’ screws were inserted into the skull, distributed anterior and posterior to the implantation site and secured in place with dental cement. Fiber-optic cannulas were implanted into the targeted brain region. The following coordinates (indicated in mm from bregma) were used for the NAc-S: +1.8 or +1.9 A/P; –0.85 or –0.95 M/L for left hemisphere; +2.2 M/L with –10° angle for right hemisphere; –6.75 D/V for left hemisphere; –6.8 or –6.9 D/V for right hemisphere. The following coordinates (indicated in mm from bregma) were used for the VP: +0.24 A/P;±1.8 M/L; –7.5 or –8.0 D/V. Post-implantation, rats received the same care as described for viral surgeries and were allowed to recover for 3–4 days before resuming the behavioral procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral apparatus</title><p>Training and testing were conducted in 12 identical operant chambers (ENV-007-VP; L 29.53 x W 23.5 x H 27.31 cm; MED Associates, Fairfax, VT, USA) enclosed within light- and sound-resistant cabinets (ENV-018MD; L 59.69 x W 40.64 x H 55.88 cm; MED Associates, Fairfax, VT, USA). The chambers consisted of two stainless-steel side walls, three clear polycarbonate walls and ceiling, and a stainless-steel grid floor. Each chamber was equipped with a recessed magazine connected to a 45-mg grain pellet (F0165; Bio-Serv Biotechnologies, Flemington, NJ, USA; one pellet per delivery) dispenser and a pump fitted with a 60-ml syringe that delivered a 0.2-ml sucrose solution (20% wt/vol; delivered across 2 s; white sugar; Winc, Erskine Park, NSW, Australia) into the left side of the magazine. Head entries into the magazine were detected via an infrared beam that crossed the magazine opening. One retractable lever was located on either side of the magazine. A house light (3 W, 24 V) situated at the top of the wall opposite to the food magazine was used to illuminate the chamber during the training and test sessions. Each chamber contained a Sonalert white noise generator (80 dB), and a 28 V DC mechanical relay that delivered a 2-Hz clicker stimulus. Training and testing sessions were programmed and controlled by computers external to the testing rooms using MED-PC V software (MED Associates, Fairfax, VT, USA) which also recorded experimental data from each session. All cabinets were fitted with cameras (IPC-K35AP; Dahua, Artarmon, NSW, Australia) to view real-time chamber activity using D-ViewCam DCS-100 software (D-Link, North Ryde, NSW, Australia). The ceiling of these chambers contained a hole which enabled the connection of the patch cable between the LED and each freely moving rat.</p><p>Outcome devaluation was conducted in a separate room equipped with 16 individual, open-top plastic boxes with stainless steel wire mesh lids. During devaluation, the lights were dimmed, and each individual chamber was fitted with either a ceramic dish for grain pellet devaluation or a plastic sipper bottle for sucrose solution devaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic equipment</title><p>Fiber-optic cannulas (10 mm; Doric Lenses, Québec, QC, Canada) consisted of a zirconia ferrule contained within a stainless-steel receptacle from which a silica/polymer flat-tip fiber extended from. Fiber-optic patch cords (custom; Doric Lenses, Québec, QC, Canada) were enclosed in a flexible cladding that consisted of one transparent fiber that split into two smaller fibers for attachment to the implanted fiber-optic cannulas. Delivery of the LED light was controlled through a TTL adapter which converted 28 V DC output to a TTL transition (MED Associates, Fairfax, VT, USA). The adapter was connected to an LED driver (Doric Lenses, Québec, QC, Canada) and Connectorized LED light source (Doric Lenses, Québec, QC, Canada) with a fiber-optic rotary joint for attachment to the fiber-optic patch cords. LED light was delivered as orange light (625 nm; continuous) and measured at least 10 mW at the cannula tip using a photometer (PM200; ThorLabs, Newton, NJ, USA) when the LED was switched on.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral procedures</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Pavlovian conditioning</title><p>Pavlovian conditioning involved 8 daily 1 hr training sessions. Two auditory conditioned stimuli (S1 and S2; white noise or clicker) were paired with two food outcomes (O1 and O2; grain pellets or sucrose solution). Each stimulus was presented for 2 min in duration, four times each in a pseudorandom order within each training session. Stimulus presentations were separated by pseudorandom intertrial intervals (ITIs) ranging between 3 and 5 min in length (4 min average). The stimulus order and ITIs were changed daily. S–O pairings were counterbalanced within- and between-groups. Food outcomes were delivered on a random time 30 s schedule throughout the stimulus presentation. Magazine entries were recorded throughout the session, and conditioned responding was analyzed by comparing magazine entries in the 2 min prior to stimulus presentation (’pre S’) and during the 2 min stimulus presentation period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Instrumental conditioning</title><p>During instrumental conditioning, two actions (A1 and A2; left or right lever presses) were trained with the two different outcomes (O1 and O2) in 2 separate daily sessions for 8 days. The order of the sessions was counterbalanced, as were the A–O relationships, which were further counterbalanced with the S–O relationships. Each session ended when 20 outcomes were earned or when 30 min had elapsed. For the first 2 days, actions were continuously reinforced (i.e., one action earned one outcome delivery). Across the next three sessions, actions were rewarded on a random ratio 5 (RR5) schedule (i.e., each action delivered an outcome with a probability of 0.2). For the final 3 days, animals were rewarded on an RR10 schedule (i.e., each response delivered an outcome with a probability of 0.1). In the VP experiments (NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs → VP projections), rats only received 2 days on RR10. Lever press actions were measured throughout the duration of the session, and performance during instrumental training was assessed using the mean number of lever presses per min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Pavlovian instrumental transfer test</title><p>Across the 3 days preceding this test, rats were given one session of Pavlovian retraining and two separate sessions of instrumental retraining. In the VP experiments (NAc-S D1- and D2-SPNs → VP projections), rats first received 1 day of Pavlovian conditioning followed by 3 days of instrumental conditioning (RR10). Immediately before the test, patch cables were attached to the fiber-optic cannulas and the LED. During the test, both levers were inserted into the chamber simultaneously and remained in the chamber for the duration of the test. The test was conducted in extinction (i.e., no outcomes were delivered). To reduce baseline (pre-S) lever presses, responding on both levers was extinguished for 8 min prior to any stimuli being presented. Each stimulus was presented for 2 min, four times each during the test in the following order: noise-clicker-clicker-noise-clicker-noise-noise-clicker. Each stimulus presentation was separated by a fixed 3-min interval. Critically, the LED was activated during half of the trials (ON) but left inactive during the other half (OFF). The order for ON and OFF trials was counterbalanced. Responses were recorded prior to and during the S presentation. These were then collated into ‘Baseline’ (lever press rates in the two min prior to S presentation), ‘Same’ (when S shares the <italic>same</italic> outcome with the action) and ‘Different’ (when S has a <italic>different</italic> outcome with the action) following data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Choice tests following outcome devaluation</title><p>Across the two consecutive days preceding these tests, rats were given two daily instrumental conditioning sessions (RR10). Following the second session, rats were habituated to the devaluation chambers for 30 min. During these habituation sessions, animals had access to one outcome (counterbalanced). On the first test day, rats were placed in the devaluation chambers for 1 hr where they had ad libitum access to one of the previously trained outcomes (O1 or O2). Once removed from the devaluation boxes, patch cables were attached to the fiber-optic cannulas and the LED, and the first choice test was conducted. Both levers were made available for 2 min each, four times during the session with an ITI of 2 min where the levers were retracted. The LED was activated during two of the 2 min trials where the levers were available (ON) and was left inactive during the other two trials (OFF). The order of the ON and OFF trials was counterbalanced. A similar procedure was implemented the following day, except that the other outcome was devalued.

The main measures were the number of magazine entries and lever presses per minute. The difference between groups was analyzed using a planned orthogonal contrast procedure controlling the per contrast error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hays, 1963</xref>). A first contrast (Group) compared rats that had been infused with the control eYFP virus and rats that had been infused with the inhibitory eNpHR3.0 virus. Changes across days (Day) during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning were assessed by planned linear trend analyses. Pavlovian conditioning and the PIT tests included a within-subject factor (Period) comparing magazine entry rates during the 2-min stimuli against rates during a 2-min baseline period immediately preceding the stimuli. During the PIT tests, a within-subject factor (Lever) examined the net (i.e., minus baseline) rates of lever presses on the response (Same) earning the same outcome as predicted by the stimulus against those on the response (Different) earning the different outcome. A second within-subject factor (LED) examined these rats when the LED was activated (ON) or not activated (OFF). The choice tests following outcome devaluation used a within-subject factor of response identity (Lever) comparing rates of lever presses on the response (Valued) earning the valued outcome against those on the response (Devalued) earning the devalued outcome. It also used the LED within-subject factor described above. All analyses were carried out using the PSY statistical software (School of Psychology, the University of New South Wales, Australia).

PIT tests</title><p>NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing enhanced magazine entry rates during the outcome-specific PIT test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). During this test, stimuli elicit both magazine entries and lever presses, with these response types competing for behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lovibond, 1981</xref>). Manipulations that reduce one response type might therefore be expected to enhance the other. Since NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing impaired outcome-specific PIT and reduced lever press responding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), it would seem reasonable to conclude that this reduction resulted in increased magazine entry rates. However, this increase was also observed during LED OFF trials in eNpHR3.0 rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), when lever press performance was comparable to control eYFP rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, response competition cannot explain the enhanced magazine entry rates. The results from NAc-S D2-SPNs silencing further rule out this possibility. While D2-SPNs silencing impaired outcome-specific PIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), it had no significant effect on magazine entry rates during PIT, unlike D1-SPNs silencing. If anything, there was a trend toward reduced magazine entries with D2-SPNs silencing, but this reduction was also present during LED OFF conditions. Notably, a similar trend occurred during Pavlovian training, when lever press manipulanda were unavailable and no silencing had been implemented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Overall, the present data do not provide a clear explanation for the enhanced magazine entry rates observed in eNpHR3.0 rats during the PIT test. Future studies using pure Pavlovian tasks without a competing instrumental response may be necessary to establish whether NAc-S SPNs modulate magazine entry performance.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Choice tests under NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing</title><p>The choice test data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref> revealed a significant Group × Lever × LED interaction. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that all groups retained the capacity to select between actions based on outcome value. However, the significant interaction suggested that NAc-S D1-SPNs silencing marginally attenuated this capacity. Caution is warranted before interpreting this finding as evidence for a role of NAc-S D1-SPNs in value-based decision-making. Several studies have demonstrated that NAc-S manipulations typically preserve such choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, previous work showed that NAc-S D1 receptor blockade impairs outcome-specific PIT while leaving value-based choice unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laurent et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore favor an alternative explanation for the observed marginal reduction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, viral transduction extended slightly into the nucleus accumbens core (NAc-C), a region critical for value-based decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parkes et al., 2015</xref>). The marginal impairment may therefore reflect inadvertent silencing of a small number of NAc-C D1-SPNs rather than a functional contribution from NAc-S D1-SPNs. Future studies specifically targeting a larger population of NAc-C D1-SPNs populations would help clarify this possibility.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107566.4.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Boston College</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Convincing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Important</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This study provides novel and <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that both dopamine D1 and D2 expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell are crucial for the expression of cue-guided action selection, a core component of decision-making.

Several approaches could provide this validation. Chemogenetic manipulation, as the reviewer suggested, represents one compelling option. Alternatively, immunohistochemical assessment of phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 (P-H3) oFers another promising avenue, given its established utility in reporting striatal SPNs plasticity in the dorsal striatum (Matamales et al., 2020). We hope to complete such an assessment in future work since it would address the limitations of previous work that relied solely on ERK1/2 phosphorylation measures in NAc-S SPNs (Laurent et al., 2014).
