inhibition to pyramidal neurons and other INs. Most recent work on INs has focused on subtypes distinguished by expression of Parvalbumin (PV), Somatostatin (SST), or Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP). However, a fourth group that includes neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) has been less well characterized due to a lack of genetic tools. Here, we show that these INs can be accessed experimentally using intersectional genetics with the gene <italic>Id2</italic>. We find that outside of layer 1 (L1), the majority of Id2 INs are NGFCs that express high levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and exhibit a late-spiking firing pattern, with extensive local connectivity. While much sparser, non-NGFC Id2 INs had more variable properties, with most cells corresponding to a diverse group of INs that strongly expresses the neuropeptide CCK. In vivo, using silicon probe recordings, we observed several distinguishing aspects of NGFC activity, including a strong rebound in activity immediately following the cortical down state during NREM sleep. Our study provides insights into IN diversity and NGFC distribution and properties, and outlines an intersectional genetics approach for further study of this underappreciated group of INs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GABAergic Interneurons</kwd><kwd>neurogliaform cells</kwd><kwd>Id2</kwd><kwd>cortical inhibition</kwd><kwd>intersectional genetics</kwd><kwd>in vivo recordings</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01NS074972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudy</surname><given-names>Bernardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS110079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudy</surname><given-names>Bernardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19NS107616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buzsáki</surname><given-names>György</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Id2 GABAergic interneurons represent a fourth major group of local inhibitory neurons that includes neurogliaform cells, and these neurons can be targeted using intersectional genetics, revealing their distinctive connectivity and in vivo activity properties.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neocortex is comprised of two primary neuronal classes: pyramidal cells that release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and interneurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Pyramidal neurons project their axons locally and distally to form extended circuit ensembles across cortical and subcortical areas, whereas GABAergic interneurons (INs) typically project their axons locally to regulate the excitability of nearby pyramidal cells and other INs. Pyramidal neurons share a common dendritic structure characterized by an apical dendrite that typically extends up towards the pial surface with extensive arborization in cortical layer 1 (L1), a cell sparse region that receives diverse long-range cortical and thalamic axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Munoz and Arbuthnott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Souza and Burkhalter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ibrahim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schuman et al., 2021</xref>). In combination with its basal dendrite and somatic inputs, the pyramidal neuron thus has the ability to distinguish and integrate inputs from bottom-up and top-down sources in real-time, a key feature that enables dynamic cortical activity and adaptability during the animal’s interactions with the external world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schuman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aru et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the morphological diversity of IN dendrites and axons was noted over a century ago by Ramón y Cajal, recent work has begun to elucidate how this specialization of IN subtypes allows for compartment-specific inhibition across the entire pyramidal neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). The discovery of molecular markers in tandem with electrophysical and morphological approaches has enabled the delineation of several major IN groups and subtypes, each with distinctive roles in the cortical circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). INs that express the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein parvalbumin (PV), which account for ~40% of the GABAergic INs in neocortex, exhibit fast-spiking properties, with most projecting their axons to form perisomatic baskets on nearby pyramidal neuron soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). In layer 4 of sensory cortical areas, these PV INs form a canonical circuit in which they provide feedforward inhibition of excitatory neurons receiving core thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>). A distinct but less abundant subtype of PV INs are the chandelier cells, whose axons form cartridge-like inputs on the pyramidal neuron axon initial segment, thereby enabling control and coordination of the axonal output of pyramidal neuron ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Inan and Anderson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gallo et al., 2020</xref>). Somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons (accounting for ~30% of the INs) represent a second major group of INs, with the majority characterized by an ascending axonal arbor that targets the distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells (SST Martinotti cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Riedemann, 2019</xref>). A third major group of INs is distinguished by the expression of the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP); these interneurons account for ~12% of the INs in the neocortex and include cells that preferentially target other interneurons, particularly SST INs, and thus act to disinhibit the local circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kullander and Topolnik, 2021</xref>). The vast majority of recent studies exploring the roles of INs in cortical function have focused on these three groups, in no small part due to the establishment of genetic tools in rodents for targeting and manipulating the activity of each group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>). This body of work has revealed how IN diversity facilitates greater flexibility and computational power in cortical circuits.</p><p>In addition to the three main IN groups described above, there remains an additional population of GABAergic interneurons (about 18% of the INs in the neocortex) that have been much less studied. This IN population is particularly enriched in superficial layers of the neocortex, and includes ~90% of the INs in layer 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>) as well as neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) in all layers and CCK basket cells (CCK BCs), two IN types previously identified in the neocortex that do not express PV, SST or VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kisvárday et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galarreta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>). NGFCs are an interneuron type that exhibits several remarkable properties, including an extremely high degree of output connectivity to other cells (pyramidal neurons and other INs) and the ability to induce postsynaptic GABA-B responses following a single action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tamás et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oláh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015</xref>). CCK BCs are a rare species in the neocortex whose synapses on pyramidal neurons exhibit endocannabinoid mediated depolarization induced suppression of inhibition (DSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galarreta et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cortical GABAergic INs are specified during embryogenesis in the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences of the ventral telencephalon (MGE and CGE, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wamsley and Fishell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lim et al., 2018</xref>), with a fraction of non-MGE derived INs originating from the preoptic area (POA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gelman et al., 2009</xref>). All cortical PV and SST INs arise from Nkx2.1+progenitors within the MGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), and express Lhx6 during tangential migration and in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liodis et al., 2007</xref>). Cortical CGE derived INs, i.e., the non-PV, non-SST subtypes labeled in the Htr3a(BAC)-EGFP mouse line (the 5HT3aR INs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) can be divided into two primary populations: VIP- and non-VIP-expressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vucurovic et al., 2010</xref>). While transgenic targeting approaches for PV, SST, and VIP INs have been developed and widely implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2016</xref>), accessing non-VIP CGE (or 5HT3aR) INs – a fourth major IN group – has been challenging due to a lack of genetic strategies to target this population, and therefore the IN subtypes present in this population are not well characterized.</p><p>Here, we show that Id2 is a marker for the INs in the neocortex that do not express PV, SST or VIP, including the non-VIP cells in L1, NGFCs in L2-6 and a variety of CCK INs. Using intersectional genetic strategies to label and optogenetically stimulate Id2 INs, we find that the vast majority of Id2 INs in L2-6 are NPY-expressing NGFCs that exhibit the late-spiking firing pattern and broad connectivity characteristic of these cells. In contrast, the much rarer non-NGFC Id2 INs display diverse firing patterns and DSI but sparse local connectivity. Combining opto-tagging with silicon probe recordings, we observe several intriguing features of NGFC in vivo behavior, such as a robust rebound in activity immediately following the cortical down states during NREM sleep. Thus, our work furthers the study of IN diversity and enables genetic access to a group of INs that despite their potent GABAergic output have remained somewhat overlooked to date.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We examined cortical single-cell transcriptome data (scRNAseq) from the Allen Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>) and observed that expression of the Id2 gene was highly enriched in the INs in their collection that do not express PV, SST, or VIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mayer et al., 2018</xref>). The Id2 IN population includes cells that express markers known to be present in non-VIP CGE INs such as Reelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyoshi et al., 2010</xref>), and NPY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kubota et al., 2011b</xref>), as well as the more recently identified markers NDNF, Lamp5 and Sncg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). Updated and expanded cortical and hippocampal scRNAseq data from the Allen Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Institute for Brain Science, 2023</xref>) confirms that Id2 is a useful marker for studying non-PV, SST, or VIP INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To develop a transgenic approach to target Id2 INs, we took advantage of an existing Id2-CreER driver line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>) that expresses a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Metzger et al., 1995</xref>). Since Id2 is also expressed in pyramidal and non-neuronal cell types in the cortex, we crossed the Id2-CreER driver with a pan-IN Flp driver (Dlx5/6-Flpe; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miyoshi et al., 2010</xref>) such that only Id2 INs would be targeted with intersectional reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In combination with the Cre and Flp dependent tdTomato reporter Ai65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>), this intersectional genetics approach yielded labeling of INs in all cortical layers of the somatosensory cortex barrel field (S1BF) following tamoxifen administration (3–4 doses between P21 and P35; see Materials and methods) to activate the CreER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Id2 expression delineates a fourth major group of INs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Public scRNAseq data (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; comprised of ~3000 INs purified from the visual cortex, with transcriptome diversity represented as tSNE plots; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mayer et al., 2018</xref>) underlying the hypothesis that the non-VIP CGE-derived IN population can be distinguished by the expression of <italic>Id2</italic>.

A small fraction of these MGE-derived NGFCs is located in the neocortex; these are the sparse deep layer Lamp5/Lhx6 cells described and characterized previously by us using intersectional genetics with Id2 (Id2-CreER; Nkx2.1-Flpo; Ai65) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krienen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Valero et al., 2021</xref>).

We found that in the LS cells located in deeper layers, the axonal arbor was also asymmetrical, but often extended in the vertical (columnar) direction.

We also observed that a small minority of the non-LS Id2 cells in L2/3 (~15%) were likely α7 cells, a L1 Id2 IN subtype typically localized in the deeper part of L1, which has a bursting firing pattern that can be distinguished from other L2/3 bursting cells by the properties of the burst, significantly lower input resistance, and morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>). The histological analysis showed that the majority (~80% in L2/3) of the non-NPY Id2 cells strongly express the neuropeptide CCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). CCK is expressed at varying levels by many types of cortical neurons, including GABAergic and glutamatergic cells; however, it is particularly high in a group of GABAergic interneurons known as CCK-CB1R interneurons or CCK basket cells that have been described in the hippocampus and L2/3 of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galarreta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galarreta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De May and Ali, 2013</xref>). Although much less abundant than other GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex, they are of special interest because of their unique synaptic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</xref>). In particular, these cells express CB1 cannabinoid receptors in their presynaptic terminals that mediate a phenomenon known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pitler and Alger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wagner and Alger, 1996</xref>). Depolarization of a connected pyramidal cell leads to the release of endocannabinoids from the pyramidal cell that then bind to CB1 receptors located on the presynaptic terminals of the CCK basket cells, leading to suppression of GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilson and Nicoll, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohno-Shosaku et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that non-LS Id2 neurons include CCK basket cells, we first examined the effect of depolarization of a pyramidal cell on the PSP generated on L2/3 PCs by light stimulation of Id2 neurons expressing the engineered channelrhodopsin variant CatCh (Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai80; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kleinlogel et al., 2011</xref>). Depolarization of the PC reduced the synaptic response by ~20%, and this reduction was prevented by application of the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>) suggesting that some of the presynaptic cells innervating the cell had undergone DSI. In paired recordings of L2/3 LS Id2 cells and PCs, we found that the synaptic response elicited by NGFCs did not undergo DSI (n=9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, in paired recordings of non-LS Id2 cells (of 46 nonLS-PC pairs tested, only 9 (20%) were connected), we observed DSI in three out of the five pairs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Of the cells showing DSI, two were irregular spiking and one was bursting; of the two cells that did not show DSI, one was burst spiking and the other was a putative α7 cell. These results indicate that the partial suppression of GABA release observed when the whole population of Id2 cells is stimulated is occurring primarily on the terminals of the non-LS Id2 cells. Consistent with this, the proportion of the GABAergic response elicited by light activation of Id2 cells that was suppressed by depolarization of the post-synaptic PC is similar to the representation of non-LS cells in the L2/3 Id2 population. These observations, together with the molecular analysis, suggest that the majority of the non-LS Id2 cells are CCK basket cells. The morphology of IS and BS non-LS Id2 cells was similar, but quite distinct from the NGFCs, with significantly longer dendrites and a less symmetrical and much less dense axonal arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the published morphologies of CCK basket cells in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galarreta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De May and Ali, 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The non-LS Id2 population exhibits DSI.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol used for revealing depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI).

Control IPSCs were elicited by light pulses of 2ms in duration. Then, after a 60 s interval, the PC was stepped to +10 mV for 5 s, and after a 2 s recovery, another IPSC was elicited in the same manner. (<bold>B</bold>) Sample traces from optogenetic experiments.

Also, the average decrease post-depolarization in Control vs. AM251 was significant by a two-tailed unpaired t-test (p=0.002). (<bold>D</bold>) A subset of five cells was tested in which the DSI protocol was carried out with (dp+) or without (dp-) a depolarization to +10 mV to control for variability or rundown of the synaptic current.

The mouse lines used for these experiments were Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai65 or the same with the addition of an NPY-hrGFP allele to facilitate the identification of nonLS cells.

In contrast, putative Id2 NGFC INs exhibited relatively consistent firing rates across all conditions, with moderately increased activity during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). During NREM sleep, the cortex interleaves periods of high spiking activity (up-states) with transient silences (down-states) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Valero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>). To gain insights into the nature of the firing dynamics of Id2 INs during sleep, we aligned the activity of all recorded neurons to the peak of the down-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Most of the neurons decreased their activity during down states, and steadily recovered their baseline activity after the down-state (post-down; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Putative Id2 NGFCs decreased their activity during down states to a similar extent as the other cell groups, but strongly increased their firing above baseline levels immediately following the termination of the down-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, bottom;~4 s.d. above pre-down rate for Id2; 0.2, 0.6 and –0.03 for PC, NW and WW, respectively). This rebound in activity was observed in the majority of the putative Id2 NGFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, right; 64% of the Id2 NGFCs vs. 7%, 14% and 1% for the PC, NW, and WW interneurons, respectively; p&lt;10<sup>–10</sup>, chi-squared test) and was negatively correlated with the degree of firing suppression during down-states for the Id2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that intrinsic membrane properties of the Id2 INs could be mediating, at least in part, their increased activity after down-states. No other neuron group showed a significant correlation between down and post-down state activity, notwithstanding the considerably bigger sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Furthermore, Id2 INs fired at an early position during the up-states sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), as estimated by the normalized rank order during the detected up-state epochs (see Materials and methods).</p><p>Finally, to understand how Id2 IN activity impacts cortical circuit dynamics in vivo, we performed optogenetic stimulation of the Id2 IN population and analyzed which fraction of putative PC, NW, or WW were suppressed (neg mod in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), activated (pos mod) or unchanged (no mod). Light stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in firing rate for about half of the population of all considered cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), consistent with the broad direct inhibition expected from NGFCs. PCs in the supra-granular layers were more frequently suppressed than deeper layer PCs, while both NW and WW INs showed the opposite trend across lamina. Interestingly, we also observed a slow positive activity modulation of a subset of INs, and to a lesser extent PCs, following stimulation of Id2 INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; darker quantiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Positively modulated responses consistently lagged the negative responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>), suggesting an indirect disinhibitory mechanism for the positive responses. Overall, we find that the recruitment of Id2 INs leads to a wide range of response dynamics throughout the cortical column, including both inhibitory and to a lesser extent, relatively slower disinhibitory effects.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Circuit effects of Id2 IN stimulation in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fraction of negatively modulated (neg mod), positively modulated (pos mod), and unmodulated neurons (no mod) in the PC, NW and WW groups across cortical layers.

Identification of differentially expressed genes has enhanced our ability to design and implement genetic strategies to label and experimentally manipulate defined populations of INs in order to understand their specialized functions in cortical circuitry. However, several critical issues have emerged from this body of work that require consideration. Differentially expressed genes that exhibit distinct labeling patterns as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or in situ hybridization (ISH) may also be expressed at lower levels in broader cell populations that escape detection with those methods. In transgenic animals expressing recombinases such as Cre, labeling strategies that utilize viral or genetically encoded Cre-dependent reporters typically reveal these additional populations due to the lower expression threshold required for labeling with these genetic methods compared to IHC or ISH. For example, expression of the marker CCK as assessed by IHC or ISH has been used to identify subsets of INs with relatively high levels of CCK, but the use of CCK-Cre with a genetic reporter results in much more extensive labeling of INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) as well as pyramidal cells.</p><p>Another important consideration is the developmental trajectory of marker gene expression, in that the adult expression pattern for a particular marker may be much more restricted than its cumulative expression. This appears to be the case for the marker 5HT3aR (Htr3a), where expression of EGFP from a BAC transgenic mouse line labels virtually <italic>all</italic> non-PV or SST INs (i.e. all the CGE-derived INs), a finding that led to the conclusion that PV, SST and 5HT3aR INs account for all the INs in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rudy et al., 2011</xref>). We compared labeling efficiencies obtained with a knock in Htr3a-Flpo line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>) with that of an Htr3a(BAC)-Cre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>) and the Htr3a(BAC)-EGFP line used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2010</xref>, and found that two copies of the Htr3a-Flpo driver could largely recapitulate the cell labeling observed with the higher copy number BAC transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This result, along with ISH images of Htr3a expression at embryonic and adult ages (e.g. Allen Brain Atlas) is consistent with broad but transient Htr3a expression in non-PV/non-SST INs that then becomes restricted to a subpopulation of these INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Prönneke et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Use of BAC transgenics has turned out to be more complicated than expected since each transgenic founder harbors its own positional and copy number variation. The Htr3a(BAC)-EGFP founder line was specifically chosen over others for high levels of EGFP expression. In hindsight, this likely contributed to its pan-CGE IN expression pattern, whereas endogenous Htr3a expression appears to be broad but transient in most CGE INs following their specification, being largely restricted to VIP/CCK and Sncg IN subtypes at adult ages. In contrast to the Htr3a(BAC)-EGFP line, the Htr3a(BAC)-Cre founder was selected based on its cumulative recombination pattern with the cre-dependent tdTomato reporter Ai9, and likely has a much lower copy number or genomic insertion location that results in its expression being closer to the endogenous Htr3a gene. The Htr3a-Flpo line is a single copy knock in whose cumulative labeling with the tdTomato reporter Ai65F is less efficient overall than that seen with either BAC transgenic line, most likely due to the lower/transient expression of Flpo in most CGE INs.</p><p>Leveraging the scRNAseq resources provided by the Allen Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>), we identified Id2 as a marker for the vast majority of the INs that do not express PV, SST, or VIP. While Id2 is also expressed in pyramidal neurons and several non-neuronal cell types, we employed intersectional genetics with a pan-IN driver (Dlx5/6-Flpe) to restrict labeling to Id2 INs. This labeling approach relies on the use of an Id2-CreER driver, which has its own pros and cons: tamoxifen induction of cre activity in Id2 cells in P21 or older animals avoids spurious cell labeling arising from developmental Id2 expression, but the efficiency of CreER-mediated recombination can be highly variable from animal to animal depending on the effectiveness of tamoxifen administration. Overall, in well-labeled brains, we found that Id2 INs comprised ~18% of the total IN population in S1BF, which is consistent with our previous estimates for the prevalence of non-PV/non-SST/non-VIP INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). In L1, a layer consisting only of GABAergic INs, we previously identified three distinct subpopulations of non-PV/non-SST/non-VIP INs: NGFCs, canopy cells, and α7 cells, which together accounted for ~90% of the neurons in this layer, with the remaining 10% consisting of VIP INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>). Using our Id2 intersectional genetic strategy, we find that 83% of L1 INs are labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), close to the expected 90% of non-PV/non-SST/non-VIP INs, suggesting that all non-VIP INs in L1 are Id2 cells.</p><p>In L2-5, we find that Id2 INs are mostly comprised of NGFCs (~87%), with the remainder consisting of a diverse CCK +IN population. While to date NGFCs have mainly been recorded in superficial layers (L1-3), here we observe that NGFCs are present in all layers, including deep layers, but are enriched in L2/3. On the other hand, CCK +INs are mainly located in superficial L2/3 along the border with L1 and in L6. As previously shown for the 5HT3aR INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>), compared to L4-5, the proportion of Id2 INs increases in L6, where this group accounts for about 15% of all INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Within the L6 Id2 population, about 60% were NPY+ (putative NGFCs), and about 25% were strongly CCK+, with about 10% unaccounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Within the Id2 NGFC in L6, a subset originates from the MGE (i.e., Nkx2.1 lineage) and exhibit a striking anti-correlated activity pattern, with peak activity during cortical down-states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Valero et al., 2021</xref>). We did not observe down-state active cells in our Id2 IN recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that NGFCs of CGE origin (the majority of cortical NGFCs) behave in a distinct manner in vivo. Thus, like L1, L6 is a specialized case that merits its own study to elucidate the diverse IN species that reside there.</p><p>The massive scale of a recent transcriptomic cell type survey from the Allen Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yao et al., 2021</xref>) offers an unprecedented look at neocortical and hippocampal IN diversity, and presents the opportunity to assess the expression profile of specific genes across all IN types. Focusing on the ‘CGE’ branch of interneurons, we find that Id2 expression largely encompasses the ‘Lamp5’ and ‘Sncg’ branches of their online dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is important to note that neither Lamp5 or Sncg are uniformly expressed across the different subtypes in their respective branches. In the case of Sncg, many of the CCK +subtypes within that branch express low if any <italic>Sncg</italic> mRNA itself (e.g. within the Serpinf1 sub-branch). Furthermore, there is substantial overlap with VIP in the Sncg population overall (~50% of cells), but this VIP/Sncg population does not appear to be well labeled using our Id2 strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), likely due to the lower levels of Id2 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The recent development of new drivers for Lamp5 (Lamp5-Flpo; Jax #037340) and Sncg (Sncg-Flpo; Jax#034424) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>) will enable new transgenic targeting approaches for these respective IN populations, but the breadth and specificity of labeling achieved with these new driver lines remain to be determined. Future work will hopefully resolve how this relatively sparse but remarkably diverse CCK +IN population functions within the cortex, and whether some of these cells might relate to primate-specific CCK +IN types such as the rosehip cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldog et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The genetic strategies described here have also facilitated the in vivo recording of NGFCs. Outside of L1, where NGFCs express NDNF, a gene that has been used to facilitate the identification and in vivo recording of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen-Kashi Malina et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2021</xref>), recording of NGFCs has been limited to blind recordings followed by post-hoc identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sakalar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuentealba et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>), a very low yield approach. Here, we combined optogenetic labeling via Id2 intersectional genetics with silicon probe recordings to identify putative NGFCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We identified 11 Id2 INs located approximately in L3-5 where the vast majority (&gt;90%) of Id2 INs are NGFCs, as defined by histology and electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). We found that these putative NGFCs have a number of unique properties, including relatively constant firing rates throughout different brain states and a strong rebound in activity immediately following the down-state during NREM sleep. We also found that optogenetic stimulation of Id2 INs produced broad inhibition of PCs and other INs, with roughly half of all cells across cortical layers exhibiting a decrease in activity. The notable rebound in NGFC activity following the down-state, together with the extensive output connectivity of these neurons, suggests an important role for this form of GABAergic inhibition in setting the stage for new incoming information during bouts of cortical activity. Future work will certainly continue to elucidate the function of this distinctive GABAergic cell type in regulating cortical circuitry.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Fluorescence in situ hybridization for NPY and tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>), with the following primers used to amplify templates for labeled cRNA antisense probe synthesis: NPY fwd primer: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">tcacagaggcacccagagc</named-content>-3’; NPY rev primer (w/T7 sequence): 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">attaatacgactcactatagcggagtccagcctagtggtg</named-content>-3’; tdTomato fwd: 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">atcaaagagttcatgcgcttc</named-content>-3’; tdTomato rev primer (w/T7 sequence): 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">cattaatacgactcactatagggttccacgatggtgtagtcctc</named-content>-3’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Adult transgenic mice of either sex (postnatal day range 30–120; mean age = 52 days) were terminally anesthetized with isoflurane, and once unresponsive, were transcardially perfused with ice-cold sucrose-ACSF containing the following (in mM): 87 NaCl, 75 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose, 1.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2.0 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Next, the mice were decapitated and the brains were extracted. The caudal part of the brain was glued to a stage, such that the rostral part of the brain was pitched forward 15⁰. The stage was then placed into a chamber filled with bubbled ice-cold sucrose ACSF, and the brain was sliced into 300 µm-thick coronal sections using a Leica VT1200S vibratome. The slices were incubated at 35 °C for 30 min in the above sucrose solution or the recording-ACSF described below and then transferred to room temperature for at least 1 hr before recording commenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology recordings</title><p>Slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with ACSF containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 21 glucose, 0.4 Na-Ascorbate, 2 Na-Pyruvate, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained at 29–32°C. For some experiments, the bath solution contained the NMDA receptor blocker D-AP5 (25 µM; Abcam), the AMPA receptor blocker CNQX (10 µM; Abcam), or the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor blocker CGP-35348 (60 µM; Tocris). Neurons were visualized on an upright Olympus microscope (BX50WI or BX51WI) using DIC and fluorescence illumination from an LED power source (Mightex) for tdTomato and/or GFP. All neurons were recorded in the barrel field of the primary somatosensory cortex in layers 2–5. Layers were identified visually under DIC optics using several features. The L1-2 border was marked by a sharp increase in soma density from L1. The L3-4 border was identified under 4 x power by the top of the barrels, the presence of horizontal fibers under 40 x (in L4), and the absence of pyramidal cells (PCs) seen in L2/3. L5a was a clear band below L4 and the L5b-6 border was determined under 40 x by a sharp drop in PCs. Neurons were recorded in whole-neuron patch-clamp in current clamp and voltage clamp mode using an internal solution containing (in mM): 130 K-Gluconate, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, and 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3–0.5% biocytin, and titrated with 1 M KOH to a final pH of 7.3. Glass pipettes were pulled on a horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments) using borosilicate glass (inner/outer diameter 1.5 mm / 0.86 mm) and had resistances of 2–6 MΩ. Before gaining whole-neuron access, a gigaseal was obtained, and the pipette capacitance was compensated. Access resistances were monitored throughout recordings and were completely compensated. The intrinsic properties of neurons with access resistances &gt;40 MΩ were not analyzed. All data were collected using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), a Digidata digitizer (1440 A or 1550B series, Molecular Devices), and Clampex version (10.6 or 10.7) software (Molecular Devices); data were sampled at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 10 kHz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiological characterization and analysis</title><p>A total of 178 cells were recorded. This includes a sample of 76 cells that were randomly selected for patching, and this group was used to determine the proportions of each type. In addition, neurons were recorded in the same Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai65 mice but recordings were biased to superficial layer 2/3 to maximize the chances of obtaining non-LS Id2 INs. Lastly, a third group included cells from animals where NPY cells were labeled with GFP (i.e., Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai65; NPY-hrGFP) to facilitate the identification of non-LS Id2 INs. Neurons were characterized for intrinsic and active properties in current-clamp mode from a resting potential of ~–70 mV. Neurons were injected with 1 s long square pulses of increasing current. Parameters relating to the neuron’s intrinsic and active properties were assessed as follows:</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>First spike latency and cell type classification</title><p>Once rheobase was determined, several current steps were delivered at rheobase to characterize the behavior of the cell. The recorded cells fell into three readily separable groups. The first and most numerous group exhibited a single-spike at rheobase with latencies of &gt;500ms and were termed late-spiking (LS). The second group displayed a high-frequency (&gt;100 Hz) burst of two or more APs at rheobase and were termed burst-spiking (BS). The third group of cells had single spikes at rheobase with short latencies (&lt;100ms) consistent with the charging of the membrane capacitance (first AP latency normalized to membrane τ, mean ± SEM: 4.3±0.5 compared to LS: 70.1±4.1). These cells also exhibited irregular spiking (CV of ISI: 0.112±0.029 vs 0.053±0.004 in LS, p=0.0066, Mann-Whitney Test, see the section below for how CV of ISI was measured) and were classified as irregular-spiking (IS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Input resistance</title><p>This was determined from Ohm’s Law based on the voltage response to a 150ms long negative voltage step of typically 20 pA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Membrane time constant (τ)</title><p>This was determined by fitting an exponential decay to the voltage response from 1 s long current pulses below rheobase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>AP waveform properties</title><p>To measure these properties, only the first APs from each sweep were considered, as APs in neurons with initial bursts tended to widen significantly for subsequent APs, and all such APs from sweeps with total AP counts &lt;50 were considered. AP threshold and peak were calculated first and then t=0 was defined at the time of AP peak. AP threshold was the voltage reading when the voltage derivative was 20 mV/ms. AP peak amplitude was the maximum voltage reached in the 2ms after the threshold was passed. AP half-width was the time of the AP when the voltage was above the midpoint between the threshold and peak. The afterhyperpolarization (AHP) was calculated as the difference in voltage between the AP threshold and AP reset (minimum voltage in 10ms window after AP peak). Finally, AP max and decay slopes were the maximum and minimum values for dV/dt reached in the 10ms after the threshold was passed. Parameters were calculated separately for each AP and then averaged together for the mean neuronal value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Rheobase and firing rates</title><p>Rheobase was determined to be the current step that resulted in a single spike, or for bursting cells, a single burst. The firing rate was measured for each voltage sweep by counting the number of spikes in the sweep and taking or interpolating the value at 2 x rheobase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Spike frequency adaptation</title><p>For LS cells, spike frequency adaptation was measured at 2 x rheobase and near rheobase, during the first depolarization where a spike train was observed throughout the pulse (1.3 x rheobase). For IS and BS cells, the adaptation index was only measured at 2 x rheobase, since near rheobase, firing was often highly irregular. The adaptation index was measured as follows: For each voltage sweep during which the neuron spiked at least six times (five ISIs), an exponential function, f<sub>adap</sub>(t), was fit to the firing-rate vs. time plot. The adaptation index (AI) for that sweep was defined as AI = f<sub>adap</sub>(1000ms) / f<sub>adap</sub>(100ms), and the values at 1.3 x rheobase or 2 x rheobase were taken or interpolated to represent adaptation for the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>Spiking regularity</title><p>For each voltage sweep, all inter-spike intervals (ISIs) from the last 500ms of the current step were considered.

Blue light (470 nm) pulses (2 ms /&gt;100 mA) were delivered to the slice using TTL-pulses to a Mightex brand LED under 40 x power with the PC soma centered. Optically evoked IPSCs were recorded under a voltage clamp at a holding potential of –50 mV with D-AP5 and CNQX present to block glutamatergic transmission and CGP 35348 to block the large GABA<sub>B</sub> component of the current characteristic of NGFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>). Cannabinoid dependence of DSI was assessed by optogenetic experiments carried out in the presence of the CB1 receptor blocker AM251 (10 µM; Abcam).</p><p>For paired recordings, Id2 neurons were identified as tdT +soma in the Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai65 mouse line or tdT+/GFP ± somas in the Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai65; NPY-hrGFP cross. The Id2 firing pattern was briefly characterized, and the neuron was tagged as late-spiking (LS), irregular-spiking (IS), or burst-spiking (BS). A nearby PC was also patched (Id2-PC inter-soma distance range 10–130 µm, average distance ± SEM = 53±4), and connectivity to the Id2 cell was assessed under voltage-clamp for both cells by eliciting escape spikes from the Id2 cell and looking for the presence of IPSCs in the PC at a holding voltage of –50 mV. If a connection was not seen, either a new Id2-PC pair was tested, or the PC pipette was withdrawn with the Id2 neuron still held, and another nearby PC was patched and tested. If a connection was identified, then the DSI protocol was run as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Morphology</title><p>During whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, neurons were held for at least 15 min with an internal solution containing ~0.4 or~1.0% biocytin. Some slices, especially the ones with neurons held close to 15 min, were retransferred to the incubation chamber to allow for more biocytin diffusion inside the recorded cell. After filling, the slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (diluted from a 32% stock; Electron Microscopy Sciences cat#15714) for 1–7 days at 4 °C. Fixed slices were then thoroughly washed with PBS and left overnight at 4 °C in a 0.4% streptavidin (AlexaFluor 647 conjugate; Invitrogen) solution (498 µl 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, 2 µl streptavidin per slice). Slices were then washed in PBS, mounted with Fluoromount-G (Invitrogen) on a glass microscope slide, and imaged under a 40–63 x oil-immersion objective using a confocal microscope (Zeiss). Confocal images were then used to morphologically reconstruct neurons in three dimensions using Neurolucida. In a few cases, cells were juxtacellularly labeled and processed using CUBIC before morphological reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Silicon probe implantation and recordings</title><p>Mice (n=5, 28–35 g, 3–10 months old) were implanted with 64-site silicon probes (NeuroNexus, Cambridge NeuroTech or Diagnostic Biochips) in the PPC (AP 2.0 mm, ML 1.75 mm, DL 0.6 mm), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Valero et al., 2021</xref>). Ground and reference wires were implanted in the skull above the cerebellum, and a grounded copper mesh hat was constructed, protecting, and electrically shielding, the probes. Probes were mounted on plastic microdrives that were advanced to layer 6 over the course of 5–8 d after surgery. A 100–200 μm fiber optic was attached to one of the shanks of the silicon probe. After implantation, animals were allowed to recover for at least 1 week and were housed individually under standard conditions (71–73 °F and 40–50% relative humidity) in the animal facility and kept on a 12 h reverse light/dark cycle. We recorded the mice while they slept or walked around freely in the home cage, and the recording session started 1–2 hr after the onset of the dark phase. Electrophysiological data were acquired using an Intan RHD2000 system (Intan Technologies LLC) digitized with a 30 kHz rate. The wide-band signal was downsampled to 1.25 kHz and used as the LFP signal. For optogenetic tagging of specific neuron types, blue laser light (450 nm, Osram) pulses were delivered in the PPC/V1. The maximum light power at the tip of the optic fiber was 1–4 mW. 100 ms light pulses with 70% of the maximum power were delivered (n=500–1000 times at each intensity at 400±200 ms random intervals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Unit activity analysis</title><p>Spike sorting was performed semi-automatically with KiloSort 1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort">https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_016422">SCR_016422</ext-link>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Valero et al., 2021</xref>) and using our own pipeline KilosortWrapper (a wrapper for KiloSort, DOI; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/brendonw1/KilosortWrapper">https://github.com/brendonw1/KilosortWrapper</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peterson et al., 2020</xref>).

Pyramidal cell (PC), narrow waveform (NW) INs and wide waveform interneurons (WW) were tentatively separated based on these two clusters.

Briefly, spectrograms were constructed with a 1 s sliding 10 s window FFT of 1250 Hz data at log-spaced frequencies between 1 and 100 Hz. Three types of signals were used for state scoring: broadband LFP, narrowband theta frequency LFP, and electromyogram (EMG). For broadband LFP signal, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to the z-transformed (1–100 Hz) spectrogram. The first principal components in all cases were based on power in the low (&lt;20 Hz) frequency range and had negatively weighted power in the higher (&gt;32 Hz) frequencies. The state scoring algorithm was performed by a series of divisions with thresholds set at the trough between the peaks of distributions in these three metrics. After automated brain state scoring, all states were manually reviewed by the experimenter. The awake-sleep index was estimated as (rate<sup>Awake</sup> - rate<sup>Sleep</sup>)/ (rate<sup>Awake</sup> +rate<sup>Sleep</sup>), where rate<sup>Awake</sup> is the average between the firing rate during Run and Quiet, and rate<sup>Sleep</sup> was the average between REM sleep and NREM sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with standard MATLAB functions or GraphPad Prism.

All data presented were obtained from experimental replicates with at least four independent experimental repeats for each assay. All attempts of replication were successful. Data collection was not performed blinded to the subject conditions. Data analysis was performed blinded to the scorer or did not require manual scoring.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sacha Nelson as the Reviewing Editor (Reviewer #1) and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission also agreed to reveal their identity: SRamesh Chittajallu (Reviewer #2); Ariel Agmon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Each of the reviewers has made multiple suggestions for clarification and or additional analyses likely to improve the impact of the paper. All of these suggestions are included below. Many of the points can be addressed with textual or figure changes and nearly all should be addressable without requiring additional experiments. Additional experiments, while recommended, are not deemed essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The idea that activation of these neurons &quot;…might drive a widespread switch&quot; (line 381) is a bit hard to square with what I presume are rather modest changes in firing rate. The changes in firing rates following circuit stimulation should be reported in Hz. (or in Hz and SD). The translation between Hz and SD is difficult to assess, but the fact that the changes in rate are only from ~3 to ~2 from wake to sleep, suggests that the changes following stimulation correspond to relatively small changes in rate. The reason this is important to assess is that the synaptic output of these neurons and hence their impact on the circuit is likely dependent on their rate of firing. The idea of a &quot;widespread switch&quot; implies a very large impact. But it is not clear this is supported. I find it significant that any impact can be demonstrated following the stimulation of a modest number of interneurons, so I do not think it is necessary to oversell this. On the other hand, if the authors really do think the data support the &quot;widespread switch&quot; model, the reader could use some more convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure S1 is rather confusing in its layout particularly since the reference to it in the manuscript is limited to two very brief sentences. It may be helpful for clarity if the authors expand a little in the text to explain the data distilled in this supplemental figure since, along with Figure 1, it sets the rationale for the genetic strategy employed.</p><p>2. Although the main focus, in this manuscript is L2-L5 it would be useful in the context of the authors' previous publication to mention perhaps in the discussion whether the layer 1 reported cells using the current strategy labels canopy cells as well.</p><p>3. Lns 346-349. It appears that a substantial number of INs are reported in Layer 6 of the Id2Cre:Dlx5/6flp (Figure 1C) when compared to that in Id2Cre:Nkx2-1Flp mouse. Since approximately 60% (Figure 2) are NPY this suggests there are significant CGE NFCS in this deep layer in addition to the sparse number of MGE-derived ones previously investigated. At the very least, an example of their morphology and basic characterization of their firing properties should be included to add to Figure 3 and Table 1. In light of their previous study (Valero et al., 2021), the authors should briefly discuss whether they suspect CGE vs MGE ID2 cells in layer 6 to perform similar functional roles and respond in a similar manner during network/behavioral states (i.e. embryonic origin redundant)?</p><p>4. The focus of Figures 3, 4 and Table 1 is to demonstrate morpho-functional differences between the LS and non-LS cells reported in Id2cre:Dlx5/6Flp mouse line. Although the characterization of intrinsic properties is well performed, the evaluation of the synaptic properties of LS and non-LS ID2 INs would benefit from some additional data. This figure could be fleshed out further as follows:</p><p>(a) Throughout the manuscript the authors point out the potentially widespread influence of NGFCs (e.g. ln 74-75) which is a consequence of the well-characterized volume transmission. However, they do not include the percentage success of attaining a paired recording between LS and non-LS ID2 cells and PCs – this would not require further experimentation since paired recordings have already been performed.</p><p>(b) In addition, it is well known that the decay of the GABAA IPSC is markedly prolonged when these receptors are activated by NGFCs – therefore a plot of this parameter demonstrating a clear contrast between LS and non-LS ID2 should be included. Again, this should not require further experimentation.</p><p>(c) The authors could also include sample traces of the pharmacologically isolated large GABAB-evoked current that is reminiscent of NGFCs (via optogenetic stimulation and/or paired recordings).</p><p>(d) Finally, the authors, use DSI as a measure of CB1 expression to demonstrate a divergence in the NGFC and CCK populations. This is a rather circuitous route to probe for functional CB1 receptors and a negative effect may not necessarily preclude functional CB1 receptor expression. A more direct method would be to perform ChR2 and paired recordings and assay the effects of CB1 receptor agonist (WIN55,212-2) on LS and non-LS ID2 cells mediated IPSC amplitude.</p><p>(e) Additional data to further highlight the advantage of using the Id2Cre:DLX5/6Flp mouse to increase the ease to which cortical NGFCs (particular in deeper layers) can be targeted to assess other aspects of their synaptic properties. Perhaps an aspect that has not been described/studied previously would be welcome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My comments are mostly recommendations to the author on using more precise language, enhancing their analysis, tightening the discussion of their results and conclusions, and adding citations to a few overlooked but important previous studies of NGFCs.</p><p>1. Please tone down a bit the description of NGFCs as &quot;neglected&quot;, &quot;enigmatic&quot;, or &quot;mysterious&quot; in the Title, Abstract, Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>2. The first paragraph in Results should be incorporated into the early part of the Introduction. The introduction needs to mention 5HT3aR neurons as a group that encompasses all (or most) CGE-derived interneurons (as described in previous work by the authors and others), and further subdivided into VIP- and non-VIP-expressing groups, the latter now being labeled by the new intersectional strategy.</p><p>3. Line 31: some references are expected at the end of this heavily loaded sentence.</p><p>4. Lines 50, 58: Although not explained, I assume that the 12% and 18% numbers come from the authors' previous estimate that VIP cells account for about 40% of 5HT3a cells, which in turn account for about 30% of all interneurons. However the product of two approximate numbers is still an approximate number, so it is important to explain here how the 12 and 18% estimates were derived lest readers take these numbers at face value. That these estimates were confirmed in the current study can be indicated later, in the Results and Discussion.</p><p>5. Line 90: Please add a citation of Vucurovic, K., Gallopin, T., Ferezou, I., Rancillac, A., Chameau, P., van Hooft, J. A., Geoffroy, H., Monyer, H., Rossier, J., and Vitalis, T. (2010).</p><p>6. Line 114: I assume that &quot;well-labeled brains&quot; refers to the more successful induction of CreER, as explained later in the Discussion; however this term is never defined. Somewhere in the manuscript the criteria for determining what is a &quot;well-labeled brain&quot; need to be enunciated.</p><p>7.

All of these suggestions are included below. Many of the points can be addressed with textual or figure changes and nearly all should be addressable without requiring additional experiments. Additional experiments, while recommended, are not deemed essential.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The idea that activation of these neurons &quot;…might drive a widespread switch&quot; (line 381) is a bit hard to square with what I presume are rather modest changes in firing rate. The changes in firing rates following circuit stimulation should be reported in Hz. (or in Hz and SD). The translation between Hz and SD is difficult to assess, but the fact that the changes in rate are only from ~3 to ~2 from wake to sleep, suggests that the changes following stimulation correspond to relatively small changes in rate. The reason this is important to assess is that the synaptic output of these neurons and hence their impact on the circuit is likely dependent on their rate of firing. The idea of a &quot;widespread switch&quot; implies a very large impact. But it is not clear this is supported. I find it significant that any impact can be demonstrated following the stimulation of a modest number of interneurons, so I do not think it is necessary to oversell this. On the other hand, if the authors really do think the data support the &quot;widespread switch&quot; model, the reader could use some more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the phrase “widespread switch” was not justified based on the available in vivo data. While it is significant that such a large percentage of putative excitatory cells are inhibited, particularly in L2/3 where NGFCs are most abundant, we don’t know how this compares with stimulating other INs such as PV or SST cells. We have now therefore removed this text, with the new version as follows: “We found that these putative NGFCs have a number of unique properties, including relatively constant firing rates throughout different brain states and a strong rebound in activity immediately following the down state during NREM sleep. We also found that optogenetic stimulation of Id2 INs produced widespread inhibition of PCs and other INs, with roughly half of all cells across cortical layers exhibiting a decrease in activity. The notable rebound in NGFC activity following the down state, together with the extensive output connectivity of these neurons, suggests an important role for this form of GABAergic inhibition in setting the stage for new incoming information during bouts of cortical activity”. (lines 420-428)</p><p>In addition, based on the reviewer suggestion we have now added an additional panel in Figure 6 (6C) that shows the changes in firing rates in Hz to complement Figure 6B (changes in firing rates shown as changes in SD). It is important to note that the overall circuit effects of Id2 INs (or other cells) stimulation are complex, with both inhibition and disinhibition observed over time. In both panels, the overall (mean) effects are shown for each class of cells (NW, WW, Pyr), along with the effects on subsets of the latter separated into quintiles based on response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Figure S1 is rather confusing in its layout particularly since the reference to it in the manuscript is limited to two very brief sentences. It may be helpful for clarity if the authors expand a little in the text to explain the data distilled in this supplemental figure since, along with Figure 1, it sets the rationale for the genetic strategy employed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have extensively revised Figure S1 (now Figure 1 —figure supplement 1; see response to Reviewer 1 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the main focus, in this manuscript is L2-L5 it would be useful in the context of the authors' previous publication to mention perhaps in the discussion whether the layer 1 reported cells using the current strategy labels canopy cells as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, based on the overall labeling in L1 (83%), our Id2 IN targeting strategy does label canopy cells as well as a7 cells. In our previous L1 work (Schuman et al., 2019) we estimated that ~90% of INs in L1 were non-VIP, which corresponds fairly well with the 83% labeling observed using Id2-CreER here (Figure 1E), particularly when taking into account some variability in labeling efficacy across Id2 IN subtypes. For example, while we could not assess canopy cells directly, we did observe that ~60% of the a7 cells in L1 (stained with fluorescent α-bungarotoxin as described in Schuman et al., 2019) were labeled in the Id2-CreER; Dlx5/6-Flpe; Ai65 animals.</p><p>The following text has been added to the Discussion: “Using our Id2 intersectional genetic strategy, we find that 83% of L1 INs are labeled (Figure 1E), close to the expected 90% of non-PV/non-SST/non-VIP INs, suggesting that all non-VIP INs in L1 are Id2 cells.” (lines 374-377)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lns 346-349. It appears that a substantial number of INs are reported in Layer 6 of the Id2Cre:Dlx5/6flp (Figure 1C) when compared to that in Id2Cre:Nkx2-1Flp mouse. Since approximately 60% (Figure 2) are NPY this suggests there are significant CGE NFCS in this deep layer in addition to the sparse number of MGE-derived ones previously investigated. At the very least, an example of their morphology and basic characterization of their firing properties should be included to add to Figure 3 and Table 1. In light of their previous study (Valero et al., 2021), the authors should briefly discuss whether they suspect CGE vs MGE ID2 cells in layer 6 to perform similar functional roles and respond in a similar manner during network/behavioral states (i.e. embryonic origin redundant)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a comparison of CGE vs MGE derived NGFC in L6 would be interesting; however, this is challenging at present since there is no straightforward genetic strategy to selectively label CGE derived NGFC. We did perform a comparison of electrophysiological properties between MGE NGFC (Id2/Nkx2.1) and L1 NGFC (NDNF/NPY; CGE derived) in Valero et al. 2021 which indicated that the two NGFC populations were largely similar. Based on the results from Valero et al. which showed that the sparse MGE NGFC in L6 comprise the majority of down state active cells, it appears that CGE NGFC in L6 (a much larger population than the MGE NGFC) are not down state active cells and thus behave in a distinct manner in vivo. Furthermore, we did not observe down-state active cells in our recordings of deep layer Id2 INs (e.g. Figure 5G).</p><p>We have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>“Within the Id2 NGFC in L6, a subset originates from the MGE (i.e., Nkx2.1 lineage) and exhibit a striking anti-correlated activity pattern, with peak activity during cortical down states (60). We did not observe down-state active cells in our Id2 IN recordings (Figure 5G), indicating that NGFC of CGE origin (the majority of cortical NGFC) behave in a distinct manner in vivo. Thus, like L1, L6 is a specialized case that merits its own study to elucidate the diverse IN species that reside there.” (lines 386-392)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The focus of Figures 3, 4 and Table 1 is to demonstrate morpho-functional differences between the LS and non-LS cells reported in Id2cre:Dlx5/6Flp mouse line. Although the characterization of intrinsic properties is well performed, the evaluation of the synaptic properties of LS and non-LS ID2 INs would benefit from some additional data. This figure could be fleshed out further as follows:</p><p>(a) Throughout the manuscript the authors point out the potentially widespread influence of NGFCs (e.g. ln 74-75) which is a consequence of the well-characterized volume transmission. However, they do not include the percentage success of attaining a paired recording between LS and non-LS ID2 cells and PCs – this would not require further experimentation since paired recordings have already been performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information that was previously only in the legend for Figure 4 to the Results: “In paired recordings of L2/3 LS Id2 cells and PCs, we observed a very high connection probability (70%; 19/27 pairs tested), consistent with previous observations and the hypothesis that NGFCs mediate volume transmission of GABA (40).” (lines 183-185)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) In addition, it is well known that the decay of the GABAA IPSC is markedly prolonged when these receptors are activated by NGFCs – therefore a plot of this parameter demonstrating a clear contrast between LS and non-LS ID2 should be included. Again, this should not require further experimentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the Results: “Finally, the decay of the IPSC elicited by NGFC is prolonged compared to other IN inputs; consistent with this, we found a significantly longer decay rate (80-20% of peak) for LS-PC pairs compared with non-LS-PC pairs (LS-PC: 51±8 ms, n=6 pairs; non-LS-PC: 16±3 ms, n=5 pairs; p=0.005, two-tailed unpaired t-test).” (lines 186-190)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Finally, the authors, use DSI as a measure of CB1 expression to demonstrate a divergence in the NGFC and CCK populations. This is a rather circuitous route to probe for functional CB1 receptors and a negative effect may not necessarily preclude functional CB1 receptor expression. A more direct method would be to perform ChR2 and paired recordings and assay the effects of CB1 receptor agonist (WIN55,212-2) on LS and non-LS ID2 cells mediated IPSC amplitude.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional paired recordings comparing LS and non-LS cell mediated IPSCs would be interesting; however, finding connected non-LS to Pyr pairs for these experiments was quite challenging. In the overall Id2 population, using optogenetics, we did observe DSI and found that this effect was blocked by the CB1R-specific antagonist AM251 (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My comments are mostly recommendations to the author on using more precise language, enhancing their analysis, tightening the discussion of their results and conclusions, and adding citations to a few overlooked but important previous studies of NGFCs.</p><p>1. Please tone down a bit the description of NGFCs as &quot;neglected&quot;, &quot;enigmatic&quot;, or &quot;mysterious&quot; in the Title, Abstract, Introduction and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>While we replaced most of these descriptors such as enigmatic or mysterious, we left the term “neglected” in the title. First, the term applies to the group, i.e., the INs that are not PV, SST or VIP. The fact that the majority of them are NGFCs is a finding of this study. Second, examination of the scores of papers investigating the role of different IN types in various functions in the last five years shows they all compare PV, SST and VIP subtypes at best, which neglects the remaining ~18% of INs highlighted in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The first paragraph in Results should be incorporated into the early part of the Introduction. The introduction needs to mention 5HT3aR neurons as a group that encompasses all (or most) CGE-derived interneurons (as described in previous work by the authors and others), and further subdivided into VIP- and non-VIP-expressing groups, the latter now being labeled by the new intersectional strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now moved the first paragraph in the Results to the Introduction as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Lines 50, 58: Although not explained, I assume that the 12% and 18% numbers come from the authors' previous estimate that VIP cells account for about 40% of 5HT3a cells, which in turn account for about 30% of all interneurons. However the product of two approximate numbers is still an approximate number, so it is important to explain here how the 12 and 18% estimates were derived lest readers take these numbers at face value. That these estimates were confirmed in the current study can be indicated later, in the Results and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide references for several recent reviews that cover the topic of IN group proportions; these estimates are not just from our own work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The Htr3a(BAC)-EGFP founder line was specifically chosen over others for high levels of EGFP expression. In hindsight, this likely contributed to its pan-CGE IN expression pattern, whereas endogenous Htr3a expression appears to be broad but transient in most CGE INs following their specification, being largely restricted to VIP/CCK and Sncg IN subtypes at adult ages. In contrast to the Htr3a(BAC)-EGFP line, the Htr3a(BAC)-Cre founder was selected based on its cumulative recombination pattern with the cre-dependent tdTomato reporter Ai9, and likely has a much lower copy number or genomic insertion location that results in its expression being closer to the endogenous Htr3a gene. The Htr3a-Flpo line is a single copy knock in whose cumulative labeling with the tdTomato reporter Ai65F is less efficient overall than that seen with either BAC transgenic line, most likely due to the lower/transient expression of Flpo in most CGE INs.” (lines 346-359)</p><p>If all three lines were single copy knock ins, then the reviewer’s expectations that there should be fewer labeled cells in the Htr3a-EGFP vs. Htr3a-Cre; Ai9 would likely be met; however, this is not the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17.
