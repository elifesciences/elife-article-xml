pneumophila</italic> recruits many Rab GTPases to its vacuole and exploits their activities. Here, we found that infection-associated regulation of Rab10 dynamics involves ubiquitin signaling cascades mediated by the SidE and SidC families of <italic>Legionella</italic> ubiquitin ligases. Phosphoribosyl-ubiquitination of Rab10 catalyzed by the SidE ligases is crucial for its recruitment to the bacterial vacuole. SdcB, the previously uncharacterized SidC-family effector, resides on the vacuole and contributes to retention of Rab10 at the late stages of infection. We further identified MavC as a negative regulator of SdcB. By the transglutaminase activity, MavC crosslinks ubiquitin to SdcB and suppresses its function, resulting in elimination of Rab10 from the vacuole. These results demonstrate that the orchestrated actions of many <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors fine-tune the dynamics of Rab10 during infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic></kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>Rab10</kwd><kwd>effector</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubori</surname><given-names>Tomoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H02867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubori</surname><given-names>Tomoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kubori</surname><given-names>Tomoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H05772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arasaki</surname><given-names>Kohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K07477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kitao</surname><given-names>Tomoe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagai</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interplay between multiple <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> effector proteins lead to spatial and temporal regulation of the host Rab10 localization to the bacterial vacuole by controlling noncanonical ubiquitin modifications.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> utilizes a large arsenal of effector proteins which are delivered via its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to modulate host cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hubber and Roy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubori and Nagai, 2016</xref>).

Among them, effector manipulation of Rab1, a critical regulator of membrane trafficking between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex, has been extensively analyzed in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arasaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ingmundson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machner and Isberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MÃ¼ller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neunuebel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan and Luo, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitination regulates all aspects of eukaryotic cell physiology, and therefore is exploited by various bacterial pathogens encoding ubiquitin (Ub) ligases and deubiquitinases (DUBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashida and Sasakawa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kubori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Machner, 2017</xref>). Effector-mediated Ub modification of Rab1 was reported as an action of the <italic>Legionella</italic> E3 ligase SidC and its paralog SdcA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horenkamp et al., 2014</xref>). Rab33b as well as Rab1, Rab6A, and Rab30 are conjugated with phosphoribosylated (PR)-Ub by the unique reaction mechanism of the SidE family of effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), and it was shown that recruitment of Rab33b and Rab6A to the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV) relies on the PR ubiquitination of Rab33b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawabata et al., 2021</xref>). A recent genome-wide screen identified host factors including Rab10 linked to intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>). It was demonstrated that Rab10 is recruited to the LCV and is ubiquitinated depending on the activity of SidC and SdcA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>SidC and SdcA were originally identified as tethering factors that function in ER-to-LCV trafficking both having a unique phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI[4]P)-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ragaz et al., 2008</xref>). The enzymatic activity of these proteins as Ub ligases was experimentally uncovered later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). The enzymatic activity was found to be encoded in the domain conserved between the two proteins, namely SidC N-terminal Ub ligase (SNL) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). SdcB (Lpg2452/LegA14) was identified as another <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Ub ligase having the SNL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of SdcB in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection has not been examined yet.</p><p>Various <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector proteins exploit the host Ub signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomaskovic et al., 2022</xref>). They are exemplified by MavC which was shown to chemically modify the E2 enzyme UBE2N. The transglutaminase activity of MavC catalyzes a covalent linkage between Ub and UBE2N, thereby abolishing the activity of UBE2N to form polyUb chains, and mediate host NFÎºB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gan et al., 2019a</xref>). Encoded by the neighboring gene of <italic>mavC</italic>, MvcA is a paralog of MavC and exhibits similar activity to MavC as a Ub-specific deamidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valleau et al., 2018</xref>). However, MvcA was found to have an ability to reverse MavC-mediated Ub conjugation to UBE2N by its unique DUB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gan et al., 2020</xref>). The enzymatic activities of MavC and MvcA are both inhibited by Lpg2149, an effector encoded downstream of <italic>mvcA</italic>, by blocking their catalytic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valleau et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of <italic>Legionella</italic> Ub ligases in Rab10 dynamics during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. Including the unexpected finding that MavC is a negative regulator of SdcB, we demonstrated multi-tiered regulation by many effectors to finely modulate the localization of Rab10 to the LCV, revealing the intricate effector network that hijacks cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SidE- and SidC-family proteins differentially contribute to ubiquitination of Rab10 in infected cells</title><p>Host Rab10 is required for optimal intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>) and therefore considered to play a significant role in LCV biogenesis or maintenance. Since <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> SidE-family proteins, which catalyze PR-linked ubiquitination, have a wide range of substrates including Rab1 and Rab33b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kalayil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotewicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>), we first examined whether the SidE family can affect Rab10 ubiquitination. Upon infection of HEK293T-FcÎ³RII cells transiently expressing FLAG-Rab10 and HA-Ub with a wild-type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain (Lp01) for 1 hr, Rab10 was detected with a shifted band of higher molecular mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, upper panel). The band was shown to contain Ub by probing with an anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lower panel), indicating that the band represents Rab10 conjugated with a single Ub molecule. The mass shift was not detected in cells infected with the T4SS-deficient strain (Î<italic>dotA</italic>), suggesting that Rab10 can be monoubiquitinated in a T4SS-dependent manner. Infection with a Î<italic>sidEs</italic> strain lacking all four SidE-family proteins (SidE, SdeA, SdeB, and SdeC) mostly eliminated the molecular mass shift of Rab10, while infection with a strain lacking the negative regulators of SidE-family proteins (DupA, DupB, SidJ, and SdjA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Black et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gan et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sulpizio et al., 2019</xref>) enhanced the intensity of the band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These results suggest that the SidE-family proteins can conjugate PR-Ub to Rab10. The high molecular weight smears detected with anti-HA antibody are thought to be polyUb chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lower panel). Appearance of these smears is tightly associated with the PR-Ub bands, showing that polyubiquitination of Rab10 is linked with its PR ubiquitination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The SidE- and SidC-family proteins differentially contribute toward ubiquitination of Rab10.</title><p>HEK293T-FcÎ³RII cells transiently expressing 3xFLAG-Rab10 and HA-Ub were infected with the indicated <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains for 1 hr at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20.

We detected a strongly enhanced polyUb smear whose appearance depends on the mono-ADP ribosyltransferase activity of SdeA. The intensity of the monoubiquitination band was correlated with that of the polyUb smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, middle panel). When the C-terminal GG motif of Ub was replaced with AA (Ub<sub>AA</sub>), the polyUb smear drastically diminished, and accumulation of monoUb-conjugated Rab10 was observed instead. This indicates that the polyUb chains on Rab10 were formed via the Ub C-terminus by the canonical ubiquitination reaction. This also shows that the observed monoUb conjugation to Rab10 does not require the Ub C-terminus, which is consistent with the formation of bridge between Arg42 of Ub and substrate catalyzed by the SidE effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kotewicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). These results strongly support that Rab10 is subjected to SdeA-mediated PR ubiquitination and that this modification may provide a platform of conjugation of polyUb chains to Rab10, which is expected to be mediated by other Ub ligases.</p><p>Since it was reported that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors SidC and its paralog SdcA induce Rab10 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), we investigated how these E3 ligases contribute toward ubiquitination of Rab10 in our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Infection of cells with a Î<italic>sidC</italic>Î<italic>sdcA</italic> strain as well as with a strain lacking all the SidC-family proteins (Î<italic>sidC</italic>Î<italic>sdcA</italic>Î<italic>sdcB</italic>) still caused both mono- and polyubiquitination of Rab10 but with reduced levels. On the contrary, infection with the Î<italic>sidEs</italic> strain eliminated both modifications. These results support that SidE-family proteins primarily contribute toward ubiquitination of Rab10, and that SidC-family proteins partly contribute toward polyubiquitination of Rab10 directly or indirectly in conditions where Rab10 is modified with PR-Ub. We also found that substitution of three residues on Rab10 (Lys102, Lys136, and Lys154) that were previously suggested to be potential ubiquitination sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>) to Ala (Rab10KKK) did not abolish polyubiquitination of Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), implying that ubiquitination sites can be present in the other residues. This raises the possibility that canonical Ub chains can be formed partly on PR-Ub conjugated to Rab10. The polyubiquitination of Rab10 was significantly observed until 7 hr after infection, although the level was slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rab10 recruitment to the LCV is differentially regulated by SidE- and SidC-family proteins</title><p>Earlier studies demonstrated that Rab10 ubiquitination is highly correlated with its localization to the LCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).

The level of wild-type SdcB-positive LCVs was relatively lower compared with that of the SdcB<sub>C57A</sub>-positive LCVs, probably due to its catalytic cycling.

However, we found that coexpression of GFP-tagged MavC, but not of its catalytic mutant (MavC<sub>C74A</sub>), recovered the detection of SdcB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, top panel). As SdcB was resolved as a doublet in the immunoblot, we suspected that SdcB may be chemically modified by MavC and that the modification may result in enhanced detection of this protein. We therefore probed with an anti-HA antibody to detect possible Ub conjugation. The upper band was stained with anti-HA antibody, showing that Ub was conjugated to SdcB presumably by the known Ub conjugation ability of MavC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gan et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, middle panel). We also found that the disappearance of the SdcB bands correlated with the appearance of the high molecular weight smears when probed with anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, middle panel). This suggests that the disappearance of the SdcB band can be caused by auto-ubiquitination, as SdcB has an ability to catalyze auto-ubiquitination with a diverse repertoire of E2 enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) consistently with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). A proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment of the cells did not rescue the disappearance of the SdcB bands, suggesting that auto-ubiquitinated SdcB was not subjected to proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2a</xref>), but the auto-ubiquitination rather caused its apparent loss by the band distribution on the gel. The catalytic activity-dependent reduction of apparent SdcB level was also detected in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, bottom panel). The transglutaminase activity of MavC is likely required for conjugation of Ub to SdcB, as the catalytic mutant of MavC (MavC <sub>C74A</sub>) failed to modify SdcB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We also found that unmodified SdcB was readily detected when the SdcB C57 active site was mutated regardless of the presence of MavC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, top panel), consistent with the disappearance of the band was linked to the auto-ubiquitination ability. Interestingly, the MavC-mediated Ub conjugation to SdcB<sub>C57A</sub> was not readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This indicates that the catalytic residue C57 of SdcB is crucial in being modified by MavC. As suggested by the reduction of the high molecular weight smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), it is plausible that MavC suppresses the E3 ligase activity of SdcB by the unique chemical modification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The transglutaminase activity of MavC can mediate a unique Ub conjugation to SdcB.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 3xFLAG-SdcB, HA-Ub, and GFP-MavC were coexpressed in HEK293T-FcÎ³RII cells.

In the presence of MavC, but not of its paralog MvcA, the mass shift of SdcB was readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, top panel). The immunoblotting showed that the band contains Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, middle panel). The presence of wild-type MavC, but not its catalytic mutant, also reduced SdcB auto-ubiquitination in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2b</xref>). Since SidC, SdcA, and SdcB are paralogs to each other, we examined if SidC and/or SdcA are also subject to MavC-mediated Ub conjugation. Triple-FLAG-tagged SidC or SdcA were transiently expressed together with GFP-MavC and HA-Ub in HEK293T-FcÎ³RII cells, and the 3xFLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). These results clearly demonstrated that Ub was conjugated to SdcA but not to SidC by the catalytic activity of MavC, and that this modification occurred only to SdcA in the catalytically active form.</p><p>We then analyzed the MavC-mediated Ub conjugation to SdcB using derivatives of Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e, f</xref>). The use of Ub having no Lys residues (HA-Ub <sub>No K</sub>) resulted in an enhanced level of Ub conjugation to SdcB mediated by functional MavC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, middle panel). Surprisingly, HA-Ub<sub>AA</sub> did not conjugate to SdcB, indicating that the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues are essential for MavC-mediated Ub conjugation to SdcB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, second panel). The shifted band detected by FLAG probing represents conjugation of cellular intrinsic Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, top panel) as probed by Ub antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, third panel).</p><p>Transglutaminase activity of MavC is known to target Gln40 of Ub to catalyze the intramolecular crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gan et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puvar et al., 2020</xref>). We investigated whether the same residue of Ub is crosslinked to SdcB by the activity of MavC using mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. We found that a covalent bond was formed between Gln41 of Ub and Lys518 of SdcB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Crosslinking between Gln31 of Ub and Lys891 of SdcB was also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm the results, we replaced Ub residues Gln41 and Gln31 with Glu (Ub <sub>Q41E</sub>, Ub <sub>Q31E</sub>, and Ub <sub>Q31E Q41E</sub>) and conducted the Ub conjugation assay by transient expression in HEK293T-FcÎ³RII cells. Consistent with the result from the MS analysis, Ub <sub>Q41E</sub>, but not Ub <sub>Q40E</sub>, failed to be conjugated to SdcB, showing that Gln41 is crucial for MavC-mediated crosslinking with SdcB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, middle panel). Ub <sub>Q31E</sub> also reduced the level of modified SdcB, and Ub <sub>Q31E Q41E</sub> completely abolished the crosslinking to SdcB. The presence of modified SdcB bands when probed with anti-FLAG antibody is thought to be caused by conjugation with intrinsic Ub in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, top panel). Contrarily, replacement of Lys518 and Lys891 of SdcB to Arg (SdcB <sub>K518R</sub>, SdcB <sub>K891R</sub>, and SdcB <sub>K518R K891R</sub>), which have no apparent effect on Rab10 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>), showed lesser impact on abolishing the reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), suggesting that additional residues of SdcB can be subjected to MavC-dependent Ub conjugation. Taken together, we currently hypothesize that association of the C-terminal Gly of Ub to the catalytic pocket of SdcA or SdcB (C44 or C57, respectively) positions these molecules in proper orientation for intramolecular crosslinking mediated by the transglutaminase activity of MavC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identification of residues on Ub and SdcB between which MavC can crosslink.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) MavC catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the Gln41 of Ub and the Lys518 of SdcB.

That Rab10 localization was reduced coincident with MavC-dependent inhibition of SdcB further supports the contribution of SdcB activity toward retention of Rab10 on the LCV.

Contrary, when the cells were infected with a strain lacking Lpg2149 which inhibits the activity of MavC and MvcA, the level declined. These results support that MavC suppresses the activity of SdcB in infection conditions and thereby downregulates Rab10 localization to the LCV at later stages of infection. Taken together, we found that Rab10 localization is finely regulated during infection; the interplay of bacterial enzymes leads to sustained association of Rab10 with the LCV and eventually dissociates it from the LCV presumably in accordance with the process of the LCV biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Catalytic activity of MavC negatively regulates the Rab10 localization to the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV).</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) HeLa-FcÎ³RII cells transiently expressing RFP-Rab10 and HA-MavC or its catalytic mutant were infected with the Lp01 Î<italic>sidC</italic>Î<italic>sdcA</italic>Î<italic>sdcB</italic> strain complemented with the plasmid expressing 3xFLAG-SdcB or its catalytic mutant at an MOI of 2 for 4 hr.

Red arrows indicate canonical Ub conjugation by SidC, SdcA, and SdcB. Purple arrows indicate the noncanonical Ub conjugation. In the early stage of infection, Rab10 is recruited and retained to the LCV. This event is linked to its phosphoribosylated (PR) ubiquitination catalyzed by the SidE effectors. The PR ubiquitination of Rab10 provides a platform of its polyubiquitination in a manner depending on SidC and SdcA. In later stages, SdcB contributes toward sustained Ub accumulation on the LCV, enabling the LCV to maintain Rab10 on the vacuole. MavC-mediated crosslinking between Ub and SdcB disrupts the catalytic activity of SdcB, eventually releasing Rab10 from the LCV.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><label>Figure 7âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw images of micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-89002-fig7-data1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata2"><label>Figure 7âsource data 2.</label><caption><title>Counting data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b, c</xref>.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="elife-89002-fig7-data2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89002-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Bacterially delivered MavC mediates elimination of Rab10 from the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV).</title><p>Representative images of cells infected with the indicated Lp01 strains at an MOI of 2 for 9 hr (Rab10-positive LCVs (%) were quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).

The importance of Rab10 and its chaperone <italic>RABIF</italic> for intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> has recently emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>). However, little is known about how <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> manipulates the activity of Rab10.</p><p>We found that the SidE-family effectors mediate noncanonical ubiquitination of Rab10. Apparently, this modification precedes and is prerequisite for subsequent polyubiquitination of Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which is linked to its localization to the LCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Polyubiquitination of Rab10 was enhanced in a manner depending on the catalytic activities of the SidC-family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a, c</xref>) consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). As ectopic expression of SdeA in HEK293T-FcÎ³RII cells led to monoubiquitination of Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>), it is plausible that PR-Ub conjugation to Rab10 is directly catalyzed by the SidE-family ligases. However, the SdcB-mediated polyubiquitination of Rab10 was not readily detected even in the presence of SdeA lacking its DUB domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This result prompted us to consider that polyubiquitination of Rab10 by the SidC-family ligases can occur only in a specific circumstance, i.e. on the LCV. It is also possible that Rab10 can be partly catalyzed by canonical E3 ligases in host cells and/or other <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector proteins. The Ub ligase activity of SdcB strongly induced accumulation of Ub on the LCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), showing that Rab10 may not be an only substrate of SdcB. The PR-Ub modification of Rab10 and ubiquitination of unknown LCV-associated substrates of the SidC family may provide the platform for the further modification of Rab10.</p><p>Involvement of MavC for regulation of the SidC-family ligases was unexpectedly identified in our analyses. This finding has added another layer of complexity to effector-mediated regulation of Rab10. It was previously demonstrated that MavC can catalyze covalent linkage between Q40 of Ub with a Lys residue of UBE2N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gan et al., 2019a</xref>). Our result showing that Q41 of Ub is crosslinked with SdcB gives a new insight into the molecular mechanism of how MavC catalyzes Ub conjugation to specific substrates. In addition, both the C-terminal Gly of Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>) and the catalytic Cys of SdcB (C57A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) were essential for crosslinking. This strongly suggests that the ability of SdcB as a Ub ligase to position a Ub molecule into its active site is a requirement for MavC to form the covalent bond between Ub and SdcB. This model is reminiscent of the reaction scheme described for how MavC mediates Ub conjugation to UBE2N, in which the initial capturing of Ub by the E2 activity of UBE2N allows enhanced activity by MavC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puvar et al., 2020</xref>). We investigated SdcB in terms of the MavC-mediated regulation in this study and found that suppression of its activity can be beneficial for release of Rab10 at the maturation stage of LCV biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). However, MavC may have multiple targets including SdcA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) which can be involved in the early stage of infection. How MavC regulates the entire process of the vacuolar modification needs to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>In contrast to the PI[4]P-binding domain present in SidC and SdcA, SdcB has an ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain at its C-terminus. As ANK domains are generally known to mediate proteinâprotein interactions, we speculate that SdcB targets substrates distinct from those of SidC and SdcA. The lipid-binding ability of SidC and SdcA implicates their substrate specificity; their substrates are on or associated with the LCV in the specific stages of vacuole remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vormittag et al., 2023</xref>). We, therefore, speculate that SdcB can target substrate(s) present on the LCV in maturation stages different from ones when SidC and SdcA can work in. In spite of our extensive efforts, we have not succeeded to identify cellular targets with which the ANK domain of SdcB interacts. It would be a future perspective to understand the exact biological role of SdcB as a Ub ligase in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection by identifying its enzymatic substrates.</p><p>We found that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> has a multi-tiered regulatory mechanism to manipulate Ub signaling cascades in which SidC- and SidE-family Ub ligases are involved, even though the exact molecular mechanism how Ub modification of Rab10 results in regulation of its LCV residency would be an open question. MavC was found to contribute to fine-tuning the regulation via its unique Ub conjugation activity toward SdcB. These regulations are reflected in many aspects of the LCV biogenesis and maturation which are thought to be largely controlled by Ub signaling. The regulatory cascade of Rab10 GTPase, whose function is crucial for ER recruitment to the LCV, became apparent in this study. Most likely, similar regulatory cascades exist for many LCV-associated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, although it remains unclear how modification of the GTPase Rab10 with ubiquitin supports Legionella virulence and the impact of ubiquitination during LCV formation. The work will be of interest to colleagues studying animal pathogens as well as cell biologists in general.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the positive and valuable feedback from the editors and the reviewers. According to their suggestions, we added many new experimental data and implications of our findings in Legionella virulence in terms of the biological process of its replication niche.

They show that Rab10 undergoes both conventional ubiquitination and noncanonical phosphoribose-ubiquitination, and that this posttranslational modification contributes to the retention of Rab10 around Legionella vacuoles.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Legionella is an emerging pathogen of increasing importance, and dissecting its virulence mechanisms allows us to better prevent and treat infections with this organism. How Legionella and related pathogens exploit the function of host cell vesicle transport GTPases of the Rab family is a topic of great interest to the microbial pathogenesis field. This manuscript investigates the molecular processes underlying Rab10 GTPase manipulation by several Legionella effector proteins, most notably members of the SidE and SidC families. The finding that MavC conjugates ubiquitin to SdcB to regulate its function is novel, and sheds further light into the complex network of ubiquitin-related effectors from Lp. The manuscript is well written, and the experiments were performed carefully and examined meticulously.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Unfortunately, in its current form this manuscript offers only little additional insight into the role of effector-mediated ubiquitination during Lp infection beyond what has already been published. The enzymatic activities of the SidC and SidE family members were already known prior to this study, as was the importance of Rab10 for optimal Lp virulence. Likewise, it had previously been shown that SidE and SidC family members ubiquitinate various host Rab GTPases, like Rab33 and Rab1. The main contribution of this study is to show that Rab10 is also a substrate of the SidE and SidC family of effectors. What remains unclear is if Rab10 is indeed the main biological target of SdcB (not just 'a' target), and how exactly Rab10 modification with ubiquitin benefits Lp infection.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points of concern</p><p>(1) The authors show that SdcB increases Rab10 levels on LCVs at later times of infection and conclude that this is its main biological role. An alternative explanation may be that Rab10 is not 'the main' target of SdcB but merely 'a' target, which may explain why the effect of SdcB on Rab10 accumulation on LCV is only detectable after several hours of infection. An unbiased omics-based approach to identify the actual host target(s) of SdcB may be needed to confirm that Rab10 modification by SdcB is biologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with your comment that SdcB should have multiple targets considering the abundance of ubiquitin observed on the LCVs when SdcB was expressed (Figure 3). However, the effect of SdcB on Rab10 accumulation at the later time point (7 h) (current Figure 4e) was well supported by the new data showing that the SdcB-mediated ubiquitin conjugation to Rab10 was highly detected at this time point (new Figure 4c). We have tried the comprehensive search of interaction partners of the ANK domain of SdcB. This analysis is planned to be included in our on-going study. We therefore decided not to add the data in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors show that Rab10 within cell lysate is ubiquitinated and conclude that ubiquitination of Rab10 is directly responsible for its retention on the LCV. What is the underlying molecular mechanism for this retention? Are GAP proteins prevented from binding and deactivating Rab10. This may be worth testing.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be a fantastic hypothesis that a Rab10GAP is involved in the regulation of Rab10 localization on the LCV. However, as far as we know, GAP proteins against Rab10 have not been identified yet. It should be an important issue to be addressed when a Rab10GAP will be found.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Related to this, an alternative explanation would be that Rab10 retention is an indirect effect where inactivators of Rab10, such as host cell GAP proteins, are the main target of SidE/C family members and sent for degradation (see point #1). Can the authors show that Rab10 on the LCV is indeed ubiquitinated?</p></disp-quote><p>The possible involvement of a putative Rab10GAP is currently untestable as it is not known. To address whether Rab10 located on the LCV is ubiquitinated nor not, we conducted the critical experiments using active Rab10 (QL) and inactive Rab10 (TN) (new Figure 4a, new Figure 4-figure supplement 1). As revealed for Rab1 (Murata et al., Nature Cell Biol. 2006; Ingmundson et al., Nature 2007), Rab10 is expected to be recruited to the LCV as a GDPbound inactive form and converted to a GTP-bound active form on the LCV. The new results clearly demonstrated that GTP-locked Rab10QL is preferentially ubiquitinated upon infection, strongly supporting the model; Rab10 is ubiquitinated âon the LCVâ by the SidE and SidC family ligases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Also, on what residue(s) is Rab10 ubiquitinated? Jeng et. al. (Cell Host Microbe, 2019, 26(4): 551-563) suggested that K102, K136, and K154 of Rab10 are modified during Lp infection. How does substituting those residues affect the residency of Rab10 on LCVs? Addressing these questions may ultimately help to uncover if the growth defect of a sidE gene cluster deletion strain is due to its inability to ubiquitinate and retain Rab10 on the LCV.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We conducted mutagenesis of the three Lys residues of Rab10 and applied the derivative on the ubiquitination analysis (new Figure 1-figure supplement 1). The Lys substitution to Ala residues did not abrogate the ubiquitination upon Lp infection. This result indicates that ubiquitination sites are present in the other residue(s) including the PR-ubiquitination site(s), raising possibility that disruption of sidE genes would be detrimental for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila because of failure of Rab10 retention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors proposed that &quot;the SidE family primarily contributes towards ubiquitination of Rab10&quot;. In this case, what is the significance of SdcB-mediated ubiquitination of Rab10 during Lp infection?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that the major contribution of SdcB is retention of Rab10 until the late stage of infection. This claim was supported by our new data (new Figure 4c) as mentioned above (response to comment #1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The contribution of SdcB to ubiquitination of Rab10 relative to SidC and SdcA is unclear. SidC is shown to be unaffected by MavC. In this case, SidC can ubiquitinate Rab10 regardless of the regulatory mechanism of SdcB by MavC. This is not further being examined or discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of intrinsic MavC is apparent at the later stage (9 h) of infection (Figure 7c) when SdcB gains its activity (see above). We therefore do not think that the contribution of MavC on the SidC/SdcA activities, which are effective in the early stage, would impact on Rab10 localization. However, without specific experiments addressing this issue, possible MavC effects on SidC/SdcA would be beyond the scope in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) When is Rab10 required during Lp infection? The authors showed that Rab10 levels at LCV are rather stable from 1hr to 7hr post infection. If MavC regulates the activity of SdcB, when does this occur?</p></disp-quote><p>While the Rab10 levels on the LCV (~40 %) are stable during 1-7 h post infection (Figure 2b), it reduced to ~20% at 9 h after infection (Figure 7c) (the description was added in lines 304-306). Rab10 seems to be required for optimal LCV biogenesis over the early to late stages, but may not be required at the maturation stage (9 h). We validated the effect of MavC on the Rab10 localization at this time point (Figure 7c). These observations allowed us to build the scheme described in Figure 7d. We revised the illustration in new Figure 7d according to the helpful suggestions from both the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Previous analyses by MS showed that ubiquitination of Rab10 in Lp-infected cells decreases over time (from 1 hpi to 8 hpi - Cell Host Microbe, 2019, 26(4): 551-563). How does this align with the findings made here that Rab10 levels on the LCV and likely its ubiquitination levels increase over time?</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully compared the Rab10 ubiquitination at 1 h and 7 h after infection (new Figure 1figure supplement 1b). This analysis showed that the level of its ubiquitination decreased over time in agreement with the previous report. Nevertheless, Rab10 was still significantly ubiquitinated at 7 h, which we believe to cause the sustained retention of Rab10 on the LCV at this time point. We added the observation in lines 146-148.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Polyubiquitination of Rab10 was not detected in cells ectopically producing SdcB and SdeA lacking its DUB domain (Figure 7 - figure supplement 2). Does SdcB actually ubiquitinate Rab10 (see also point #5)? Along the same line, it is curious to find that the ubiquitination pattern of Rab10 is not different for LpÎsidC/ÎsdcA compared to LpÎsidC/dsdcA/dsdcB (Figure 1C). The actual contribution of SdcB to ubiquitinating Rab10 compared to SidC/SdcA thus needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the important point. We currently hypothesize that SidC/SdcA/SdcB-mediated ubiquitin conjugation can occur only in the presence of PR-ubiquitin on Rab10 (either directly on the PR-ubiquitin or on other residue(s) of Rab10). Failure to detect the polyubiquitination in the transfection condition (Figure 7-figure supplement 2) suggests that this specific ubiquitin conjugation can occur in the restricted condition, i.e. only âon the LCVâ. We added this description in the discussion section (lines 334-335). No difference between the ÎsidCÎsdcA and ÎsidCÎsdcAÎsdcB strains (Figure 1C, 1h infection) can be explained by the result that SdcB gains activity at the later stages (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor commentsIn Figure 4b and 7b, the authors show a quantification of &quot;Rab10-positive LCVs/SdcBpositive LCVs&quot;. Whys this distinction? It begs the question what the percentile of Rab10positive/SdcB-negative LCVs might be?</p></disp-quote><p>We took this way of quantification as we just wanted to see the effect of SdcB on the Rab10 localization. To distinguish between SdcB-positive and negative LCVs, we would need to rely on the blue color signals of DAPI to visualize internal bacteria, which we thought to be technically difficult in this specific analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The band of FLAG-tagged SdcB was not detected by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 5). The authors hypothesized that &quot;disappearance of the SdcB band can be caused by auto-ubiquitination, as SdcB has an ability to catalyze auto-ubiquitination with a diverse repertoire of E2 enzymes. This can be easily confirmed by using MG-132 to inhibit proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the experiment using MG-132 as suggested and found that proteasomal degradation is not the cause of the disappearance of the band (new Figure 5-figure supplement 2, added description in lines 228-233). SdcB is actually not degraded. Instead, its polyubiquitination causes its apparent loss by distributing the SdcB bands in the gel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5F, the authors mentioned that &quot;HA-UbAA did not conjugate to SdcB&quot;, whereas &quot;shifted band detected by FLAG probing plausibly represents conjugation of cellular intrinsic Ub&quot;. The same argument was made in Figure 6B. These claims should be confirmed by immunoblot using anti-Ub antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We added the data using anti-Ub antibody (P4D1) (Figure 6f, new third panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7A: In cell producing MavC, SdcB is clearly present on LCV. However, in Figure 5A, SdcB was not detected by immunoblot in cells ectopically expressing MavC-C74A. What is the interpretation for these results?</p></disp-quote><p>SdcB was not degraded in the cells, but just its apparent molecular weight shift occurred by polyubiquitination (see above). The detection of SdcB in the IF images (Figure 7a) supported this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript explores the interplay between Legionella Dot/Icm effectors that modulate ubiquitination of the host GTPase Rab10.

We revised the description in the text accordingly (lines 326327).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The complex interplay of Legionella effectors and their meta-effectors targeting a single host protein (as shown previously for Rab1) suggests the timing and duration of Rab10 activity on the LCV is tightly regulated. How does the association of Rab10 with the LCV early during infection and then its loss from the LCV at later time points impact LCV biogenesis or stability? This could be clearer in the manuscript and the summary figure does not illustrate this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing the important issue. Association of Rab10 with the LCV is thought to be beneficial for L. pneumophila as it is the identified factor which supports bacterial growth in cells (Jeng et al., 2019). We speculate that its loss from the LCV at the later stage of infection would also be beneficial, since the LCV may need to move on to the maturation stage in which a different membrane-fusion process may proceed. As this is too speculative, we gave a simple modification on the part of discussion section (lines 356-358). We also modified the summary figure (revised Figure 7d) as illustrated with the time course.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) How do the activities of the SidE and SidC effectors influence the amount of active Rab10 on the LCV (not just its localisation and ubiquitination)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is an important point. We tested the active Rab10 (QL) and inactive Rab10 (TN) for their ubiquitination and LCV-localization profiles (new Figure 4ab, new Figure 4figure supplement 1 and 2). These analyses led us to the unexpected finding that the active form of Rab10 is the preferential target of the effector-mediated manipulation. See also our response to Reviewer 1âs comment #3. Thank you very much for your insightful suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) What is the fate of PR-Ub and then poly-Ub Rab10? How does poly-Ub of Rab10 result in its persistence at the LCV membrane rather than its degradation by the proteosome?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not revealed the molecular mechanism in this study. We believe that it is an important question to be solved in future. We added the sentence in the discussion section (lines 376378).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Mutation of Lys518, the amino acid in SdcB identified by mass spec as modified by MavC, did not abrogate SdcB Ub-crosslinking, which leaves open the question of how MavC does inhibit SdcB. Is there any evidence of MavC mediated modification to the active site of SdcB?</p></disp-quote><p>The active site of SdcB (C57) is required for the modification (Figure 5b), but it is not likely to be the target residue, as the MavC transglutaminase activity restricts the target residues to Lys. It would be expected that multiple Lys residues on SdcB can be modified by MavC to disturb the catalytic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) I found it difficult to understand the role of the ubiquitin glycine residues and the transglutaminase activity of MavC on the inhibition of SdcB function. Is structural modelling using Alphafold for example helpful to explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted the Alphafold analysis of SdcB-Ub. Unfortunately, when the Glycine residues of Ub was placed to the catalytic pocket of SdcB, Q41 of Ub did not fit to the expected position of SdcB (K518). Probably, the ternary complex (MavC-Ub-SdcB) would cause the change of their entire conformation. A crystal structure analysis or more detailed molecular modeling would be required to resolve the issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Are the lys mutants of SdbB still active in poly-Ub of Rab10?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment and found that K518R K891R mutant of SdcB still has the E3 ligase activity of similar level with the wild-type upon infection (new Figure 6-figure supplement 2) (lines 283-284). The level was actually slightly higher than that of the wildtype. This result may suggest that the blocking of the modification sites can rescue SdcB from MavC-mediated down regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>see above</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
