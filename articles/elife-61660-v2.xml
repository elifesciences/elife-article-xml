diseases. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive and the majority of studies on animal models applying rather high-intensity ultrasound that cannot be safely used in humans. Here, we showed low-intensity ultrasound was able to activate neurons in the mouse brain and repeated ultrasound stimulation resulted in adult neurogenesis in specific brain regions. In vitro calcium imaging studies showed that a specific ultrasound stimulation mode, which combined with both ultrasound-induced pressure and acoustic streaming mechanotransduction, is required to activate cultured cortical neurons. ASIC1a and cytoskeletal proteins were involved in the low-intensity ultrasound-mediated mechanotransduction and cultured neuron activation, which was inhibited by ASIC1a blockade and cytoskeleton-modified agents. In contrast, the inhibition of mechanical-sensitive channels involved in bilayer-model mechanotransduction like Piezo or TRP proteins did not repress the ultrasound-mediated neuronal activation as efficiently. The ASIC1a-mediated ultrasound effects in mouse brain such as immediate response of ERK phosphorylation and DCX marked neurogenesis were statistically significantly compromised by ASIC1a gene deletion. Collated data suggest that ASIC1a is the molecular determinant involved in the mechano-signaling of low-intensity ultrasound that modulates neural activation in mouse brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanoreceptor</kwd><kwd>ultrasound</kwd><kwd>micropipette</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>calcium signal</kwd><kwd>ASIC1a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 107-2221-E-002-068-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jaw-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST108-2321-B-002-047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jaw-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 108-2321-B-002-061-MY2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jaw-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004737</institution-id><institution>National Health Research Institutes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHRI-EX109-10924EI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jaw-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 108-2321-B-001-028-MY2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chih-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 110-2321-B001-010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chih-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006477</institution-id><institution>National Taiwan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NTU-CC-107L891105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jaw-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mouse brain neurons response to transcranial ultrasound at the energy level of 5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and repeated stimulations lead to neurogenesis while ASIC1a is required both in vitro and in vivo as one of the mechanoreceptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcranial ultrasound such as opening blood-brain barrier (BBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cammalleri et al., 2020</xref>) for localized drug release and modulating neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicodemus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Legon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2014</xref>) has been used for therapeutic treatments of various brain diseases. Many in vivo animal experiments and human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) proved the clinical potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation. With the increased interest of this technique, the mechanisms underlying ultrasound-mediated neural modulation has also recently been learned. A study showed high-intensity transcranial ultrasound can elicit a startle-like motor response via an indirect auditory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato et al., 2018</xref>). Emerging sonogenetics in worm model also identified and engineered TRP-4 channels as a sensor for the ultrasound stimulus to activate neurons in living organisms at pressure level above 0.5 MPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ibsen et al., 2015</xref>), and ultrasound at 0.1 MPa acoustic pressure was found to activate neurons via Piezo one mechanosensitive ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, the energy intensity or acoustic pressure of most clinical trials or basic researches used for BBB opening or neuromodulation are both high, and safety issue of this technique in clinical application remains a concern.</p><p>In this study, a much lower intensity ultrasound at the order lower than 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> is proposed to activate neurons via mechanosensitive ion channels in mammals’ brain for potential clinical application. Mechanosensitve ion channels such as PIEZO and TRP channels and acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nilius and Honoré, 2012</xref>) are considered the candidates likely responsive to ultrasound.

The phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), an established indicator of immediate neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao and Ji, 2009</xref>), was used to evaluate whether transcranial low-intensity ultrasound can stimulate neuronal activity in mouse brain. Mice with 1 min ultrasound exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) had shown significant increase of p-ERK positive cells in certain brain regions, such as the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), and amygdala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>) as compared with those received sham treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). More specifically, increased p-ERK expression generally occurred upon ultrasound stimulation in the visual, somatosensory, auditory, temporal associations, retrosplenial, piriform, and entorhinal areas of mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). In hippocampus, CA1 and CA2 were dramatically lightened up with p-ERK signals in response to ultrasound whereas CA3 and dentate gyrus showed sparsely stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). In amygdala, the central amygdala nucleus showed the strongest p-ERK signals, while medial and basolateral also obviously increased in p-ERK signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).

A micropipette was used to guide ultrasound to cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The device can generate either an ultrasound induced pressure predominant condition (2000 mVpp, DF 0.05%, measured peak pressure versus the distance to the pipette tip shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or an acoustic streaming predominant condition (100 mVpp, DF 100%, flow pattern for the acoustic streaming shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2021</xref>), or a mixed loading condition (700 mVpp, DF 20%) depending on duty cycle applied. Ultrasound pressure predominant conditions (up to 2000 mVpp, DF 0.05%) generated compressional stress on cells that were not able to elevate calcium responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), while acoustic streaming predominant conditions (up to 100 mVpp, DF 100%) invoked shear stress that could only activate little calcium responses in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); whereas a mixed loading condition (700 mVpp, 20 % DF) effectively yielded much higher calcium responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This response was also reproducible when we applied two additional live cell calcium staining reagents, including Fluo-4 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) and Fura-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), and we observed similar responses upon micropipette guided ultrasound stimulations. To validate that the calcium response was not caused by a lipid bilayer damage, we repeated the stimulation on the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and found that despite an overwhelming photo-decay problem due to continuous light exposure, there was some repeated calcium elevations at certain sub-cellular sites (white arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The quantification of the neuronal calcium responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) using Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM was presented in an average value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) and the experiments were ended by a 0.01% Saponin cell perforation to calibrate the maximum response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This method was going to be utilized for the tests for inhibitors and dosage studies. To ensure that this method is reliable, cells were repeatedly stimulated and clear responses were observed even though the magnitude of responses typically dropped to 30–60% during the second stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The ultrasound predominant mode with only compressional stress cannot induce a response even when the stimulation was extended to 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Similarly, the prolong stimulation of acoustic streaming invoking shear stresses also only elevated mildly the amplitude of calcium response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

First, the treatment with Gadolinium (10 μM), a non-selective blocker of mechanically sensitive ion channels, partially suppressed the ultrasound-induced calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Treating the cells with a selective Piezo inhibitor, GsMTx-4, led to a marginal (not significant) inhibition of the ultrasound-induced calcium elevation as compared with the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Instead, the treatment with a TRP blocker ruthenium red (1–10 μM) partially suppressed the calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), whereas the non-selective ASIC inhibitor, amiloride, totally abolished the calcium signals by micropipette ultrasound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Above results suggested ASICs might be the major channels involved in micropipette ultrasound mechanotransduction.

However, the mechanosensitive role of ASICs in the brain is still not known, although ASIC1a is a predominant acid sensor modulating neural activity in physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baron and Lingueglia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wemmie et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we demonstrated low-intensity ultrasound could modulate neural activity in mouse brain and directly activate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) via an ASIC1a-depenent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). While the current view of transcranial ultrasound activation of neurons in brain is through the auditory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato et al., 2018</xref>), our results from <italic>Asic3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice suggest that the peripheral nerves may not play a role in the activation of p-ERK in mouse brain by low intensity ultrasound. Alternatively, the low-intensity ultrasound-mediated mechanotransduction may act via a channel subtype-dependent manner specific for ASIC1a but not for other ASIC subtypes as shown in dextrose prolotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, repeated transcranial low-intensity ultrasound stimulations are safe and able to elicit adult neurogenesis in mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Although ASIC1a was determined as the molecular determinant involved in low-intensity ultrasound mechanotransduction, non-selective mechanosensor inhibitors such as gadolinium and ruthenium red were partially suppressing the calcium response triggered by micropipette ultrasound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). Of note gadolinium also blocked ASICs in μM to mM ranges. However, we cannot rule out a role of TRP channels in the micropipette ultrasound mechanotransduction, because there is no evidence showing ruthenium red can also inhibit ASICs. Previous studies have proposed a role of TRP for ultrasound-mediated mechanotransduction while high-intensity ultrasound was applied. More studies are required to validate the role of TRP in low-intensity ultrasound mechanotransduction or the unexpected role of ruthenium red in neuronal ASIC1a signaling pathways.</p><p>ASIC1a is widely expressed in the brain and could form as homotrimeric and heterotrimeric channels with different sensitivity to PcTx1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joeres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sherwood et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, heterotrimeric ASIC2b/ASIC1a can be inhibited 50 % by approximately 3 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sherwood et al., 2011</xref>) PcTx1 and ASIC1a/ASIC2a heterotrimeric can be inhibited by 50 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joeres et al., 2016</xref>), whereas 0.5 nM to 1 nM can inhibit the homotrimeric ASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escoubas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saez et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, since PcTx1 in low-doses effectively inhibited ASIC1a-mediated calcium signal by micropipette ultrasound, homotrimeric ASIC1a channels may be the predominant subtype involved in ultrasound mechanotransduction in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To explain the mode of ultrasound induced ASIC1a mechanotransduction, we hypothesized a physical effect of micropipette ultrasound at cell level; which the acoustic streaming imposes shear stress on cell apical surfaces while ultrasound exerts compressional stresses throughout the cells. Considering the combinatorial forces mode in vitro, we argue, in a mixed loading condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> <italic>F</italic>), the extracellular domains of ASIC1a are under shear force pulling the protein to the flow direction while the intracellular domains of the ASIC1a are connected to cortical actin or other cytoskeleton, which experiences dynamic reorganization coupling with membrane withdrawals in response to ultrasound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2020</xref>). As such, mechano-signal triggered ASIC1a, essentially a sodium channel, results in the intracellular calcium elevation possibly by activating voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boillat et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The condition in vivo on the other hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), is accomplished differently. Neurons are embedded in extracellular matrixes (earthy yellow color) such as laminin, poly-lysine, or poly-ornithine in the brain. ASIC1a is N-glycosylated at N366 and N393, both residues extracellular located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jing et al., 2012</xref>). While N-glycosylation is reported to be involved in the surface trafficking and dendritic spine trafficking of ASIC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kadurin et al., 2008</xref>), the N-glycosylation of many proteins has been known to be important for adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina-Cano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stevens and Spang, 2017</xref>), implicating the extracellular matrix interacting nature of N-glycans. When ultrasound is applied to the brain, the acoustic pressure exerted through extracellular matrixes, can possibly activate ASIC1a via a cytoskeletal-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), in addition to other mechanosensitive machineries such as PIEZO and TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Servin-Vences et al., 2017</xref>), since these mechanoreceptors have all been proven to be triggered by indentation of substrates. Consequently, this leads to an activation of the cells manifesting as ERK phosphorylation.</p><p>Since DCX has been accepted as a surrogate mark for neurogenesis in dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salvi et al., 2016</xref>), increased DCX-positive cells in dentate gyrus with a consecutive 3 day of ultrasound treatment suggests a therapeutic implication. Of note, DCX plays multiple roles in brain development including hippocampal pyramidal neuronal lamination, cortical neuronal migration, and axonal wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Germain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koizumi et al., 2006</xref>). The use of ultrasound in developing brains should be extremely cautious.</p><p>In conclusion, here we provide evidence that a clinically safely low-intensity transcranial ultrasound could modulate neuronal activity in mouse brain. The low-intensity ultrasound can directly activate neurons via ASIC1a, which provides a molecular basis for future development of ultrasound neuromodulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ultrasound devices and stimulation parameters</title><p>Two different ultrasonic setups were used in our study.

Culture was gradually replaced with serum free B27+ neurobasal media until day seven for either immunofluorescence or for live cell calcium signal detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Live cell calcium signal imaging</title><p>In order to visualize calcium signal in the neurites and in the cell bodies of neuron, we treated the primary cultures with three different green fluorescent dyes, that is Invitrogen Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM cell permeant (O6807, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), Invitrogen Fluo-4, AM, FluoroPure grade (F23917, Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA), or Invitrogen Fura-2, AM, cell permeant (1 mM Solution in Anhydrous DMSO) (F1225, Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA). Living primary culture on cover slip was immersed in HHBS (20 mM Hepes pH7.4, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>-7H<sub>2</sub>O, 5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 138 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 6 mM D-Glucose) with 2–5 μM of fluorescent dye and incubate in incubator for 90 min. Subsequently, calcium staining solution was replaced with HHBS with 17% neurobasal media. Cover glass was mounted on an imaging chamber and placed under the fluorescent microscope and micropipette ultrasound was set up to the proximity of targeted cells.</p><p>Images were recorded using Olympus IX71 fluorescent microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) with digital camera for microscope Camera attachment with 0.63 x lens (DP80, Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). Stacked images were analyzed in ImageJ. ROI of neurites or cell bodies were determined for stacks resliced to obtain data of fluorescence intensities plotted against time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Molecular signaling protein inhibitors</title><p>To determine whether PIEZO receptor or TRPC1 was responsible for the signal, we applied the GsMTx-4 (500 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 2007</xref>) (ab141871, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, MA, USA) isolated from tarantula venom and Gadolinium (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coste et al., 2010</xref>) (G7532, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to the tissues or cells before ultrasound treatment. To investigate the potential role of ASIC channels in ultrasound signal transduction, we utilized the inhibitors such as Amiloride (100 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leng et al., 2016</xref>) (A7410-1G Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and PcTx1 (0.1–50 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cristofori-Armstrong et al., 2019</xref>) (Tocris #5042, Bio-Techne Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, USA). To test whether endoplasmic reticular stored calcium was involved in the calcium signal detected, RyR inhibitor, JTV519 fumarate (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunt et al., 2007</xref>) (Tocris #4564, Bio-Techne Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Thapsigargin (T9033, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of DCX</title><p>After the VLIUS stimulation, the mice were sacrificed and perfused with 10 % formaldehyde/PBS. The brain was then harvested and fixed with 10% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature. Samples were embedded in paraffin and serial 7 μm transverse sections were mounted on slides. The samples were deparaffinized, rehydrated, antigen retrieved (100℃, 20 min) and washed in PBST. Slices were blocked with 10% newborn calf serum (NCS) and 1% BSA in PBST for 1 hr, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4℃. After washing with PBST, the samples were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature, washed with PBST and mounted with EverBrite Hardset Mounting Medium containing DAPI to label the nuclei (Biotium). Slides were viewed, and images were captured with LSM780 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The primary antibodies used for immunostaining and their dilutions were as follows: rabbit anti-DCX (1:200, Cell signaling), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:200, Thermo). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Thermo) and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Thermo).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data and statistical analyses</title><p>Cells were counted using ImageJ. Cells were identified using a global threshold with watershed segmentation. The number of pixel groups was evaluated as the number of cells. Cells were also manually counted from bright-field images. Measurements were compared between control and ultrasound groups using student t-test. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses of animal studies were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Animal experiments, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The animal work has been performed following the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of National Taiwan University.

This is a novel finding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers find the results of the study to be intriguing, but have also voiced major concerns about open questions and methodological issues. Most importantly, the reviewers felt that there is insufficient evidence to support a key role for ASIC1a in the responses to ultrasound stimulation.</p><p>A revised version would need to address and include the following:</p><p>1. It is critically important to back up the claim that ASIC1a mediates the effects described in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo experiments pertaining to pERK activation by ultrasound stimulation, appropriate ASIC knockout mice should be used. This experiment is critical for the manuscript to be considered further for a re-review. For in vitro experiments in HEK cells, the reviewers wish to see transfection with ASIC1a and tests performed to determine whether this is sufficient to confer sensitivity to ultrasound stimulation.</p><p>2. Calcium imagine experiments: Number of cells tested in calcium imaging experiments must be specified in legends, it should be clarified whether data points refer to individual cells or to mean values, and are sufficient enough for robust interpretations. Data on internal calibration and integrity of cellular responses, e.g. using an ionophore, should be shown. You should clarify if the inhibitors were applied to the control cells from the same panel or to different cells. Please specify how many control cells actually responded to the ultrasound stimulation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ASIC1a is required for neuronal activation via low-intensity ultrasound stimulation in mouse brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Most noteworthy is the new analysis of ultrasound induced neuron activation (pERK as a surrogate) in both ASIC1 and ASIC3 knockout mouse models. The authors noted a higher baseline number of pERK positive cells in ASIC1-/- mice but no increase was seen after ultrasound exposure. This data together with the data from ASIC3 mutant mice where no attenuation of the ultrasound effect was seen, better support a role for ASIC1 in the ultrasound effect. The authors should still note that this data implicates a role for ASIC1 in being necessary for the effect, but does not show that the mechanical activation of this trimeric channel is the mechanism accounting for the in vivo effect. For example the presence of ASIC1 could be necessary for the trafficking or functionality of other proteins necessary for the effect. Indeed the authors should at least comment in the discussion on the fact that ASIC1a is highly selective for sodium ions cannot directly account for calcium influx measured in the in vitro experiments.</p><p>One other general point that the authors should take care of is their assertion that ASIC1a is gated via tethers. As far as I am aware there is no direct evidence of a molecular tether that binds to this protein to gate the channel. Rather, this assertion is based on the observation that indentation of the substrate can activate a such channels (work from the Chen lab). However, this has also been shown for PIEZO and TRPV4 channels PMID: 28135189,PMID: 24662763. These data were reviewed in a short review here PMID: 24981693.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61660.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In the manuscript entitled “ASIC1a is required for neuronal activation via low-intensity ultrasound stimulation in mouse brain&quot;, Lim et al. investigate the mechanism underlying the activation of brain neurons by transcranial low-intensity ultrasound stimulation. The authors propose that ultrasound stimuli-induced movements of the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton cause mechanical activation of ASIC1a in cortical neurons, which leads to ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and subsequent expression of pERK, which the authors used as a surrogate marker for neuronal activation.</p><p>While I agree that the finding that ultrasound activates neurons via activation of a mechanosensitive ion channel is per se very interesting, I have to say that in my opinion most of the conclusions and claims are not supported by the actual data.</p><p>1. The entire study is purely correlative. Thus, the authors made two independent experiments; on the one hand they show that in-vivo transcranial ultrasound stimulation induces pERK in various brain regions and on the other hand they shown that ultrasound-evoked ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in cultures of cortical neurons is probably mediated by ASIC1a. From this data they conclude that pERK activation is also mediated by ASIC1a activation. This is, however, pure speculation. The authors must provide additional evidence to support their claim. In my opinion the sole use of PcTx1 is not sufficient to prove that the ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are mediated by ASIC1a. Hence, firstly the authors should demonstrate that ASIC1a is indeed activated by ultrasound. This is a very simple experiment. All they would have to do is express ASIC1a in a cell line (e.g. HEK293, CHO, etc) and show that this expression renders the cells sensitive to ultrasound. Second, I would appreciate it if the authors would show that cortical neurons, especially those that show pERK activation, express ASIC1a in the first place. This would also be quite simple – just co-stain the brain sections with an anti-ASIC1a antibody. Third, if the authors want to keep up their claim (see title) that ASIC1a is required for ultrasound activation of brain neurons they should examine ultrasound-induced pERK activation in ASIC1a-knockout mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the <italic>Asic1a</italic> overexpression experiment suggested by the reviewer using CHO cells. The CHO cells are in favour instead of HEK293 because of the endogenous ASIC1a expression levels in HEK293. The results are organized into Manuscript Figure 4. (Unless otherwise indicated, all the figures are referred to according to the manuscript figure number system). Basically, our results confirm the notion that ASIC1a is mediating the neuronal calcium response. The CHO cells calcium response to pipette delivered ultrasound with a time lag of about 10-15 seconds (Figure 4<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>). We think this may be due to acoustic flow however the delay response is not within our scope of study. The CHO cells overexpressing <italic>Asic1a</italic> show an immediate calcium response to ultrasound (Figure 4 <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>) comparable to that was detected in primary cultured neurons (Manuscript Figure 2). In order to make sure that the difference is not due to the mere effect to an introduction of the ectopic DNA into the cells, same experiments were conducted using a vector transfected control to compare with <italic>Asic1a</italic> transfected cells. We have observed and confirmed that the shortened response time to the ultrasound stimulation is due to ectopic ASIC1a (Figure 4<italic>C</italic>). The responsive time was significantly reduced in <italic>Asic1a</italic> overexpressed CHO cells (Figure 4 <italic>C</italic>). After the stimulations, intracellular calcium can be elevated again by 0.1% saponin treatment to cause cell permeation (Figure 4<italic>D</italic>). The calcium response calibrated by 0.01% Saponin cell perforation could surge to the maximal Fura-2 ratio (F<sub>340/380nm</sub>) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 <italic>C, D</italic>). The 2-way ANOVA analysis of this set of data showed that ASIC1a overexpression did not contribute to the difference of with an insignificant <italic>p</italic> value (F=0.11; p=0.74) (Figure 4-table supplement 2) while cell perforation contributed significantly to the calcium responses (F=10.52; p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 4-table supplement 2). Note that the calcium response upon ultrasound treatment remained effective under the PcTx1 treatments in vehicle transfected cells (Figure 4<italic>E</italic>) as ultrasound as a factor still contributed significantly (F=17.2; p&lt;0.0001) to the changes of calcium while there was no significant interaction (F=1.44; p=0.15) (Figure 4-table supplement 3) of drug treatments with ultrasound stimulations (Figure 4-table supplement 3). In contrast, when CHO cells were overexpressing ASIC1a, ultrasound stimulations had no significant effects on the calcium response under the PcTx1 inhibition (Figure 4<italic>F</italic>) (F=1.26; p=0.29) (Figure 4-table supplement 4), while the two factors interact significantly (F=4.46, p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 4-table supplement 4). In short, different from the failed PcTx1 inhibition of mock control (Figure 4 <italic>E</italic>), the ASIC1a mediated calcium response upon ultrasound was significantly blocked by PcTx1 starting from as diluted as 2nM (Figure 4<italic>F</italic>).</p><p>The reviewer ask for the immunostaining of ASIC1a expression in the cortical neurons. However, the immunostaining of ASIC1a is currently not possible due to the lack of reliable antibody. We have tried many commercially available antibodies using <italic>Asic1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> to validate the specificity however we have found no antibody that detect specific signal that is absent in knockout samples.</p><p>Despite the co-staining of ASIC1a is not possible because there is no good and specific antibody available that can meet the standard of knockout validation. Nevertheless, we have obtained three batches of <italic>Asic1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and performed pERK immunohistochemical staining. The results confirmed that the deletion of <italic>Asic1a</italic> in mice can sufficiently suppressed pERK cell count in cortex, hippocampus and amygdala Figure 7, demonstrating that ASIC1a is required for ultrasound activation of cells in mouse brain. The two-way ANOVA analysis of p-ERK cell counts showed that there was only an interaction of two factors, namely genotype and ultrasound treatment in the cortex (F=6.45, p=0.0037) but not in hippocampus and amygdala (Figure 7-table supplement 1). To further confirm the specific function of ASIC1a in mediating ultrasound stimulation, we included the <italic>Asic3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> in our p-ERK response phenotypes studies and indeed the genotype did not reduce the activation of p-ERK as <italic>Asic1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> did. These results indicated that the p-ERK response in mouse brain is likely directly caused by the transcranial ultrasound instead of caused by the secondary effects due to the neurons wired with auditory circuits or other sensory circuits, as ASIC3 being mainly expressed in somatosensory neurons and spiral ganglion neurons (1, 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is difficult to evaluate the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, because the method – especially the ultrasound stimulation – is not very well described. Hence it is unclear to me how close to the cell the ultrasound stimulator was placed. Moreover, the N-numbers of the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments are rather small (by the way, it would make reading much easier if the N-numbers were indicated in the figure). Most importantly, it is unclear if the inhibitors (Gadolinium, GsMTx4 etc – Figure 2B-H) were applied to the control cells from the same panel or to different cells. In this context it would be important to know how many control cells actually responded to the ultrasound stimulation. Considering the low N-number, I was wondering if the authors may have had a hard time finding cells that responded and that this is the reason why the N-numbers are so small? I suggest examining many more control neurons and provide information about the proportion of cells that respond. If only for the controls as well as for the cells treated the various channel inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concern of the validity of the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments and to allow better evaluation of calcium response, we have performed the experiment again using Fura-2 staining reagent and setting up the imaging system recording F<sub>340/380nm</sub> images. The results were shown in (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Video ).</p><p>The same cells were stimulated for the second time and still show a good response within the duration of ultrasound stimulation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). It is probably due to the imaging system in our laboratory, the photo-decay problem is quite overwhelming, and it will be difficult for us to keep recording the same visual field for subsequent treatments. Thus, although the inhibitors were applied to the same dish, a different visual field is recorded for the quantification of the calcium response. The N-numbers presented in our manuscript is representing a subset of what we have tested, mainly from the experiments using Invitrogen Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM, cell permeant. When this project was funded year 2019, the Fura-2 staining method and imaging system was not available in our lab yet. When we used Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, almost all of the tested visual fields (&gt;90%) were responsive to ultrasound stimulation. Thus, this allowed a better consistency in quantification. On the other hand, if Invitrogen Fluo-4, AM, FluoroPure was used, only 28.6%-38.5% of the tested visual fields were showing the calcium response upon ultrasound stimulation (Video 4). When this staining method is applied, each treatment is performed using a fresh dish of cells. After the image recording, we selected the best responding cells from each experimental group for comparison to the sham-treated control dish of cells. The N-numbers of every graph and chart presented are added to the manuscript figure legends.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 1C shows the position of micropipette in the visual field of video 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this study the authors claim that short lasting low intensity ultrasound stimulation activates many neurons in the whole brain. They further claim that the activation mechanism is via the ASIC1a channel. There are some intriguing results in this paper, but there are also many open questions and methodological issues that should be addressed. The authors use pERK as a surrogate for neuronal activation by a global ultrasound stimulus. Some but not all neurons in cortex seem to show activation (it seems only large pyramidal cells, why not interneurons? More analysis needed here).</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to identify the p-ERK cells by co-staining them with several markers, including NeuN, NMDAR, GAD67 and PV. The results in shown in the following micrographs Figure 7—figure supplement 1. We observed that there were visibly a large number of p-ERK co-stained with NeuN (94% or 197/209). However, we have not found any NMDAR co-stained cells in our experiment. We cautioned that this could be a false negative result that was probably due to the limitation of antibody specificities and staining procedures. We found that there is very small population of p-ERK positive cells co-stained with GAD67 (4.5% or 10/223) while even smaller percentage co-stained cells of p-ERK with Parvalbumin (PV) (0.9% or 2/211).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This experiment is followed by an in vitro experiment with cultured cortical neurons from neonates (no ages given for the animals used in this experiment as far as I can see). These are also not equivalent to the adult cells tested in the in vivo experiment. In the bulk of the experiments calcium imaging is used as a surrogate to measure neuronal activation. Unfortunately, in none of the graphs displayed of the Δ F/Fo is there any indication of the number of cells selected and measured. This is critical to evaluate the robustness of the results. In addition, it is normal at the end of the experiment to permeabilize the neurons to calcium by using an ionophore. This allows the assessment of the maximum fluorescence signal when calcium outside concentration equilibrates with the intracellular concentration. This was not done which means the experiments have no internal calibration.</p></disp-quote><p>The neuronal cultures were prepared using postnatal day 3 – postnatal day 5 pups. The usage of neonatal primary culture is to have a proof-of-concept that ultrasound can directly activate neurons in a simplified in vitro system. Of note, it is almost impossible to culture adult cortical neurons for calcium imaging studies. To ensure that the results are reproducible and robust, we have applied four different staining reagents; namely (1) Invitrogen Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM, cell permeant, (2) Invitrogen Fluo-4, AM, FluoroPure, (3) Rhod-2 AM, fluorescent ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (ab142780) and (4) Fura-2, AM, cell permeant. We found that Rhod-2 AM is not compatible with our system and we cannot obtain any good signal from the staining. Thus, this staining method was ruled out. Our observation can be reproduced by using the other three reagents. Of note only that when Fluo-4 is applied, the responding neurons are about 28.6%-38.5% among tested (6/21 and 10/26, in total 46 cells were tested).</p><p>We have added 0.1% saponin to show the assessment of the maximum fluorescence signal. Representative results are shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Likewise, similar cell perforation experiments have been performed using Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 for primary neurons to show the maximal calcium response presented in DF/F0 (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). We have also measured the repeated stimulation of the same cells using this staining method and the comparisons of first and second stimulation is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is for me impossible to assess the robustness of the calcium imaging experiment when I do not know what each data point corresponds to, take Figure 2I as an example. Are these individual cells or means values from many cells from individual cultures? Many critical methodological details are indeed missing from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Every data point corresponds to individual cell. Although we have performed the experiments for either two or three times for each treatment, we presented the data from a representative experiment because the staining reagents and imaging settings are sometimes changed, and it is quite impossible to merge all the measurements into one graph. To demonstrate that the calcium response is indeed reproducibly stimulated by the micropipette guided ultrasound and not caused by cell damage, we have set up a new imaging system in the lab to perform the experiment again using Fura-2 staining reagent and the quantification is presented by a ratio of F<sub>340nm/380nm</sub>. The results were shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Video 5.</p><p>The same cells were stimulated for the second time and still show a good response within the duration of ultrasound stimulation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The photo-decay problem causes a difficulty in keeping the same visual field for different treatments of inhibitors. Thus, although the inhibitors were applied to the same dish, a different visual field is recorded for the quantification of the calcium response. The N-numbers presented in our manuscript is representing a subset of what we have tested, mainly from the experiments using Invitrogen Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1, AM, cell permeant. When we use this reagent, almost every visual field of the tested cells (&gt;90%) were responsive to ultrasound stimulation (Video 3). We place the pipette right on top of the imaged neuron or its neurites under 40X objective lens, the calcium response can be observed at the time points of 1.5 to 5 seconds after the turning on of ultrasound. This can be because of the limitation of our recording setting, which is usually capturing 1 or 2 images per second. In most of the cases, about 1or 2 neuronal cells per visual field can be quantified plotting fluorescence (DF/F0) against time (s). On the other hand, if Invitrogen Fluo-4, AM, FluoroPure is used, only 28.6%-38.5% of the visual fields were showing calcium response upon ultrasound stimulation (Video 4). When this staining method is applied, each treatment is performed using a fresh dish of cells. After the image recording, we select the top responding visual fields from each experimental group for comparison to the control dish of cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The idea that ASIC1a is THE critical mediator of this effect is quite surprising and the more dramatic and implausible the conclusion may seem, the more solid the evidence needed.

Transcranial ultrasound induces p-ERK response in various regions of the mice including cortex, hippocampus and amygdala (representative micrographs Figure 7 <italic>A, B, H, I, O, P</italic>), while the activation is partially abolished in the <italic>Asic1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (Figure 7 <italic>C, D, J, K Q, R</italic>).

On the other hand, the effects of <italic>Asic3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> on the p-ERK response to ultrasound are less noticeable (Figure 7 <italic>E, F, L, M, S, T</italic>). The ultrasound induced p-ERK response is therefore remaining statistically significant (Figure 7 <italic>G, N, U</italic>). The two-way ANOVA analysis of p-ERK cell counts showed that there was only an interaction of two factors, namely genotype and ultrasound treatment in the cortex (F=6.45, p=0.0037) but not in hippocampus and amygdala (Figure 7-table supplement 1).

Most noteworthy is the new analysis of ultrasound induced neuron activation (pERK as a surrogate) in both ASIC1 and ASIC3 knockout mouse models. The authors noted a higher baseline number of pERK positive cells in ASIC1-/- mice but no increase was seen after ultrasound exposure. This data together with the data from ASIC3 mutant mice where no attenuation of the ultrasound effect was seen, better support a role for ASIC1 in the ultrasound effect. The authors should still note that this data implicates a role for ASIC1 in being necessary for the effect, but does not show that the mechanical activation of this trimeric channel is the mechanism accounting for the in vivo effect. For example the presence of ASIC1 could be necessary for the trafficking or functionality of other proteins necessary for the effect. Indeed the authors should at least comment in the discussion on the fact that ASIC1a is highly selective for sodium ions cannot directly account for calcium influx measured in the in vitro experiments.</p><p>One other general point that the authors should take care of is their assertion that ASIC1a is gated via tethers. As far as I am aware there is no direct evidence of a molecular tether that binds to this protein to gate the channel. Rather, this assertion is based on the observation that indentation of the substrate can activate a such channels (work from the Chen lab). However, this has also been shown for PIEZO and TRPV4 channels PMID: 28135189,PMID: 24662763.

When ultrasound is applied to the brain, the acoustic pressure exerted through extracellular matrixes, can possibly activate ASIC1a via a cytoskeletal dependent manner (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), in addition to other mechanosensitive machineries such as PIEZO and TRPV4 (36, 37), since these mechanoreceptors have all been proven to be triggered by indentation of substrates.
