Effective stress response cascades, conserved from invertebrates to mammals, ensure reestablishment of homeostasis and tissue repair. Hemocytes, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood-like cells, rapidly respond to oxidative stress by immune activation. However, the precise signals how they sense oxidative stress and integrate these signals to modulate and balance the response to oxidative stress in the adult fly are ill-defined. Furthermore, hemocyte diversification was not explored yet on oxidative stress. Here, we employed high-throughput single nuclei RNA-sequencing to explore hemocytes and other cell types, such as fat body, during oxidative stress in the adult fly. We identified distinct cellular responder states in plasmatocytes, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages, associated with immune response and metabolic activation upon oxidative stress. We further define oxidative stress-induced DNA damage signaling as a key sensor and a rate-limiting step in immune-activated plasmatocytes controlling JNK-mediated release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>unpaired-3</italic>. We subsequently tested the role of this specific immune activated cell stage during oxidative stress and found that inhibition of DNA damage signaling in plasmatocytes, as well as JNK or upd3 overactivation, result in a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress. Our findings uncover that a balanced composition and response of hemocyte subclusters is essential for the survival of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> on oxidative stress by regulating systemic cytokine levels and cross-talk to other organs, such as the fat body, to control energy mobilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Environmental factors, including radiation, pathogens or toxins, permanently lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pham-Huy et al., 2008</xref>). In vertebrates and invertebrates, low levels of ROS support cellular pathways like immune cell differentiation and even immune function including antimicrobial defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herb and Schramm, 2021</xref>). At high concentrations, ROS lead to oxidative stress, a deleterious process that negatively impacts protein synthesis and stability, lipid metabolism as well as overall genome stability. ROS-mediated cellular damage can further result in degenerative diseases or cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nathan and Cunningham-Bussel, 2013</xref>). Therefore, metazoan organisms employ efficient repair and defense mechanisms to circumvent high levels of oxidative stress and subsequent organ damage. Hence, keeping the balance between the production and the antioxidant-dependent clearance of ROS is essential for the survival and well-being of the affected organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Finkel and Holbrook, 2000</xref>). Oxidative stress induced tissue damage is most often followed by a strong local immune response. These molecular processes are conserved across vertebrates and invertebrates such as the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moghadam et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Hemocytes, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cells, are essential cellular components of the immune and stress response machinery. They consist of three different subtypes: crystal cells, lamellocytes, and plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meister and Lagueux, 2003</xref>). Plasmatocytes are considered to be macrophage equivalents in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and comprise up to 95% of all hemocytes in the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). They share many functions as well as the multilayered ontogeny with vertebrate tissue macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gold and Br√ºckner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holz et al., 2003</xref>). Adult plasmatocytes are actively involved in many immune functions such as pathogen recognition, defense, and phagocytosis but also chronic immune activation upon metabolic stress by dietary lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">P√©an et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woodcock et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies highlighted the essential role of adult plasmatocytes as key players in regulation of tissue homeostasis, including the gut by regulating the intestinal stem cell niche or in muscles by controlling glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kierdorf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Similar to higher eukaryotes, levels of ROS are used as a central antimicrobial defense mechanism of hemocytes against invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myers et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, larval hemocytes respond differentially to ROS, with two cell subsets mounting a biphasic immune reaction to invading bacteria by controlling hemocyte spreading and adhesion as well as crystal cell rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Myers et al., 2018</xref>). Larval hemocytes have been also attributed to respond to increased oxidative stress of other tissues, as seen in response to oxidative stress in the eye-antenna imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, by regulating intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation in the damaged midgut during infection- or chemical-induced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>), adult hemocytes were described to release the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) homologue <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) to facilitate tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>). Other studies pointed to an essential role of hemocyte-derived <italic>unpaired-3</italic> (<italic>upd3</italic>), which is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologue of Interleukin-6, in the regulation of ISC proliferation during septic injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>), and wound healing during sterile injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakrabarti and Visweswariah, 2020</xref>). In line with these findings, hemocytes have been implicated in organ-to-organ immune signaling for example upon infection-induced injury in the gut and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Hemocyte activation is thus a hallmark of oxidative stress in defined tissues, although their role in modulating and controlling oxidative stress response to facilitate tissue repair and survival of the organism remains undefined.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate an essential role of hemocytes to control susceptibility to oxidative stress, where hemocytes orchestrate systemic oxidative stress response by defined cellular states identified by unbiased transcriptomic profiling. Plasmatocytes segregate in oxidative stress responder subclusters, characterized by immune activation and cellular stress response, and potential bystander subsets associated with metabolic gene regulations. Mechanistically, we unravel that the direct immune response to oxidative stress by plasmatocytes is driven by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Jak/STAT pathway activation with subsequent induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>upd3</italic>. This inflammatory cascade is to a certain amount regulated by DNA damage signaling in plasmatocytes and essentially defines the susceptibility of the fly to oxidative stress. Deficiencies in the DNA damage signaling machinery in plasmatocytes lead to elevated JNK activation, cytokine release and subsequently a higher susceptibility of the adult fly to oxidative stress. Hence, our data point to a key role of plasmatocytes in balancing systemic cytokine levels and stress response upon oxidative stress. Collectively, we provide new insights on the role of macrophages in orchestrating systemic stress responses in other tissues and to balance tissue wasting and energy mobilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hemocytes control susceptibility to oxidative stress</title><p>In vertebrates and invertebrates, prolonged oxidative stress can cause severe tissue damage, hence controlled activation of stress signaling cascades are essential for the survival of the organism and the resolution of oxidative stress with subsequent tissue repair. Yet the precise role of macrophages in the initiation and control of oxidative stress signaling needs to be determined.</p><p>To analyze the role of macrophages in signaling cascades to oxidative stress, we took advantage of the well-established Paraquat (PQ)-feeding model in adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to induce systemic oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). Feeding of 7 days old <italic>w;Hml-Gal4,UAS-2xeGFP/+</italic> (<italic>Hml/+</italic>) flies with PQ-supplemented sucrose solution led to an increased lethality of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> after 18 hr in a dose-dependent manner (0 mM: 1.25 ¬± 1.25%, 2 mM: 2.5 ¬± 1.6 4%, 15 mM: 27.78 ¬± 5.47%, and 30 mM: 38.75 ¬± 6.67%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), 15 mM PQ was chosen for further experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we determined which systemic changes are associated with susceptibility to oxidative stress. Infection-induced damage in enterocytes can result in gut leakage and subsequent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>). We tested if the death of flies after 18 hr on 15 mM PQ food was associated with PQ-induced damage of gut enterocytes and resulting gut leakage, but we found no indication of gut leakage on 15 mM PQ food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Only very few flies on control food and PQ indicated gut leakage of the food color to thorax and abdomen, which was unrelated to the treatment and not altered between the groups (control: 3.75%, 2 mM PQ: 2.53 %, 15 mM PQ: 1.11% and 30 mM PQ: 3.75 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We investigated if aberrant systemic induction of immune signaling cascades are seen upon PQ-mediated oxidative stress. For this, gene expression levels of different known immune activated genes were analyzed by qPCR such as <italic>unpaired</italic> (<italic>upd</italic>) cytokines (<italic>upd1</italic>, <italic>upd2</italic>, <italic>upd3</italic>), <italic>Jak/STAT</italic> down-stream targets (<italic>Turandot-A</italic> (<italic>TotA</italic>), <italic>suppressor of cytokine signaling at 36E</italic> (<italic>Socs36E</italic>)), stress induced JNK activation (<italic>puckered</italic> (<italic>puc</italic>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as well as expression of <italic>nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells</italic> (<italic>Nfkb</italic>)-induced antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and further cytokines such as <italic>eiger</italic>, <italic>dpp,</italic> and <italic>dawdle</italic> (<italic>daw</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1C‚ÄìD</xref>).

Next, we examined histological sections of flies to define which tissues might be affected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Oil Red O (ORO) stainings showed a shrinkage in fat body cell size and stored lipid-filled vesicles in the abdominal fat body compared to flies kept under control conditions <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1E</xref>. Fat body development, energy mobilization and storage have been recently connected to the presence, cell number and subsequent cross-talk of hemocytes with fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 2021</xref>), therefore we quantified GFP<sup>+</sup> hemocytes in <italic>Hml/+</italic> flies after 18 hr on PQ or control food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G‚ÄìH</xref>). Our analysis did not reveal alterations in hemocyte numbers and especially no oxidative stress induced loss of hemocytes (control: 243.4¬±24.33 hemocytes per fly and PQ: 219.6¬±24.22 hemocytes per fly, ns p<italic>=0.508</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G‚ÄìH</xref>). To evaluate if hemocytes are essential contributors to the stress-mediated metabolic changes and susceptibility to oxidative stress, we used ‚Äòhemocyte-deficient‚Äô <italic>crq-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>&gt;reaper</italic> (<italic>w;tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup>/UAS-CD8-mCherry;crq-Gal4/UAS-reaper</italic>) flies and tested their survival rate compared to control flies on PQ food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Hemocyte-deficient flies displayed a significantly higher mortality rate on 15 mM PQ (43.33 ¬± 6.30%) compared to control flies (13.08 ¬± 2.63%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Next, we analyzed triglycerides, as well as free glucose and glycogen levels in whole flies after 18 hr on control or 15 mM PQ. Interestingly, we found that hemocyte-deficient flies compared to the control genotype mobilized less triglycerides from the fat body during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). When we looked into free glucose levels, we found that these flies show a decrease in free glucose upon PQ feeding, whereas the control genotype showed similar free glucose levels as on normal food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect any difference in glycogen levels between the two genotypes on control food and on PQ food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Our findings show detrimental changes in energy mobilization upon oxidative stress in the absence of profound systemic overactivation of immune signaling cascades, however the presence or absence of hemocytes seem to be a key determinant of the susceptibility to oxidative stress and results in altered energy mobilization in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Interestingly, when we defined which hemocyte clusters were enriched in control flies or PQ-treated flies, the two plasmatocyte clusters C1 and C7 were primarily derived from control flies, whereas C2, C3, C4, and C6 are predominantly found in PQ-treated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2M</xref>). The plasmatocyte cluster C5 as well as the crystal cell cluster C8 presented in both conditions to similar proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2M</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the TOP20 differentially expressed (DE) genes across all hemocyte clusters. We found clear differences between the seven distinct plasmatocyte clusters and the crystal cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The crystal cell cluster C8 showed a high expression of crystal cell specific genes including <italic>lz</italic>, <italic>peb</italic>, <italic>PPO1,</italic> and <italic>PPO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Plasmatocyte cluster C1, which was mostly present in control conditions, had a remarkable expression of hemocyte specific marker genes such as <italic>Hml</italic> and <italic>Pxn,</italic> as well as migration-associated genes including the semaphorins <italic>Sema2a and Sema5c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Yet this cluster also showed higher expression of genes contributing to metabolic regulations such as the L-gulonate 3-dehydrogenase <italic>Had2</italic> and the gluconolactonase <italic>regucalcin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The cluster C7 and C1, mostly found in control flies, substantially shared gene expression profiles. In contrast, cluster C2 and C3 were nearly exclusively found in PQ-treated flies and showed expression of genes involved in metabolic adaptations. Due to this finding, we verified that these cell clusters are <italic>bona fide</italic> hemocytes and not fat body cells. We analyzed the expression of characteristic fat body signature genes, such as <italic>Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1</italic> (<italic>Tps1</italic>), <italic>CG16758</italic>, <italic>CG2233</italic>, <italic>CG4716</italic>, <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>), <italic>Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I</italic> (<italic>CaMKI</italic>), <italic>Desaturase 1</italic> (<italic>Desat1</italic>), <italic>Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase</italic> (<italic>Prps</italic>), <italic>CG34166</italic> and <italic>Apolipoprotein lipid transfer particle</italic> (<italic>Apoltp</italic>) across all identified hemocyte clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Metabolic adaptation within these clusters included high expression of the <italic>glucose transporter 4 enhancer factor</italic> (<italic>Glut4EF</italic>) and the <italic>phosphatidate phosphatase Lipin</italic> (<italic>Lpin</italic>) in C2 or the induced expression of the lipase <italic>brummer</italic> (<italic>bmm</italic>), the <italic>autophagy-associated gene-17</italic> (<italic>Atg17)</italic> or the <italic>lipophorin receptor 1 (LpR1)</italic>, involved in uptake of neutral lipids from the hemolymph, in C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Overall gene expression profiles in clusters C2 and C3 showed an induction of insulin signaling, increased autophagy and lipolysis pointing to adaptation of energy mobilization in these clusters upon PQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Cluster C4 was characterized by a remarkable upregulation of genes involved in translation including many ribosomal proteins such as <italic>RpL8</italic>, <italic>RpL31,</italic> or <italic>RpS13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, C4 included genes associated with unsaturated fatty acid metabolism such as <italic>Desaturase 1 (Desat1)</italic>. Similarly, cluster C5 also showed induction of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism such as <italic>ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7</italic> (<italic>ELOVL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Of note, we also found <italic>Tie-like receptor tyrosine kinase</italic> (<italic>Tie</italic>) specifically expressed in this cluster, which is described to bind PDGF- and VEGF-related factor (Pvf) ligands and contribute to cell survival and migration, as well as actin-associated binding proteins including <italic>polychaetoid</italic> (<italic>pyd</italic>) and <italic>formin 3</italic> (<italic>form3</italic>). All these gene expression changes are pointing to a plasmatocyte cluster with a gene expression profile associated with mobility and migration. Among all plasmatocyte clusters, we found cluster C6 which presented a strong immune activation phenotype with induction of Jak/STAT target genes including <italic>Fasciclin 3</italic> (<italic>Fas3</italic>) and <italic>Turandot-M</italic> (<italic>TotM</italic>) among its TOP20 DE genes<italic>,</italic> but also activation of oxidative stress response genes such as the heat shock proteins <italic>Hsp23</italic>, <italic>Hsp26</italic> and <italic>Hsp27</italic> or cytoskeletal genes including <italic>myosin Myo31DF</italic> or <italic>spire</italic> (<italic>spir</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Due to the partially shared expression profile of genes across hemocyte clusters, we wondered if there were genes exclusively expressed in individual clusters. However, cluster C1 showed that <italic>Sema2a</italic> seems to be exceptionally high expressed in these homeostatic plasmatocytes and genes associated with metabolic regulation (e.g. <italic>InR</italic>, <italic>Lpin</italic> or <italic>bmm</italic>) or Jak/STAT activation (e.g. <italic>Fas3</italic>), as seen in PQ-associated clusters, are downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Cluster C5 showed enrichment for genes such as the transcription factor <italic>grainy head</italic> (<italic>grh</italic>) but also cytoskeletal-associated genes such as <italic>jitterbug</italic> (<italic>jbug</italic>) and <italic>form3,</italic> suggesting a migratory potential of plasmatocytes from this cluster within their host tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, plasmatocyte cluster C6 presented with the most profound gene expression changes compared to all other clusters. Similar to our previous observations, we identified that genes specifically expressed in this cluster were associated with Jak/STAT pathway activation (e.g. <italic>Fas3</italic>, <italic>TotM</italic>), cytoskeletal rearrangements and migration (e.g. <italic>Myo31DF</italic>, <italic>spir</italic> or <italic>cheerio</italic> [<italic>cher</italic>]) and response to oxidative stress (e.g. <italic>Nicotinamide amidase</italic> [<italic>Naam</italic>] or <italic>Hsp23</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also included the crystal cell cluster C8 in this analysis and verified unique expression of crystal cell markers compared to the seven plasmatocyte clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Our snRNA-seq analysis revealed that adult hemocytes respond differentially to oxidative stress with a specific cluster of plasmatocytes associated with immune activation and stress response. Despite our findings that on systemic level we did not detect a strong induction of immune activation upon oxidative stress, we now provide evidence that plasmatocyte cluster C6 showed a substantial immune response toward oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Direct response to oxidative stress <italic>in vitro</italic> mimics the transcriptional changes seen in cluster C6 plasmatocytes <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Plasmatocytes responded to PQ-mediated oxidative stress in different cellular states. We defined cluster C6 as a cell state, which is associated with oxidative stress response and immune activation. Since cluster C6 showed gene expression associated with oxidative stress and immune activation, we focused our further analysis on this cluster. To further substantiate our findings and address the signaling pathways that could lead to diverse transcriptional states, we inferred the transcription factor (TF) network based on gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This analysis revealed that genes with binding sites for <italic>Xbp1</italic> were enriched. <italic>Xbp1</italic> is a transcription factor associated with stress response. In addition to this, the Nf-Œ∫B-related transcription factor <italic>Relish</italic> (<italic>Rel</italic>) and <italic>kayak</italic> (<italic>kay</italic>), a component of the <italic>activator protein-1</italic> (<italic>AP-1</italic>) transcription factor complex induced by JNK signaling, were also enriched in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine if the gene expression signature of cluster C6 plasmatocytes reflects a functional state of plasmatocytes directly induced by oxidative stress, we treated S2 cells, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> plasmatocyte cell line, with different concentrations of PQ (15 mM and 30 mM) <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We were then wondering if PQ-treated S2 cells would resemble cluster C6 plasmatocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> and performed gene expression analysis of S2 cells treated with 15 mM PQ after 6 and 24 hr. Comparable to our results for cluster C6 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found a profound induction of the Jak/STAT target genes by qRT-PCR. In S2 cells, we also detected a significant increase of the Jak/STAT cytokines <italic>upd1</italic>, <italic>upd2,</italic> and <italic>upd3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1E</xref>), which we did not see before <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Along this line, we went back to our snRNA-seq data and specifically searched for Jak/STAT target genes (<italic>upd3</italic>, <italic>Socs36E</italic>, <italic>TotA</italic>, <italic>TotM,</italic> and <italic>Fas3</italic>) across all clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Here, we identified an enriched expression of these genes in cluster C6, and a unique expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>upd3</italic> in cluster C6, which was not detected in any other hemocyte cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Of note, we did not detect elevated <italic>upd3</italic> levels in gene expression profiling of whole flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but now unraveled elevated <italic>upd3</italic> induction in the particular hemocyte cell cluster C6 upon PQ treatment.

This could indicate that plasmatocytes within cluster C6 undergo oxidative stress mediated DNA damage, which results in activation of the DNA damage repair machinery but also JNK activation, similar to what we have seen in S2 cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. However within our snRNA-seq analysis, the JNK target gene <italic>puc</italic> was expressed across all hemocyte clusters analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> without a specific induction in cluster C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To further explore this hypothesis, we aimed to gain further insights into single-cell transcriptomic profiles of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body during oxidative stress. Using cell type-specific signatures, three of the clusters were annotated as fat body cells (clusters: 1, 3, and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A‚ÄìB</xref>). Re-scaling and clustering of all 3150 identified fat body nuclei revealed 8 distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). First, we verified fat body-specific signature gene expression across these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3B</xref>) and excluded expression of hemocyte-specific signature genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3C</xref>). From the eight distinct fat body cell clusters, we identified that cluster C1, C6 and C8 were mainly enriched with cells obtained from control flies, whereas clusters C2-5 were almost exclusively derived from PQ-treated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3D</xref>). Only cluster C7 represents cells from both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3D</xref>). To define the transcriptional changes between these eight fat body cell clusters, we analyzed the TOP20 DE genes across all fat body cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), as well as the unique regulated genes in each specific cluster compared to all others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Here the cluster C1, mostly derived of fat body cells from control flies, showed an enrichment for gene induction associated with triglyceride storage, such as <italic>Fatty acid synthase 1</italic> (<italic>FASN1</italic>), <italic>Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1</italic> (<italic>Gpdh1</italic>) or <italic>Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain</italic> (<italic>Acsl</italic>), as well as fat body signature genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C‚ÄìD</xref>). Interestingly cluster C8, which mostly consisted of cells from control food, showed a distinct expression of AMP genes including <italic>Dro</italic>, <italic>Drs</italic> or <italic>Diptericin-B</italic> (<italic>DptB</italic>), however this cluster completely disappeared after PQ feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C‚ÄìD</xref>). In contrast, PQ treatment induced several fat body-specific cell clusters which were not found in control conditions. For example, cluster C2, C4, and C5 showed a strong gene induction of oxidative stress response genes, but also genes associated with Jak/STAT pathway (e.g. <italic>Socs36E</italic>, <italic>upd3</italic>, <italic>Fas3</italic>, <italic>TotA</italic>) and JNK activation (e.g. <italic>puc</italic>, <italic>kay</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C‚ÄìD</xref>).

We did not find alteration in hemocyte number across all fly lines on control food (with the exception of an increase in hemocytes in the <italic>Hml&gt;tefu-</italic>IR line), nor did we observe any effect of PQ treatment on the number of hemocytes in DDR-deficient flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed if the loss of the DDR signaling machinery via knockdown of <italic>tefu</italic> and <italic>mei41</italic> results in increased DNA damage in hemocytes. Comet assays of isolated hemocytes from DDR-deficient flies and the control genotype on PQ and control food only indicated a slight increase in DNA damage in these flies, which demonstrates that the higher susceptibility of DDR-deficient flies is not due to a loss of hemocyte numbers or a substantial increase in DNA damage, but rather due to changes in the downstream DDR-signaling events modulating immune activation of hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Other studies demonstrated that upon tissue damage JNK-mediated secretion of the JAK/STAT cytokines upd1, upd2 and upd3 is a critical step for innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, DNA damage signaling is essential to induce such an immune response and to regulate insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karpac et al., 2011</xref>). To elucidate the implication of DDR signaling on hemocyte activation and oxidative stress resistance, we measured the gene expression levels of <italic>upd</italic> cytokines as well as JNK and Jak/STAT targets in DDR-deficient flies and controls on PQ and control food. Loss of DNA damage signaling in hemocytes induced a significant induction of <italic>upd3</italic> expression upon PQ treatment in <italic>Hml&gt;tefu-</italic>IR and <italic>Hml&gt;mei-41-IR;tefu-IR</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrary, <italic>upd1</italic> and <italic>upd2</italic> were not significantly changed in DDR-deficient flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We measured the Jak/STAT target genes <italic>Socs36E</italic> and <italic>TotA</italic> on systemic level. A slight induction of <italic>Socs36E</italic> expression in all DDR-deficient genotypes on PQ, but only <italic>Hml&gt;mei-41-IR;tefu-IR</italic> flies showed a significant induction of <italic>Socs36E</italic> upon PQ treatment compared to control food and <italic>Hml/+</italic> flies on PQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). <italic>TotA</italic> expression tended to be reduced upon PQ treatment across all genotypes analyzed. However, when we checked the levels of <italic>puc,</italic> as a <italic>JNK signaling</italic> target gene, we found a significant induction on PQ treatment in <italic>Hml &gt;tefu</italic> IR, <italic>Hml &gt;mei-41-IR;tefu-IR</italic> and <italic>Hml &gt;nbs</italic> IR flies, which was not seen in control flies upon PQ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). When we analyzed the gene expression of genes involved in metabolism and energy mobilization, we detected a significant induction and dysregulation of <italic>Thor</italic> and <italic>InR</italic> in all DDR-deficient genotypes upon PQ treatment compared to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), as well as a slight induction of <italic>Pepck1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To exclude that these changes in energy mobilization are due to altered expression of <italic>Ilps</italic>, we analyzed the levels of <italic>Ilp</italic>2, <italic>Ilp3</italic> and <italic>Ilp5</italic> in all genotypes on control and PQ treatment, but could not detect remarkable alterations here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To further exclude that the higher susceptibility of DDR-deficient flies and seen alterations in stress response are due to inefficient mobilization of triglycerides, we measured stored triglycerides across all genotypes and found efficient mobilization of triglyceride storage upon PQ treatment in all genotypes compared to control food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>From our results, we can conclude that DNA damage signaling in adult hemocytes, mostly consisting of plasmatocytes, essentially determines susceptibility to oxidative stress. Loss of DNA damage signaling in hemocytes results in upregulation of JNK signaling and elevated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>upd3</italic>, as well as transcriptional alterations in energy mobilization and insulin signaling. Based on our previous results on the role of hemocytes during oxidative stress, we can therefore assume that the DNA damage signaling machinery in hemocytes is activated by oxidative stress and plays an essential modulatory and rate-limiting role for subsequent immune activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Adult hemocytes control susceptibility to oxidative stress by JNK signaling and <italic>upd3</italic> release</title><p>To this point, our data suggests that oxidative stress-induced DNA damage signaling in hemocytes limits immune activation and stress response upon oxidative stress.

Therefore, we wanted to verify if JNK activation in hemocytes acts as a direct downstream signal activated by oxidative stress and subsequently induces the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>upd3</italic>. We either overexpressed a constitutive active form of <italic>JNKK hemipterous</italic> (<italic>hep</italic>) in hemocytes using <italic>Hml&gt;hep[act]</italic> (<italic>w;Hml-Gal4,UAS-2xeGFP/UAS-hep[act]</italic>) flies or overexpressed a dominant-negative version of the Jun kinase <italic>basket</italic> (<italic>bsk</italic>) in hemocytes using <italic>Hml&gt;bsk-</italic>DN (<italic>w;Hml-Gal4,UAS-2xeGFP/UAS-bsk-DN</italic>). We compared their survival on PQ after 18 hr and in line with our previous results, we found an increased susceptibility of <italic>Hml&gt;hep[act</italic>] flies to PQ treatment, but not of <italic>Hml&gt;bsk-</italic>DN flies compared to the control genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We again analyzed the overall lifespan of these flies on normal food and could not find differences between the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1H</xref>). Furthermore, when we analyzed <italic>upd3</italic> expression in these flies upon PQ treatment, we found a significant induction of <italic>upd3</italic> expression after PQ treatment in <italic>Hml&gt;hep[act</italic>] compared to control food, but only a slight increase in <italic>Hml/+</italic> and <italic>Hml&gt;bsk-</italic>DN flies upon PQ feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These findings support a substantial role of JNK-mediated induction of <italic>upd3</italic> in hemocytes upon oxidative stress.</p><p>In summary, our study revealed a defined immune-responsive subset of plasmatocytes during oxidative stress. We show that this oxidative stress-mediated immune activation seems to be regulated by DNA damage signaling in hemocytes, which controls JNK activation and subsequent <italic>upd3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

However, this immune activation was not obvious on a systemic level upon PQ-mediated oxidative stress. In contrast, localized oxidative stress-induced immune activation in damaged tissues is an essential step of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response to infection or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>). However, the precise contribution of <italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages in this immune activation, in the organ-to-organ communication during stress response and the implication in the organism‚Äôs survival upon increased oxidative stress remained so far ill-defined. Overall, we describe the induction of diverse cellular states of adult hemocytes, namely plasmatocytes, during oxidative stress with a particular subset of plasmatocytes (cluster C6) which directly responds to oxidative stress by immune activation. We demonstrated that this immune activation seems to be at least partially controlled by the DNA damage signaling machinery in hemocytes. Loss of <italic>nbs</italic>, <italic>tefu</italic> or <italic>mei-41</italic> in hemocytes renders the organism more susceptible to oxidative stress without significantly affecting oxidative stress mediated DNA damage, but with an enhanced induction of JAK/STAT and JNK signaling, accompanied by changes in genes associated with energy mobilization and storage. In line with that, we describe substantial changes in the fat body on the transcriptomic level with diverse cell states, indicating decrease of triglyceride storage and induced response to oxidative stress and immune activation, but loss of AMP-producing cells. Finally, we showed that the control of hemocyte-derived <italic>upd3</italic> is key for the survival of the organism upon oxidative stress and that induction of the <italic>JNK/upd3</italic> signaling axis in hemocytes is sufficient to increase the susceptibility to oxidative stress. Hence, we postulate that hemocyte-derived <italic>upd3</italic> is most likely released by the activated plasmatocyte cluster C6 during oxidative stress <italic>in vivo</italic> and is subsequently controlling energy mobilization and subsequent tissue wasting upon oxidative stress.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes have been described before to react to PQ- or infection-mediated intestinal damage via release of cytokines to promote ISC proliferation in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>). PQ is a widely used model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to induce oxidative stress via oral uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rzezniczak et al., 2011</xref>). In many reports, the gut has been described to be the most affected organ and ISC proliferation is an essential step to regenerate the injured intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). PQ treatment has been described to cause gut leakage and therefore this could be a potential cause of death for the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>), although we did not find signs of gut leakage within the 18 hr PQ treatment with a concentration of 15 mM. Aside from the gut, oral PQ treatment was shown to induce oxidative stress in many organs including hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azad et al., 2011</xref>), oenocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maitra et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that the induced oxidative stress is not only localized to the gut tissue. PQ-induced oxidative stress was described before to cause neurodegeneration with parkinsonism-like symptoms, accompanied by strong immune activation and upregulation of JNK signaling in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maitra et al., 2019</xref>), an activation profile similar to the identified activated plasmatocyte cluster C6 and the activated fat body clusters C2 and C4 in our snRNA-seq analysis. The snRNA-seq analysis further revealed distinct hemocyte clusters with seven plasmatocyte clusters and one crystal cell cluster. Whereas the plasmatocyte clusters C1 and C7 seem to represent cellular states found in steady state conditions only, we identified several other clusters which seemed to be exclusive or at least enriched under PQ treatment. Interestingly, we only identified one cluster, C6, which specifically responded to oxidative stress via immune activation and upregulation of oxidative stress response genes but also <italic>Jak/STAT</italic> and JNK target genes. We postulate that these cells might be directly exposed to the oxidative stress because their signature resembles the one of S2 cells directly treated with PQ <italic>in vitro</italic>. Even though oxidative DNA damage in hemocytes was followed by immune activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, it remains to be determined if this activation is induced by cytokines derived from damaged organs during oxidative stress or by the oxidative stress directly. The hypothesis that this cluster is directly exposed to oxidative stress is further supported by an upregulation of genes such as <italic>Hsps</italic> in this cluster, which are known to be directly induced by oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan and Marr, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we found evidence that oxidative DNA damage and induced DNA damage signaling dynamically modulate immune activation cascades in cluster C6 plasmatocytes. This was supported by the increased DNA damage in S2 cells by PQ treatment but also the enrichment of DDR-associated genes such as <italic>Gadd45</italic> in cluster C6, which is associated with JNK activation and is further implicated in oxidative stress induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maitra et al., 2019</xref>). Constant DNA damage signaling and repair is an essential step in all tissues to maintain tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we point to a potential role of DNA damage signaling as a rate-limiting step for immune activation and response to oxidative stress in hemocytes. We did not find indications of canonical DNA damage response, such as induced apoptosis in hemocytes due to the oxidative DNA damage. Non-canonical DNA damage sensing has been implicated in immune responses in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karpac et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maitra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednarski and Sleckman, 2019</xref>). It was demonstrated that vertebrate macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> respond similarly to immune stimuli such as infection by synergistic activation of DDR and type I interferon signaling to induce downstream immune signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morales et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we provide new evidence in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that potentially non-canonical DNA damage is used by immune cells <italic>in vivo</italic> to modulate and especially control their immune response including pro-inflammatory cytokine release upon oxidative stress. Localized DNA damage in larval epithelial cells has been shown to induce non-canonical DNA damage activity leading to the secretion of <italic>upds</italic> and the regulation of hemocyte expansion and activation, as well as subsequent hemocyte-mediated regulation of energy storage in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karpac et al., 2011</xref>). In further support of our results, one report previously demonstrated that loss of DNA damage signaling machinery induced the release of <italic>upd3</italic> in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayyaz et al., 2015</xref>). Most likely, the identified plasmatocyte cluster C6 is a central cellular source of this signal. However, we also detected <italic>upd3</italic> induction in the PQ-induced fat body cell cluster C4 as potential secondary source of upd3, which needs to be further determined in future studies. Furthermore, anatomical localization of this upd3-producing plasmatocyte cluster, as well as spatial distribution and cross-talk of the different plasmatocyte and fat body cell clusters would be of interest. We describe a strong connection between the control of <italic>upd3</italic> expression by hemocytes and the susceptibility of the adult fly to oxidative stress. Upon oxidative stress, we observe decreased triglycerides and glycogen stores and altered gene expression such as induced expression of lipolytic enzymes and other <italic>foxo</italic> target genes indicating energy mobilization from the adult fat body, which was further supported by the transcriptomic profiling of fat body cells. Accumulating evidence throughout our study points to an implication of hemocyte-derived <italic>upd3</italic> in the control of energy mobilization and tissue wasting during oxidative stress. Our data from hemocyte-deficient flies indicating defects in energy mobilization and maintenance of free glucose levels further support this assumption. Our presented findings are in line with our previous studies where we showed that upon high-fat diet hemocytes produce high levels of <italic>upd3</italic> which induces insulin insensitivity in many tissues by activating Jak/STAT signaling in these organs and inhibiting the insulin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woodcock et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we and others described a central role for hemocyte-derived <italic>upds</italic> in the control of glucose metabolism in muscles during steady state and upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kierdorf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). As shown before, hemocytes produce high levels of <italic>upd3</italic> upon infection with <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> which also caused tissue wasting and extensive energy mobilization in a <italic>foxo</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">P√©an et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dionne et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our study provides further evidence that hemocytes serve as essential signaling hubs in ‚Äòorgan-to-organ communication‚Äô during oxidative stress, which is in line with previous studies in immune challenge as well as steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang and Hultmark, 2016</xref>). Our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> highlight the role of macrophages for the survival on oxidative stress with an urgent need for a balanced immune response to overcome the tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We further unravel the diverse responses of hemocytes and fat body cells toward oxidative stress which can now serve as a baseline to further explore the spatiotemporal macrophage/hemocyte responses to oxidative stress and their communication with other host tissue cells such as the fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Future in-depth analysis of the regulation of these cellular states and their coupling to tissue repair will allow to gain new insights for the treatment of diseases where tissue repair and tissue wasting needs to be balanced, including cancer or neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> stocks</title><p>Flies were reared on a high yeast food containing 10% brewer‚Äôs yeast, 8% fructose, 2% polenta and 0.8% Agar.

Based on the DEGs found by the ‚ÄòFindAllMarkers‚Äô function (parameters: only.pos=T, test.use = ‚ÄúMAST‚Äù), a heat map was plotted for TOP 20 DE genes per clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Regulation network analysis of hemocyte clusters</title><p>In order to determine the transcription factor activity, regulon analysis was performed using the R package SCENIC (v1.3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>). To remove noise, genes with low expression levels or low positive rates were filtered using the ‚ÄògeneFiltering‚Äô function with default settings to obtain a filtered matrix which was used to build co-expression network using the ‚ÄòrunCorrelation‚Äô and ‚ÄòrunGENIE3‚Äô functions. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were built and scored using the default parameters. Potential regulons based on DNA-motif analysis were selected by using RcisTarget and active gene networks were identified by AUCell. Regulon activity for each cell was calculated as the average normalized expression of putative target genes. Regulon activity matrix was exported which was used to create a new ‚ÄòAUC‚Äô assay using ‚ÄòCreateAssayObject‚Äô function of Seurat. ‚ÄòDoHeatmap‚Äô function from Seurat was used to plot scaled TF activity in individual hemocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>S2 cell culture, CellROX staining, and flow cytometry</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (Thermo Scientific, R96007) were cultured in Schneider‚Äôs <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (Gibco) at 26 ¬∞C and atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide conditions. The medium contained 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PQ was added into the medium in concentrations of 15 mM or 30 mM to investigate the influence on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Control cells remained untreated. To visualize ROS and oxidative stress, the cells were stained with CellROX Deep Red Reagent (Invitrogen) for 30 min directly in the medium in a concentration of 1:500 at 26 ¬∞C. The cells were washed twice with 1xPBS containing 2 mM EDTA. In order to stain dead cells, DAPI was added to the samples in a concentration of 1:1000. Samples were acquired using a BD LSRFortessa (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>COMET assays</title><p>Comet assays were performed to analyze the amount of DNA damage in S2 cells treated with PQ. S2 cells were treated with 15 mM or 30 mM PQ for 24 hr. The cells were brought into a concentration of 1.8x10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml. Low melting agarose (LMA) was boiled at 90 ¬∞C and subsequently cooled down to 37 ¬∞C. The cells were diluted in low melting agarose (LMA) at a ratio of 1:10 (cells:LMA) and transferred onto a CometSlide (Trevigen). To ensure proper attachment of the LMA, the slides were cooled for 30 min at 4 ¬∞C. The lysis was performed for 1 hr at 4 ¬∞C. Therefore, the slides were submerged in CometAssay Lysis Solution (Trevigen). Subsequently, the cells were submerged in alkaline unwinding solution (200 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH 13) for 1 hr at 4 ¬∞C. The electrophoresis was performed under alkaline conditions (pH13) for 30 min with a current of 20 V (1 V/cm). The slides were neutralized with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, dehydrated with 37% ethanol and dried properly at 37 ¬∞C before they were stained with SYBRGold (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Comets were imaged with an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope. Comet data was analyzed via TriTrek CometScore 2.0.0.38 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis and data handling</title><p>Statistical significance of real-time qPCR, Paraquat survival, hemocyte quantification, TLC, Glucose assay, CellROX and comet assay data was calculated with an unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA as indicated in the figure legends.

Using single cell sequencing they identify several transcriptionally distinct populations of hemocytes, including one subset that show altered immune and stress gene expression. They also find that knockdown of DNA Damage Response (DDR) genes in hemocytes increases expression of the immune cytokine, upd3, and that both upd3 overexpression in hemocytes and hemocyte knockdown of DDR genes leads to increased lethality upon oxidative stress. And they find that the PQ-induced lethality seen when the DDR is disrupted can be rescued in upd3 null background, suggesting links between proper regulation of DDR in hemocytes, modulation of systemic upd3 signaling, and the control of oxidative stress survival.</p><p>The paper has two key strengths:</p><p>1, The single cell analyses provide a clear description of how oxidative stress can cause distinct transcriptional changes in different populations of hemocytes.

They found that hemocytes are essential in this response, and using state-of-the-art single-cell transcriptomics, they identified expression changes at the level of individual hemocytes. This allowed them to cluster hemocytes into subgroups with different responses, which certainly represents very valuable work. One of the clusters appears to respond directly to oxidative stress and shows a very specific expression response that could be related to the observed systemic metabolic changes and energy mobilization.</p><p>Using hemocyte-specific genetic manipulation, the authors convincingly show that the DNA damage response in hemocytes regulates JNK activity and subsequent expression of the JAK/STAT ligand Upd3. Silencing of the DNA damage response or excessive activation of JNK and Upd3 leads to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. This nicely demonstrates the importance of tight control of JNK-Upd3 signaling in hemocytes during oxidative stress. The treatment the authors used is quite harsh, and in such a situation it is simply better not to use upd3 signaling, but it is still worth bearing in mind that upd3 signaling may have a protective role under milder stresses, but Upd3 could require very tight control - this could be an interesting objective for future studies.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that hemocytes play an important role in energy mobilization during oxidative stress, suggesting that control of energy mobilization by hemocytes is essential for the response. They further postulate that &quot;hemocyte-derived upd3 is most likely released by the activated plasmatocyte cluster C6 during oxidative stress in vivo and is subsequently controlling energy mobilization and subsequent tissue wasting upon oxidative stress.&quot; It is important to note here that the association of upd3 with the observed changes in energy metabolism has not been tested, and the subsequent tissue wasting allegedly caused by excessive upd3 as a cause of death remains an open question.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86700.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Kierdorf and colleagues investigated the function of hemocytes in oxidative stress response and found that non-canonical DNA damage response (DDR) is critical for controlling JNK activity and the expression of cytokine unpaired3.

The evidence in support of the requirement for hemocytes in oxidative stress responses as well as the hemocyte single-nuclei analyses in the presence or absence of oxidative stress are convincing. In contrast, the genetic and physiological analyses that link the non-canonical DDR pathway to upd3/JNK expression and high susceptibility, and the inferences regarding the function of hemocytes in systemic metabolic control are incomplete and would benefit from more rigorous approaches. The work will be of interest to cell and developmental biologists working on animal metabolism, immunity, or stress responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the editorial team for these positive comments on our manuscript and the constructive suggestions to improve our manuscript. We are now happy to send you our revised manuscript, which we improved according to the suggestions and valuable comments of the referees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The study examines how hemocytes control whole-body responses to oxidative stress. Using single cell sequencing they identify several transcriptionally distinct populations of hemocytes, including one subset that show altered immune and stress gene expression. They also find that knockdown of DNA Damage Response (DDR) genes in hemocytes increases expression of the immune cytokine, upd3, and that both upd3 overexpression in hemocytes and hemocyte knockdown of DDR genes leads to increased lethality upon oxidative stress.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>1. The single cell analyses provide a clear description of how oxidative stress can cause distinct transcriptional changes in different populations of hemocytes. These results add to the emerging them in the field that there functionally different subpopulations of hemocytes that can control organismal responses to stress.</p><p>1. The discovery that DDR genes are required upon oxidative stress to limit cytokine production and lethality provides interesting new insight into the DDR may play non-canonical roles in controlling organismal responses to stress.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to referee 1 to point out the importance and novelty of our snRNA-seq data and our findings on the role of DNA damage-modulated cytokine release by hemocytes during oxidative stress. We further extended these analyses in the revised manuscript by looking deeper into the transcriptomic alterations in fat body cells upon oxidative stress (Figure 4, Figure S4). We further provide additional data to support the connection of DNA damage signaling and regulation of upd3 release from hemocytes (Figure 6F). Here we show that upd3-deficiency can abrogate the increased susceptibility of flies with mei41 and tefu knockdown in hemocytes. In line with this finding, we also show that upd3null mutants show a reduced but not abolished susceptibility to oxidative stress overall (Figure 6F), underlining the role of upd3 as a mediator of oxidative stress response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. In some ways the authors interpretation of the data - as indicated, for example, in the title, summary and model figure - don't quite match their data. From the title and model figure, it seems that the authors suggest that the DDR pathway induces JNK and Upd3 and that the upd3 leads to tissue wasting. However, the data suggest that the DDR actually limits upd3 production and susceptibility to death as suggested by several results:</p></disp-quote><p>According to the referee‚Äôs suggestion, we revised the manuscript and adjusted our title, abstract and graphical summary to be more precise that DNA damage signaling seem to have a modulatory or regulatory effect on upd3 release. Furthermore, we provide now additional data to support the connection between DNA damage signaling and upd3 release. For example, we added several genetic ‚Äúrescue‚Äù experiments to strengthen the epistasis that modulation of DNA damage signaling and the higher susceptibility of the fly is connected to altered upd3 levels (Figure 6F). We now provide additional data showing that the loss of upd3 rescues the susceptibility to oxidative stress in flies, which are deficient for DDR components in hemocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. PQ normally doesn't induce upd3 but does lead to glycogen and TAG loss, suggesting that upd3 isn't connected to the PQ-induced wasting.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though in our systemic gene expression analysis of upd3 expression, we could not detect a significant induction of upd3 upon PQ feeding. However, we found upd3 expression within our snRNAseq data in a distinct cluster of immune-activated hemocytes (Figure 3B, Cluster 6). Upon knockdown of the DNA damage signaling in hemocytes, the levels then increase to a detectable level in the whole fly. This supports our assumption that upd3 is needed upon oxidative stress to induce energy mobilization from the fat body, but needs to be tightly controlled to balance tissue wasting for energy mobilization. Furthermore, we found evidence in our new analysis of the snRNA-seq data of the fat body cells, that indeed we can find Jak/STAT activation in one cell cluster here, which could speak for an interaction of Cluster 6 hemocytes with cluster 6 fat body cells. A hypothesis we aim to explore in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. knockdown of DDR upregulates upd3 and leads to increased PQ-induced death. This would suggest that activation of DDR is normally required to limit, rather than serve as the trigger for upd3 production and death.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data support the hypothesis that DDR signaling in hemocytes ‚Äúmodulates‚Äù upd3 levels upon oxidative stress. We now carefully revised the text and the graphical summary of the manuscript to emphasize that oxidative stress causes DNA damage, which subsequently induces the DNA damage signaling machinery. If this machinery is not sufficiently induced, for example by knockdown of tefu and mei-41, non-canonical DNA damage signaling is altered which induces JNK signaling and induces release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including upd3. Whereas DNA damage itself is only slightly increase in the used DDR deficient lines (Figure 5C) and hemocytes do not undergo apoptosis (unaltered cell number on PQ (Figure 5B)), we conclude that loss of tefu, mei-41, or nbs1 causes dysregulation of inflammatory signaling cascades via non-canonical DNA damage signaling. However, oxidative stress itself seems to also induce upd3 release and DNA damage signaling in the same cell cluster, as shown by our snRNA-seq data (Figure 3B). Hence, we think that DNA damage signaling is needed as a rate-limiting step for upd3 release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. hemocyte knockdown of either JNK activity or upd3 doesn't affect PQ-induced death, suggesting that they don't contribute to oxidative stress-induced death. It‚Äôs only when DDR is impaired (with DDR gene knockdown) that an increase in upd3 is seen (although no experiments addressed whether JNK was activated or involved in this induction of upd3), suggesting that DDR activation prevents upd3 induction upon oxidative stress.</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas the double knockdown of upd3 or bsk and DDR genes was resulting in insufficient knockdown efficiencies, we added a rescue experiment where we combined upd3null mutants with knockdown of tefu and mei-41 in hemocytes and found a reduced susceptibility of DDR-deficient flies to oxidative stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The connections between DDR, JNK and upd3 aren't fully developed. The experiments show that susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced death can be caused by (a) knockdown of DDR genes, (b) genetic overexpression of upd3, (c) genetic activation of JNK. But whether these effects are all related and reflect a linear pathway requires a little more work. For example, one prediction of the proposed model is that the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced death in the hemocyte DDR gene knockdowns would be suppressed (perhaps partially) by simultaneous knockdown of upd3 and/or JNK. These types of epistasis experiments would strengthen the model and the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned before, we had some technical difficulties combining the knockdown of bsk or upd3 with DDR genes. However, we added a new experiment in which we show that upd3null mutation can rescue the higher susceptibility of hemocytes with tefu and mei41 knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The (potential) connections between DDR/JNK/UPD3 and the oxidative stress effects on depletion of nutrient (lipids and glycogen) stores was also not fully developed. However, it may be the case that, in this paper, the authors just want to speculate that the effects of hemocyteDDR/upd3 manipulation on viability upon oxidative stress involve changes in nutrient stores.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we now provide a more thorough snRNA-seq analysis in the fat body upon PQ treatment to give more insights on the changes in the fat body upon PQ treatment. We added additional histological images of the abdominal fat body on control food and PQ food, to demonstrate the elimination of triglycerides from fat body with Oil-Red-O staining (Figure S1). We also analyzed now hemocyte-deficient (crq-Gal80ts&gt;reaper) flies for their levels of triglycerides and carbohydrates during oxidative stress, to support our hypothesis that hemocytes are key players in the regulation of energy mobilization during oxidative stress. Loss of hemocytes (and therefore also their regulatory input on energy mobilization from the fat body) results in increased triglyceride storage in the fat body during steady state with a decreased consumption of these triglycerides on PQ food compared to control flies (Figure 1J). In contrast, glycogen storage and mobilization, which is mostly done in muscle, is not altered in these flies during oxidative stress (Figure 1L). Interestingly, free glucose levels are drastically reduced in hemocyte-deficient flies, which could be due to insufficient energy mobilization from the fat body and subsequently results in a higher susceptibility of these flies on oxidative stress (Figure 1K). Additionally, we aim to point out here that ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù hemocytes are needed for effective response to oxidative stress, but this response has to be tightly balanced (see also new graphical abstract).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Hersperger et al. investigated the importance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune cells, called hemocytes, in the response to oxidative stress in adult flies. They found that hemocytes are essential in this response, and using state-of-the-art single-cell transcriptomics, they identified expression changes at the level of individual hemocytes. This allowed them to cluster hemocytes into subgroups with different responses, which certainly represents very valuable work. One of the clusters appears to respond directly to oxidative stress and shows a very specific expression response that could be related to the observed systemic metabolic changes and energy mobilization. However, the association of these transcriptional changes in hemocytes with metabolic changes is not well established in this work. Using hemocyte-specific genetic manipulation, the authors convincingly show that the DNA damage response in hemocytes regulates JNK activity and subsequent expression of the JAK/STAT ligand Upd3. Silencing of the DNA damage response or excessive activation of JNK and Upd3 leads to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. This nicely demonstrates the importance of tight control of JNK-Upd3 signaling in hemocytes during oxidative stress. However, it would have been nice to show here a link to systemic metabolic changes, as the authors conclude that it is tissue wasting caused by excessive Upd3 activation that leads to increased susceptibility, but metabolic changes were not analyzed in the manipulated flies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the suggestion to better connect upd3 cytokine levels to energy mobilization from the fat body. We agree that this is an important point to support our hypothesis. First, we added now a detailed analysis of fat body cells in our snRNA-seq data to evaluate the changes induced in the fat body upon oxidative stress. We further added additional metabolic analyses of hemocyte-deficient flies (crq-Gal80ts&gt;reaper) to support our hypothesis that hemocytes are key players in the regulation of energy mobilization during oxidative stress (see also answer to referee 1). Loss of the regulatory role of hemocytes in the energy mobilization and redistribution leads to a decreased consumption of these triglycerides on PQ food compared to control flies (Figure 1J). In contrast, glycogen storage and mobilization from muscle, is not affected in hemocyte-deficient flies during oxidative stress (Figure 1L). Interestingly, free glucose levels are drastically reduced in hemocyte-deficient flies compared to controls, which could be due to insufficient energy mobilization from the fat body resulting in a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress (Figure 1K). This data supports our assumption that ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù hemocytes are needed for effective response to oxidative stress, but this response has to be tightly balanced (see also new graphical summary).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The overall conclusion of this work, as presented by the authors, is that Upd3 expression in hemocytes under oxidative stress leads to tissue wasting, whereas in fact it has been shown that excessive hemocyte-specific Upd3 activation leads to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress (whether due to increased tissue wasting remains a question). The DNA damage response ensures tight control of JNK-Upd3, which is important. However, what role naturally occurring Upd3 expression plays in a single hemocyte cluster during oxidative stress has not been tested. What if the energy mobilization induced by this naturally occurring Upd3 expression during oxidative stress is actually beneficial, as the authors themselves state in the abstract - for potential tissue repair? It would have been useful to clarify in the manuscript that the observed pathological effects are due to overactivation of Upd3 (an important finding), but this does not necessarily mean that the observed expression of Upd3 in one cluster of hemocytes causes the pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that the pathological effects and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress are mediated by over-activated hemocytes and enhanced cytokine release, including upd3 during oxidative stress. We edited the revised manuscript accordingly to imply a ‚Äúregulatory‚Äù role of upd3, which we suspect and suggest as an important mediator for inter-organ communication between hemocytes and fat body. Whereas our used model for oxidative stress (15mM Paraquat feeding) is a severe insult from which most of the flies will not recover, we could not account and test how upd3 might influence tissue repair after injury, insults and infection. We believe that this is an important factor, we aim to explore in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, Kierdorf and colleagues investigated the function of hemocytes in oxidative stress response and found that non-canonical DNA damage response (DDR) is critical for controlling JNK activity and the expression of cytokine unpaired3.

Furthermore, we added additional data to highlight the importance of hemocytes themselves as essential regulators of susceptibility to oxidative stress. We analyzed the hemocyte-deficient flies (crq-Gal80ts&gt;reaper) for their triglyceride content and carbohydrate levels during oxidative stress (Figure 1 I-L). As outlined above, loss of hemocytes leads to a decreased consumption of these triglycerides on PQ food compared to control flies (Figure 1J).

Lethality after PQ treatment varies widely (sometimes from 10 to 90%! as in Figure 5D) - is this normal? In some experiments the variability was much lower. In particular, Figure 5D is very problematic and for example the result with upd3 null mutant compared to control is not very convincing. This could be an important result to test whether Upd3, with normal expression likely coming from cluster 6, actually plays a beneficial role, whereas overexpression with Hml leads to pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that it would be more convincing if the variation cross of survival experiments would be less. However, we included a lot of flies and vials in many individual experiments to test our hypothesis and variation in these survivals was always the case. These effects can be caused by many factors for example the amount of food intake by the flies, genetic background or inserted transgenes. The n-number is quite high across our survivals; so that we are convinced, the seen effects are valid. This reflects also the power of using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> as a model organism for such survivals. The high n-number in our data falls into a normal Gauss distribution with a distinct mean susceptibility between the genotypes analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I like the conclusion at the end of the results: line 413: &quot;We show that this oxidative stressmediated immune activation seems to be controlled by non-canonical DNA damage signaling resulting in JNK activation and subsequent upd3 expression, which can render the adult fly more susceptible to oxidative stress when it is over-activated.&quot; This is actually a more appropriate conclusion, but in the summary, introduction and discussion along with the overall schematic illustration, this is not actually stated as such, but rather as Upd3 released from cluster 6 causes the pathology. For example: line 435 &quot;Hence, we postulate that hemocyte-derived upd3, most likely released by the activated plasmatocyte cluster C6 during oxidative stress in vivo and subsequently controlling energy mobilization and subsequent tissue wasting upon oxidative stress.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion and edited our manuscript and conclusions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. In Figure 2, the authors claim showed that PQ treatment changes the hemocyte clusters in a way that suppresses the conventional Hml+ or Pxn+ hemocytes (cluster1) while expanding hemocyte clusters enriched with metabolic genes such as Lpin, bmm etc. It is not clear whether these cells are comparable to the fat body and if these clusters express any of previously known hemocyte marker genes to claim that these are bona fide hemocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included a new analysis of our snRNA-seq data in Figure S4, where we clearly show that all identified hemocyte clusters do not have a fat body signature and are hemocytes, which seem to undergo metabolic adaptations (Figure S4A). Furthermore, we show that the identified fat body cells have a clear fat body signature (Figure S4B) and do not express specific hemocyte markers (Figure S4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 4C, the authors showed that comet assays of isolated hemocytes result in a statistically significant increase in DNA damage in DDR-deficient flies before and after PQ treatment. However, the authors conclude that, in lines 324-328, the higher susceptibility of DDR-deficient flies is not due to an increase in DNA damage. To explicitly conclude that &quot;non-canonical&quot; DNA damage response, without any DNA damage, is specifically upregulated during PQ treatment, the authors require further support to exclude the potential activation of canonical DDR.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is correct that we do not provide direct evidence for non-canonical DNA damage signaling. Therefore, we also decided to tune down our statement here a bit and removed that claim from the title. Increase in DNA damage can of course also increase the non-canonical DNA damage signaling pathway, loss of DNA damage signaling genes such as tefu and mei-41 seem to only have minor impacts on the overall amount of DNA damage acquired in hemocytes by oxidative stress. We therefore concluded that the induction in immune activation is most unlikely only caused by increased DNA damage but might be connected to dysregulation in non-canonical DNA damage signaling. Canonical DNA damage signaling leads essentially to DDR, which could be slow in adult hemocytes because they post-mitotic, or to apoptosis, which we could not observe in the analyzed time window in our experiments. Hemocyte number remained stable over the 24h PQ treatment without reduction in cell number (Figure 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. From Figure 4D-F, the authors showed that loss of DDR in hemocytes induces the expression of unpaired 2 and 3, Socs36E, which represent the JAK/STAT pathway, and thor, InR, Pepck in the InR pathway, and a JNK readout, puc. These results indicate that the DDR pathway normally inhibits the upd-mediated JAK/STAT activation upon PQ treatment, compared to wild-type animals during PQ treatment in Figure 1B-C, which in turn protects the animal during oxidative stress responses. However, the authors claim that &quot;enhanced DNA damage boosts immune activation and therefore susceptibility to oxidative stress (lines 365-366); we show that this oxidative stress-mediated immune activation seems to be controlled by non-canonical DNA damage signaling resulting in JNK activation and subsequent upd3 expression (line 413-416)&quot;. These conclusions are not compatible with the authors' data and may require additional data to support or can be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we carefully revised now the text and our statements that it seems that DNA damage signaling in hemocytes has regulatory or modulatory effect on the immune response during oxidative stress. Accordingly, we also adjusted our graphical summary. We agree with the referee and used the term ‚Äúnon-canonical‚Äù DNA damage signaling more carefully throughout the manuscript. The slight increase in DNA damage seen after PQ treatment can contribute to immune activation but seems to be not correlative to the induced cytokine levels or the susceptibility of the flies to oxidative stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Fig 1I, the authors showed that genetic ablation of hemocytes using UAS-repear induces susceptibility to PQ treatment. It is possible that inducing cell death in hemocytes itself causes the expression of cytokine upd3 or activates the JNK pathway to enhance the basal level of upd3/JNK even without PQ treatment. If this phenotype is solely mediated by the loss of hemocytes, the results should be repeated by reducing the number of hemocytes with alternative genetic backgrounds.</p></disp-quote><p>In the different genotypes analyzed across our manuscript we did not detect cell death of hemocytes or a dramatic reduction in hemocytes number (see Figure 1H, Figure 5B, Figure 6C). The higher susceptibility if hemocyte-deficient flies during oxidative stress is most likely caused by the loss of their regulatory role during energy mobilization. We tested triglyceride levels in hemocyte-deficient flies and found a decreased triglyceride consumption (lipolysis), with reduced levels of circulating glucose levels. This findings support our hypothesis that hemocytes are needed to balance the response to oxidative stress. In contrast, the flies with DDR-deficient hemocytes show higher systemic cytokine levels, which most likely enhance energy mobilization from the fat body and therefore result in a higher susceptibility of the fly to oxidative stress. Hence, we claim that hemocytes and their regulation of systemic cytokine levels are important to balance the response to oxidative stress and guarantee the survival of the organism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lethality of control animals in PQ treatment is variable and it is hard to estimate the effect of animal susceptibility during 15mM PQ feeding. For example, Fig1A shows that control animals exhibit ~10% death during 15mM PQ which is further enhanced by crq-Gal80&gt;reaper expression to 40% (Fig 1I). However, in Fig 5D-E, the basal lethality of wild-type controls already reaches 40~50%, which makes them hard to compare with other genetic manipulations. Related to this, the authors demonstrated that the expression of upd3 in hemocytes is sufficient to aggravate animal survival upon PQ treatment; however, upd3 null mutants do not rescue the lethality, which indicates that upd3 is not required for hampering animal mortality. These data need to be revisited and analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we find the variability of susceptibility to oxidative stress across all of our experiments. This could be due to different effects such as food intake but also transgene insertion and genetic background. Crq-gal80ts&gt;reaper flies are healthy, but show a shortened life span on normal food (Kierdorf et al., 2020) due to enhanced loss of proteostasis in muscles. We show in the revised manuscript that these flies have a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress and that this effect could be mediated by defects in energy mobilization and redistribution as shown by less triglyceride lysis from the fat body and decreasing levels in free glucose. This would explain the high mortality rate of these flies at 7 days after eclosion. Paraquat treatment (15mM) is a severe inducer of oxidative stress, which results in death of most flies when they are maintained for longer time windows on PQ food. Hence, it is a model, which is not suitable to examine and monitor recovery from this detrimental insult. upd3null mutants were extensively reexamined in this manuscript, and even though we could not see a full protection of these flies from oxidative stress induced death, we found a reduced susceptibility compared to control flies (Figure 6F). Furthermore, when we combined upd3null mutants with flies deficient for tefu and mei-41 in hemocytes, the increased susceptibility to oxidative stress was rescued.</p></body></sub-article></article>
