Two promising strategies to curb transmission are transgenesis, consisting of genetically engineering mosquitoes to express antimalarial effector molecules, and paratransgenesis, consisting of introducing into the mosquito commensal bacteria engineered to express antimalarial effector molecules. Although both approaches restrict parasite development in the mosquito, it is not known how their effectiveness compares. Here we provide an in-depth assessment of transgenesis and paratransgenesis and evaluate the combination of the two approaches. Using the Q-system to drive gene expression, we engineered mosquitoes to produce and secrete two effectors – scorpine and the MP2 peptide – into the mosquito gut and salivary glands. We also engineered <italic>Serratia</italic>, a commensal bacterium capable of spreading through mosquito populations to secrete effectors into the mosquito gut. Whereas both mosquito-based and bacteria-based approaches strongly reduced the oocyst and sporozoite intensity, a substantially stronger reduction of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> development was achieved when transgenesis and paratransgenesis were combined. Most importantly, transmission of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> from infected to naïve mice was maximally inhibited by the combination of the two approaches. Combining these two strategies promises to become a powerful approach to combat malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transgenesis</kwd><kwd>paratransgenesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Anopheles</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic></kwd><kwd>malaria transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI031478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobs-Lorena</surname><given-names>Marcelo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015283</institution-id><institution>Bloomberg Philanthropies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobs-Lorena</surname><given-names>Marcelo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The combination of mosquito transgenesis with paratransgenesis provides maximum parasite-blocking activity and has high potential for fighting malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An estimated 241 million malaria cases and 627,000 malaria deaths worldwide were reported in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">WHO, 2021</xref>). Whereas world malaria incidence has declined by 27% during the first 15 years of this century, in the last 4 years it declined by less than 2%, indicating that current interventions to control this deadly disease are waning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">WHO, 2021</xref>). The development of innovative approaches to reduce this intolerable burden is sorely needed.</p><p>The strategy of targeting the mosquito to fight malaria is based on two premises: (1) the mosquito is an obligatory vector for parasite transmission and (2) strong bottlenecks limit parasite development in the mosquito and during transmission to the mammalian host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). The mosquito acquires the parasite when it bites an infected individual. Of the large number of gametocytes (~10<sup>3</sup>) ingested by the mosquito, only a few (single digits) ookinetes succeed in traversing the mosquito gut and differentiate into oocysts, defining the first strong bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang and Jacobs-Lorena, 2013</xref>). Each oocyst produces thousands of sporozoites, a good proportion of which invade the salivary glands, where they are stored. Only a small number of these sporozoites (on the order of 1% of total salivary gland content) are delivered when an infected mosquito bites a new individual, defining a second strong bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vanderberg, 1977</xref>).</p><p>Since the early demonstration that mosquitoes can be engineered to be refractory to the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2002</xref>), the effectiveness of this approach has been robustly demonstrated in the laboratory by simultaneous expression of multiple effector genes (genes that stop parasite development without affecting the mosquito vector) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). The major current challenge is to devise means to introduce the genes that confer refractoriness into mosquito populations. This will most likely be achieved by use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quinn and Nolan, 2020</xref>). In addition to technical aspects, topics to be resolved include regulatory and ethical issues related to the release of genetically modified organisms in nature.</p><p>An independent approach to suppress the mosquito vectorial capacity is to express effector genes from symbiotic bacteria rather than from the mosquito itself, an approach referred to as paratransgenesis. Paratransgenesis has the advantage that the bacteria occur in the mosquito gut in large numbers, in close proximity to the most vulnerable parasite forms. Since the early demonstration of the effectiveness of paratransgenesis to contain the spread of <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the causative agent of Chagas disease, by the <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durvasula et al., 1997</xref>), this approach has been developed for suppressing the mosquito’s ability to vector the malaria parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yoshida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Riehle et al., 2007</xref>). As is the case for gene drive, the mosquito symbiont <italic>Serratia AS1</italic> can spread through mosquito populations and be engineered to secrete effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This work addresses two unanswered questions: (1) which of the two genetic approaches – transgenesis and paratransgenesis – is the most effective, and (2) can the two approaches be combined to enhance the effectiveness of the intervention? We use transgenic mosquitoes engineered to express effector genes in the midgut and/or salivary glands and <italic>Serratia</italic> bacteria engineered to express the effector genes. We measured the ability of these two strategies, individually and in combination, to inhibit malaria parasite transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes expressing antimalaria effectors</title><p>To constitutively and robustly express antimalaria effector proteins in the midgut and salivary glands of <italic>An. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes, we used the QF-QUAS binary expression system previously adapted for expression in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Potter et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Riabinina et al., 2016</xref>).

We also constructed a third ‘effector’ mosquito line that encodes two parasite inhibiting factors (MP2 and scorpine) downstream of the QUAS promoter and driven by the QF transcription factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Crossing this effector line with either or both driver lines leads to the salivary gland and/or midgut expression of parasite-inhibiting factors.

Two of the three Sg2 insertions are in intergenic regions, and one in the open-reading frame of the gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase gene (ASTE010947). Each transgenic line was propagated for over 10 generations, discarding at each generation mosquitoes not displaying the correct combination of fluorescent eyes. After the 10th generation, 20 transgenic female mosquitoes from each line were mated with wild-type (WT) males, and 100% the offspring showed the same fluorescence as the parent females, consistent with all transgenic lines being homozygous (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantification of effector mRNA and protein expression</title><p>Using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we compared abundance of the endogenous mosquito Aper and AAPP transcripts with the abundance of effector transcripts originating from the same promoters but driven by the Q-system. Transcripts derived from the Q-system were substantially higher. In the midgut, the scorpine transcript was between 44- (p&lt;0.01) and 56-fold (p&lt;0.01) higher than that of the endogenous Aper mRNA and the MP2 transcript abundance was between 49- (p&lt;0.001) and 36-fold (p&lt;0.01) higher, depending on the transgenic line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>).

We also assess the effectiveness of transgenesis and paratransgenesis, individually or in combination, in thwarting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite transmission. Notably, effector mRNA abundance was about 50 times higher than that of the endogenous genes, consistent with the high effectiveness of the Q-system in <italic>Drosophila (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Potter et al., 2010b</xref>). Some QF toxicity was reported when the Q-system was first used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Potter et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Riabinina et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, expression of neither the QF transcription factor nor the antimalaria effectors affected mosquito longevity, blood meal uptake, or offspring production under laboratory conditions. Additional experiments are required to test the fitness of these transgenic mosquitoes under field conditions.</p><p>We selected two potent effector molecules, MP2 and scorpine, to block the development of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in the mosquito. MP2 is a 12-amino-acid peptide that likely targets a midgut receptor for ookinete traversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vega-Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>), and scorpine is an antimicrobial toxin hybrid between a cecropin and a defensin that lyses <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conde et al., 2000</xref>). Scorpine expressed by the entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Metarhizium</italic> in the mosquito hemocoel strongly inhibits (~90%) salivary gland sporozoite numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2011</xref>). Transgenic mosquitoes expressing this effector in the salivary glands were also highly effective in reducing sporozoite numbers (this work). Furthermore, expression of both effector genes in the midgut and the salivary glands led to a much stronger decrease of salivary gland sporozoite numbers than the expression of the effectors in either of these organs alone. A number of effectors have already been individually tested in paratransgenesis experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Going forward, the combination of different effectors and the use of mosquitoes and bacteria expressing different effector sets should be explored to achieve maximum blocking activity.</p><p>That expression of antimalaria effectors in the salivary glands inhibited oocyst development in the midgut (Sg/E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is most likely explained by the fact that mosquitoes ingest saliva with the blood meal, in this way incorporating effector proteins into the blood bolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2000</xref>). A similar phenomenon was also observed in a recent report showing that human PAI-1 expressed in salivary glands was ingested together with the saliva and inhibited oocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pascini et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, we confirmed the presence of the multi-effector protein, in addition to the AAPP salivary gland protein (control), in the midguts of Sg/E mosquitoes that express the multi-effector protein only in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). Scorpine has been shown to be nontoxic to insect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2008</xref>), whereas MP2 toxicity was not determined previously. Further studies are needed to determine whether the delivery of these molecules by the mosquito bite could induce physiological responses. As effector molecules in the mosquito saliva are injected into the host dermis during blood feeding, the introduction in the field of transgenic mosquitoes that produce nonhuman proteins in their saliva needs to be considered with much caution.</p><p>Experiments seeking evidence for possible bacteria transmission with a mosquito bite yielded negative results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>), suggesting that mosquitoes cannot inoculate the bacteria while feeding on a host. It was previously shown that secretion of effector proteins by recombinant <italic>Pantoea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Serratia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), or <italic>Asaia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shane et al., 2018</xref>) bacteria into the midgut inhibits <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development and that WT <italic>Serratia</italic> AS1 is transmitted from one mosquito generation to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). What was not known is whether engineering <italic>Serratia</italic> to produce and secrete large amounts of proteins would affect their fitness and ability to be transmitted. Our experiments showed that the engineered <italic>Serratia</italic> were efficiently transmitted from one mosquito generation to the next, a result that bodes well for the implementation of the paratransgenesis strategy in the field. For introduction of bacteria in the field, we envision placing around villages, cotton baits soaked with a mosquito attractant dissolved in sugar and containing suspended bacteria. This is similar to how we introduce bacteria into mosquitoes in the laboratory. The continuous introduction of bacteria into the local mosquito population, combined with the seeding the breeding sites when female mosquitoes lay eggs covered with bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), is expected to compensate for the decrease of transmission through mosquito generations.</p><p>This project was based on two basic premises: (1) transgenesis and paratransgenesis are not mutually exclusive and (2) both strategies result in impairment of parasite development in the mosquito. As such, our experiments addressed the question of whether a combination of the two strategies would result in enhanced transmission-blocking effectiveness. The combination of transgenesis and paratransgenesis greatly reduced parasite development in the mosquito, and most importantly, it resulted in a high-level reduction of transmission from an infected to a naïve mouse compared to the individual interventions. When naïve mice were bitten by three (transgenic + paratransgenic) mosquitoes, 93% of the mice (14 out of 15) did not develop an infection compared with 100% infection when mice were bitten by WT mosquitoes. In the field, where the density of infected mosquitoes is low even in high-transmission areas, it is unlikely that people will be consecutively bitten by more than one infected mosquito, and protection from transmission is expected to be very high. For translating these findings to the field, the testing of different combinations of effectors, both for transgenesis and paratransgenesis, may further improve the effectiveness of the approach.</p><p>Whereas both transgenesis and paratransgenesis have been shown to be highly effective in a lab setting, the challenge will be to implement these new strategies in the field. In addition to address regulatory and ethical issues connected with the release of recombinant organisms in nature, a major technical issue to be solved is how to introduce the blocking transgenes into mosquito populations in the field. In this respect, CRISPR/Cas9 technology has afforded the development of promising gene drive systems focused on population suppression or population modification strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scudellari, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nolan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>). Population reduction leaves an empty biological niche that upon cessation of reduction pressure will result in recolonization by the same or other mosquito species. In contrast, population modification results in a more stable state, with a biological niche occupied by mosquitoes that are poor transmitters. Similarly, efficient spread of recombinant bacteria into mosquito populations has been demonstrated in a laboratory setting (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2017</xref> and this work), indicating a promising path toward the field implementation of the most efficient (transgenesis + paratransgenesis) strategy. The recent finding that a naturally occurring and nonmodified <italic>Serratia</italic> can spread through mosquito populations while strongly suppressing <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2021</xref>) significantly increases the feasibility of moving a paratransgenesis-like approach into the field as it bypasses concerns relating to the release of genetically modified organisms in nature. Notably, transgenesis and paratransgenesis are not envisioned to be implemented by themselves. Both are compatible with current vector and malaria control measures such as insecticide-based mosquito control, mass drug administration, and vaccines, and their added implementation promises to substantially enhance the effectiveness of intervention of disease transmission.</p><p>In summary, we show that the Q-binary system to express anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> effectors in the mosquito is highly efficient. We also show that in addition to inhibiting parasite development, recombinant <italic>Serratia</italic> AS1 is horizontally and vertically transmitted across multiple mosquito generations, which is a bacteria counterpart of gene drive. A major conclusion of this work is that the combination of transgenesis with paratransgenesis provides maximum parasite blocking activity and has high potential for fighting malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mosquitoes rearing and parasite culture</title><p><italic>An. stephensi</italic> Nijmegen strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldmann and Ponnudurai, 1989</xref>) and <italic>An. stephensi</italic> transgenic lines were reared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2020</xref>.

As shown in the revised manuscript Appendix 1-Figure A-D, no fitness cost was detected when transgenesis and paratransgenesis are combined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The hypothesis that inhibition of oocyst development in the Sg/E line is due to mosquitoes ingesting saliva with the blood meal needs to be tested by determining the presence of Scorpine and MP2 protein in the blood bolus.</p></disp-quote><p>Ingestion of mosquito saliva during blood feeding and its effect on parasite development has been documented (Luo et al., 2000, Medical Entomology and Zoology 51, 13-20; Hirai et al., 2001, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 287, 859-864). Our previous study showed that human PA-I expressed in salivary gland with the Q-system was ingested together with the saliva and inhibited oocyst development. These studies together with the Western blot showing lack of scorpine and MP2 expression in the midgut of the salivary gland transgenic mosquitoes (Figure 1E) suggest that the oocyst reduction observed in these mosquitoes is due to the effector molecules ingested with the saliva.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) More data on the stage at which parasites are killed need to be provided, and levels of Scorpine and MP2 need to be determined in paratransgenic mosquitoes.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments to investigate at which stage parasite are killed were performed as recommended. As shown in Appendix 1-Figure 5 of the revised manuscript, ookinete formation is significantly inhibited by the expression of effector molecules in transgenic mosquitoes and a stronger inhibition is observed when transgenesis is combined with paratransgenesis. These results suggest that the effectors inhibit early stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development in the mosquito midgut.</p><p>The effect of scorpine and MP2 on <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development in the midgut of paratransgenic mosquitoes was previously studied in detail, as reported in Conde et al., FEBS Lett 471:165-168 (2000) and in Wang et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:12734-12739 (2012) for scorpine and by Vega-Rodríguez et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 111:E492-500 (2014) for MP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Limitations of the study need to be more amply discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for calling our attention to this point. In response, we have added the following two statements to the discussion.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>As effector molecules in the mosquito saliva are injected into the host dermis during blood feeding, the introduction in the field of transgenic mosquitoes that produce non-human proteins in their saliva needs to be considered with much caution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For introduction of bacteria in the field, we envision placing around villages, cotton baits soaked with a mosquito attractant dissolved in sugar and containing suspended bacteria<sup>33</sup>. This is similar to how we introduce bacteria into mosquitoes in the laboratory. The continuous introduction of bacteria into the local mosquito population, combined with the seeding the breeding sites when female mosquitoes lay eggs covered with bacteria<sup>14</sup>, is expected to compensate for the decrease of transmission through mosquito generations.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The bulk of my review is confined to the 'public review' section.</p><p>Below are mostly style elements or requests for points of clarification:</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, you do see an anti-parasite effect just from the addition of wild-type Serratia to the mosquito, correct? The possibility of this, and the fact that it has been found in previous literature, is mentioned but that you also found it in 'this' work does not seem to be explicitly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. In our previous study, we also found a similar phenomenon (Wang et al., 2017). In that research, we found around 40% inhibition of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection with <italic>Serratia</italic> carrying empty plasmid (HasA), which is similar to what we found here. We added the sentence “As found previously<sup>14</sup>, wild type bacteria also inhibited to some extent, oocyst formation in wild type mosquitoes” (line 195-197).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 300-302 would that case still be 'paratransgenesis' then, as implied if there is no transgene?</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We modified the sentence as “The recent finding that a naturally occurring and non-modified <italic>Serratia</italic> can spread through mosquito populations while strongly suppressing <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development<sup>32</sup>, significantly increases the feasibility of moving a paratransgenesis<bold>-</bold>like approach into the field,…” (lines 320-323).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 179 'would have been easily detected' this is a bit difficult to conclude, without any controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this sentence to “We note that this assay is very sensitive, as one life bacterium in the blood is expected to result in abundant growth during the overnight incubation” (lines 183-184).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 215 re: mice infections. Authors first talk about % infected (in controls) but then go on to talk about %protected in test experiments. This can be confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We changed “protected” to “not infected” throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 220 what is the justification for using median here, rather than mean plus/minus SE? (I get that median of 0% infected sounds better).</p></disp-quote><p>Due to non-normal distribution, statistics for sporozoite number counts should use non-parametric method (Mann-Whitney's U test), which cannot compare means. Nonetheless, the mean data are provided in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>116 'this resulted in homozygous lines' needs some more precision – under some scenarios it 'could' result in homozygosity. Similarly, and this is possibly pedantic, but (line 390) 'absence of' does not indicate heterozygosity. It would be better to state all gave 100% inheritance of….consistent with them all being homozygous'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The sentence was changed as suggested (Lines 118-121).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>288 'containment' can have two quite different meanings: containment of parasites or containment of released GM organisms.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the word “containment” was not properly used. This word was omitted in the revised version (line 309).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Panel B on Figure 1 is redundant and excessive – I initially thought this said something about effector expression in different tissues but it is just whether eyes were red, green, or blue, indicating transgenes. Since this is already done and confirmed molecularly, there is no value in this panel.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. Figure 1B illustrates how the transgenic lines were first selected, how lines carrying multiple transgenes were selected, and how transgenic lines were built by selecting mosquitoes with the correct combination of eye color. Only after getting enough mosquitoes of the desired lines, we used PCR to confirm the insertions molecularly (this step kills the mosquitoes). Both eye fluorescence and PCR are important in establishing the transgenic lines. Thus, we feel that it is important to keep <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, as it was the primary method used to build the transgenic lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, the splinkerette PCR to identify transgene integrations is well done but the Figure S1 is incorrectly labelled as PCR validation of the plasmid insertion site. Since the primer pair are internal to the transgenes they are not validating the integration sites.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> title now reads “plasmid insertion”, not “plasmid insertion site”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>'Significance' section needs a grammar check 'thousand persons yearly' etc. Overall though, I found the manuscript really well written and easy to follow in terms of experimental flow and logic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.
