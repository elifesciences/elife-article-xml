substantially to socioeconomic burden necessitating early diagnosis. While recent studies in rodent models of AD have suggested diagnostic and therapeutic value for gamma rhythms in brain, the same has not been rigorously tested in humans. In this case-control study, we recruited a large population (N = 244; 106 females) of elderly (&gt;49 years) subjects from the community, who viewed large gratings that induced strong gamma oscillations in their electroencephalogram (EEG). These subjects were classified as healthy (N = 227), mild cognitively impaired (MCI; N = 12), or AD (N = 5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating scores. Surprisingly, stimulus-induced gamma rhythms, but not alpha or steady-state visually evoked responses, were significantly lower in MCI/AD subjects compared to their age- and gender-matched controls. This reduction was not due to differences in eye movements or baseline power. Our results suggest that gamma could be used as a potential screening tool for MCI/AD in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most common forms of dementia, characterised by declining memory and thinking skills, and behavioural changes that worsen over time. It affects millions of people worldwide, mostly in older age, and yet early indicators of the disease are lacking. Most cases are only diagnosed once a person’s brain function becomes noticeably impaired, even though known biological changes underpin the disease. Detecting Alzheimer’s disease early could aid diagnosis and enable early intervention, while also improving the chances of finding treatments to halt or reverse the disease.</p><p>Currently, brain function is measured by performing cognitive tests, such as remembering a set of words, imaging the brain with MRIs or CT scans, and blood or spinal fluid tests. Many of these tests can be invasive and expensive, so researchers are exploring whether measuring oscillations in the brain’s electrical activity can be a non-invasive and chepaer way of testing brain function. Gamma oscillations are rhythmic signals, thought to be involved in attention and working memory. Animals used to study Alzheimer’s disease have shown some abnormalities in gamma oscillations, and studies of healthy humans have also observed a decline in the strength and frequency of these oscillations with age. These findings have spurred an interest in understanding the link between gamma oscillations and AD in humans.</p><p>To investigate this link, Murty et al. measured patterns of brain activity in elderly people chosen from the community using electrodes placed on their scalps (a technique called electroencephalography). These participants watched certain images previously shown to elicit gamma oscillations. Participants who were later diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s disease had weaker gamma oscillations than their cognitively healthy peers in the part of the brain that processes visual images.</p><p>These results build upon previous findings from animal research suggesting that gamma oscillations may be disrupted in early Alzheimer’s disease. The work by Murty et al. could lead the way to new ways of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease, where early indicators are urgently needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gamma</kwd><kwd>SSVEP</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>mild cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>dementia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005915</institution-id><institution>Tata Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Naren Prahalada</given-names></name><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Supratim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intermediate fellowship 500145/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Supratim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior fellowship IA/S/18/2/504003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Supratim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>DBT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Supratim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Visual narrow-band gamma rhythms are reduced in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, confirming previous rodent research and forming crucial first steps for development of EEG-based biomarkers for humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a predominant cause of dementia (decline in cognitive abilities) of old age and substantially contributes to the socioeconomic burden in the geriatric population, necessitating early diagnosis. Advances in our understanding of cellular pathology of AD in rodent models and its link to gamma rhythms in brain have spurred interest to investigate diagnostic and therapeutic potential of gamma rhythms in AD and other forms of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mably and Colgin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Gamma rhythms are narrow-band oscillations in brain’s electrical activity with center frequency occupying ~30–80 Hz frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 1989</xref>). These are suggested to be generated from excitatory-inhibitory interactions of pyramidal cell-interneuron networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>) involving parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Veit et al., 2017</xref>). These have been proposed to be involved in certain cognitive functions like feature binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 1989</xref>), attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fries et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregoriou et al., 2009</xref>), and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pesaran et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have reported abnormalities in gamma linked to interneuron dysfunction in AD. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verret et al., 2012</xref> reported PV interneuron dysfunction in parietal cortex of AD patients and hAPP mice (models of AD). They found aberrant gamma activity in parietal cortex in such mice. Further, some recent studies have suggested therapeutic benefit of entraining brain oscillations in gamma range in rodent models of AD. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref> suggested that visual stimulation using light flickering at 40 Hz entrained neural activity at 40 Hz and correlated with decrease in Aβ amyloid load in visual cortices of 5XFAD, APP/PS1 mice models of AD. Based on such reports in rodents in both visual and auditory modalities, some investigators have suggested a paradigm termed GENUS (gamma-entrainment of neural activity using sensory stimuli) and have claimed to show neuro-protective effects in rodent models of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martorell et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies in human EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murty et al., 2018</xref>) and MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pantazis et al., 2018</xref>) have reported existence of two gamma rhythms (slow: ~20–34 Hz and fast: ~36–66 Hz) in visual cortex, elicited by Cartesian gratings. Age-related decline in power and/or frequency of these stimulus-induced gamma rhythms has been shown in cognitively healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>). However, abnormalities in such stimulus-induced visual narrow-band gamma rhythms in human patients of mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a preclinical stage of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Petersen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>]) or AD have not been demonstrated till date.</p><p>We addressed this question in the present double-blind case-control EEG study involving a large cohort of elderly subjects (N = 244; 106 females, all aged &gt;49 years) recruited from urban communities in Bangalore, India. These were classified as healthy (N = 227; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>), or suffering from MCI (N = 12) or AD (N = 5) based on clinical history and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris, 1993</xref>) scores. We studied narrow-band gamma rhythms induced by full-screen Cartesian gratings in all these subjects. We also examined steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) at 32 Hz in a subset of these subjects (seven MCI and two AD subjects). We monitored eyes using an infrared eye tracker to rule out differences in gamma power due to potential differences in eye position or microsaccade rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We presented achromatic full-screen static sinusoidal grating stimuli that varied in spatial frequency (1, 2, and 4 cpd) and orientation (0°, 45°, 90°, and 135°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to a large cohort of elderly subjects (227 healthy, 12 MCI, and 5 AD subjects; see 'Materials and methods' for details of subject selection and classification). We first examined whether gamma power depended on orientation and spatial frequency. We have previously shown that gamma oscillations in EEG recorded from healthy young subjects have low orientation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murty et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that stimulus-induced change in fast gamma power did not vary significantly across different orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; two-way ANOVA with spatial frequency and orientation as factors; <italic>F</italic>(3,2723) = 0.87, p=0.46) in healthy subjects, with very low orientation selectivity (mean ± SEM: 0.02 ± 0.002; see 'Materials and methods' for details). Slow gamma varied with orientation (<italic>F</italic>(3,2723) = 6.4, p=0.0003); however, orientation selectivity calculated across the four orientations was small (mean ± SEM: 0.03 ± 0.002; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for details). We therefore averaged all data across the four orientations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fixation task.</title><p>Every trial started with the onset of a fixation spot (0.1°) at the center of the screen on which the subjects had to maintain fixation.

Inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was 700 ms. Each stimulus (of a particular combination of spatial frequency, temporal frequency, and orientation) was presented for a total of ~30–40 times according to the subjects’ comfort and willingness, and is referred to as a ‘stimulus repeat’ in this paper unless otherwise stated.

Gray dots represent data for each of the 227 healthy subjects. SEM is indicated as black vertical lines on the bars. Because of a large variability in gamma power across subjects, the SEMs are barely visible. Therefore, for clarity, we have plotted these means and SEM (error bars) separately in the insets. We statistically quantified differences in these means across orientations using one-way ANOVA at each spatial frequency. We found that these were not significant for any gamma at any spatial frequency, except for slow gamma at 2 cpd (for slow gamma, 1/2/4 cpd: <italic>F</italic>(3,904) = 0.63/5.81/1.37, p=0.59/0.0006/0.25; for fast gamma, 1/2/4 cpd: <italic>F</italic>(3,904) = 0.27/0.96/0.83, p=0.84/0.41/0.48).

In particular, we found that the difference in gamma between cases and controls was more prominent at spatial frequencies of 2 and 4 cpd, so we used the data for these two spatial frequencies for main analysis. The 1 cpd condition, as well as the power averaged across all three spatial frequencies, gave similar, albeit slightly weaker, results (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Because the sample sizes were severely unbalanced between cases and controls, for each case subject, we selected controls who were age- (±1 year) and gender-matched and averaged their spectral data.

We compared the change in power spectral densities (PSDs) for each MCI with the mean change in power of their corresponding age- and gender-matched controls. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the median stimulus-induced change in PSDs for 12 MCIs (yellow) and their controls (dark orange; light shaded regions show ± SD of median after bootstrapping for 10,000 iterations). While both slow and fast gamma ‘bumps’ were conspicuously visible for MCI as well as control groups, power in both slow gamma (20–34 Hz) and fast gamma (36–66 Hz) ranges (but not alpha, 8–12 Hz range) was significantly lower in the MCI group compared to the control group (Kruskal-Wallis [K-W] test, significance as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This could also be seen in the median time-frequency change in power spectrograms (baseline: −500–0 ms of stimulus onset) for cases and controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Change in band-limited power was significantly less for both gamma bands in the MCI group compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; slow gamma: χ<sup>2</sup>(23) = 4.09, p=0.043; fast gamma: K-W test, χ<sup>2</sup>(23) = 5.61, p=0.018).

For example, for all subjects, we used the same set of electrodes over which gamma was computed, as well as same time and frequency ranges. Further, we computed the total power within a band by simply summing the absolute power values within the band separately in baseline and stimulus periods and then taking a ratio. This estimate has larger contribution from lower frequencies in the band because of the power-law distribution of PSDs in baseline/stimulus periods. Consequently, if the traces are overlapping at lower frequencies within the band and diverge at higher frequencies, which was the case in the slow gamma range, the total change in power in the band may not be significantly different. Therefore, these results could be further improved by customizing the low frequency limit of the gamma band for each subject, as well as choosing only electrodes that show stronger gamma. For example, taking slow and fast gamma ranges as 26–34 Hz and 44–56 Hz improved the p-values (slow gamma: χ<sup>2</sup>(23) = 7.69, p=0.005; fast gamma: χ<sup>2</sup>(23) = 8.34, p=0.004). Although we have refrained from such customization here because we wanted to study the efficacy of a simple and subject-independent computational procedure, such data-driven subject specific optimization holds promise for improving the efficacy of a gamma-based biomarker.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows the median scalp maps (see EEG data analysis subsection in 'Materials and methods') of change in band-limited power across 112 bipolar electrode pairs (shown as discs) for alpha, slow, and fast gamma bands. Stimulus-induced change in power across all three bands was most prominent in the nine electrode pairs as above. However, this change in power was less in the MCI group compared to the control group in slow and fast gamma bands (but not alpha band) as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>.</p><p>For two MCI subjects (M1 and M4 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), slow gamma power was less than 0 dB. This could be because visual stimuli typically suppress power at low frequencies (&lt;30 Hz), and if the visual stimulus does not induce sufficiently strong slow-gamma rhythm, there is an overall reduction in power between 20 and 35 Hz. However, our results remained consistent even when these two MCI subjects were removed from analysis (χ<sup>2</sup>(19) = 4.81, p=0.028, for slow gamma between 26 and 34 Hz). Similarly, our results did not change when we removed one MCI subject (subject M5) who had negative fast gamma power (χ<sup>2</sup>(21) = 4.56, p=0.032).</p><p>Our study had many control subjects for each case subject (range 4–19). To rule out the possibility that our results were influenced by this imbalance, we first ordered the control subjects based on the difference in experiment date from the case subject and then chose only the first N control subjects. We tried different values of N and found that our results remained consistent in all cases, with less slow and fast gamma power in cases vs controls. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the results for N = 1 (a single control for each case).</p><p>Although the error bars shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> appear smaller for controls than cases, that is only because each data point for the control group is already an average across many subjects. When a single control subject was used per case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the error bars were comparable (standard error of the medians: 0.33, 0.20, and 0.34 for controls vs 0.28, 0.08, and 0.36 for cases, for slow gamma, fast gamma, and alpha, respectively). Similarly, if we pooled all the control subjects in one group without averaging (N = 74 controls vs 12 MCI subjects), the standard deviations of slow gamma, fast gamma, and alpha power were 0.94, 0.72, and 0.67 for controls and 0.79, 0.36, and 1.00 for cases. Therefore, the variability in power was comparable in the two groups.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the results for individual spatial frequencies as well as after pooling all three spatial frequencies.

Nonetheless, we observed a strong reduction in the slow and fast gamma bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), which was significant for both slow gamma (χ<sup>2</sup>(9) = 4.81 p=0.028) and fast gamma (χ<sup>2</sup>(9) = 3.94, p=0.047), but not alpha (χ<sup>2</sup>(9) = 0.01, p=0.92).

Results were similar for the unmatched condition, in which all the controls were considered separately (112 healthy, 12 MCI, and 6 AD subjects), albeit the CDR slope (β<sub>CDR</sub>) was significantly negative only for slow gamma (β<sub>CDR</sub> = –0.62/–0.29, p=0.0071/0.0702 for slow/fast gamma). On the other hand, similar to the results in previous analyses, alpha power did not depend on CDR (β<sub>CDR</sub> = –0.30/–0.30, p=0.14/0.21 for matched/unmatched conditions).</p><p>We have previously shown that gamma power decreases with age in healthy elderly, and females have more gamma than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these results, we found that coefficient for age was significantly negative (β<sub>AGE</sub> = –0.018/–0.0094, p=0.014/0.06 for slow/fast gamma), while coefficient for gender was significantly positive (β<sub>GENDER</sub> = 0.33/0.35, p=0.0070/3.15 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for slow/fast gamma) when the regression analysis was performed on the full set of healthy subjects (N = 227). However, when the regression analysis was performed with cases and controls as described above, the coefficients were not significant (matched: β<sub>AGE</sub> = 0.0042/4.13 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, p=0.73/0.99 and β<sub>GENDER</sub> = –0.036/0.11, p=0.87/0.36 for slow/fast gamma; unmatched: β<sub>AGE</sub> = –0.0071/–0.0009, p=0.51/0.91 and β<sub>GENDER</sub> = 0.17/0.19, p=0.30/0.10 for slow/fast gamma). This also suggests that CDR is a stronger predictor of gamma power than age or gender.</p><p>These results suggest that the alternate hypothesis (gamma power in controls was greater than cases) was more likely than the null hypothesis (controls and cases had comparable gamma power). We quantified this by estimating the Bayes factor (BF), which is the ratio of the marginal likelihood of the alternate hypothesis and the null hypotheses, given the data that we observed (see 'Materials and methods for details). For the MCI group (N = 12), BF computed using single-tailed paired t-test was ~1.89 for both slow and fast gamma. However, as before, choosing a more ‘sensitive’ range for slow gamma (26–34 Hz) and fast gamma (44–56 Hz) improved the BF to 3.34 and 4.60, respectively, suggesting substantial evidence for the alternate hypothesis over the null hypothesis. For the AD group (N = 5), BF was 2.85 for slow gamma and 1.83 for fast gamma, suggesting weak evidence, which did not improve substantially when more sensitive ranges were used. However, when both MCI and AD groups were combined, BF increased to 13.70 for slow gamma (26–34 Hz) and 8.60 for fast gamma (44–56 Hz), further strengthening the evidence in favor of alternate hypothesis. On the other hand, evidence for alpha band power was in favor of the null hypothesis (BF was 0.088 when only MCIs were considered, 0.29 for ADs, and 0.077 when both MCI and AD subjects were considered).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Difference in gamma power was not due to differences in eye position or movement</title><p>Previous studies have correlated increases in gamma power with occurrence of small involuntary eye movements called microsaccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008</xref>). These have been described in previous literature using plots called ‘main sequence,’ which show peak velocity on ordinate and maximum velocity on abscissa on a log-log scale.

Importantly, out of the 257 subjects that we collected data from (247 used for analysis plus 10 subjects whose data was noisy and thus rejected, see 'Materials and methods'), there were 13 MCIs (~5%) and 6 AD subjects (2.3%).

Although we did not find any significant trend for SSVEP at 32 Hz in cases compared to controls (unlike our observations with narrow-band gamma), we cannot directly compare the results from abovementioned studies with our study for several reasons. First, the frequency of entrainment was different (40 Hz vs 32 Hz). Second, the model organism was different (human vs rodent). Finally, we did not measure any cognitive or pathological outcome of the visual stimulation. Indeed, while the previous studies have focused on therapeutic aspect of flicking stimulation, we only studied its potential for diagnosis. It is possible that entrainment of neural oscillations to visual stimulation in gamma frequency range gets deranged only in advanced stages of AD (as in the rodent models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref>). It may thus have therapeutic benefit but may not reflect as abnormal on testing early on (as in our case). Further, as discussed in the Methods, SSVEP study was always done at the end of the experiment in our study and the total number of stimulus repeats were much less than the gamma study. Nonetheless, the differences in trends for gratings and SSVEP evoked gamma presented in this study suggest that these two phenomena might be sub-served by different, yet unknown mechanisms. These differences have to be borne in mind while designing screening/therapeutic tools for MCI and AD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Stimulus-induced change in visual narrow-band gamma power has the potential to be a simple, low-cost, easy to replicate, and objective biomarker for screening of MCI and AD.

Five out of the six AD subjects were directly referred to the study by the neurologist. Diagnosis of all MCI/AD subjects was further reviewed by a panel of four experts for consensus (see Appendix; criteria used by the panel are given in Tables 1–3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), who reclassified two MCI subjects as healthy. Data from these two subjects was not used for further analysis. Subjects went through the experiments only once. However, there were a few subjects who had undergone the experiments more than once (annually as part of a different longitudinal study). For such subjects, we used only data from the first year. However, in the first year of study, four subjects did not have eye data and data of one participant was noisy. Further, one participant was diagnosed as MCI in the second year. Hence, for these six subjects, data from the first year was discarded and data from the second year was used instead. From the rest, we discarded data of ten subjects due to noise (nine healthy and one MCI; see Artifact Rejection subsection). Finally, we discarded one AD patient (male, aged 92 years) as he did not have any healthy age- and gender-matched control. We were thus left with 227/12/5 (females: 101/3/2) healthy/MCI/AD subjects for analysis. For the purpose of this study, we called the MCI/AD subjects as cases and their respective age- and gender-matched healthy subjects as controls. Since the subjects were directly recruited from the community based on advertisements without any prior knowledge of their clinical status (which was determined during the study itself and revealed to the experimenters after the EEG recordings were over), no explicit power calculation was done.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic and clinical details for subjects.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">Healthy</th><th valign="bottom">MCI</th><th valign="bottom">AD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" valign="bottom"><italic>Demographic details</italic></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="bottom">Number of subjects (no. of females in parentheses)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Total recruited</td><td valign="bottom">236 (104)</td><td valign="bottom">15 (3)</td><td valign="bottom">6 (2)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Total analyzed</td><td valign="bottom">227 (101)</td><td valign="bottom">12 (3)</td><td valign="bottom">5 (2)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="bottom">Age (in years, for analyzed subjects)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Range (min-max)</td><td valign="bottom">50–88</td><td valign="bottom">51–81</td><td valign="bottom">60–79</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Mean ± SD</td><td valign="bottom">66.8 ± 8.2</td><td valign="bottom">71.4 ± 9.3</td><td valign="bottom">68.8 ± 7.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"><italic>Diagnostic criteria</italic></td><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Subjective memory complaint</td><td valign="bottom">Present/absent</td><td valign="bottom">Present</td><td valign="bottom">Present</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">General cognitive function*</td><td valign="bottom">Preserved</td><td valign="bottom">Preserved</td><td valign="bottom">Reduced</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">IADL</td><td valign="bottom">&lt;/=0.5</td><td valign="bottom">&lt;/=0.5</td><td valign="bottom">&gt;0.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">CDR</td><td valign="bottom">= 0</td><td valign="bottom">= 0.5</td><td valign="bottom">&gt;0.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">HMSE**</td><td valign="bottom">&gt;27</td><td valign="bottom">-</td><td valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="bottom"><italic>Clinical scores of analyzed subjects</italic> (no. of subjects in parentheses)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">CDR</td><td valign="bottom">0 (204)</td><td valign="bottom">0.5 (12)</td><td valign="bottom">1 (4), 3 (1)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">HMSE (mean ± SD)</td><td valign="bottom">30.3 ± 1 (216)</td><td valign="bottom">29.6 ± 1.5 (12)</td><td valign="bottom">23 ± 2.7 (5)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>MCI: mild cognitive impairment; AD: Alzheimer’s disease; IADL: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathuranath et al., 2005</xref>); CDR: Clinical Dementia Rating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morris, 1993</xref>); HMSE: Hindi Mental State Examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganguli et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p><sup>*</sup>Based on clinician’s assessment.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>**</sup>HMSE was used as a diagnostic criterion only if CDR score was unavailable and clinical testing did not indicate any sign of dementia.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>All subjects reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were instructed to wear spectacles if prescribed earlier.

We calibrated the stimuli to the viewing distance in all cases.</p><p>Subjects performed a visual fixation task, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. They performed the main ‘Gamma’ experiment in 2–3 blocks (total 543 blocks across 257 subjects) according to their comfort. We also tested 32 Hz SSVEPs on these subjects in the SSVEP experiment. We chose 32 Hz SSVEP (induced by gratings of temporal frequency of 16 cycles per second or cps) for two reasons. First, in a separate set of experiments, we had recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys while presenting counterphasing gratings at varying temporal frequencies and found that the SSVEP gain was highest for gratings with temporal frequencies of 12-16 cps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salelkar and Ray, 2020</xref>). Second, 32 Hz was between slow and fast gamma bands, hence within the available time for the experiment, we were able to record SSVEP activity closest to both the gamma rhythms.</p><p>Subjects completed both experiments during a single session. We considered only those subjects for analysis in SSVEP experiment who had analyzable data for the Gamma experiment (see Artifact Rejection section below). This gave us a total of 222/11/5 subjects (99/3/2 females) for healthy/MCI/AD categories for the SSVEP experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Eye position analysis</title><p>We recorded eye signals (pupil position and diameter data) using EyeLink 1000 (SR Research Ltd) for all subjects (except for one subject each in healthy/MCI/AD categories). Eye data for Gamma experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We rejected stimulus repeats with fixation breaks (eye blinks or shifts in eye position outside a square window of width 5° centered on the fixation spot) during −0.5 s to 0.75 s of stimulus onset (mean ± SD: 16.7 ± 14.2%, 12.8 ± 12%, and 31.6 ± 18.4% for Gamma experiment; and 16.7 ± 15.1%, 9.1 ± 16%, and 46.4 ± 1% for SSVEP experiment, for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, respectively). For the remaining repeats, all the subjects were able to maintain fixation with a standard deviation of less than 0.5°, 0.3°, and 0.6° for Gamma experiment and 0.6°, 0.4°, 0.6° for SSVEP experiment for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, in either directions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Artifact rejection</title><p>We used a pipeline to reject artifact-containing data as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>. Briefly, we applied a repeat-wise thresholding process on both time-domain waveforms and multitapered PSD (between −500 ms and 750 ms of stimulus onset) to select bad repeats across electrodes. We discarded those electrodes that had more than 30% of all repeats marked as bad, and subsequently labelled any repeat as bad if it occurred in more than 10% of total number of remaining electrodes. We next discarded those electrodes that had PSD slopes (calculated in 56-84 Hz range as described briefly in EEG data analysis subsection; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref> for details) less than 0. Further, we discarded any block that did not have at least a single clean bipolar electrode pair (see Data Analysis subsection below) in any of the following three groups of bipolar electrodes: PO3-P1, PO3-P3, POz-PO3; PO4-P2, PO4-P4, POz-PO4 and Oz-POz, Oz-O1, Oz-O2. Despite these strict criteria, we ended up rejecting only 53/497, 4/31, and 1/15 blocks for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects; and we rejected only 5.5 ± 6.4%, 5.7 ± 3.6%, and 4.1 ± 1.9% of electrodes for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects, among those blocks that were analyzed. We then pooled data across all good blocks for each subject for final analysis. Those subjects who did not have any analyzable blocks (9 of 236 healthy subjects and 1 of 15 MCIs, respectively) were discarded from further analysis.</p><p>We used a similar procedure for the SSVEP experiment. Note that we did this experiment always towards the end, and therefore the signal quality could be poorer than the Gamma experiment. Consequently, we rejected 25/222, 5/12, and 3/5 blocks for healthy, MCI, and AD subjects; and 6.6 ± 7.2%, 8.5 ± 7.4%, and 5.7 ± 1% of electrodes among those blocks that were analyzed. Hence, we rejected data from 25/4/3 out of 222/11/5 subjects as they did not have any analyzable blocks, leaving 197/7/2 (93/1/1 females) healthy/MCI/AD subjects for analysis for the SSVEP experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EEG data analysis</title><p>For all analyses we re-referenced data at each electrode offline to its neighboring electrodes (bipolar reference). We thus obtained 112 bipolar pairs out of 64 unipolar electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>). We considered the following nine bipolar electrodes for analysis: PO3-P1, PO3-P3, POz-PO3, PO4-P2, PO4-P4, POz-PO4, Oz-POz, Oz-O1, Oz-O2, which are inside the black encapsulation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. We discarded a bipolar electrode if either of its constituting unipolar electrodes was marked bad during artifact rejection. Data was pooled for the rest of the bipolar electrodes for further analysis.</p><p>We analyzed all data using custom codes written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murty et al., 2020</xref>.

diagnosis</title><boxed-text><p>As in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, our major criteria to diagnose MCI/AD were clinical history and CDR, which were administered by a single clinician (neurologist or psychiatrist). However, to minimize observer bias, we followed the recommendations made in SAGES study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimchi et al., 2017</xref>) to arrive at a consensus diagnosis for each MCI/AD patient. We constituted a panel with four members, consisting of one neurologist (author MJ), two psychiatrists (authors AML and NPR), and one psychologist (author AB, an additional expert who did not participate in the single clinician diagnosis before). These members independently reviewed data variables available in TLSA (Tata Longitudinal Study of Aging) cohort to operationalize the NIA-AA criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKhann et al., 2011</xref>) for probable AD and MCI. For each of the NIA-AA criteria, they operationalized an equivalent TLSA criterion (see Tables 1–3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Wherever longitudinal data was available, they considered trends over time for diagnosis.</p><p>They labelled a subject as MCI/AD only if all 4 of them concurred with the diagnosis. When they could not achieve at a consensus for any subject in the first instance (six subjects), they used Delphi method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalkey and Helmer, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graham et al., 2003</xref>) till all of them agreed upon the diagnosis. Briefly, the members were informed of the discrepancy within the panel, who then discussed among themselves and rated again. This process was iterated till all four members came to a consensus. Although they used this stringent approach to confirm the previous diagnoses, they reclassified as healthy only two subjects previously classified as MCI. They confirmed and retained initial diagnosis for rest of the 12/14 MCI and 6/6 AD subjects.</p></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61666.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Vinck</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Ernst Strüngmann Institute (ESI) for Neuroscience in Cooperation with Max Planck Society</institution><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bosman</surname><given-names>Conrado A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Amsterdam</institution><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Murty and collaborators investigate alterations in stimulus-induced gamma (~30-80 Hz) oscillations in a geriatric population with early symptoms of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Compared with sex and age-matched controls, the authors observed a significant and specific decrease in the stimulus-induced gamma-band frequency power during the presentation of Cartesian grating stimuli. Conversely, they did not find a gamma power decrease when subjects performed a flickering experiment using static gratings presented at 32 Hz. Overall, this study addresses an important and timely question, because stimulus-induced gamma oscillations could be considered as an electrophysiological marker of early stages of AD, and previous studies in animal models have shown cognitive improvement following optogenetic and visually induced increases of gamma power.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the study is interesting and addresses an important question. The main concerns focused on the sample size and stimulus variability. Please see below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Statistics and study design</p><p>A main issue that was defined by the reviewers was the sample size used in this study. The authors should address several points:</p><p>1) The authors combine both groups to obtain significant effects which are not present in the MCI-group by itself. The text seems a bit fuzzy about this point, the statistics per group should be clarified or further analysed.</p><p>2) A problem is that clinical characteristics differ substantially between the two groups and the question remains whether abnormalities in gamma-band oscillations are present prior the onset of AD. This should be discussed/considered.</p><p>3) The authors chose appropriate non-parametric tests to perform statistical inference on groups with different samples. However, they should address the rather sever unbalanced effect sizes between the control and the condition group, providing, for example, some measurement of the distribution of gamma power between the two groups. The low number of cases with AD (5) is problematic because such a small sample is at the limit of the sensibility of a KW test.</p><p>4) A revised manuscript should explicitly acknowledge that, if it is impossible to increase the sample size due to COVID-19, the paper would benefit from including more subjects.</p><p>5) There are several instances where the authors included a subject (data) for one analysis and excluded the same subject for a different analysis. Specific examples; (1) The authors mention that two of the MCI patients (M4 and M8) were later re-evaluated and found to be cognitively normal. Removing their data for the individual-level comparison of gamma PSD did not cause the differences between the &quot;cases&quot; and &quot;controls&quot; to change much (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), but it is unclear if their data were also removed from the group level data (i.e., Figure 2) and what happens to the conclusions made at the group level if their data are removed. (2) Grouped data in Figure 5A, 5C contains 12 cases but individual plots in Figure 5E contains only 11 cases ('A1 discarded'). We appreciate the authors providing the details about what is included/excluded in each analyses, but if a subject needed to be excluded because of some obvious reasons, then the authors should do it across all analysis to reduce the inconsistency in the data being analyzed.</p><p>6) It appears there is quite a clear increase in variability in the AD/MCI group as compared to the controls. Some subjects in fact show rather extremely strong gamma. It would be interesting to comment on this and quantify this.</p><p>7) Please provide dot-plots with the bar plots to see how the 6 AD subjects are scattered and the 14 MCI cases, and how robust the effects are.</p><p>8) Evaluation of diagnostic and inclusion criteria by an AD-expert would be recommended.</p><p>Stimuli</p><p>9) Is the difference between groups is driven by a specific spatial frequency and orientation of the gratings? During the experiment with gratings, the authors presented a sequence of gratings with different spatial frequencies. According to the manuscript, the presentation sequence and the number of trials with the same stimuli were fixed according to a preliminary experiment aiming to obtain the most responsive parameters per subject. However, it is well-known that stimulus properties affect the gamma power increase in visual areas. We suggest adding a control analysis comparing only those trials with the same type of gratings between subjects to discard that any differences due to stimuli properties are affecting these results.</p><p>10) The authors used multiple spatial frequencies and orientations for the 'gamma experiment', but they do not provide any frequency- or orientation-specific data, which makes it difficult to conclude if a specific frequency and/or orientation are driving the difference seen between the cases and the controls and thus more ideal than other combinations of frequencies and orientations. None of the spectrograms for 'gamma experiment' has any information about stimulus details. The authors are advised to provide more thorough quantitative analyses.</p><p>Data analysis</p><p>11) The authors do not analyze ERPs. Do those differ between subjects?</p><p>12) Does the difference between groups hold/changes if the gamma band is not broken up into slow and fast gamma band and instead analyzed as a single band (e.g., 30 – 80Hz).</p><p>13) The authors can maximize the utility of the microsaccades analysis used as a control. In the text, there is no context about why this analysis should be performed. Some authors have argued that a microsaccadic rhythm can modulate the strength of gamma-band power. It would be relevant to observe whether such microsaccades modulations can contribute differently to the strength of the gamma-band power across groups.</p><p>Questions about SSVEP experiments</p><p>14) What does it mean that there was a reduction in fast gamma (36-66Hz) when the real evoked signal was at 32Hz (and that 32Hz was not different between cases and controls) in SSVEP experiment?</p><p>15) There is a time lag between stimulus onset /off and spectral power change (&gt;100ms) in both 'gamma experiment and SSVEP' but maybe more pronounced in SSVEP (Figure 5B). It would be informative if the authors can examine the spectral/waveform differences between control and cases within +/- 200 ms from stimulus onset (in other words, whether AD patients showed delayed response compared to controls?).</p><p>16) The authors should provide more explanation on how they extracted the &quot;induced&quot; gamma-band power from the SSVEP experiment (i.e., how they derived Figure 5—figure supplement 1A from Figure 5A). Were EEG signals phase-locked to the stimulation removed?</p><p>17) We presume the authors aimed to induce gamma oscillations at 32 Hz stimulation during the SSVP experiments. Yet, that number seems arbitrary. It may have been preferable to observe the same experiment across different flickering frequencies. It could help if the authors could show examples of ERP responses at the 32 Hz flickering, also analyzing the amplitude of the ERP components. A non-significant difference between amplitudes across groups would add evidence that the response observed is specific for gamma frequency-band and that it is not a consequence of this particular type of stimulation.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>18) The authors did not reference a study with seemingly contradictory findings (conducted by van Deursen et al.; J Neural Transm 2008), in which the gamma band (30 – 100 Hz) power induced by visual stimulation was actually higher in patients with AD at the occipital and parietal leads compared to the control subjects. The authors should discuss why their findings are different from those by van Deursen et al. and the potential implications of the differences.</p><p>19) Conceptually, the findings presented here may suggest that the gratings and SSVEP evoked gamma is sub-served by different mechanisms. The authors should discuss this.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stimulus-induced gamma rhythms are weaker in human elderly with Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors should address several points:</p><p>1) The authors combine both groups to obtain significant effects which are not present in the MCI-group by itself. The text seems a bit fuzzy about this point, the statistics per group should be clarified or further analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. We have now done the analysis on MCI and AD subjects separately (Figures 2 and 3); the analysis of MCI+AD data is only shown as a supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Statistics have been clarified and presented uniformly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A problem is that clinical characteristics differ substantially between the two groups and the question remains whether abnormalities in gamma-band oscillations are present prior the onset of AD. This should be discussed/considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. We now show reduction in gamma oscillations in MCI group separately, compared to their age and gender matched controls. We have presented these results in Figure 2 and have also included relevant statistics in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors chose appropriate non-parametric tests to perform statistical inference on groups with different samples. However, they should address the rather sever unbalanced effect sizes between the control and the condition group, providing, for example, some measurement of the distribution of gamma power between the two groups. The low number of cases with AD (5) is problematic because such a small sample is at the limit of the sensibility of a KW test.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. In our revised manuscript, we have now averaged the data from control subjects such that the final comparison is now done across equal samples (i.e. 12 MCIs and 12 averages of respective controls). Further, we have tested our results by limiting the number of control subjects that were averaged per case subject. The results continue to remain significant for several choices of this limit (we show results for N=1, and also present stats for N=4, which is the minimum number of controls for each case subject).</p><p>The low number of AD subjects is indeed problematic, but this number cannot be increased because of the pandemic. We note, however, that the results hold separately for MCIs, for which we have 12 subjects, and the results are robust and significant in the AD cohort (Figure 3) in spite of the small number of subjects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A revised manuscript should explicitly acknowledge that, if it is impossible to increase the sample size due to COVID-19, the paper would benefit from including more subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have acknowledged this limitation in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are several instances where the authors included a subject (data) for one analysis and excluded the same subject for a different analysis. Specific examples; (1) The authors mention that two of the MCI patients (M4 and M8) were later re-evaluated and found to be cognitively normal. Removing their data for the individual-level comparison of gamma PSD did not cause the differences between the &quot;cases&quot; and &quot;controls&quot; to change much (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), but it is unclear if their data were also removed from the group level data (i.e., Figure 2) and what happens to the conclusions made at the group level if their data are removed. (2) Grouped data in Figure 5A, 5C contains 12 cases but individual plots in Figure 5E contains only 11 cases ('A1 discarded'). We appreciate the authors providing the details about what is included/excluded in each analyses, but if a subject needed to be excluded because of some obvious reasons, then the authors should do it across all analysis to reduce the inconsistency in the data being analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. We have followed your suggestion and have removed MCI subjects M4 and M8; and AD patient A1 (mentioned in the suggestion above) from all our analyses. Hence, now we have analyzed 12 MCIs and 5 ADs and have maintained consistency across the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It appears there is quite a clear increase in variability in the AD/MCI group as compared to the controls. Some subjects in fact show rather extremely strong gamma. It would be interesting to comment on this and quantify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. The reason behind this apparent increase in variability is simply because each control data point is the average of many subjects. When we compare the variability of a single control subject versus case subject, the variability is actually comparable. We have now added this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please provide dot-plots with the bar plots to see how the 6 AD subjects are scattered and the 14 MCI cases, and how robust the effects are.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Evaluation of diagnostic and inclusion criteria by an AD-expert would be recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>The expert panel, consisting of one neurologist (author MJ), two psychiatrists (authors AML and NPR) and one psychologist (author AB, an additional expert who did not participate in the single clinician diagnosis before), are all clinicians who have been involved in AD related research for several years.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stimuli</p><p>9) Is the difference between groups is driven by a specific spatial frequency and orientation of the gratings? During the experiment with gratings, the authors presented a sequence of gratings with different spatial frequencies. According to the manuscript, the presentation sequence and the number of trials with the same stimuli were fixed according to a preliminary experiment aiming to obtain the most responsive parameters per subject. However, it is well-known that stimulus properties affect the gamma power increase in visual areas. We suggest adding a control analysis comparing only those trials with the same type of gratings between subjects to discard that any differences due to stimuli properties are affecting these results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. Although gamma oscillations are indeed dependent on orientation, the orientation selectively is substantially weaker in EEG as compared to animal recordings (see Murty et al., 2018, JNS for a direct comparison between human and monkey data). We repeated this analysis here as well as found the same results: orientation only had a modest effect on gamma, and therefore we pooled the results across orientations. For spatial frequency, we did find that 2 and 4 CPD produced better results than 1 CPD. Therefore, we performed the main analyses using only 2 and 4 CPD. However, results remained qualitatively similar when 1 CPD was included. Spatial-frequency specific results have now been added as a separate supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for MCI subjects and their controls; and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 for AD subjects and their controls).</p><p>We also note that for the main “Gamma” experiment, each subject (case and control) viewed all four orientations and three spatial frequencies, so the difference in gamma could not be due to any difference in stimuli between cases and controls. It is only for the SSVEP protocol that we fixed the SF and Ori to a single value in the interest of time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors used multiple spatial frequencies and orientations for the 'gamma experiment', but they do not provide any frequency- or orientation-specific data, which makes it difficult to conclude if a specific frequency and/or orientation are driving the difference seen between the cases and the controls and thus more ideal than other combinations of frequencies and orientations. None of the spectrograms for 'gamma experiment' has any information about stimulus details. The authors are advised to provide more thorough quantitative analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. As discussed in the previous point, gamma is not very orientation selective in EEG, and limiting ourselves to the two best spatial frequencies (2 and 4 CPDs) actually marginally improved the results. We have included this analysis in the Results section (first paragraph and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data analysis</p><p>11) The authors do not analyze ERPs. Do those differ between subjects?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. ERPs were not different between MCIs and controls. Specifically, we did not find any significant difference between P1/N1/P2 peak amplitudes. We have now added a figure showing these analyses (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Does the difference between groups hold/changes if the gamma band is not broken up into slow and fast gamma band and instead analyzed as a single band (e.g., 30 – 80Hz).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. The results hold well for both 20-66 Hz and 30-80 Hz. We have added these in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The authors can maximize the utility of the microsaccades analysis used as a control. In the text, there is no context about why this analysis should be performed. Some authors have argued that a microsaccadic rhythm can modulate the strength of gamma-band power. It would be relevant to observe whether such microsaccades modulations can contribute differently to the strength of the gamma-band power across groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now added a supplementary figure to show the analysis of repeats that had micro saccades (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We have also added the context and the appropriate reference (Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008) in the Results section. Results remained similar with or without microsaccades containing trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Questions about SSVEP experiments</p><p>14) What does it mean that there was a reduction in fast gamma (36-66Hz) when the real evoked signal was at 32Hz (and that 32Hz was not different between cases and controls) in SSVEP experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. For the SSVEP experiment, the real evoked signal was at 32 Hz. However, as noted in the reply to point 16 below, we did not calculate gamma power from the SSVEP experiment. Fast gamma power was calculated from the gamma experiment for the same set of subjects (7 MCIs) as for the SSVEP experiment, for comparing between the gamma and SSVEP results. Further, the differences in the trends of gamma and SSVEP suggest that these may have different origins and/or generating mechanisms in the brain. We have made these points clearer in the manuscript now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) There is a time lag between stimulus onset /off and spectral power change (&gt;100ms) in both 'gamma experiment and SSVEP' but maybe more pronounced in SSVEP (Figure 5B). It would be informative if the authors can examine the spectral/waveform differences between control and cases within +/- 200 ms from stimulus onset (in other words, whether AD patients showed delayed response compared to controls?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. SSVEP onset-related responses (0-250 ms) were comparable between MCIs and their respective controls as seen in the median time-courses of stimulus-induced change in power in 20-66 Hz frequency range. The RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and time of the peak of the onset response (calculated from trial-averaged time-courses for each subject) also did not differ among MCI subjects and their respective controls (KW test; χ<sup>2</sup>(13)=0.33/0.92/1.48, p=0.56/0.34/0.22 for RMS-amplitude/peak-amplitude/peak-time). We have now added a figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D-E) and the respective analyses in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors should provide more explanation on how they extracted the &quot;induced&quot; gamma-band power from the SSVEP experiment (i.e., how they derived Figure 5—figure supplement 1A from Figure 5A). Were EEG signals phase-locked to the stimulation removed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have not extracted induced gamma-band power from the SSVEP experiment. Instead, we had repeated the analysis done in Figure 2 for those subjects who had undergone the SSVEP experiment, for a comparison. We have made this clearer in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) We presume the authors aimed to induce gamma oscillations at 32 Hz stimulation during the SSVP experiments. Yet, that number seems arbitrary. It may have been preferable to observe the same experiment across different flickering frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. We could not include more counter-phasing gratings for the study due to time constraints involved in the project. As we were working with elderly population in collaboration with clinical teams, we had strict timelines. However, we chose 32 Hz SSVEP (induced by gratings of temporal frequency of 16 cycles per second) for two reasons. First, in a different study, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in the primary visual cortex of awake monkeys. We found that the SSVEP gain was highest for gratings with temporal frequencies of 12 to 16 cps (Salelkar and Ray, 2020). Second, 32 Hz was between the slow and fast gamma bands, hence within the available time, we were able to record SSVEP activity closest to both the gamma rhythms. We have now added these points in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It could help if the authors could show examples of ERP responses at the 32 Hz flickering, also analyzing the amplitude of the ERP components. A non-significant difference between amplitudes across groups would add evidence that the response observed is specific for gamma frequency-band and that it is not a consequence of this particular type of stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We performed time-frequency analysis on trial-averaged time-amplitude waveforms for each subject instead for averaging time-frequency spectra of individual repeats for each subject, as done for SSVEP analysis in Figure 6. Trends were not different between either analyses. We have now summarized the results in Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>18) The authors did not reference a study with seemingly contradictory findings (conducted by van Deursen et al.; J Neural Transm 2008), in which the gamma band (30 – 100 Hz) power induced by visual stimulation was actually higher in patients with AD at the occipital and parietal leads compared to the control subjects. The authors should discuss why their findings are different from those by van Deursen et al. and the potential implications of the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Our findings are different from the study of van Deursen et al., probably due to the differences in task settings: we had tested for visual gamma rhythms induced by gratings, whereas they had tested for resting-state gamma as well as gamma activity for multiple colored objects randomly moving on a computer screen (taken from screensavers). Whether our results hold true for drifting (moving) and chromatic gratings needs to be tested in future studies. We have added these points and the reference in the Discussion section now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Conceptually, the findings presented here may suggest that the gratings and SSVEP evoked gamma is sub-served by different mechanisms. The authors should discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added this in the Discussion section now. However, we have avoided extensive discussion because the comparison between SSVEP and gamma is based on limited data and therefore we did not want to speculate too much.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relatively small sample size of the study remained a point of discussion among the reviewers, with consideration of the fact that the COVID situation prevented collecting a larger dataset.

Was this a priori chosen, was there any power calculation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. This was a community based study, in which subjects were recruited from the community based on advertisements, without any prior knowledge of their cognitive status. Their clinical identity was determined by trained clinicians and psychologists through various tests (as described in the paper) and was revealed to us after the experiments were over. Therefore, no power calculation was done. We have made this clear in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Reporting Bayes factor, esp. given that this is a medically relevant study, would be useful given the sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this excellent suggestion. We performed this analysis and found that the results were highly consistent with our previous statistical tests. In summary, for the MCI group (N=12), the Bayes factor (BF) was ~1.89 for both slow and fast gamma when standard frequency ranges were used. However, as noted in the paper, we used fixed frequency ranges for the two gamma bands even though the difference between cases and controls was visible only in the middle of the bands. Simply choosing more “sensitive” gamma ranges (26-34 Hz for slow gamma and 44-56 Hz for fast gamma) yielded BFs of 3.34 and 4.6, thereby providing substantial evidence in favour of the alternate hypothesis even when only MCIs were considered. Upon considering both MCI and AD groups together (N=17), the BFs were 13.70 and 8.60 for the two gamma bands, providing strong evidence in favour of the alternate over the null hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have adequately addressed major concerns in the revised manuscript. However, the authors need to address a few additional points. Especially, on Page 16, lines 348-352, and Page 17, lines 353-358, why do the authors think that their findings contradict findings of Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al.? The current findings are in no meaningful way comparable to Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., and Thomson et al. Did the authors induce 40 Hz repeatedly and measured any cognitive and pathology outcomes? Or did Adaikkan et al., Martorell et al., showed SSVEP changes at 32 Hz in any human AD or mouse AD. The authors should provide a nuanced interpretation of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. As the reviewer has rightly pointed out, we cannot draw a direct comparison of our study with the studies cited above. This is because the model organism as well as the entrainment frequencies are different in our study. We have now made this point clear in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Page 5, lines 87-95, where is the corresponding graph or data points? If the authors would like to not include any additional graph, at least they should provide values for which they performed statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now made a separate figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) showing these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given that the authors have CDR score for all subjects, it would be helpful to perform a regression analyses and provide an additional insight as to whether there is a correlation between CDR score and sensory evoked gamma.

We have included this regression analysis, and it does show a significant effect for both gamma ranges (slow gamma: β<sub>CDR</sub> = -0.57, p = 0.0017; fast gamma: β<sub>CDR</sub> = -0.25, p = 0.0063) but not for the alpha range, consistent with other results presented earlier.</p></body></sub-article></article>
