deprivation. To what extent membrane-resident autophagy receptors also respond to organelle-restricted cues to induce selective autophagy remains poorly understood. We find that latent activation of the yeast pexophagy receptor Atg36 by the casein kinase Hrr25 in rich media is repressed by the ATPase activity of Pex1/6, the catalytic subunits of the exportomer AAA+ transmembrane complex enabling protein import into peroxisomes. Quantitative proteomics of purified Pex3, an obligate Atg36 coreceptor, support a model in which the exportomer tail anchored to the peroxisome membrane represses Atg36 phosphorylation on Pex3 without assistance from additional membrane factors. Indeed, we reconstitute inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> using soluble Pex1/6 and define an N-terminal unstructured region of Atg36 that enables regulation by binding to Pex1. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which a compartment-specific AAA+ complex mediating organelle biogenesis and protein quality control staves off induction of selective autophagy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>selective autophagy</kwd><kwd>pexophagy</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd><kwd>Atg36</kwd><kwd>Hrr25</kwd><kwd>Pex1/6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM121419-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denic</surname><given-names>Vladimir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R35GM127136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denic</surname><given-names>Vladimir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP DGE1144152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamber</surname><given-names>Roarke A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mechanism by which a compartment-specific AAA+ complex mediating organelle biogenesis and protein quality control staves off induction of selective autophagy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The accumulation of damaged organelles is a hallmark of aging and neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mizushima and Levine, 2020</xref>). In healthy cells, damaged organelles are detected and eliminated by selective autophagy, a process that involves the capture of organelles in transport vesicles called autophagosomes that deliver organelles to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gatica et al., 2018</xref>). A class of proteins called autophagy receptors targets a diverse range of organelles and other targets for autophagic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirkin and Rogov, 2019</xref>). Recent work in yeast and mammals has established that autophagy receptors function not only by tethering autophagy targets to autophagosomes, but also by initiating <italic>de novo</italic> autophagosome formation via activation of the master autophagy kinase, Atg1/ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ravenhill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torggler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vargas et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To perform effective quality control, autophagy receptors must initiate degradation of damaged organelles while sparing functional organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Green and Levine, 2014</xref>). Several regulatory mechanisms that enable such selectivity by autophagy receptors have been identified. First, the localization of multiple autophagy receptors is regulated by organelle damage, such that some receptors localize only to damaged organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>). Second, phosphorylation by cytosolic kinases is critical for the ability of several autophagy receptors to drive organelle degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wild et al., 2011</xref>). Studies of mitochondrial autophagy in mammalian cells have shown that such receptor phosphorylation events can be regulated to enable effective organelle quality control: the kinase TBK1 is recruited to depolarized mitochondria, where it phosphoactivates the autophagy receptor OPTN, enabling selective elimination of damaged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>). For many other autophagy receptors that are known to be phosphorylated, however, it remains unclear whether their phosphorylation is regulated by signals of organelle damage in order to enable effective organelle quality control.</p><p>Recently, multiple groups working in yeast and mammalian cells reported intriguing observations that peroxisomes are rapidly degraded by autophagy in cells that lack Pex1, Pex6, or Pex15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Law et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>), which form a complex required for peroxisome matrix protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Platta et al., 2013</xref>). The Pex1/6 subunits form a hexameric AAA-ATPase that is recruited by Pex15 to peroxisomes, where it extracts ubiquitinated Pex5 (a receptor for peroxisome matrix proteins) from the peroxisome membrane to enable additional rounds of protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Platta et al., 2005</xref>). The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins on the surface of peroxisomes has been shown to drive selective peroxisome autophagy (also known as pexophagy) in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deosaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), and it was thus proposed that the accumulation of ubiquitinated Pex5 in exportomer-deficient cells explains why pexophagy is induced in those cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Law et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nazarko, 2017</xref>). However, it remains to be determined why pexophagy is induced by exportomer mutations in yeast, as Pex5 is not required for pexophagy in exportomer-deficient cells and ubiquitination does not appear to be a pexophagy-inducing signal in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>). All forms of budding yeast pexophagy, including pexophagy driven by exportomer loss, are dependent on the autophagy receptor Atg36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Motley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>), whose ability to drive pexophagy depends on its phosphoactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, to gain insight into the mechanism by which exportomer mutations induce peroxisome turnover by selective autophagy, we investigated the molecular basis of Atg36 regulation upon loss of exportomer subunits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exportomer mutations enhance Atg36 phosphoactivation by Hrr25</title><p>We confirmed that deletion of the <italic>PEX1</italic> gene encoding a subunit of the exportomer promotes pexophagy under nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that this process is dependent on the pexophagy receptor Atg36 as well as Atg11, a scaffold protein that connects autophagy receptors to the Atg1 complex involved in all forms of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and is associated with a modified form of Atg36 that could be resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Exportomer mutations have been previously shown to enhance removal of peroxisomes but not mitochondria or bulk cytoplasm, thus allowing the autophagy system to effectively exert a form of organelle quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>). Despite being selective, this pexophagy process resembles the mechanism of pexophagy induction by nitrogen starvation, which concomitantly elevates bulk autophagy and cytoplasm-to-vacuole (CVT) transport. In this latter, nonselective context, Atg36 is activated by Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation resulting in the enhanced ability of the modified receptor product to interact with Atg11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>). We have obtained four lines of experimental evidence for an analogous mechanism by which exportomer mutants lead to Atg36 activation. First, lambda phosphatase treatment of Atg36-MYC isolated by affinity purification from a <italic>pex1∆</italic> cell extract converted modified Atg36 to its unmodified form, thus rendering its migration indistinguishable from the wild-type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, Atg36 was no longer modified in the presence of a Pex3 mutation (<italic>pex3-177</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that abolishes Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 during nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meguro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Motley et al., 2012</xref>). Third, we took advantage of the previous observation that auxin-inducible degradation (AID) of Pex1 can also enhance pexophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We were then able to effectively suppress this conditional <italic>pex1</italic> phenotype by simultaneous AID of Hrr25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Lastly, we found that pexophagy enhanced by the loss of Pex1 was abolished by inhibiting the kinase activity of a Shokat mutant version of Hrr25 with the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In sum, these data show that exportomer mutants enable Atg36 phosphoactivation by Hrr25, thus leading to selective pexophagy in the absence of nutritional stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Exportomer mutations enhance Atg36 phosphoactivation by Hrr25.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The indicated extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-MYC magnetic beads.

This mechanoenzymatic process has not been fully reconstituted with purified components but appears to be driven by the Pex1/6 ATPase. To test if the latter activity also drives Atg36 repression, we mutated the D2 Walker B motif of Pex6, mutation of which was recently shown to abrogate ATP hydrolysis by the Pex1/6 complex <italic>in vitro</italic> , without affecting hexamerization of Pex6 with wild-type Pex1 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ciniawsky et al., 2015</xref>) or Pex6 binding to Pex15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birschmann et al., 2003</xref>).

These findings demonstrate that exportomer ATPase activity, either directly or indirectly, inhibits Atg36.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of physical interactions between Pex3 and the exportomer</title><p>PTS receptors have already been excluded as potential mediators of Atg36 activation in <italic>pex1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuttall et al., 2014</xref>), but a systematic dissection of this mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic> had not been carried out. Thus, we devised an unbiased proteomics approach for detecting Pex1-dependent changes within the Atg36 interactome relevant to pexophagy. Atg36 has relatively low cell abundance and appears to be both inherently unstable and resistant to Hrr25 phosphorylation when not associated with Pex3, its peroxisomal anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meguro et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we chose Pex3-FLAG as our bait and subjected digitonin-solubilized extracts from postlogarithmic cells to affinity purification. Comparative mass spectrometry with extracts of control cells expressing untagged Pex3 revealed the presence of several previously identified Pex3 interaction partners, including Atg36, Inp1, Pex19, and Pex5, as well as several peroxisome membrane proteins whose insertion is known to be Pex19- and Pex3 dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hettema et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>). Intriguingly, we also identified all three components of the exportomer, which to our knowledge had not been previously linked to Pex3. SDS–PAGE analysis followed by protein staining revealed two prominent high molecular weight species (&gt;100 kDa) as likely candidates for Pex1 (~117 kDa) and Pex6 (~ 116 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, we confirmed that Pex1 was a relatively abundant component of the Pex3 interactome by appending a bulky tag (3xV5-AID; ~30 kDa) to its C-terminus and detecting it by western blotting, as well as by the expected band shift following SDS–PAGE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that the coimmunoprecipitation between Pex3 and Pex1 was not affected by the expression of Pex6<sup>WB</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the effect of this mutation on Atg36 phosphorylation and pexophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) is not simply caused by gross disruption of Pex3’s association with the exportomer.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of physical interactions between Pex3 and the exportomer.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Detergent-solubilized extracts derived from cells with indicated genotypes were first cleared at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> and then immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG magnetic beads.

One possibility is that the N-terminal region of Atg36, which is near the critical Hrr25 S97 phosphosite for Atg11 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farré et al., 2013</xref>), could provide a docking site for Hrr25, and that Pex1/6 binding to Atg36 disrupts the interaction between Hrr25 and Atg36. Future structural studies, for instance using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe differences in Atg36 structure in the presence or absence of Pex1/6, should help resolve these issues.</p><p>Our work establishes that the ATPase activity of Pex1/6 can directly inhibit activation of Atg36 by Hrr25 but defining the mechanism of this mechanoenzymatic process remains an important future goal. One possibility is that active ATP hydrolysis enables Pex1/6 to interact more strongly with Atg36 and out-compete Hrr25 binding to Atg36. Alternatively, Pex1/6 may modulate the conformation of Atg36 and its abundance on the peroxisome similar to the activity of Pex1/6 in extracting Pex15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gardner et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, it will be important to examine if growth and nutritional cues affect Atg36 phosphorylation via posttranslational modifications of Hrr25 and the exportomer.</p><p>Pex3 is required for Atg36 phosphorylation, and it was recently shown that Pex3 promotes Atg36 phosphoactivation by enhancing interaction of the Pex3–Atg36 complex with Hrr25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meguro et al., 2020</xref>). Due to technical difficulties in purifying a functional form of the soluble domain of Pex3, however, we have been unable to conduct quantitative enzymatic analyses of Pex3’s role in promoting Hrr25 phosphorylation of Atg36, leaving uncertain whether the mechanism of stimulation involves substrate-induced conformational changes or a more passive tethering mechanism. It additionally remains unclear whether Pex3 regulates inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation by Pex1/6, but our work suggests that Pex3 is not absolutely essential for this process, as Pex1/6 was capable of inhibiting Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Atg36 in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays conducted in the absence of Pex3. However, we cannot exclude that possible additional disruption of Atg36–Pex3 or Hrr25–Pex3 interactions by Pex1/6 may contribute to inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation by the exportomer <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>While Pex3 coimmunoprecipitates with exportmer subunits in this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weir et al., 2017</xref>), we were not able to distinguish whether the coimmunoprecipitation reflected direct interaction between Pex3 and Pex1/6/15 or was mediated by the unidentified factors. An early split-ubiquitin assay study reported a weak interaction signal between Pex15 and Pex3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Eckert and Johnsson, 2003</xref>), but no binding between the cytosolic fragments of Pex3 (cytoPex3) and Pex15 (cytoPex15) in our Y2H assay was detected. We speculate that the transmembrane domains of Pex3 and Pex15 may mediate their putative interactions. Further structural and biochemical studies will help to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Atg36 is known to become phosphorylated by Hrr25 upon starvation, but future studies are required to determine how Atg36 phosphorylation is regulated by changes in nutrient status, and how starvation causes Atg36 to be released from, or overcome, inhibition by Pex1/6. It is known that starvation also increases Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of two other autophagy receptors, Atg19 and Atg34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mochida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pfaffenwimmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>), so one possibility is that Hrr25 is globally activated by starvation signals, which may be sufficient to overcome Pex1/6 suppression. Alternatively, it is possible that exportomer activity (either toward all substrates or toward Atg36 specifically) decreases during starvation. In this vein, future studies should examine whether the sites at which Atg36 is phosphorylated by Hrr25 differ upon exportomer loss and upon starvation, and whether exportomer loss synergizes with starvation to increase Atg36 phosphorylation and pexophagy.</p><p>Within the context of quality control, our findings raise the intriguing possibility that autophagy is capable of selective organelle clearance using a similar mechanistic logic to two protein homeostasis pathways: the heat shock response and the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hetz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hetz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pincus, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). A key feature of both is the dual ability of compartment-specific chaperones (cytosolic or endoplasmic reticulum [ER] resident, respectively) to enable negative feedback by functioning as both effectors of protein folding and degradation, as well as repressors of two conserved transcription factors (in yeast, Hsf1 and Ire1, respectively) that restore proteostasis by inducing gene expression of various proteostasis factors, including the chaperones themselves. By analogy, Pex1/6 are known to be mechanonenzymes for both membrane recycling and degradation of Pex5/7, the receptors for targeting soluble proteins to the peroxisome matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kragt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miyata and Fujiki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Platta et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Platta et al., 2007</xref>). We demonstrate that Pex1/6 also bind to Atg36 to directly repress wholesale peroxisome destruction but further work is needed to establish if physiological changes in the capacity of this AAA+ system are a readout of peroxisome dysfunction and damage. In this broad view of how different tiers of quality control can be logically connected, our work also raises the attractive possibility that emerging connections between ER protein folding stress and ER-phagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molinari, 2021</xref>) are the products of direct ER-phagy receptor regulation by ER-associated degradation factors.</p><p>Finally, even though the exportomer also appears to function as a repressor of selective pexophagy in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Law et al., 2017</xref>), it remains unclear whether the mechanism we have uncovered in yeast is relevant to the regulation of pexophagy in mammalian cells. Several important differences in the regulation of pexophagy between yeast and mammals – including the use of different autophagy receptor proteins and the apparently unique role of ubiquitin in mammalian pexophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deosaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nordgren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) – warrant caution in seeking for convergence between these mechanisms. Systematic screening for potential kinase-mediated mechanisms involved in mammalian pexophagy should help resolve this issue. Regardless of these specifics, our work paves the way for future efforts to define a broadly conserved regulatory mechanism of selective autophagy by exploring the ability of organelle-localized enzymes to directly inhibit phosphoactivation of autophagy receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Vladimir Denic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/directory/vladimir-denic/">vdenic@mcb.harvard.edu</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Yeast strain construction and PCRs</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Since autophagic degradation often targets components critical for cell viability and growth, it must be tightly regulated. Indeed, previous studies have discovered regulatory mechanisms for different types of autophagy. In selective autophagy of peroxisomes (pexophagy) in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of the pexophagy receptor Atg36 stimulates pexophagy by enhancing Atg36 activity to recruit core Atg proteins responsible for autophagosome formation. On the other hand, disrupting the peroxisomal AAA+ ATPase complex, which is composed of Pex1 and Pex6 and required for protein import into peroxisomes, was reported to somehow stimulate pexophagy even under conditions where pexophagy does not occur in wild-type cells, implying that this complex is involved in the repression of pexophagy under non-inducing conditions.</p><p>In this study, based on elegant protein engineering, quantitative mass spectrometry, and phosphorylation reactions reconstituted using purified proteins, the authors discovered the mechanism underlying this pexophagy repression. The N-terminal region of Atg36 is captured by Pex1, which, in a manner dependent on ATPase activity of the complex, prevents Atg36 from phosphorylation by Hrr25 on peroxisomes, resulting in pexophagy inhibition. This conclusion was strongly supported by a series of experiments, all of which were logically designed and well conducted. Details for interactions among proteins involved in this mechanism are still unclear, but key interactions were likely to be clarified in this study. An important remaining issue is how this repression mechanism is cancelled upon pexophagy stimulation (nitrogen starvation). It is also interesting to know the relationship between this newly-found inhibitory mechanism and the previously-described counteracting mechanism, Pex3-mediated stimulation of Atg36 phosphorylation by Hrr25 (the authors found in this study that the Pex1-Pex16 complex interacts with Pex3 via Pex15). The physiological impact of this mechanism also remains to be investigated. At any rate, this study unveils a novel aspect in pexophagy regulation and also provides mechanistic insights into the regulation of other selective autophagy pathways and other intracellular quality control systems.</p><p>As mentioned above, I find this study clearly shows a new mechanism by which pexophagy is repressed under non-inducing conditions. I raised major remaining issues but think that these should be addressed in future studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>When pexophagy is induced in yeast, pexophagy receptor Atg36 is phosphorylated by Hrr25, and the phosphorylated Atg36 interacts with Atg11 to deliver peroxisome to the isolation membrane. However, it remains unclear how phosphorylation of Atg36 is suppressed to prevent unnecessary pexophagy induction at unstressed conditions. It was recently reported that pexophagy was promoted by the lack of peroxisomal AAA-ATPase Pex1/Pex6 or Pex15. Thus, the authors focused on Pex1/Pex6 and identified that Pex1/Pex6 interacts with Atg36 and suppresses the phosphorylation of Atg36. They also showed that repression of Atg36 phosphorylation by Pex1/Pex6 requires their AAA-ATPase activity, but not Pex15 function by using in vivo and in vitro assays,</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>By in vivo assays, the authors clearly showed that Pex1/Pex6 represses the phosphorylation of Atg36 by interacting with Atg36. The in vitro reconstitution assay support entirely the findings of in vivo that Pex1/Pex6 inhibits phosphorylation of Atg36 by Hrr25. The requirement of ATPase activity of Pex1/Pex6 for the repression of Atg36 phosphorylation was also demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>Using the transmembrane domain deleted Pex3 (cytoPex3), cytoPex15-cytoPex3 chimeric protein, and the rapamycin dependent FRB/FKBP system, the authors succeeded to show that inhibition of Atg36 phosphorylation works without Pex15 and peroxisomal membrane.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors found that Pex1/Pex6 suppresses phosphorylation of Atg36 and pexophagy, the mechanism by which Pex1/Pex6 suppresses phosphorylation of Atg36 is unclear. Furthermore, this study did not figure out how the phosphorylation of Atg36 is regulated by Pex1/Pex6, i.e., how Atg36 is phosphorylated by releasing the inhibition by Pex1/Pex6 when pexophagy should be induced.</p><p>1) It was shown that Pex1/Pex6 suppresses phosphorylation of Atg36. However, the mechanism which regulates phosphorylation of Atg36 is unclear. One possibility is that posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination regulates the activity of Hrr25 or Pex1/Pex6. Another possibility is that the localization of Hrr25 or Pex1/Pex6 changes upon pexophagy induction. The authors should test these possibilities.</p><p>2) The AAA-ATPase activity of Pex1/Pex6 is required for the repression of Atg36 phosphorylation. It may be possible that the AAA-ATPase activity unfolds or degrades Hrr25 when Pex1 interacts with Atg36. This possibility can be tested by adding substrate of Casein Kinase 1 in in vitro reconstitution assay, as shown in Figure 3F.</p><p>3) In this study, pexophagy was induced at post-logarithmic growth in the oleate medium. In this culture condition, TOR may be suppressed and nonselective macroautophagy may be induced. Constitutive phosphorylation of Atg36 by Pex6WB or δ-N30-Atg36 can induce pexophagy. However, it is unclear whether phosphorylation of Atg36 alone can trigger pexophagy or activation of autophagy machinery is required in addition to Atg36 phosphorylation for pexophagy. To test these possibilities, test the pexophagy at early-logarithmic growth in glucose medium in the presence or absence of a constitutively active form of Atg13 (Kamada et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 30, 1049-1058) in Pex6WB or δ-N30-Atg36 strains.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper by Yu et al., addresses the mechanism of how the yeast pexophagy receptor, Atg36, is kept in check, until needed, prior to its phosphoactivation by the casein kinase, Hrr25, during pexophagy in yeast. This works follows previous studies in Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces showing that the peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP), Pex3, is necessary for the localization and phosphoactivation of Atg36 by Hrr25. This study now shows that Pex3, in addition to recruiting Atg36 to peroxisomes, also interacts with one component, Pex1, of the interacting AAA ATPases, Pex1 and Pex6, which block the phosphorylation of Atg36 by Hrr25. An ATPase-active Pex1/Pex6 interacts with Pex3 and inhibits Atg36 phosphorylation via interaction of Atg36 with Pex1, causing the exportomer to act as a negative regulator of pexophagy</p><p>Although previous work had shown the Pex1/Pex6 negatively regulate pexophagy, the mechanism was unknown, but is clarified here. The data are reasonably strong and convincing, but rely heavily on in vitro systems and artificial constructs, and could be strengthened by in vivo data and physiological constructs.</p><p>While the impact of the exportomer (the hexameric Pex1/Pex6 complex and the PMP, Pex15, which recruits Pex6 to peroxisomes) on Atg36 phosphoactivation and pexophagy is published, this study adds to the mechanistic details using several artificial constructs and in vitro reconstitution experiments. Because a good part of what is in the paper was shown previously (except for the new mechanistic details referenced above), what would be nice, but is missing, is how the ATPase activity of Pex1/Pex6 inhibits the phosphoactivation of Atg36.</p><p>In characterizing the Pex3 complexes, the authors make a new observation that all three components of the exportomer complex associate with Pex3, including a specific interaction with Pex1, along with other previously described partners. The authors go on to use engineered, chimeric protein constructs to reconstitute the interaction between Pex3, Atg36 and Pex1, as well as either the phosphorylation, or repression thereof, of Atg36, to show that the exportomer directly blocks activation of Pex3-bound Atg36 by Hrr25. However, the only caveat is the use of mislocalized and/or artificial chimeras, which should be strengthened by in vivo studies.</p><p>In showing the specificity of the Pex1/Pex6 ATPase towards blocking the phosphorylation of Atg36, the authors use another AAA ATPase, Cdc48, as a control (Figure 4F). This does not seem like a good control without localizing Cdc48 with Pex3 (using Pex3-FRB and FKBP-Cdc48 wt and mutant, +/- rapamycin as shown in Figure 3 E).</p><p>Are strains expressing various chimeras, such as cyto-Pex3, cytoPex15-cytoPex3 incompetent for physiological pexophagy and are these proteins really cytosolic as presumed, which may not be true because Pex3 associates with other PMPs? This is important to validate the claim that the exportomer's proximity to Atg36 is critical for inhibition of pexophagy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74531.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see below, all reviewers positively evaluated your manuscript.

Thus, we evaluated whether Pex6<sup>WB</sup> or ∆N30Atg36 are able to induce pexophagy in cells grown in SD media to OD 0.5 and 1.0. We found that expression of Atg13-8SA as the sole constitutive copy of Atg13 did not result in elevated Pex11-GFP processing relative to cells with wild-type Atg13. Similarly, at the postlogarithmic phase (OD 5.2), Atg13 (8SA) only marginally increased Pex11-GFP processing and this effect appeared to be independent of the regulatory Atg36 phosphorylation mechanism defined by our study. Even though these new data suggest the existence of an undefined post-logarithmic signal they might also be explained by the insufficiency of Atg13-8SA as a strong inducer of nonselective macroautophagy.

To reduce the potential for disrupting Cdc48’s essential function in many cellular processes, we expressed a second copy of FLAG-FKBP-Cdc48 from a β-estradiol inducible promoter. Using a similar experimental setup to the one in which rapamycin enables FKBP-Pex6 to bind Pex3-FRB and repress Atg36 phosphorylation, we observed no repression by FKBP-Cdc48 expression even though the protein levels of FKBPCdc48 were substantially overexpressed relative to FKBP-Pex6 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G). These new findings provide complementary in vivo support for the AAA+ specificity of Atg36 inhibition by Pex1/6 that we originally demonstrated solely by our in vitro kinase assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Confirming the localization of chimeras, cyto-Pex3 and cytoPex15-cytoPex3 (Reviewer #3, Major comments).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the Pex3 chimeras lacking the native transmembrane domain. We expressed a second copy of either mCherry-tagged Pex3 or chimeras thereof in cells with a mutant allele of Pex3 (<italic>pex3-177</italic>) that is specifically defective in recruiting Atg36 and in pexophagy (Motley et al., 2012) but otherwise wild-type for peroxisome biogenesis.

To clarify the impact of the current work and more clearly frame the remaining mechanistic questions, we have described several competing mechanistic models in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript that we will discern between in follow-up studies. One possibility is that an ATPase active conformation (probably the ADP bound state) of Pex1/6 is more competent for phospho-inhibition of Atg36, for instance because the ADP bound state of Pex1/6 may exhibit stronger binding affinity for Atg36 and may thus out-compete Hrr25 binding to Atg36. Alternatively, by analogy to Pex1/6’s proposed role in extracting Pex15 from the peroxisomes (Gardner et al., 2018), Pex1/6 may also regulate Atg36 by disrupting its interaction with the membrane and/or Pex3. Regardless of these mechanistically detailed issues, the current work demonstrates that the ATPase activity of Pex1/6 is critical for suppression of pexophagy through direct repression of Atg36 phosphoactivation. The ability of kinases in general and casein kinase in specific (e.g. Chino et al., 2022) to activate autophagy receptors is emerging as a new regulatory paradigm in the field. As such, we feel that our current work makes a concrete and significant mechanistic and conceptual advance by showing how a AAA+ machine can enable autophagy receptors to be phosphoregulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In characterizing the Pex3 complexes, the authors make a new observation that all three components of the exportomer complex associate with Pex3, including a specific interaction with Pex1, along with other previously described partners. The authors go on to use engineered, chimeric protein constructs to reconstitute the interaction between Pex3, Atg36 and Pex1, as well as either the phosphorylation, or repression thereof, of Atg36, to show that the exportomer directly blocks activation of Pex3-bound Atg36 by Hrr25. However, the only caveat is the use of mislocalized and/or artificial chimeras, which should be strengthened by in vivo studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making this point here and below. As the reviewer suggested, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the Pex3 chimeras and found that by contrast with the peroxisomal localization of wt Pex3-mCherry, both cytoPex3-mCherry and cytoPex15-cytoPex3-mCherry were localized to the cytoplasm (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We additionally confirmed that cells expressing Pex3 chimeras were defective for physiological pexophagy, as measured in an assay for Pex11-GFP processing conducted under nitrogen starvation conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). A detailed description is included in the essential revision (#4) and below.</p><p>Our co-immunoprecipitation studies showed the exportomer complex (Pex1/6/15) associates with Pex3. However, we have not found any Y2H evidence for a direct interaction between Pex3 and any individual exportormer subunits. Thus, we speculate in the revised Discussion that Pex3 binding to Pex15 in the context of the native transmembrane complex enables it to associate with Pex1/6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In showing the specificity of the Pex1/Pex6 ATPase towards blocking the phosphorylation of Atg36, the authors use another AAA ATPase, Cdc48, as a control (Figure 4F). This does not seem like a good control without localizing Cdc48 with Pex3 (using Pex3-FRB and FKBP-Cdc48 wt and mutant, +/- rapamycin as shown in Figure 3 E).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have engineered yeast strains for chemical heterodimerization of Cdc48 to Pex3 on the peroxisome membrane. To reduce the potential for disrupting Cdc48’s essential function in many cellular processes, we expressed a second copy of FLAG-FKBP-Cdc48 from a β-estradiol inducible promoter. Using a similar experimental setup to the one in which rapamycin enables FKBP-Pex6 to bind Pex3-FRB and repress Atg36 phosphorylation, we observed no repression by FKBP-Cdc48 expression even though the protein levels of FKBPCdc48 were substantially overexpressed relative to FKBP-Pex6 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1G). These new findings provide complementary in vivo support for the AAA+ specificity of Atg36 inhibition by Pex1/6 that we originally demonstrated solely by our in vitro kinase assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are strains expressing various chimeras, such as cyto-Pex3, cytoPex15-cytoPex3 incompetent for physiological pexophagy and are these proteins really cytosolic as presumed, which may not be true because Pex3 associates with other PMPs? This is important to validate the claim that the exportomer's proximity to Atg36 is critical for inhibition of pexophagy.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the Pex3 chimeras lacking the native transmembrane domain. We expressed a second copy of either mCherry-tagged Pex3 or chimeras thereof in cells with a mutant allele of Pex3 (<italic>pex3-177</italic>) that is specifically defective in recruiting Atg36 and in pexophagy (Motley et al., 2012) but otherwise wild-type for peroxisome biogenesis. As expected, wt Pex3-mCherry formed puncta that colocalized with Pex11-GFP, while both cytoPex3-mCherry and cytoPex15-cytoPex3-mCherry had a diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We additionally confirmed that only wt Pex3-mCherry complemented the defect in pexophagy whereas the cytosolic Pex3 chimeras did not (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>References</p><p>Birschmann I, Stroobants AK, Berg M van den, Schäfer A, Rosenkranz K, Kunau W-H, Tabak HF. 2003.
