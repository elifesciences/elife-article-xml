Secreted signaling proteins of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Hedgehog (Hh), Notch, Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β)/Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), and Wnt/Wingless (Wg) families have been shown to act as morphogens either at a short range or over a long distance. How these morphogens and their corresponding signaling pathways coordinate to control patterning and growth in various developmental systems is a central question in developmental biology.</p><p>The developing appendages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> provide a valuable model system to genetically and molecularly identify morphogens and members of their corresponding signaling pathways. They have also assisted in revealing the fundamental features and interplay between different morphogens during pattern formation. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh and BMP signals function as short- and long-range morphogens, respectively, and together organize patterning along the anteroposterior (A/P) axis of the wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mullor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nellen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strigini and Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zecca et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In the case of Hh signaling, the quiescent state of the pathway is maintained by the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc)-dependent inhibition of Smoothened (Smo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ingham et al., 2011</xref>). This inhibition is lifted by Hh binding to Ptc and its co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McLellan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>), which releases Smo from repression and thus activates intracellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beachy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lum and Beachy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Varjosalo and Taipale, 2008</xref>). In the wing discs, Hh is secreted in the posterior (P) compartment and spreads toward the anterior (A) compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basler and Struhl, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capdevila et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tabata and Kornberg, 1994</xref>). Hh signaling does not occur in P compartment cells because they do not express critical components of the Hh pathway, such as the major transcriptional effector Ci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eaton and Kornberg, 1990</xref>). Conversely, A compartment cells can receive and respond to Hh but are unable to produce Hh. Hh synthesized by P cells diffuses into the A compartment adjacent to the A/P boundary, where it is sequestered by the Ptc-Ihog/Boi receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>), thus forming a short-range gradient that activates the localized expression ofseveral target genes, including <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basler and Struhl, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capdevila et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ingham et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tabata and Kornberg, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Dpp is the homolog of vertebrate TGF-β superfamily ligands BMP2/4, which binds to the BMP type I receptor thickveins (Tkv) or Saxophone (Sax) and type II receptor Punt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parker et al., 2004</xref>). Upon ligand binding, Tkv or Sax phosphorylates the transcription factor Mad (referred to as pMad; an indication of active Dpp signal transduction). Phosphorylated Mad then forms a trimeric complex with the co-Smad Medea and is translocated to the nucleus where it regulates downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moustakas and Heldin, 2009</xref>). In contrast to the Hh signal, Dpp diffuses into both the A and P compartments and acts as a long-range morphogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brook et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lawrence and Struhl, 1996</xref>).

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two other characterized BMP family ligands, the BMP5/6/7/8 homolog Glass-bottom boat (Gbb), and the more distantly related Screw (Scw) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arora et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Padgett et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wharton et al., 1991</xref>), can form heterodimers with Dpp to augment the level and increase the range of BMP signaling in different cells and tissues.

Additionally, Tkv, the main type I Dpp receptor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, critically affects Dpp tissue distribution through ligand trapping and internalization, and thus globally shapes the BMP activity gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crickmore and Mann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lecuit and Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>). Prominent among the many determinants that impact proper establishment and maintenance of the Dpp activity gradient is the action of the Hh signal, which simultaneously induces Dpp expression and lowers responsiveness to Dpp in the same cells at the A/P border by repressing transcription of the <italic>tkv</italic> receptor gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>). The coordinated activation and attenuation of BMP signaling activity by Hh illustrates the complex regulatory interactions of different morphogens in pattern and growth in developing systems.</p><p>Here, we show that the activity of BMPs is further fine-tuned by a previously unknown Hh-dependent mechanism involving induction of <italic>nord,</italic> which encodes a Neuron-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (NDNF)-like factor. Absence of <italic>nord</italic> results in reduced medial BMP signaling near the source of Dpp in the larval wing imaginal discs but increases long-range BMP activity surrounding the primordial PCV in the pupal wing. Thus, adult wings from <italic>nord</italic> mutant flies exhibit seemingly opposite phenotypes of reduced wing size and ectopic PCV. Expression and co-immunoprecipitation studies in cultured S2 cells demonstrate that Nord is secreted, associates with the extracellular matrix, and binds to Dpp or the heterodimer of Dpp-Gbb. We further show that Nord is a dosage-dependent BMP modulator, where low levels of Nord promote and high levels inhibit BMP signaling. Taken together, we propose that Hh-induced Nord expression modulates the distribution and level of BMP signaling in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval and pupal wing to obtain proper size and crossvein patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide expression profiling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs identifies <italic>nord</italic> as a novel target gene of the Hh signaling pathway</title><p>The imaginal discs of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, where most known Hh signaling target genes are expressed with a restricted pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strigini and Cohen, 1997</xref>), offer an accessible model system for identifying novel targets of the Hh signaling pathway. In wing discs, cells near the A/P compartment boundary (B: <italic>ptc+</italic>) receive the highest level of Hh stimulation while A cells (A: <italic>hh-</italic>), located further from the border, receive lower levels of stimulation. In contrast, P cells (P: <italic>hh+</italic>) do not respond to Hh due to lack of the receptor Ptc and the transcription factor Ci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eaton and Kornberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify target genes whose expression is controlled, directly or indirectly, by Hh signaling activity, we performed a systematic comparison of gene expression profiles among the three cell types. After genetic labeling, wing discs were dissected, cells dissociated, and then sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RNA was extracted from the sorted cell populations and subjected to microarray analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previously, by comparing genes differentially expressed in the A/P boundary adjacent cells (B: <italic>ptc+</italic>) and P cells (P: <italic>hh+</italic>), we identified an unknown Hh pathway target dTRAF1/TRAF4 and established that the Hh signal mediates JNK activity by regulating the expression of dTRAF1/TRAF4 in developmental organ size control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Willsey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Here, we modified the gene expression analysis method by including additional transcriptome comparisons between the A/P boundary adjacent cells (B: <italic>ptc+</italic>) and A cells (A: <italic>hh-</italic>), and between A cells (A: <italic>hh-</italic>) and P cells (P: <italic>hh+</italic>). Genes whose expression is not only higher in A cells than P cells (<italic>Fold<sub>A/P</sub> &gt;</italic> 1.2), but also higher in the A/P boundary adjacent cells than general A cells (<italic>Fold<sub>B/A</sub> &gt;</italic> 1.5) were selected as potential Hh-induced target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Hh-responsive genes known to be differentially expressed in the wing discs were found, including <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic>, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then focused on <italic>nord</italic> (FlyBase, CG30418), one of the top-ranking A/P boundary-enriched genes, with no previously characterized expression pattern or functional analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).

Analyses of the genome and EST sequences from various organisms suggest that nearly all bilaterian animals have either single or multiple orthologous genes for Nord/Ndnf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We cloned the full-length cDNAs from <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nord and NDNF from several different species into a mammalian expression vector and found that both Nord and various NDNF proteins were secreted into the medium after transient transfection into HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Gbb is broadly and uniformly expressed in the larval and pupal wing, while Dpp, a well-known target of Hh signaling, is expressed in a stripe of cells in the anterior compartment along the A/P compartmental boundary of the larval wing imaginal disc. From this source, Dpp protein is thought to spread and form a concentration gradient to control the patterning and growth of the wing imaginal disc. In agreement with our finding that like <italic>dpp</italic>, <italic>nord</italic> is a target gene of the Hh signaling pathway in the wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), we observed a spatial-temporal correspondence between <italic>nord</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic> expression.

We, therefore, asked whether elimination of Nord alters the level of phosphorylated Mad (pMad), the primary downstream signal transducer of BMP signaling in the wing disc. We quantified pMad signal intensity in <italic>nord</italic> mutant wing discs and compared it to that of wild-type controls. We found that the pMad intensity was slightly reduced in <italic>nord</italic> mutant wing discs, and this reduction of pMad levels was more evident in the A compartment where Nord is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, arrow). In contrast, by measuring the expression of high-threshold target gene <italic>ptc</italic> and low-threshold gene <italic>dpp</italic>, we found no obvious difference in the Hh signaling activity in the wild-type and <italic>nord</italic> mutant discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Of note, besides BMPs, Hh signaling also patterns the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing.

When quantifying the distance between distal ends of LVs L3 and L4 (d<sub>L3–L4</sub>) and that of L2 and L5 (d<sub>L2–L5</sub>), we found no specific reduction in the L3–L4 region indicated by comparable or higher d<sub>L3–L4</sub>/d<sub>L2–L5</sub> ratio in the female and male <italic>nord</italic> mutant wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), which is consistent with normal Hh signaling activity during the development of <italic>nord</italic> mutant wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Together, these findings suggested a positive role of endogenous Nord in augmenting BMP signaling activity to promote wing growth.</p><p>During pupal wing development, BMP signaling is activated in the prospective CV regions prior to the appearance of other known vein promoting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Connor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ralston and Blair, 2005</xref>), and abnormal BMP signaling can selectively affect the PCV and leave the LVs largely or entirely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Celis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haerry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Khalsa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nguyen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ralston and Blair, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ray and Wharton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wharton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yu et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the possible role of Nord in Dpp/BMP signal transduction during crossvein patterning. It is known that pMad becomes gradually refined to a narrow strip of precursor cells that form the future PCV during the first 24–28 hr AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>). To examine whether the ectopic PCV in <italic>nord</italic> mutants is a direct consequence of enhanced BMP signaling, we quantified pMad signal intensity at the presumptive PCV region in pupal wings at various time points after pupation. In contrast to the rather restricted pMad domain in wild-type pupal wings, we detected a broadened pMad domain around the presumptive PCV in <italic>nord</italic> mutants from 19 to 20 hr AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Gradually, the ectopic pMad accumulation became an expanded patch adjacent to the presumptive PCV, indicating that BMP signaling was abnormally elevated in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p>During early pupal stage, it is notable that Nord expression was seen neither in the LV nor primordia PCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement, we did not notice any ectopic PCV in the adult flies when <italic>UAS-nord-RNAi</italic> was selectively expressed in the P compartment of the larval and pupal wing via the <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>). Given that Nord is a secreted protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), Nord proteins secreted from the A/P boundary would likely play a role in reducing excessive BMP signaling in the L4–L5 intervein region to prevent ectopic venation. To test this possibility, we analyzed the ectopic venation phenotype in flies carrying <italic>ptc-Gal4</italic>-driven expression of <italic>UAS-nord-RNAi</italic>. Although ectopic venation phenotype was observed when <italic>nord</italic> was selectively knocked down in the Hh-responding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), the frequency of flies carrying ectopic PCV was lower when compared to <italic>nord</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). This weaker phenotype likely resulted from residual Nord protein either due to incomplete <italic>ptc-Gal4&gt;UAS-nord-RNAi-</italic>mediated <italic>nord</italic> knock down in the cells flanking the A/P boundary or due to possible Nord expression and secretion from other tissues. Nevertheless, opposite to the positive role of enhancing BMP signaling activity to promote growth of the larval wing discs, endogenous Nord also plays a negative role in inhibiting BMP signaling activity in the early pupal wing to prevent the formation of ectopic crossveins in the posterior compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Nord is a biphasic modulator of BMP signaling during wing growth</title><p>To better understand the role of Nord in modulating BMP signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated transgenic flies carrying a <italic>Gal4</italic>-inducible <italic>UAS-Nord</italic> transgene. Under control of the ubiquitous wing blade driver <italic>nub-Gal4</italic>, ectopic Nord expression resulted in reduced range and level of the pMad gradient in the third instar wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, 25°C), and accordingly decreased wing size in both adult males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, 25°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In flies, minimal Gal4 activity is present at 16°C, while 29°C provides a balance between maximal Gal4 activity with minimal effects on fertility and viability due to growth at a high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duffy, 2002</xref>). Taking advantage of the temperature-dependent nature of Gal4 activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we compared the dosage effect of Nord on pMad intensity in larvae raised at two different temperatures, 25 and 29°C. Indeed, in animals raised at 29°C expressing higher levels of exogenous Nord, we detected both a much reduced pMad gradient in the larval wing discs and more severely decreased wing size in the adult flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, Hh signaling activity is relatively normal in the wing discs expressing ectopic Nord. Although the Ptc-expressing domain became narrower, we did not notice any obvious decrease in the levels of Ptc expression. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Consistently, ectopic Nord expression did not cause any specific reduction in the distance of L3 and L4 based on the d<sub>L3–L4</sub>/d<sub>L2–L5</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting that the wing growth defect caused by ectopic Nord is unlikely due to inhibition of Hh signaling. Interestingly, partial L5 and PCV loss was also noticed in the wings with more dramatic size reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, arrowheads and arrows), and the frequency of disrupted L5 and PCV was more dramatic when the flies were raised at higher temperatures and expressed higher levels of ectopic Nord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, our observations indicate that ectopic Nord attenuates BMP signaling, leading to inhibition of wing growth and vein patterning. Along with the positive role of endogenous Nord in enhancing BMP signaling to promote wing growth, we propose a model that Nord has both positive and negative effects in modulating BMP signaling activity, where low (endogenous) levels of Nord enhance and high (ectopic) levels of Nord inhibit BMP signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ectopic expression of Nord attenuates Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Larvae expressing the indicated transgenes driven by <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> were raised at 25 or 29°C.

Accordingly, we used both <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> and <italic>en-Gal4</italic> to drive different levels of ectopic Nord in the P compartment of the wing disc, including the PCV primordia where Nord is not normally expressed.

We performed temperature-shift experiments (from 18 to 29°C) to initiate ectopic Nord expression at different times during pupal development and characterized the impact on PCV patterning in the resulting adult wings. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roberts, 1998</xref>), the length of pupal period became shorter after the temperature was raised from 18 to 29°C due to temperature-dependent effects on the growth rate, and we found that shifting the temperature to 29°C right after pupation led to eclosion ~84–96 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that activation of <italic>UAS-Nord</italic> expression by temperature shifts at 78 hr or earlier before eclosion caused the most severe PCV phenotype, but activation at 66 hr before eclosion or later resulted in essentially normal PCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). More importantly, we found that the abnormal PCV phenotypes relied on the levels of exogenous Nord: expression of a lower level of Nord (<italic>1XUAS-Nord</italic>) led to ectopic PCV, moderate levels (<italic>2XUAS-Nord</italic>) yielded a mixed phenotype with both ectopic and slightly reduced PCV, whereas high levels (<italic>3XUAS-Nord</italic>) gave rise to nearly complete loss of PCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, adult PCV defects and pMad patterns in pupal wings showed a correlation with the level of ectopic Nord, where the temperature shift occurred 12 hr after the start of pupal development. In pupal wings expressing a low level of exogenous Nord (<italic>1XUAS-Nord</italic>), ectopic pMad and ectopic crossveins were detected, while moderate overexpression (<italic>2XUAS-Nord</italic>) led to a mixed phenotype of partial pMad and crossvein vein loss or wider pMad and ectopic veins. When high Nord levels (<italic>3XUAS-Nord</italic>) were expressed in the pupal wings, pMad and the PCV were largely absent. Although the temporal resolution is somewhat limited, the results clearly indicate that the level of Nord influences the outcome of PCV patterning during the early pupal development where a lower level of exogenous Nord resulted in enhanced BMP signaling and ectopic PCV, while higher levels of exogenous Nord inhibited BMP signaling and caused disrupted or depleted PCVs.

We found that far less cleaved Dpp protein was released into the conditioned medium when Nord was co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, compare lane M3 with M2). Likewise, the same negative effect of Nord was observed when the medium was collected from cells expressing both Dpp and Gbb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, compare lane M5 with M4), albeit the increased total amount of ligands likely reflects the release of Dpp-Gbb heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, compare lane M4 with M2). Thus, the presence of Nord affected the release into the media of both Dpp and Dpp-Gbb, likely via binding to the BMP ligand. We then determined the activity of the collected conditioned media in an S2 cell-based signaling assay. Because endogenous levels of Mad protein in S2 cells are low, we established Mad-S2 responding cells that stably express a FLAG epitope-tagged Mad transgene (FLAG-Mad) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ross et al., 2001</xref>). Upon incubation of the Mad-S2 responding cells with conditioned medium collected from the source cells, BMP signaling activity was monitored by measuring the pMad signal intensity. Conditioned medium containing either Dpp or Dpp-Gbb, but not that containing Nord alone, was able to induce Mad phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In agreement with the dramatically reduced amount of Dpp or Dpp-Gbb ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), the conditioned medium collected from source cells co-expressing Nord showed lower pMad signal intensity compared to that collected from source cells lacking Nord co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Of note, Nord is not a membrane-tethered protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but we observed noticeable amounts of Nord deposited on the surface of source cells, as well as the surrounding extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Thus, the matrix-associated Nord may sequester Dpp and Dpp-Gbb ligands to the source cells and thereby reduce ligand level in the media, which in turn leads to decreased BMP signaling activity in the responding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Dosage-dependent modulation of BMP signaling by Nord <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, our loss- and gain-of-function analyses suggested that Nord is a dosage-dependent modulator of BMP signaling in wing growth and crossvein patterning. In the <italic>in vitro</italic> signaling assay, ectopically expressing Nord in the source cells led to reduced BMP ligand release and thus decreased the signaling activity (pMad/Mad) from an equal volume of conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). However, when the signaling activity was further normalized to the ligand amount (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), the relative ligand activity ([pMad/Mad]/BMPs) from the medium without Nord is lower than that with Nord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), suggesting that while ectopic Nord expressed in the source cells reduced the levels of released ligand, that soluble ligand appears to have a higher signaling activity perhaps as a result of an association with Nord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). To further assess whether Nord directly modulates the signaling activity of released BMP ligands in a dosage-dependent manner, we treated Mad-S2 cells with a recombinant Dpp peptide (rDpp) in the absence or presence of conditioned medium containing increasing amounts of Nord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Consistent with our <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses, <italic>in vitro</italic>, we also observed a dosage-dependent signaling profile of rDpp in the presence of increasing concentrations of Nord where the lowest tested level of Nord enhanced signaling while higher Nord levels reduced Dpp signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the highest level of Nord supplied from conditional medium failed to completely inhibit the free rDpp-induced BMP signaling. We next transiently transfected Mad-S2 cells for expression of Nord-GFP. Similar to Nord supplied from conditioned medium, we found that transient expression of Nord-GFP in the Mad-S2 cells partially inhibited the average Mad phosphorylation induced by exogenous rDpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Remarkably, immunofluorescent staining revealed that cells expressing Nord-GFP exhibited much lower pMad when compared to the surrounding Mad-S2 cells lacking Nord-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). In contrast, cells expressing GFP did not cause a noticeable reduction in pMad level in rDpp-treated Mad-S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). The much stronger cell-autonomous inhibition of Nord on BMP signaling is likely due to a much higher level of ectopic Nord when overexpressed in the Mad-S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Taken together, both our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays demonstrated that Nord not only can sequester BMP ligands, thereby impeding their release from the source cells, but may also directly modulate the activity of released BMP ligands in a dosage-dependent manner, where low levels promote and high doses attenuate BMP signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the short-range morphogen Hh and the long-range morphogen BMP function together to organize wing patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mullor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nellen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strigini and Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zecca et al., 1995</xref>). It has been previously shown that the Hh signal shapes the activity gradient of BMP by both inducing the expression of Dpp and simultaneously downregulating the Dpp receptor Tkv, resulting in lower responsiveness to Dpp in cells at the A/P compartment border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we showed that the activity of BMP is further fine-tuned by another previously unknown Hh-dependent mechanism. Using a genome-wide expression profiling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs, we identified <italic>nord</italic> as a novel target gene of the Hh signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Nord and its homolog NDNF belong to a family of secreted proteins that can exist in two distinct pools: diffusible Nord/NDNF proteins that can reach a longer distance and membrane/matrix-associated Nord/NDNF proteins spreading within a short distance from the source cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). During larval and early pupal wing development, Nord is expressed together or in close proximity with the BMP ligand Dpp along the A/P compartment boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Elimination of <italic>nord</italic> caused a reduction of overall wing size and resulted in ectopic PCV formation. Both of these phenotypes are attributable to alterations of BMP signaling activity as monitored by the level of Mad phosphorylation, yet in opposite directions: loss of <italic>nord</italic> led to decreased pMad in larval wing discs, whereas ectopic pMad surrounded the primordial PCV in <italic>nord</italic> mutant pupal wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Moreover, expressing exogenous Nord at different levels and during different developmental stages and contexts showed that Nord is a dosage-dependent modulator of BMP signaling both in wing growth and crossvein patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). At the molecular level, we further demonstrated that Nord is a BMP-binding protein that directly enhances or inhibits BMP signaling in cultured S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Combining the genetic and biochemical evidence, we propose that Nord mediates BMP signaling activity through binding of the BMP ligands Dpp and Dpp-Gbb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Depending on the levels of Nord proteins and the source/types of BMP ligands, Nord-mediated binding of Dpp and Dpp-Gbb may promote or repress BMP signaling activity. Additionally, the existence of two spatially distinct pools of diffusible and membrane/matrix-associated Nord proteins may introduce further complications in Nord-mediated BMP signaling regulation. In the wild-type wing discs, expressed in a subset of Dpp-secreting cells along the A/P boundary, Nord binds and enhances the local BMP signaling activity by augmenting ligand concentration near the Nord/Dpp-secreting cells. Meanwhile, Nord also impedes the mobilization of Dpp, especially the long-range BMP signaling mediator Dpp-Gbb heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Loss of <italic>nord</italic> simultaneously led to reduced local BMP and increased long-range BMP activities, and therefore gave rise to the seemingly opposite phenotypes of reduced wing size and ectopic PCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In contrast, low levels of ectopic Nord in the P compartment autonomously increased BMP signaling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), whereas high levels of Nord, either in the P compartment or throughout the wing pouch, inhibited BMP signaling activity likely through interfering with the normal BMP reception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D and E</xref>).

These modulator proteins vary broadly in structure, location, and mechanism of action. Well-known extracellular and freely diffusible proteins include Noggin, Tsg, Follistatin, the CR (cysteine-rich) domain containing proteins such as Chordin/Sog, and the Can family named after two founding members, Dan and Cerberus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang, 2016</xref>). With the exception of Tsg and Tsg/Sog or Tsg/Chordin complexes that in some cases can promote BMP signaling, all of these factors behave as antagonists, where BMP binding prevents association of the ligand with the receptor complex.</p><p>The other broad category of BMP-binding proteins includes membrane-bound or matrix-associated proteins and, in contrast to the highly diffusible class of BMP-binding factors, these proteins often act as either agonists or antagonists depending on context. These proteins are also structurally diverse, but to date, none contain FN3 or DUF2369 domains that are characteristic of Nord and NDNF, its vertebrate counterpart. From a mechanistic point of view, perhaps the two most instructive <italic>Drosophila</italic> members of this class of modulators are the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) Dally and the CR-containing protein Cv-2. HSPGs are well characterized as modulators of growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakato and Li, 2016</xref>). In the case of FGFs, HSPGs act as true co-receptors in which they form a tripartite complex with ligand and FGFR, the signaling receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DiGabriele et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlessinger et al., 2000</xref>). However, they can also mediate signaling in other ways. Analysis of <italic>dally</italic> loss-of-function clones in imaginal discs demonstrates that it has both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects with respect to BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujise et al., 2003</xref>). In general, low levels tend to promote signaling while high doses attenuate signaling. Many models have been put forth to explain these opposing effects and often come down to balancing ligand sequestration and diffusion properties. For instance, in the absence of HSPGs, Dpp may more freely diffuse away from the disc epithelial cell surface. In this case, HSPG acts to enhance signaling by keeping Dpp tethered to the cell surface where it can engage its signaling receptors. On the other hand, a high level of HSPG may compete with signaling receptors for BMP binding and thereby reduce signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nakato and Li, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The situation with respect to signal modulation becomes even more complex for factors such as Nord that bind both HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyama et al., 2021</xref>) and BMPs (this report). An instructive example to consider is Cv-2, a secreted factor that, like Nord, binds both to HSPGs and BMPs and is also induced by BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Serpe et al., 2008</xref>). Like Dally, Cv-2 also has dose-dependent effects on signaling in wing imaginal discs, where low levels enhance while high levels inhibit BMP signaling. By virtue of being bound to HSPGs, it may simply function as an additional tethering molecule that keeps BMPs localized near the cell surface. However, Cv-2 has the unique property that it is also able to bind Tkv, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMPR type I receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Serpe et al., 2008</xref>). This has led to speculation that it could act as an exchange factor that aids in handing off a BMP ligand from the HSPG pool to the type I receptor. Mathematical modeling showed that this mechanism can produce a biphasic signal depending on affinities of the various BMP-binding proteins involved and their concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Serpe et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the case of Nord, its mechanism of action is likely compatible with a variety of these and/or alternative models. While we have shown that Nord is a BMP-binding protein and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akiyama et al., 2021</xref> have shown that it also binds HSPGs, it is not clear whether the BMP and HSPG-binding sites overlap or are distinct and where they are positioned relative to the FN3 and DUF2369 domains. This is an important issue to consider with respect to the two CRISPR mutants that we generated that truncate Nord within the DUF2369 domain. Interestingly, the <italic>nord<sup>3D</sup></italic> allele appears to retain some function since it does not generate ectopic crossveins as do the <italic>nord<sup>MI06414</sup></italic> or <italic>nord<sup>22A</sup></italic> alleles, yet <italic>nord<sup>3D</sup></italic> still produces small wings in transheterozygous combination with a deficiency or <italic>nord<sup>22A</sup></italic>, consistent with having lost the BMP growth-promoting ability. The discrepancy in crossvein patterning between the different <italic>nord</italic> alleles may be explained by a difference in residual function of the various truncated Nord protein products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because the <italic>nord<sup>MI06414</sup></italic> allele yields a much shorter predicted Nord peptide compared to the two CRISPR alleles, it is likely to behave as a protein null with a stronger phenotype. The two <italic>nord</italic> CRISPR alleles, although similar in the sequence deleted from the C-terminus, differ in how many non-<italic>nord</italic> encoded amino acids occur between the frameshift and the stop codon. The <italic>nord<sup>22A</sup></italic> allele has additional 14 amino acids relative to <italic>nord<sup>3D</sup></italic>. Perhaps this extension of the truncated fragment destabilizes or interferes with residual function found in the <italic>nord<sup>3D</sup></italic> allele. Additional biochemical studies defining the BMP and HSPG-binding sites, the stability of truncated Nord fragments, and whether Nord can also associate with either the type I or II receptors will aid in formulating a more precise mechanistic model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is Nord structure and function conserved across species?</title><p>Nord shows some sequence similarity to the NDNF family of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Based on a very recent study, like many other neurotrophic factors, NDNF arose in the ancestor of bilaterians or even later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heger et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement, by analyzing the genome and EST sequences from various organisms, we found that nearly all bilaterian animals have either single or multiple orthologous genes for Nord/Ndnf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

All vertebrate family members contain a signal peptide, two FN3-like repeats, and a domain of unknown function (DUF2369) that is now referred to as the NDNF domain. The NDNF domain partially overlaps with the first FN3 but shows some additional conservation that extends between the two FN3 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Studies using cultured mouse hippocampal neurons revealed that it promotes neuron migration and neurite outgrowth, hence its name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kuang et al., 2010</xref>). In later studies, NDNF was also found to be upregulated in mouse endothelial cells in response to hindlimb ischemia, where it promotes endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte survival through integrin-mediated activation of AKT/endothelial NOS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ohashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Joki et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, recent studies have shown that NDNF expression is significantly downregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), indicating that NDNF may also provide a beneficial function as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Xia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these studies have suggested some possible functions for vertebrate NDNF. However, they have primarily relied on <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture models, and only recently have <italic>in vivo</italic> loss-of-function studies been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Messina et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, NDNF mutants were discovered in the genomes of several probands with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by absence of puberty, infertility, and anosmia (loss of smell) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boehm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lima Amato et al., 2017</xref>). This phenotype is very similar to that produced by loss of the <italic>anos1,</italic> which also encodes an FN3 superfamily member and is responsible for Kallmann syndrome, a condition that similarly presents with CHH and anosmia due to lack of proper GnRH and olfactory neuron migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stamou and Georgopoulos, 2018</xref>). Although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicated that NDNF modulates FGFR1 signaling after FGF8 stimulation, the <italic>in vivo</italic> molecular mechanism responsible for the neuronal migration defects is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Messina et al., 2020</xref>). The results of our study on the function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nord raise the issue of whether any of the ascribed vertebrate NDNF functions could involve alterations in BMP signaling. In the case of angiogenesis and EMT, BMPs, as well as other TGF-β family members, participate at many levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goumans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kahata et al., 2018</xref>). At present, however, no involvement of BMP or TGF-β signaling has been implicated in migration of the GnRH neurons, although BMP signaling does define neurogenic permissive areas in which the olfactory placode forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Forni and Wray, 2015</xref>). A clear objective for the future is to determine if the vertebrate NDNF factors bind BMPs and/or HSPG proteins such as Dally-like glypicans to modulate BMP signaling activity. On the <italic>Drosophila</italic> side, additional non-BMP-modulating roles for Nord should also be examined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The raw microarray data were deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus public repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE180120;">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE180120;</ext-link> Gene Expression Omnibus series no. GSE180120). In our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Willsey et al., 2016</xref>), we focused on two datasets and searched for genes differentially expressed in the A/P boundary adjacent cells (B: <italic>ptc+</italic>) and P cells (P: <italic>hh+</italic>). Here, we modified the gene expression analysis method by including the third dataset from A cells (<italic>hh-</italic>) and additional transcriptome comparisons between the A/P boundary adjacent B cells (<italic>ptc+</italic>) and A cells (<italic>hh-</italic>), and between A cells (<italic>hh-</italic>) and P cells (<italic>hh+</italic>).</p><p>Briefly, all analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2.

The <italic>Drosophila</italic> 2.0 CDF environment was utilized. Probe-level data from the CEL files were imported using the function <italic>ReadAffy</italic> and converted to expression values using <italic>rma</italic> with default settings. This method implemented the multi-array average (RMA) for background correction followed by quantile normalization. Expression values were log<sub>2</sub> transformed. Probe sets were mapped to genes using the <italic>Drosophila</italic>_2.na30.annot.xml annotation file, available from the Affymetrix website. 14,448 of 18,952 (76.2%) probe sets map to gene isoforms—13,016 (90.1%) of which correspond to unique genes (some genes are mapped by ≥1 probe set). Probe sets mapping to the same gene were not combined to minimize technical artifacts. Genes (probe sets) whose expression is not only higher in A cells than P cells (<italic>Fold<sub>A/P</sub> &gt;</italic> 1.2), but also higher in the A/P boundary adjacent cells than general A cells (<italic>Fold<sub>B/A</sub> &gt;</italic> 1.5), were selected as potential Hh-induced target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A total of 61 probe sets (59 unique genes) were identified as potential Hh signaling target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Larvae from the control and corresponding experimental group were raised at the same temperature and density. Wing discs were dissected, fixed, immunostained, and mounted by following the same protocol. All images were taken using the same confocal microscope settings. The pixel intensities of pMad, Dpp, or Ptc were obtained within a fixed rectangular region across both ventral and dorsal compartments using the Plot Proﬁle function of Fiji.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;The NDNF-like factor Nord is a Hedgehog-induced BMP modulator that regulates <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing patterning and growth&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers felt that many experiments would be needed to better characterize the nord mutant phenotype, particularly its role in BMP signaling. They wanted the authors to:</p><p>1. Measure Dpp levels in nord mutants. This could be accomplished using the anti-pro-Dpp, or enhancer traps that are more accurate than BS3.0 (which not only lack the shortvein enhancers but is overly sensitive to anterior en).</p><p>2. Measure Ptc levels in nord mutants.</p><p>3. Show a cell autonomous effect of Hh signal reception on Nord expression.</p><p>4. Examine pMad at earlier stages of PCV development (20 hr AP) before EGFR and Notch signaling are active in this region.</p><p>5. Test whether the posterior defects they see are caused by loss of anterior Nord, or whether they might be caused by loss of low-level Nord expression in the posterior. In other words, what is the result when Nord is depleted from anterior or from posterior cells. Additionally, the authors should determine how far secreted Nord can spread in the disc.</p><p>7. Test how much of the PCV loss in en&gt;Nord is caused by loss of the adjacent L5.</p><p>8. Add missing controls such as a nub-Gal4/+ 29°C control wing and a control disc stained with anti-GFP.</p><p>9. improve quantification for pMad analysis, particularly in Figure 4E, 4F and 6.</p><p>The reviewers also suggested extensive editorial changes that would make the manuscript easier for the reader to follow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors used cell sorting and genome-wide expression profiling to identify new Hedgehog (Hh) target genes in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc, which has been a powerful system to study Hh signaling. They identify nord, which encodes a secreted factor that associates with cell membranes and the extracellular matrix. Null mutants of nord are adult viable. Paradoxically, these animals have slightly smaller wings and ectopic posterior cross vein (PCV) material. Both phenotypes can be caused by alterations in BMP signaling. They demonstrate that recombinant Nord binds to Dpp and Gbb and restricts their release from cells and diffusion in the media. They use the Gal4/UAS mis-expression to test the model that Nord has both positive and negative effects on BMP signaling depending on where and when Nord is expressed.</p><p>The strengths of this paper are the appropriate use of techniques such as cell sorting, transcriptomics, <italic>Drosophila</italic> loss of function genetics, cell culture. These approaches support their model that Nord regulates availability of Dpp, Gbb and/or Dpp-Gbb dimers. However, the use of mis-expression of wild-type Nord in the pouch or posterior compartment lead similar phenotypes as global nord loss-of-function. This is a weakness because it is difficult for the reader to reconcile logically these paradoxical results. This work may impact the mammalian fields because Nord is conserved through evolution, but Nord homologues have not been implicated in BMP signaling.</p><p>a) While I appreciate that they authors have done a lot of work and the data are of high quality, I don't follow the reasoning of how similarity in loss- and gain-of-function nord phenotypes supports their model (or Nord having both positive and negative effects on BMP signaling depending on where and when Nord is expressed). Could the authors use available Gbb and Dpp antibodies to determine the expression patterns of these proteins in nord LOF and GOF?</p><p>Related to this, the authors do not control for the number of UAS transgenes in Figure 7. If you want to compare 3X UAS-Nord to 1X UAS-Nord, the 1X UAS-Nord sample should have 2X UAS-LacZ, GFP or another neutral protein. Being able to prove that they have not titrated Gal4 is critical to their model about low vs high Nord. These experiments should be performed again with all animals have the same number of UAS transgenes.</p><p>b) The authors do not provide a description of micro-array analysis.

Nord shares sequence similarity with a family of secreted proteins containing a domain of unknown function (DUF2369) and one or two fibronectin type II-like repeats which contains the neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) which has been shown to promote neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth in vertebrates, such as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone producing neurons critical in the regulation of puberty and reproduction. The authors explored the function of nord in wing development. Hh is known to be secreted from cells in the posterior compartment of the wing disc and act on cells across the A/P boundary where an adjacent stripe of anterior cells express the Hh receptor ptc. Interestingly, nord is expressed in a subset of these 'stripe' cells consistent with it being a Hh-target. The dpp gene is a well known Hh-target expressed throughout the 'stripe' like ptc. dpp encodes a BMP2/4 ligand which is known, with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMP5/6/7 ligand, Gbb, to play multiple roles in wing growth and patterning. Wu et al. find while flies homozygous for LOF mutations in nord are viable and fertile, their wings are slightly smaller and they contain ectopic vein material at the posterior cross vein (PCV). A reduction in BMP signaling results in smaller wings but an increase in BMP signaling is associated with PCV spurs. Based on these phenotypes, Wu et al. investigate the potential relationship between nord function and BMP signaling. BMP signaling in the larva and its roles in growth and patterning and its later roles in the pupal wing disc in laying down vein material are temporally separable events. Furthermore, both the Blair and O'Connor labs have nicely delineated a mechanistic explanation for BMP involvement in the formation of the PCV. How nord is involved in each of these processes is not completely clear, especially given nord's expression pattern. Must the spatial and temporal requirements for BMPs in these processes be re-evaluated?</p><p>Is there a connection between how NDNF influences the migration neurons and its extracellular role in modulating molecules such as BMPs? Does it provide a link with extracellular matrix and other extracellular molecules that also appear to be modulators of BMP activity? Could Nord impact BMP output by influencing wing disc cellular projections?</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– Identification of a Hh-target gene that appears to modify BMP signaling output.</p><p>– Ectopic vein material near the posterior cross vein (PCV) is attributed to loss of nord.</p><p>– A loss of function nord mutants exhibit a reduction in wing size.</p><p>– Nord-GFP is shown to bind to Dpp, and less so to Gbb, by co-immunoprecipitations in S2 cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– The manuscript would benefit from stating at the start that the researcher's findings suggest that nord may both facilitate and antagonize BMP signaling. It will be easier for the reader to follow.</p><p>– Better clarification of the different functions for BMP signaling in wing growth, patterning, and development in the larval versus pupal period would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>– The authors can then follow up on these points as to how nord impacts these different functions</p><p>– For the most part nord is not expressed in either wing pouch cells or vein primordia. Furthermore, based on expression in cell culture, Nord is not found far from the source cell.

In some places in the manuscript this information is robust but in other places it is lacking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The study focuses on a possible role for the secreted Nord protein in BMP signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors demonstrate Nord binding to Dpp and Gbb <italic>in vitro</italic>, and suggest that this explains the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes observed. The <italic>in vitro</italic> work is quite suggestive, but some caution may be in order as other other extracellular molecules can affect multiple pathways, and some of these other pathways can have have similar effects on growth and vein formation. While this is a worthwhile publication with strong <italic>in vitro</italic> data, I have a few points below that I think would strengthen the <italic>in vivo</italic> data.</p><p>1) Nord as a Hh target- The expression of Nord in the imaginal and pupal wing tissues largely mirrors that of Hh targets, being heightened anterior to the anterior-posterior compartments boundary. Its expression is however excluded from the distal wing blade, something that the authors do not further investigate. The authors can widen or narrow Nord expression by widening or reducing Hh signaling, but this will also widen BMP expression and signaling, so it would have been helpful to have one experiment showing a cell autonomous effect of Hh signal reception on Nord expression.</p><p>2) Nord mutants- The authors generate and examine Nord mutants. The effects in the wing are fairly mild, consisting of very slight undergrowth mirrored by slightly reduced BMP signaling (pMad) in the disc, and a few ectopic veins, suggestive of gains in BMP signaling. The only other growth-inducing pathways the authors examine are Hh, looking at a single target, Ptc. They do not however quantify Ptc staining in the same way they did to detect the weak effects on pMad, nor do they look at other Hh targets with different sensitivities.</p><p>The ectopic veins in mutants are consistent with defects seen with mild increases in BMP signaling, but there are many other ways of inducing similar ectopic venation, especially through EGF gains or reductions in Notch or its ligands. The authors concentrate almost exclusively on one defect, a vein extension distal to the PCV. This is a common defect seen in many mutant fly stocks as it is something of a “hot-spot” for ectopic venation. The authors show that pMad is high in this ectopic vein, but do this staining at 26hr AP, a fairly late stage of PCV development. By this time LVs and cells near the ACV have all been expressing dpp for some time and have BMP signaling, while dpp expression in the PCV is initiating. I would wager this ectopic vein is expressing dpp, and will also have rhomboid and thus EGFR activity and high Δ and Serrate. The authors could greatly strengthen their case by examining pMad at earlier stages of PCV development (20 hr AP) before EGFR and Notch signaling are active in this region.</p><p>The authors also do not test whether the posterior defects they see are caused by loss of anterior Nord, or whether they might be caused by loss of low-level Nord expression in the posterior. Since they have a Nord-RNAi line, what happens with anterior knockdown? Posterior?</p><p>3) Nord overexpression and biphasic effects on BMP signaling – Increased Nord expression causes undergrowth and reduced pMad but ectopic venation. In that sense, Nord has biphasic effects, with similar mixed effects (both BMP losses and gains) caused by either too much or too little Nord. The authors extend this by showing that further increases in Nord overexpression change the ectopic PCV extension into PCV loss, the latter often caused by loss of BMP signaling. However, this loss may not always be due to a direct effect on the PCV. While the nub-gal4 example looks ok, the en-gal4 example has lost L5 adjacent to the PCV, likely due to loss of the distal L5 primordium at the disc stages (Ray and Wharton, Bangi and Wharton). That will in turn block or reduce dpp expression in L5 and thus Dpp’s availability for signaling in the early PCV.</p><p>4) <italic>In vitro</italic> studies- These provide the strongest proof that Nord can affect BMP signaling, although in this case the observed effects are all inhibitory. Secreted Nord can co-IP with secreted Gbb or Dpp, and co-expression with Nord reduces Gbb or Dpp secretion and thus its ability to signal. Nord can also reduce the BMP signaling induced by addition of exogenous Dpp. The only shortcoming here is that the authors have not apparently tested binding to any of the extracellular modulators of BMP signaling.</p><p>I need to see whether there is ectopic pMad in the nord mutant PCV at a stage before dpp, rhomboid and Δ/Serrate expression in the region. Otherwise I am not convinced that the ectopic vein is initiated by ectopic BMP signaling.</p><p>Quantify Ptc or some other Hh marker (Dpp would be especially helpful) in Nord mutants.</p><p>How much of the PCV loss in en&gt;Nord might be caused by loss of the adjacent L5?</p><p>Cell-autonomous effects of Hh signaling on Nord expression would be helpful, as would the effects of anterior vs. posterior Nord RNAi.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article “The NDNF-like factor Nord is a Hedgehog-induced extracellular BMP modulator that regulates <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing patterning and growth” for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Overall, the manuscript is much improved. However, I have concerns about the conclusions regarding Figure 8, the <italic>in vitro</italic> work, which the authors use conclude that Nord <italic>in vitro</italic> also has biphasic function on BMPs <italic>in vitro</italic>. The authors present results from a single experiment and then normalize these single data points to draw conclusions about Nord function <italic>in vitro</italic>. Specifically, the authors’ new analyses in Figure 8 panels D,E,G show relative pMad levels normalized to Mad (8D,8G) and to Mad and BMP (8E). My concerns are as follows. First, the authors need statistical analyses. Second, BMP released from cells appear to be equally active in the absence (M4) or presence (ME) of Nord, and these data only become supportive of their argument when “normalized” to the amount of ligand. Third, there are additional bands consistent with other Dpp/Gbb isoform in the source blot for Figure 8A. These may be bioactive molecules but are not accounted for in the manuscript. The pMad bands in M4 and M5 also appear to be saturated, again making it difficult to determine differences between the lanes. In panel C, the WB: Flag row is &quot;smiling&quot; with some lanes compacted and others not, again making it difficult to normalize. Without more replicates, the authors statement that “soluble ligand appears to have a higher signaling activity perhaps as a result of an association with Nord” (p.21) is not sufficiently supported by the data. This same issue holds for panel F, with only one replicate. In its current form, the data are not conclusive and other interpretations are also possible. The authors should soften their conclusions about their <italic>in vitro</italic> work in the results and discussion.

I do however have some points I would like the authors to seriously consider. (1) and (2) concern data that are problematic, but could be removed from the manuscript without damaging its conclusions.</p><p>1) Hh signaling and Nord expression- The autonomous gains in Nord expression caused by Smo overexpression are convincing. The loss caused by Ptc overexpression, shown for a single flpout clone Figure 3D, is not. To be a valid result, the dotted blue line drawn by the authors must accurately follow the A/P. However, outside the Ptc clone at the bottom of the figure, the dotted line does not at all correspond to the line shown by Nord expression, even though the Nord outside the clone should define the A/P. Nor does the line correspond to the A/P defined by Ci staining. Instead, the true A/P boundary is further left, and thus it is not at all clear that the Ptc clone is in the anterior compartment. If the authors want to keep Ptc flpout data in the manuscript, they need a more convincing example.</p><p>2) MS1096-gal4- The authors use MS1096 for some of the nord-RNAi data. This is a Gal4 enhancer trap insertion into the X-linked Bx (dLMO) locus, and in hemizygous males has a mild Bx wing mutant phenotype with variable penetrance that includes disruption of the crossveins (see Figure 6 in Milan, Diaz-Benjumea, and Cohen 1998). The crossvein phenotype tends to disappear in stocks, but often reappears when outcrossing to other lines. It is therefore not an appropriate driver to use when assessing crossvein phenotypes in males. If the authors want to use it, they have to explain how they dealt with the crossvein phenotypes that can be caused by MS1096 on its own.</p><p>And while MS1096 is expressed in the wing disc, it is not clear that MS1096 is “wing-specific” as the authors state. Bx (dLMO) is expressed in many tissues, including the CNS. If MS1096 follows the expression of Bx, the authors cannot say that this experiment “further validates that the observed phenotypes in the nord mutants are not indirect effects associated with loss-of-nord in tissues other than the wing discs.”</p><p>3) Is Nord in the posterior compartment? The authors make several absolute statements about the absence of Nord expression from the posterior of the developing wing, but do not provide any staining of controls that would allow one to distinguish signal from background. While Nord is certainly much higher anterior to the A/P boundary, the data does not rule out low-level Nord expression in the posterior. The authors have addressed this in their revision, not by changing any of their absolute statements about expression, but by added a new experiment showing that “we did not notice any ectopic PCV in the adult flies when UAS-nord-RNAi was selectively expressed in the P compartment of the larval and pupal wing via the hh-Gal4 driver.” But this negative result could simply reflect stronger RNAi expression with MS1096-gal4 or A9-gal4. It would be preferable if they had tested the effects of nord-RNAi when it was limited to the anterior compartment, something that their model predicts should affect the posterior crossvein. This could easily be done with ptc-gal4 or ci-gal4.</p><p>The authors also model the action of Nord as if it only diffuses over a short distance, and thus is only affecting BMP movement from neighboring cells, such as those”in L4 in pupal wings, and is never present in the PCV. However, the extracellular staining of Nord-GFP in Figure 3 looks substantially above background throughout the wing disc.</p><p>4) Biphasic or multiphasic effects- The authors have added new data that clarify some of the effects of Nord in the PCV, but complicate their story about biphasic effects. In growth Nord appears truly biphasic, promoting growth only at normal levels, and inhibiting growth and BMP signaling with either decreased or increased Nord expression. But in PCV formation things are more complex. Both loss of endogenous Nord and mild gains induce ectopic PCV phenotypes. Since normal levels do not alter the PCV, that also fits with a biphasic effect, albeit the opposite of the growth effect (ectopic signaling with both losses and mild gains). Overexpression also has a biphasic effect, as strong Nord gains do the opposite of weak gains and cause loss of the PCV and signaling. However, if one puts all of this together, the PCV effect is more multiphasic than biphasic, because of the normal signaling observed at wild type. Nord loss increases signaling, wild type is normal, mild Nord overexpression increases, strong Nord decreases.</p><p>The only detailed explanation of these effects is in the legend of Figure 9, which is not very complete and leaves some puzzles. If loss of Nord increases long-range BMP diffusion into the PCV, why isn’t the same thing happening in a third instar wing pouch? And there are ideas hidden in the figure itself that are not explained in the legend or the Discussion, especially the switch from BMP presentation to BMP sequestration with a change from low local to high local Nord concentrations. A fuller discussion in the text would be helpful.</p><p>5) Biphasic <italic>in vitro</italic>- The <italic>in vitro</italic> work remains strong, especially for Nord’s inhibitory effects on BMP signaling. But the only evidence for a positive and thus biphasic effect of adding Nord relies on a single lane in a single gel: the lowest Nord concentration in Figure 8F, then quantified in 8G. It would be helpful if the authors could state how many times they have repeated this result.</p><p>6) Given the long discussion of NDNF, the authors should mention the mechanisms that have been proposed for NDNF activity: by binding integrins, or by modulation of FGF signaling by binding HSPGs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73357.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

When quantifying the distance between distal ends of longitudinal veins L3 and L4 (dL3-L4) and that of L2 and L5 (dL2-L5), we found no specific reduction in the L3-L4 region indicated by comparable or higher dL3-L4 /dL2-L5 ratio in the female and male nord mutant wings (Figure 4B, C), which is consistent with the obviously reduced BMP, but not Hh, signaling activity during wing imaginal disc development (Figure 5B, C).

They identify nord, which encodes a secreted factor that associates with cell membranes and the extracellular matrix. Null mutants of nord are adult viable. Paradoxically, these animals have slightly smaller wings and ectopic posterior cross vein (PCV) material. Both phenotypes can be caused by alterations in BMP signaling. They demonstrate that recombinant Nord binds to Dpp and Gbb and restricts their release from cells and diffusion in the media. They use the Gal4/UAS mis-expression to test the model that Nord has both positive and negative effects on BMP signaling depending on where and when Nord is expressed.</p><p>The strengths of this paper are the appropriate use of techniques such as cell sorting, transcriptomics, <italic>Drosophila</italic> loss of function genetics, cell culture. These approaches support their model that Nord regulates availability of Dpp, Gbb and/or Dpp-Gbb dimers. However, the use of mis-expression of wild-type Nord in the pouch or posterior compartment lead similar phenotypes as global nord loss-of-function. This is a weakness because it is difficult for the reader to reconcile logically these paradoxical results. This work may impact the mammalian fields because Nord is conserved through evolution, but Nord homologues have not been implicated in BMP signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for the time and effort invested in reviewing our manuscript, as well as the instructive comments.

Could the authors use available Gbb and Dpp antibodies to determine the expression patterns of these proteins in nord LOF and GOF?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional experimental results to support the model that Nord is a dosage depend biphasic BMP modulator, where low levels of Nord promote, and high levels inhibit BMP signaling. The biphasic feature of Nord was observed both in the larval wing discs during wing growth and in the pupal wing in the process of PCV patterning. Additionally, we show the biphasic activity of Nord on BMP signaling in cultured S2 cells.

Nord shares sequence similarity with a family of secreted proteins containing a domain of unknown function (DUF2369) and one or two fibronectin type II-like repeats which contains the neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (NDNF) which has been shown to promote neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth in vertebrates, such as the gonadotropin-releasing hormone producing neurons critical in the regulation of puberty and reproduction. The authors explored the function of nord in wing development. Hh is known to be secreted from cells in the posterior compartment of the wing disc and act on cells across the A/P boundary where an adjacent stripe of anterior cells express the Hh receptor ptc. Interestingly, nord is expressed in a subset of these 'stripe' cells consistent with it being a Hh-target. The dpp gene is a well known Hh-target expressed throughout the 'stripe' like ptc. dpp encodes a BMP2/4 ligand which is known, with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BMP5/6/7 ligand, Gbb, to play multiple roles in wing growth and patterning. Wu et al. find while flies homozygous for LOF mutations in nord are viable and fertile, their wings are slightly smaller and they contain ectopic vein material at the posterior cross vein (PCV). A reduction in BMP signaling results in smaller wings but an increase in BMP signaling is associated with PCV spurs. Based on these phenotypes, Wu et al. investigate the potential relationship between nord function and BMP signaling. BMP signaling in the larva and its roles in growth and patterning and its later roles in the pupal wing disc in laying down vein material are temporally separable events. Furthermore, both the Blair and O'Connor labs have nicely delineated a mechanistic explanation for BMP involvement in the formation of the PCV. How nord is involved in each of these processes is not completely clear, especially given nord's expression pattern. Must the spatial and temporal requirements for BMPs in these processes be re-evaluated?</p><p>Is there a connection between how NDNF influences the migration neurons and its extracellular role in modulating molecules such as BMPs? Does it provide a link with extracellular matrix and other extracellular molecules that also appear to be modulators of BMP activity? Could Nord impact BMP output by influencing wing disc cellular projections?</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– Identification of a Hh-target gene that appears to modify BMP signaling output.</p><p>– Ectopic vein material near the posterior cross vein (PCV) is attributed to loss of nord.</p><p>– A loss of function nord mutants exhibit a reduction in wing size.</p><p>– Nord-GFP is shown to bind to Dpp, and less so to Gbb, by co-immunoprecipitations in S2 cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– The manuscript would benefit from stating at the start that the researcher's findings suggest that nord may both facilitate and antagonize BMP signaling. It will be easier for the reader to follow.</p><p>– Better clarification of the different functions for BMP signaling in wing growth, patterning, and development in the larval versus pupal period would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>– The authors can then follow up on these points as to how nord impacts these different functions</p><p>– For the most part nord is not expressed in either wing pouch cells or vein primordia. Furthermore, based on expression in cell culture, Nord is not found far from the source cell. How is Nord though to influence pMad, for example, in cells in the anterior wing pouch?</p><p>– It is import to reconcile the findings of others that the pMad gradient is not required for wing disc growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for the very detailed and constructive comments towards improving the quality and presentation of our manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have provided additional experimental evidence, with better spatial (Figure 5, compared to original Figure 4) and temporal (Figure 7 compared to original Figure 7) resolution, to support our model that Nord can both facilitate and antagonize BMP signaling in a dosage-dependent manner.

This is because Nord is associated with the matrix, and does not spread too far from the producing cells (Figure 3D, Figure 7D). Also, we detected much less Dpp/Dpp-Gbb ligands in the medium when Nord is co-expressed (Figure 8B). We propose that in the absence of endogenous Nord (low level), Dpp spreading will increase, which in turn lead to the reduced medial BMP signaling and associated with decreased wing growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead of facilitating movement, could Nord prevent Dpp-Gbb turnover, thus in its absence Dpp-Gbb is less stable and a drop in signaling (pMad) is observed.

The authors demonstrate Nord binding to Dpp and Gbb <italic>in vitro</italic>, and suggest that this explains the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes observed. The <italic>in vitro</italic> work is quite suggestive, but some caution may be in order as other other extracellular molecules can affect multiple pathways, and some of these other pathways can have have similar effects on growth and vein formation. While this is a worthwhile publication with strong <italic>in vitro</italic> data, I have a few points below that I think would strengthen the <italic>in vivo</italic> data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the instructive comments and suggestions. As suggested, we have performed additional experiments and analysis to strengthen the <italic>in vivo</italic> data and clarify the model of how Nord functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Nord as a Hh target- The expression of Nord in the imaginal and pupal wing tissues largely mirrors that of Hh targets, being heightened anterior to the anterior-posterior compartments boundary. Its expression is however excluded from the distal wing blade, something that the authors do not further investigate. The authors can widen or narrow Nord expression by widening or reducing Hh signaling, but this will also widen BMP expression and signaling, so it would have been helpful to have one experiment showing a cell autonomous effect of Hh signal reception on Nord expression.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested experiment was performed and included in Figure 2C-H in the revised</p><p>manuscript. Briefly, we found that Nord expression is cell-autonomously induced/inhibited by Hh signaling within the anterior compartment in the wing discs’ hinge and outer wing pouch region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Nord mutants- The authors generate and examine Nord mutants. The effects in the wing are fairly mild, consisting of very slight undergrowth mirrored by slightly reduced BMP signaling (pMad) in the disc, and a few ectopic veins, suggestive of gains in BMP signaling. The only other growth-inducing pathways the authors examine are Hh, looking at a single target, Ptc. They do not however quantify Ptc staining in the same way they did to detect the weak effects on pMad, nor do they look at other Hh targets with different sensitivities.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we measured the Ptc staining profile and examined the expression of a low-threshold Hh signaling target gene <italic>dpp</italic> (anti-Dpp Prodomain) in the <italic>nord</italic> mutant wing discs. No noticeable change of the Ptc or Dpp (anti-Dpp prodomain) expression levels were detected in the <italic>nord</italic> mutant wing discs. These data are presented in Figure 5 and Figure 5-figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, we measured the distance between distal ends of longitudinal veins L3 and L4 (dL3-L4) and that of L2 and L5 (dL2-L5), we found no specific reduction in the L3-L4 region indicated by comparable or higher dL3-L4 /dL2-L5 ratio in the female and male <italic>nord</italic> mutant wings (Figure 4B, C), which is consistent with the obviously reduced BMP, but not Hh, signaling activity during wing imaginal disc development (Figure 5B, C). Together, these findings suggested a positive role of endogenous Nord in augmenting BMP signaling activity to promote wing growth. See Page 14-15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ectopic veins in mutants are consistent with defects seen with mild increases in BMP signaling, but there are many other ways of inducing similar ectopic venation, especially through EGF gains or reductions in Notch or its ligands. The authors concentrate almost exclusively on one defect, a vein extension distal to the PCV. This is a common defect seen in many mutant fly stocks as it is something of a &quot;hot-spot&quot; for ectopic venation. The authors show that pMad is high in this ectopic vein, but do this staining at 26hr AP, a fairly late stage of PCV development. By this time LVs and cells near the ACV have all been expressing dpp for some time and have BMP signaling, while dpp expression in the PCV is initiating. I would wager this ectopic vein is expressing dpp, and will also have rhomboid and thus EGFR activity and high Δ and Serrate. The authors could greatly strengthen their case by examining pMad at earlier stages of PCV development (20 hr AP) before EGFR and Notch signaling are active in this region.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested experiment was performed and included in Figure 5D-E in the revised manuscript. Expansion of pMad range around the primordial PCV was noticed in the <italic>nord</italic> mutants starting from 19-20 hr AP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also do not test whether the posterior defects they see are caused by loss of anterior Nord, or whether they might be caused by loss of low-level Nord expression in the posterior. Since they have a Nord-RNAi line, what happens with anterior knockdown? Posterior?</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings show that <italic>nord</italic>, like <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>dpp,</italic> is a target gene of the Hh signaling pathway and not expressed in the posterior compartment of the wing discs (Figures 1, 2; Figure 2-figure supplement 3). Consistently, when we knocked down <italic>nord</italic> in the posterior compartment using <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>, we did not observe the ectopic PCV phenotype, which is frequently caused by knocking down <italic>nord</italic> throughout the wing discs via <italic>MS1096-Gal4</italic> or <italic>A9-Gal4</italic>. These data are presented in Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Nord overexpression and biphasic effects on BMP signaling – Increased Nord expression causes undergrowth and reduced pMad but ectopic venation. In that sense, Nord has biphasic effects, with similar mixed effects (both BMP losses and gains) caused by either too much or too little Nord. The authors extend this by showing that further increases in Nord overexpression change the ectopic PCV extension into PCV loss, the latter often caused by loss of BMP signaling. However, this loss may not always be due to a direct effect on the PCV. While the nub-gal4 example looks ok, the en-gal4 example has lost L5 adjacent to the PCV, likely due to loss of the distal L5 primordium at the disc stages (Ray and Wharton, Bangi and Wharton). That will in turn block or reduce dpp expression in L5 and thus Dpp's availability for signaling in the early PCV.</p></disp-quote><p>High levels of ectopic Nord driven by <italic>nub-Gal4</italic>, <italic>en-Gal4</italic> or <italic>hh-Gal4</italic> in the larval stage can sequester BMP ligands and inhibit BMP signaling, thus leading to loss of L5 (Figure 6; original Figure 7).

The temporal control of <italic>en-Gal4/hh-Gal4&gt;UAS-Nord</italic> was achieved by adding the <italic>tub-Gal80ts</italic> allele.

Nord can also reduce the BMP signaling induced by addition of exogenous Dpp. The only shortcoming here is that the authors have not apparently tested binding to any of the extracellular modulators of BMP signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Interaction of Nord and the BMP binding protein Dally was presented in a manuscript co-submitting with ours.

Overall, the manuscript is much improved. However, I have concerns about the conclusions regarding Figure 8, the <italic>in vitro</italic> work, which the authors use conclude that Nord <italic>in vitro</italic> also has biphasic function on BMPs <italic>in vitro</italic>. The authors present results from a single experiment and then normalize these single data points to draw conclusions about Nord function <italic>in vitro</italic>. Specifically, the authors' new analyses in Figure 8 panels D,E,G show relative pMad levels normalized to Mad (8D,8G) and to Mad and BMP (8E). My concerns are as follows. First, the authors need statistical analyses. Second, BMP released from cells appear to be equally active in the absence (M4) or presence (ME) of Nord, and these data only become supportive of their argument when &quot;normalized&quot; to the amount of ligand. Third, there are additional bands consistent with other Dpp/Gbb isoform in the source blot for Figure 8A. These may be bioactive molecules but are not accounted for in the manuscript. The pMad bands in M4 and M5 also appear to be saturated, again making it difficult to determine differences between the lanes. In panel C, the WB: Flag row is &quot;smiling&quot; with some lanes compacted and others not, again making it difficult to normalize. Without more replicates, the authors statement that &quot;soluble ligand appears to have a higher signaling activity perhaps as a result of an association with Nord&quot; (p.21) is not sufficiently supported by the data. This same issue holds for panel F, with only one replicate. In its current form, the data are not conclusive and other interpretations are also possible. The authors should soften their conclusions about their <italic>in vitro</italic> work in the results and discussion. Additionally, they need add a statement to the effect that without additional replicates in Figure 8 other conclusions are possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank the reviewer for carefully reviewing our manuscript.

However, outside the Ptc clone at the bottom of the figure, the dotted line does not at all correspond to the line shown by Nord expression, even though the Nord outside the clone should define the A/P. Nor does the line correspond to the A/P defined by Ci staining. Instead, the true A/P boundary is further left, and thus it is not at all clear that the Ptc clone is in the anterior compartment. If the authors want to keep Ptc flpout data in the manuscript, they need a more convincing example.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concern and have removed the related data from Figure 4 and Figure 5—figure supplementary 3. We also removed related text, including the statement &quot;further validates that the observed phenotypes in the nord mutants are not indirect effects associated with loss-of-nord in tissues other than the wing discs&quot; from Page 13 and 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) MS1096-gal4- The authors use MS1096 for some of the nord-RNAi data. This is a Gal4 enhancer trap insertion into the X-linked Bx (dLMO) locus, and in hemizygous males has a mild Bx wing mutant phenotype with variable penetrance that includes disruption of the crossveins (see Figure 6 in Milan, Diaz-Benjumea, and Cohen 1998). The crossvein phenotype tends to disappear in stocks, but often reappears when outcrossing to other lines. It is therefore not an appropriate driver to use when assessing crossvein phenotypes in males. If the authors want to use it, they have to explain how they dealt with the crossvein phenotypes that can be caused by MS1096 on its own.</p><p>And while MS1096 is expressed in the wing disc, it is not clear that MS1096 is &quot;wing-specific&quot; as the authors state. Bx (dLMO) is expressed in many tissues, including the CNS. If MS1096 follows the expression of Bx, the authors cannot say that this experiment &quot;further validates that the observed phenotypes in the nord mutants are not indirect effects associated with loss-of-nord in tissues other than the wing discs.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concern and have removed the related data from Figure 4 and Figure 5—figure supplementary 3.

The authors make several absolute statements about the absence of Nord expression from the posterior of the developing wing, but do not provide any staining of controls that would allow one to distinguish signal from background. While Nord is certainly much higher anterior to the A/P boundary, the data does not rule out low-level Nord expression in the posterior. The authors have addressed this in their revision, not by changing any of their absolute statements about expression, but by added a new experiment showing that &quot;we did not notice any ectopic PCV in the adult flies when UAS-nord-RNAi was selectively expressed in the P compartment of the larval and pupal wing via the hh-Gal4 driver.&quot; But this negative result could simply reflect stronger RNAi expression with MS1096-gal4 or A9-gal4. It would be preferable if they had tested the effects of nord-RNAi when it was limited to the anterior compartment, something that their model predicts should affect the posterior crossvein. This could easily be done with ptc-gal4 or ci-gal4.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we analyzed the ectopic venation phenotype in flies carrying ptc-Gal4 driven expression of UAS-nord-RNAi (Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4). See the related changes on Page 15-16 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also model the action of Nord as if it only diffuses over a short distance, and thus is only affecting BMP movement from neighboring cells, such as those in L4 in pupal wings, and is never present in the PCV. However, the extracellular staining of Nord-GFP in Figure 3 looks substantially above background throughout the wing disc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out our incomplete interpretation regarding how far Nord may diffuse. We propose that the secreted Nord/NDNF proteins likely exit in two spatially distinct pools: one pool with more freely diffusible proteins that can reach a longer distance, whereas another pool containing proteins mainly associated with source cells or nearby extracellular matrix. See Pages 23-34 and 47 of the revised manuscript for related changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Biphasic or multiphasic effects- The authors have added new data that clarify some of the effects of Nord in the PCV, but complicate their story about biphasic effects. In growth Nord appears truly biphasic, promoting growth only at normal levels, and inhibiting growth and BMP signaling with either decreased or increased Nord expression. But in PCV formation things are more complex. Both loss of endogenous Nord and mild gains induce ectopic PCV phenotypes. Since normal levels do not alter the PCV, that also fits with a biphasic effect, albeit the opposite of the growth effect (ectopic signaling with both losses and mild gains). Overexpression also has a biphasic effect, as strong Nord gains do the opposite of weak gains and cause loss of the PCV and signaling. However, if one puts all of this together, the PCV effect is more multiphasic than biphasic, because of the normal signaling observed at wild type. Nord loss increases signaling, wild type is normal, mild Nord overexpression increases, strong Nord decreases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we need to be cautious about using the word “biphasic” when describing how Nord modulates BMP signaling in PCV patterning. Therefore, we have replaced “biphasic” with “dosage-dependent” when describing the activity of Nord in the context of PCV patterning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only detailed explanation of these effects is in the legend of Figure 9, which is not very complete and leaves some puzzles. If loss of Nord increases long-range BMP diffusion into the PCV, why isn't the same thing happening in a third instar wing pouch?</p></disp-quote><p>Loss of nord likely also leads to increased Dpp spreading in the 3rd instar wing pouch. For instance, a recent study reported that nord mutation rescued the L5 defects in dally mutants (Akiyama et al., 2021). However, in nord single mutant, the Dpp spreading increase associated gain of BMP activity is not strong enough to overturn the reduced BMP signaling associated with medial Dpp reduction during wing growth regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And there are ideas hidden in the figure itself that are not explained in the legend or the Discussion, especially the switch from BMP presentation to BMP sequestration with a change from low local to high local Nord concentrations. A fuller discussion in the text would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested changes were made on Pages 23-34 and 47 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Biphasic <italic>in vitro</italic>- The <italic>in vitro</italic> work remains strong, especially for Nord's inhibitory effects on BMP signaling. But the only evidence for a positive and thus biphasic effect of adding Nord relies on a single lane in a single gel: the lowest Nord concentration in Figure 8F, then quantified in 8G. It would be helpful if the authors could state how many times they have repeated this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We include additional replicates and statistical analysis in Figure 8G. See Page 45 for the changes in the legend of Figure 8. We also softened the conclusion on Page 22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given the long discussion of NDNF, the authors should mention the mechanisms that have been proposed for NDNF activity: by binding integrins, or by modulation of FGF signaling by binding HSPGs.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggested changes were made on Page 28.</p></body></sub-article></article>
