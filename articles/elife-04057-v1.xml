Here, we examine the time course of release at inhibitory basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses and show that it is independent of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transmitter release suggests that the invariant time course of release critically depends on tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors. Experiments with exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators reveal that channel-sensor coupling at basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses is very tight, with a mean distance of 10–20 nm. Thus, tight channel-sensor coupling provides a mechanistic explanation for the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the time course of release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04057.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04057.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04057.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The nervous system sends information around the body in the form of electrical signals that travel through cells called neurons.

As transmitter release is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent biochemical process, one would expect that both the extent and kinetics of release will depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. In contrast to this expectation, the time course of release (TCR) at the neuromuscular junction is independent of the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datyner and Gage, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Van der Kloot, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parnas et al., 1989</xref>). However, the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the TCR is less well established at central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sargent et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Several potential explanations were proposed, including adaptation of transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsu et al., 1996</xref>) and additional voltage sensors that control the timing of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parnas et al., 2000</xref>; See; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felmy et al., 2003</xref>). Recent results suggested that in several central synapses presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors are tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scimemi and Diamond, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Tight coupling might be another factor contributing to the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamada and Zucker, 1992</xref>).

Analysis of the dependence of evoked IPSC peak amplitude on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> revealed that the amount of transmitter release was steeply [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent, with a high power coefficient (n = 3.02 in the low-concentration limit; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Thus, release at the BC–PC synapse was highly cooperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967</xref>). We next measured the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence of release kinetics. To determine the TCR, we first recorded unitary IPSCs at a given [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, and subsequently in reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to isolate quantal IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We then computed the TCR by deconvolution of unitary and quantal IPSC waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diamond and Jahr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neher and Sakaba, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was changed in the range from 0.7–4 mM, peak release rate changed by a factor of 34.4. In contrast, the half-duration of the TCR was only minimally affected (0.49 ± 0.05 ms at 0.7 mM; 0.43 ± 0.05 ms at 1 mM; 0.47 ± 0.01 ms at 2 mM; 0.47 ± 0.02 ms at 4 mM; 5–11 pairs; p = 0.56; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Furthermore, the decay time constant of the TCR was similar in the different conditions (p = 0.38; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). These results show that the TCR is largely [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-independent at a central synapse. Similar conclusions were reached at lower recording temperature, which would be expected to markedly slow down the kinetic rates of channels and sensors, but to only minimally change the rates of diffusional processes.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering were computed by solving the full set of partial differential diffusion and reaction equations, and the TCR was simulated using a previously established release sensor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Finally, the half-duration of the TCR was plotted against the peak release rate (PRR). Computational analysis revealed that the TCR was markedly dependent on the PRR in both low and high PRR limit. In the low PRR limit, the half-duration of the TCR decreased with PRR in a model with fixed coupling distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This dependence was accentuated after slowing of release sensor rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top), indicating that rate-limiting sensor kinetics are responsible. Furthermore, this dependence was inverted in a model with variable coupling distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In such a configuration, small Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow may selectively release proximal vesicles, whereas large Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow may recruit all vesicles, resulting in a broadening of the TCR. In the high PRR limit, the half-duration of the TCR increased with PRR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This behavior was particularly prominent in small boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom), suggesting that saturation of the endogenous buffers leads to broadening of the TCR. In all configurations, the dependence of the TCR on the PRR was substantially more prominent in loose (200 nm, blue colors) than in tight coupling configurations (20 nm, red colors).

Our results show that coupling is tight, with a coupling distance of 10–20 nm. Although several previous studies measured the coupling distance, the rules that define the coupling configuration remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nadkarni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scimemi and Diamond, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>).

Our model reveals that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence is substantially more prominent in loose than in tight coupling regimes in a variety of conditions. These include different Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor rates, different bouton diameters, various concentrations and affinity values of endogenous buffers, and uniform vs non-uniform coupling. Specifically, our model predicts that slowing of sensor rates should markedly enhance the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence of the TCR in a microdomain, but not in a nanodomain coupling regime. We tested this prediction by lowering the temperature, which, among other potential effects, is expected to slow sensor rates. Whereas lowering the temperature had large effects on the absolute value of the half-duration of the TCR, its [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence was unchanged. These findings provide experimental evidence that tight source–sensor coupling is a key factor that ensures the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence of the TCR.</p><p>Previous studies highlighted several functional advantages of nanodomain coupling, including efficacy, speed, temporal precision, and energy efficiency of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest another functional benefit: conveying [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> independence to the TCR. Is the invariance of the TCR relevant for microcircuit function under physiological conditions? Maintenance of speed and temporal precision at the GABAergic BC–PC synapse is of critical importance for the operation of the cerebellum, since feedforward inhibition mediated by BCs sets the temporal window of signal integration in PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mittmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2010</xref>).

At 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the quantal content, estimated as the integral under the TCR, was 10.4 ± 1.8. Analysis was performed using Mathematica 8.0.1 running under Windows 7 on a PC.</p><p>To test the possibility that postsynaptic factors, such as receptor desensitization, receptor saturation, or GABA spillover affected our measurements, we measured the TCR in the presence of the low-affinity competitive antagonist 300 µM TPMPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2001</xref>) and 2 µM CGP55845 to avoid effects of TPMPA on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. In 4 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (presumably maximizing the confounding effects of postsynaptic factors), the half-duration of the TCR was 0.51 ± 0.04 in the presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; 6 pairs) vs 0.47 ± 0.02 in the absence of TPMPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; p = 0.38).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Estimation of distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors</title><p>To quantify the coupling distance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and release sensors, concentration–effect data for both BAPTA and EGTA were first fit with a Hill equation. Next, data were analyzed with a model of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and buffering based on linear approximations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>). The ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the presence and absence of chelators was converted into the ratio of release probabilities, using a power function with the Hill coefficient set according to the slope of the double-logarithmic IPSC–[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> relation in the low-concentration limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom). Three different model variants were used: (1) a model with a constant coupling distance, (2) a model with a half-normally distributed coupling distance, and (3) a model with skewed-normally distributed coupling distance. In the two latter cases, the average coupling distance was specified as the expectation value of the distribution. For BAPTA, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and unbinding rates were assumed as k<sub>on</sub> = 4 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and k<sub>off</sub> = 88 s<sup>−1</sup> (affinity 220 nM). For EGTA, the rates were taken as k<sub>on</sub> = 1 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> and k<sub>off</sub> = 0.7 s<sup>−1</sup> (affinity 70 nM). The diffusion coefficients for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, EGTA, and BAPTA were assumed to be 220 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neher, 1998</xref>). The endogenous buffer product was set to 5500 s<sup>−1</sup> and the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was assumed as 40 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collin et al., 2005</xref>). Confidence intervals of coupling distance were obtained by bootstrap procedures. 1000 artificial data sets were generated from the means and SEMs of the original data set and analyzed as the original (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efron and Tibshirani, 1998</xref>). Error estimates were given as half of the 15.9–84.1 percentile range. All simulations were performed using Mathematica 8.0.1 running under Windows 7 on a PC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>All values are given as mean ± SEM. Error bars in the figures also indicate SEM (shown only if larger than symbol size). Statistical significance was tested using a two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data, a two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test for unpaired data, and a Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple comparisons (Igor Pro 6.3.2). Differences with p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Modeling of transmitter release</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and binding to mobile and fixed buffers were modeled using the full set of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the reaction–diffusion problem, including all necessary boundary and initial conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggermann and Jonas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). PDEs were solved numerically with NDSolve of Mathematica 8.01 running under Windows 7 on a PC. A release unit was implemented as a hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The diameter was assumed to be 1 µm, approximately corresponding to the radius of inhibitory boutons, unless specified differently. PDEs were integrated over the radial coordinate (2000 grid points) and solved at a concentration accuracy of 0.01 nM.</p><p>Brief single action potentials were applied as stimuli. A cluster of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was represented as a point source. A previously published Hodgkin-Huxley-type gating model of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels was used to calculate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borst and Sakmann, 1998</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> inflow, relative to that of a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, was varied between 1 and 100. The single-channel conductance was assumed as 2.2 pS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2007</xref>). The coupling distance was varied between 10 and 200 nm.</p><p>The standard parameters of the model were as follows: For the fixed endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer, the rates were chosen as k<sub>on</sub> = 5 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and k<sub>off</sub> = 1000 s<sup>−1</sup> (affinity 2 µM). For standard simulations, both a fixed buffer (100 µM) and a mobile buffer with BAPTA-like properties (10 µM) were incorporated. Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer concentrations were considered to be spatially uniform. The resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was set to 40 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collin et al., 2005</xref>). Vesicular release rate was computed using a model of transmitter release originally established at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lou et al., 2005</xref>). This model was preferred over alternative models because it is based on the most extensive set of experimental data. The occupancies for the different states of the model were obtained by solving the corresponding first-order ordinary differential equations with a Q-matrix approach. Release rate was computed as the sum of the product of occupancy and release rate for each state; pool depletion was not considered.</p><p>To account for the rapid timing of transmitter release at BC–PC synapses, the previously used presynaptic action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meinrenken et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bucurenciu et al., 2008</xref>) was time-compressed by a factor of two, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel gating rates were multiplied by a factor of two, and the binding and unbinding rates of the sensor were increased by a factor of two. The maximal release rate in the model was 6008 s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lou et al., 2005</xref>). In a subset of simulations, a distributed arrangement of release sensors was assumed, with a coefficient of variation for the coupling distance of 0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In these cases, release rates were obtained at various distances, and the average release rate was computed as the weighted mean, with weight factors set according to a normal distribution.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs Nicholas Vyleta and Ryuichi Shigemoto for critically reading the manuscript.

To address this, the authors have performed paired recordings at basket cell Purkinje cell synapses, in combination with computational modelling. They include a study of latencies at two temperatures, a pharmacological analysis of synaptic calcium channel subtypes, a deconvolution-based analysis of release rate as a function of external calcium, and an investigation of the effects of added EGTA and BAPTA on synaptic efficacy. The results are then simulated using a variant of the previously published Eggermann-Jonas model at the same synapse.</p><p>The experimental results, which are of high quality, clearly show that there is tight coupling between SVs and VDCCs and also, that the release rate does not vary significantly with external calcium at physiological temperature. While intuition suggests that a causal link between these two findings is likely, the simulation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> brings disappointingly little to support this hypothesis, or to eliminate alternative explanations. As detailed below, the possibility remains open that other aspects of the synapse function such as width of the AP, speed of the release reactions, or effects of endogenous buffers, may play a key role as well. Repeating the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> at room temperature should help to solve this problem. Therefore, we believe these experiments are essential for the resubmission, should not be very time-consuming, but will be very informative.</p><p>Further detail is provided below:</p><p>1) The figure describing the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) is difficult to understand in detail. The main result is in panel c. But there seems little justification in using the slope ratio at 200 s-1 to evaluate the effect of coupling distance on calcium sensitivity. It would be better to use the slope calculated by joining together the points representing 1, 2 and 4 mM calcium (respectively near 200, 2000 and 4000 s-1). If this is done it appears that the changes in TCR duration are only near 15 or 20% for the loose coupling (roughly decreasing from 0.65 to 0.55). A similar analysis made on panel e (including a dispersion in coupling distances) leads to even smaller changes. Looking at these simulations, it does seem like the dependence on external calcium is less for tight coupling than for loose coupling. But in either case the dependence is modest, presumably because the model has been constrained to mimic a very fast synapse (fast AP, fast calcium channel, fast SV release). So at the end it is not clear whether the weak dependence of TCR on external calcium should be ascribed primarily to the tight coupling as proposed by the authors, or to other features of the model.</p><p>2) Additional room temperature experiments would significantly strengthen the manuscript and should be carried out prior to resubmission. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> show a much broader distribution of latencies at 22<sup>°</sup>C than at 34<sup>°</sup>C. Likewise the previous deconvolution analysis by Sakaba at the same synapse (Neuron 57, 406, 2008), which was performed at room temperature, indicates a broader TCR than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> here. This suggests an opportunity to test whether it is really the tight coupling that prevents latency changes with extracellular calcium, or whether other factors play a role as well. If in spite of the broader TCR, external calcium effects remain negligible at room temperature, then the case of tight coupling as a causal link will be much strengthened. If however significant changes occur at room temperature, then additional synaptic parameters will have to be considered as well.</p><p>3) The SV release rates appear to be per synapse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and per vesicle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, making the correspondence between the two figures difficult. The “default” rate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is 2000 s-1 presumably corresponding to the 15 quanta /ms of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> at 2mM calcium. How the 2000 s-1 rate was obtained is unclear. It may have been obtained by extrapolating the normalized IPSC data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> to very high calcium, and inferring that the release rate at 2mM is 1/3 of the maximum, that is a third of 6000 s-1, or 2 000 s-1. However the extrapolation cannot be considered as accurate because high calcium points are difficult to obtain at physiological temperatures, so that the asymptote is not well constrained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>. If true, the 2 000 s-1 value would indicate an RRP value of 15/2=7.5 per synapse, much smaller than the mean value of 110 found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakaba (2008)</xref>. Overall vesicular release rates may have been seriously overestimated in the simulation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>4) This paper comes in a line of other works by the senior author and others measuring the channel sensor coupling in different synapses. A common conclusion is that at GABAergic synapses the coupling is 'tight'. In this context, some of the results presented here are not particularly surprising (e.g. all of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and all of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It would be helpful if the authors could emphasize more strongly which of the results they consider to be particularly novel and important, especially in light of the recent literature (see next comment).</p><p>5) The discussion of the literature needs to be expanded. While it is true that latency variations have been little investigated in the CNS, the literature is not as empty as the manuscript would suggest. For example, Boudkkazi et al (Neuron 56, 1048, 2007) found that delays vary with release probability at cortical synapses, including when increasing the extracellular calcium concentration. Gilmanov IR et al 2008 also approached these issues at NMJ with similar conclusions. Furthermore, the Ca independence of release has long been noted at NMJ (as the authors acknowledge), but the authors don't refer to any studies of this in neurons, though there are several which could be cited and discussed, starting perhaps with Silver et al. 1996 in granule cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04057.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The figure describing the simulations (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) is difficult to understand in detail.

We have estimated that the peak release rates at 0.7 and 1 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> are 168 and 379 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. We have therefore decided to maintain our original reference point (200 s<sup>-1</sup>), which is exactly in-between. Finally, we have indicated our experimental release rates with red arrows in the graphs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>. These data corroborate that if there were marked dependencies of TCR on release rate, as e.g. the case in a loose coupling regime, we would be able to detect this dependence in our experiments. We thank the editor / reviewers for raising this point.</p><p><italic>2) Additional room temperature experiments would significantly strengthen the manuscript and should be carried out prior to resubmission.

We would like to point out that the results shown in the original submission (with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c, d</xref>) had already been performed at room temperature. We have revised the Materials and methods section and the Figure legends to make this point more clear. We are aware that the TCR in our experiments (0.47 ± 0.01 ms) is shorter than the approximate value reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakaba, 2008</xref> (∼1 ms) under seemingly identical conditions. However, because of the high Q<sub>10</sub> value of the TCR (see below), this may have been caused by relatively minor differences in temperature.</p><p>To constructively pick up the key idea of the editors / reviewers, we performed additional experiments at lower temperature (∼12°C; 5 pairs). Under these experimental conditions, kinetic parameters (presynaptic action potential duration, presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel gating, and release sensor kinetics) are expected to be slowed down, whereas tight coupling is likely to be maintained. These experiments turned out to be surprisingly difficult, because of lower stimulation frequencies required to ensure pool replenishment and several additional experimental issues related to low temperature. Interestingly, reduction in temperature markedly prolonged the TCR, whereas the dependence of TCR on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> remained minimal. These results (incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) corroborate our original conclusion that the tight coupling is the most important parameter in shaping the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independence of transmitter release. Again, we thank the editor / reviewers for this suggestion.</p><p><italic>3) The SV release rates appear to be per synapse in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, and per vesicle in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, making the correspondence between the two figures difficult.

The results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, and better constrain our estimates of release probability. The new results confirm that the “physiological” release probability at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is 0.26, and that the corresponding peak release rate is close to 2000 s<sup>-1</sup>. Given that we extended the range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, we further decided to determine the Hill coefficient in the concentration range ≤ 2 mM rather than the entire concentration range. We have included a double-logarithmic representation to graphically illustrate this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom of the revised version). Please note that this different (presumably more accurate) measurement of the Hill coefficient also slightly changed the results of our analysis of coupling distance (in the main text and legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for reminding us of the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakaba (2008)</xref>. We have cited this paper in the revised version. We are aware that our mean peak release rate and the relatively high release probability may suggest that the size of the releasable pool is small. Our simple quantitative estimation is pool size = quantal content (from deconvolution and integral of TCR) / release probability (from Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of release) = 10.4 / 0.26 = 40 at 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. In apparent contrast, the cumulative release analysis during trains of action potentials and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging suggested a larger pool size (110 ± 28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sakaba, 2008</xref>). One possible explanation might be that the size of the pool accessed by single action potentials is smaller than that accessed by trains or Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging. Furthermore, there are many additional complications in the analysis of train data, including release-independent components of depression (Kraushaar and Jonas, 2000), Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and time-dependent changes in refilling rate (Wang and Kaczmarek, 1998, Nature), and nonlinearities in the extrapolation in cumulative release plots (Thanawala and Regehr, 2013, J. Neuroscience). Thus, whether or not there is a true discrepancy remains to be resolved.</p><p><italic>4) This paper comes in a line of other works by the senior author and others measuring the channel sensor coupling in different synapses.

In this context, some of the results presented here are not particularly surprising (e.g. all of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, parts of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, and all of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). It would be helpful if the authors could emphasize more strongly which of the results they consider to be particularly novel and important, especially in light of the recent literature (see next comment)</italic>.</p><p>We have completely changed the Discussion to indicate the novel aspects more clearly. We continue to think that the manuscript provides interesting data, as also stated by the editor’s summary that the paper addresses an “interesting and under-studied question”. Furthermore, not all papers converge on the conclusion that coupling is tight. For example, we have recently shown loose coupling in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>), and earlier papers suggested loose coupling at CA3–CA1 cell synapses based on the properties of synaptic dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nadkarni et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, previous studies using membrane-permeant Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators indicated loose coupling in CCK interneuron output synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>). Finally, the suggestions of the editor / reviewers have helped to convey an additional novel aspect to the paper, because, to the best of our knowledge, nobody ever studied the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> dependence of the TCR at different temperatures.</p><p><italic>5) The discussion of the literature needs to be expanded. While it is true that latency variations have been little investigated in the CNS, the literature is not as empty as the manuscript would suggest. For example, Boudkkazi et al (Neuron 56, 1048, 2007) found that delays vary with release probability at cortical synapses, including when increasing the extracellular calcium concentration. Gilmanov IR et al 2008 also approached these issues at NMJ with similar conclusions. Furthermore, the Ca independence of release has long been noted at NMJ (as the authors acknowledge), but the authors don't refer to any studies of this in neurons, though there are several which could be cited and discussed, starting perhaps with Silver et al. 1996 in granule cells</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for reminding us of the papers of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilmanov et al., 2008</xref>, Silver et al., 1996 (and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sargent et al., 2005</xref>). Although the TCR is not directly reported in those studies, we agree that these papers are relevant to our work, because they report Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of the EPSC time course. We have incorporated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilmanov et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sargent et al., 2005</xref>, as suggested. However, we would like to add that latency and time course of release should not be confused. For example, Boudkkazi et al. studied latency variation rather than TCR (thus, those results will not be directly relevant to the present paper).</p></body></sub-article></article>
