elusive. Emerging evidence implicates Cathepsin L (CTSL) in diabetic complications, including nephropathy and retinopathy. Our previous research identified CTSL as a pivotal protease promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate elevated blood CTSL levels in individuals with diabetes, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chronic hyperglycemia correlates positively with CTSL concentration and activity in diabetic patients, while acute hyperglycemia augments CTSL activity in healthy individuals. In vitro studies reveal high glucose, but not insulin, promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells, with <italic>CTSL</italic> knockout cells displaying reduced susceptibility. Utilizing lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, alongside <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic>mice and <italic>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></italic>mice, we illustrate increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice under diabetic conditions. Mechanistically, high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation in diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>People with diabetes are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19 and dying from the illness, which is caused by a virus known as SARS-CoV-2. The high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes appear to be a contributing factor to this heightened risk. However, diabetes is a complex condition encompassing a range of metabolic disorders, and it is therefore likely that other factors may contribute.</p><p>Previous research identified a link between an enzyme called cathepsin L and more severe COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Elevated cathepsin L levels are known to contribute to diabetes complications, such as kidney damage and vision loss. It has also been shown that cathepsin L helps SARS-CoV-2 to enter and infect cells. This raised the question of whether elevated cathepsin L is responsible for the increased COVID-19 vulnerability in patients with diabetes.</p><p>To investigate, He, Zhao et al. monitored disease severity and cathepsin L levels in patients with COVID-19. This confirmed that people with diabetes had more severe COVID-19 and that higher levels of cathepsin L are linked to more severe disease. Analysis also revealed that cathepsin L activity increases as blood glucose levels increase.</p><p>In laboratory experiments, cells exposed to glucose or fluid from the blood of people with diabetes were more easily infected with SARS-CoV-2, with cells genetically modified to lack cathepsin L being more resistant to infection. Further experiments revealed this was due to glucose promoting maturation and migration of cathepsin L in the cells.</p><p>The findings of He, Zhao et al. help to explain why people with diabetes are more likely to develop severe or fatal COVID-19. Therefore, controlling blood glucose levels in people with diabetes may help to prevent or reduce the severity of the disease. Additionally, therapies targeting cathepsin L could also potentially help to treat COVID-19, especially in patients with diabetes, although more research is needed to develop and test these treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human blood sample</kwd><kwd>diabetic mice</kwd><kwd>hepatoma cell line</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82341076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jin-Kui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81930019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jin-Kui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82300917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Miao-Miao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009601</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PX20240203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Miao-Miao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome via the ER-Golgi-lysosome axis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cysteine proteases, including cathepsin L (CTSL), hold pivotal roles in human pathobiology due to their multifaceted activities within and outside cells.

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through the virus spike protein binding with ACE2 receptor. It uses host proteases, such as CTSL and cathepsin B (CTSB) to activate its spike protein by cleavage, which enhances its cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jackson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muralidar et al., 2021</xref>). We measured the plasma levels of COVID-19 related proteins, ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB in diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Only CTSL levels were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients and changed with the course of COVID-19. CTSL peaked on admission day and decreased significantly after discharge from the hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>). These results indicate that CTSL is strongly associated with COVID-19, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>), and may be involved in diabetes in COVID-19 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Impact of chronic and acute hyperglycemia on CTSL activity</title><p>In non-COVID-19 participants, we investigated the correlation of CTSL with chronic and acute hyperglycemia using two studies.

However, the mechanism underlying this process remained unclear. As mentioned previously, CTSL maturation depends on structural activation via the ER-Golgi apparatus-lysosome axis and acid activation at low pH environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ishidoh and Kominami, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reiser et al., 2010</xref>).

We labeled specific proteins in each organelle: calreticulin for ER, GM130 for Golgi apparatus and lamp1 for lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also confirmed CTSL expression in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Confocal microscopy results revealed that under low glucose conditions, CTSL tended to co-localize within the ER rather than lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and e</xref>).

Diabetes may increase susceptibility to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections for various suggested reasons. These include higher viral titer, relatively low functioning T lymphocytes that lead to decreased viral clearance, vulnerability to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome, and comorbidities associated with type 2 diabetes, such as cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mazucanti and Egan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moradi-Marjaneh et al., 2021</xref>).

The underlying mechanisms by which diabetes or hyperglycemia exacerbates COVID-19 remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>This study identified that CTSL maturation induced by hyperglycemia may contribute to the higher mortality and severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. While our initial study involved 62 COVID-19 patients, with 31 having diabetes and 31 without, matching based on gender and age, we acknowledged the challenge of obtaining balanced gender distribution in both groups due to the difficulty of collecting blood samples from COVID-19 patients. To mitigate potential gender bias resulting from small sample sizes, we conducted a supplementary clinical study involving 122 non-COVID-19 volunteers, including 61 individuals with diabetes and 61 without. The percentage of males in the diabetes group was 50.8%, while in the healthy group, males constituted 44.3% (p-value = 0.468), indicating no significant gender bias. The clinical data from this study indicated that human plasma CTSL activity and concentration were correlated with acute (in euglycemic participants under high-glucose clamp conditions) and chronic (in diabetic patients, both with and without COVID-19) hyperglycemia, respectively.</p><p>Using lung tissue samples from diabetic and non-diabetic patients, as well as <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice and <italic>Lepr<sup>db/+</sup></italic> mice, we found that diabetic conditions increased CTSL activity in both humans and mice. The liver is a significant target organ for COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gupta et al., 2020</xref>). Despite potential limitations, such as generalization of liver function abnormalities and lack of tissue specificity in SARS-CoV-2 impact, Huh7 cells offer practical advantages as a mature cell model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection, including accessibility, susceptibility to infection, and stable proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ciotti et al., 2020</xref>). Taking all these factors into consideration, we have ultimately chosen to utilize the hepatoma cell line to investigate how hyperglycemia induces CTSL maturation and subsequently promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection. High glucose promoted SARS-CoV-2 infection in WT cells, while <italic>CTSL</italic> KO cells showed reduced susceptibility to high glucose promoting effects. Mechanistically, we proposed that hyperglycemia promoted CTSL maturation by accelerating its translocation from the ER to lysosome via Golgi apparatus. This condition increased the functionality of CTSL, which cleaved the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, promoting virus membrane fusion and infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). In our study, the term ‘diabetes’ encompasses the condition of hyperglycemia in a broad sense, rather than specifically indicating type 1 diabetes (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This broader definition aligns with the scope of our research objectives and findings, particularly observed in the cell experiments conducted.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h–j</xref> illustrate the impact of acute hyperglycemia on CTSL concentration and activity in 15 healthy male volunteers over a 160 min period. During this short timeframe, CTSL concentration remained stable, as evidenced by consistent RNA results from cells exposed to varying glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there was a significant increase in CTSL activity, indicating that glucose elevation rapidly triggers CTSL maturation through propeptide cleavage. This activation process occurs more rapidly than CTSL protein synthesis. In summary, acute hyperglycemia specifically elevates CTSL activity, while chronic hyperglycemia may impact both CTSL activity and concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>). To date, there have been limited studies investigating the relationship between cathepsin maturation and glucose. In 1998, Tournu C, et al. reported that D-glucose did not impact mRNA levels for CTSB or CTSL or secretion of proCTSL. However, D-glucose did significantly enhance the amount of mature forms of CTSB and CTSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tournu et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, Shi Q, et al. found that increased glucose metabolism promotes O-GlcNAcylation of the lysosome-encapsulated protease CTSB, leading to elevated levels of mature CTSB in macrophages and secretion in the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). These findings support our evidence that hyperglycemia drives CTSL maturation.</p><p>ACE2 has previously been identified as a critical host cell surface receptor that enables SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). While some studies have reported that glucose can increase ACE2 expression in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Härdtner et al., 2013</xref>), numerous other studies have found that ACE2 is downregulated in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizuiri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reich et al., 2008</xref>). Garreta et al. recently conducted a study using a human kidney organoid system to investigate the impact of diabetes on SARS-CoV-2 infections. The study revealed that hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperglycemic human kidney organoids had elevated ACE2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garreta et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it remains controversial whether diabetes results in up- or downregulation of ACE2. In our study, we evaluated plasma levels of ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. We found that only CTSL levels were significantly increased in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients and varied during the course of COVID-19.</p><p>In addition to CTSL, there may be other bioactive factors involved in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with diabetes. A recent study revealed that diabetic patients have lower levels of serum 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG), a small-molecule metabolite in human blood that exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The reduced levels of 1,5-AG have been associated with increased viral loads and severe respiratory tissue damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, the study found that 1,5-AG binds directly to the S2 subunit of the spike protein, which disrupts virus-host membrane fusion and inhibits infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tong et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we propose that diabetes may promote COVID-19 infection through multiple factors, and CTSL is only one of several important factors.</p><p>Apart from diabetes, other comorbidities such as hypertension and CHD are also prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, our study revealed a strong correlation between CTSL activity and concentration with hypertension and CHD in these patients. Using an angiotensin II-induced hypertension model, researchers observed an increase in blood pressure and CTSL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Whether these chronic comorbidities contribute to increased morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 by increasing CTSL activity and concentration requires further investigation in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that hyperglycemia drives the maturation and activation of CTSL, for only mature form of CTSL gains its function of proteolysis. Therefore, targeting CTSL may be a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic comorbidities and complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lepr<sup>db/db</sup> mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vital River Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lepr<sup>db/+</sup> mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vital River Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, liver)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Huh7 cell line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Resource Center, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Blood samples from patients with COVID-19</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University;

No ES009). Prior to measurement, the cell medium was concentrated using the ultra-tube (Milipore, Cat. No UFC501096). The test samples were evaluated in the presence of a reaction buffer (100 mM NaAc, 5 mM EDTA, pH 5.3). The reaction was conducted in 100 µL system (50 µL sample containing CTSL protein +47 µL reaction buffer +1 µL DTT (1 mM)+2 µL substrate Ac-FR-AFC (10 mM)) in 96-well black plates. The plated was cultured at 37 °C for 2 hr in light avoidance incubator. The fluorescence emitted from the samples was then measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Infinite 200, TECAN, China) at the Ex = 380 nm, Em = 460 nm wavelengths.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Immunofluorescence assay</title><p>The CTSL, calreticulin, Golgi membrane protein 130 (GM130) and lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp 1) distributions in the Huh7 cells were visualized by immunofluorescent staining. The CTSL, calreticulin, GM130 and Lamp1 antibody species source IgG were used as negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Briefly, Huh7 cells was cultured in 35 mm confocal dishes after poly-l-lysine coating. After high/low glucose treatment for 96 hr, Huh7 cells were then fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized by a detergent 0.25% triton X-100. A specific primary antibody is applied on the Huh7 cell surface at 4 °C overnight. After wash out, the secondary antibody is applied at room temperature for 1 hr avoid from light. All pictures were captured under Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (FV3000RS, Olympus, Japan).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Clinical data are shown as percentage or median, as appropriate. Comparison of continuous data between two independent groups was performed using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. An unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparing the averages/means of two independent or unrelated groups. A paired t-test was used to test whether the mean difference between pairs of measurements is existing. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for checking if the means of two or more categories are significantly different from each other. Spearman’s rho test (two-tailed) was used to analyze nonparametric correlations of parameters correlated with CTSL levels and diabetes. Fluorescence intensity was calculated by Plot Profile tool in Image J software. Graphpad prism 7.0 software and SPSS for Windows 17.0 were used for statistical analysis, with statistical significance set at two-sided. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Materials Availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

The authors conducted in vitro experiments, revealing that elevated glucose levels promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells. In contrast, CTSL knockout cells show reduced susceptibility to high glucose-promoted effects. Additionally, the authors utilized lung tissue samples obtained from both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, along with db/db diabetic and control mice. Their findings indicate that diabetic conditions lead to an elevation in CTSL activity in both human and mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have effectively met their research objectives, and their conclusions are supported by the data presented. Their findings suggest that high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome, potentially contributing to diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) In Figure 1e, the authors measured plasma levels of COVID-19 related proteins, including ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB, in both diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Notably, only CTSL levels exhibited a significant increase in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients, and these levels varied throughout the course of COVID-19. Given that the diabetes groups encompass both male and female patients, it is essential to ascertain whether the authors considered the potential impact of gender on CTSL levels. The diabetes groups comprised a higher percentage of male patients (61.3%) compared to the non-diabetes group, where males constituted only 38.7%.</p><p>(2) lines145-149: &quot;The results showed that WT Huh7 cell cultured in high glucose medium exhibited a much higher infective rate than those in low glucose medium. However, CTSL KO Huh7 cells maintained a low infective rate of SARS-CoV-2 regardless of glucose or insulin levels (Fig. 3f-h). Therefore, hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL.&quot; However, this evidence may be insufficient to support the claim that hyperglycemia enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL. The human hepatoma cell line Huh7 might not be an ideal model to validate the authors' hypothesis regarding high blood glucose promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection through CTSL.</p><p>(3) The Abstract and Introduction sections lack effective organization.</p><p>In this revised version of the study, the authors have addressed my concerns by providing additional experiments, references and discussing further the points of controversy. I think that the authors have made improvements to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92826.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Qiong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Diabetes Institute, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Miao-Miao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Diabetes Institute, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ming-Jia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Diabetes Institute, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Ya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Diabetes Institute, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Jian-Min</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Ying-Mei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of HIV/AIDS and Sex-Transmitted Virus Vaccines, Institute for Biological Product Control, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC), Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Wei Jin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Institutes for Food and Drug Control</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Fangyuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Capital Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jin-Kui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Endocrinology, Beijing Diabetes Institute, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study advances our understanding of why diabetes is a risk factor for more severe Covid-19 disease.

As CTSL activity is highly dependent on pH, it would have been crucial to include this parameter in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your valuable comment. We agree that hyperglycemia can lead to metabolic acidosis and alter blood pH. However, the normal range for blood pH in humans is relatively narrow, typically ranging from 7.35 to 7.45. In our study, we ensured that blood pH remained within this normal range for both diabetic and healthy control samples. To address your concern, we conducted experiments to investigate CTSL activity in response to pH fluctuations within this physiological range. The updated Fig. 4a now presents these findings, demonstrating consistent CTSL activity despite pH variations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test to ensure robustness. We have also amended the figure legend and provided corresponding descriptions in the final edition manuscript (line 15-18, page 7).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92826-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The study rarely differentiates between cellular and extracellular CTSL activity.

Over the course of the manuscript, the hypothesis shifts increasingly towards an increase in protease trans-localization and processing to the active form rather than a change in total protease amounts. The overall importance of CTSL concentrations remains questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful feedback. We have addressed your concerns regarding the impact of hyperglycemia on CTSL concentrations. Fig. 2h-j illustrate the effect of acute hyperglycemia on both CTSL concentration and activity in 15 healthy male volunteers over a 160-minute period. During this short timeframe, CTSL concentration remained stable, as evidenced by consistent RNA results from cells exposed to varying glucose levels (Supplementary Fig.1). However, there was a significant increase in CTSL activity, indicating that glucose elevation rapidly triggers CTSL maturation through propeptide cleavage. This activation process occurs more rapidly than CTSL protein synthesis. In summary, acute hyperglycemia specifically elevates CTSL activity, while chronic hyperglycemia may impact both CTSL activity and concentration (Fig. 2a-d). Additionally, Tournu C, et al. (1998) (reference 1) and Shi Q, et al. (2018) (reference 2) have reported that increased glucose metabolism promotes the maturation and secretion of CTSL and other proteases. These findings align with our evidence that hyperglycemia drives CTSL maturation, as discussed at line 10-25, page 12 in the final edition manuscript.</p><p>References：</p><p>(1) Tournu C et al.

The authors conducted in vitro experiments, revealing that elevated glucose levels promote SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type cells. In contrast, CTSL knockout cells show reduced susceptibility to high glucose-promoted effects. Additionally, the authors utilized lung tissue samples obtained from both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, along with db/db diabetic and control mice. Their findings indicate that diabetic conditions lead to an elevation in CTSL activity in both humans and mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have effectively met their research objectives, and their conclusions are supported by the data presented. Their findings suggest that high glucose levels promote CTSL maturation and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome, potentially contributing to diabetic comorbidities and complications.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) In Figure 1e, the authors measured plasma levels of COVID-19 related proteins, including ACE2, CTSL, and CTSB, in both diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients. Notably, only CTSL levels exhibited a significant increase in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients, and these levels varied throughout the course of COVID-19. Given that the diabetes groups encompass both male and female patients, it is essential to ascertain whether the authors considered the potential impact of gender on CTSL levels. The diabetes groups comprised a higher percentage of male patients (61.3%) compared to the non-diabetes group, where males constituted only 38.7%.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful feedback. In response to your concerns regarding the potential impact of gender on CTSL levels in diabetic and non-diabetic COVID-19 patients, we conducted analyses to address this issue. While our initial study involved 62 COVID-19 patients, with 31 having diabetes and 31 without, matching based on gender and age, we acknowledged the challenge of obtaining balanced gender distribution in both groups due to the difficulty of collecting blood samples from COVID-19 patients. To mitigate potential gender bias resulting from small sample sizes, we conducted a supplementary clinical study involving 122 non-COVID-19 volunteers, including 61 individuals with diabetes and 61 without. The percentage of males in the diabetes group was 50.8%, while in the healthy group, males constituted 44.3% (P value = 0.468), indicating no significant gender bias. We have incorporated this information into the discussion section on line 4-13, page 11 in the final edition manuscript, to provide clarity on this aspect of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 145-149: &quot;The results showed that WT Huh7 cell cultured in high glucose medium exhibited a much higher infective rate than those in low glucose medium. However, CTSL KO Huh7 cells maintained a low infective rate of SARS-CoV-2 regardless of glucose or insulin levels (Fig. 3f-h). Therefore, hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL.&quot; However, this evidence may be insufficient to support the claim that hyperglycemia enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL. The human hepatoma cell line Huh7 might not be an ideal model to validate the authors' hypothesis regarding high blood glucose promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection through CTSL.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have addressed the concerns regarding the sufficiency of evidence supporting the claim that hyperglycemia enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection dependent on CTSL. Specifically, we have revised the expression to state, “Therefore, hyperglycemia enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection through CTSL.” as suggested, in line 9, page 7 in the final edition manuscript. Additionally, we acknowledge the potential involvement of other bioactive factors, such as 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (1,5-AG), in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with diabetes, as outlined in the discussion section from line 13-21, page 13 in the final edition manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the choice of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 as a model for investigating hyperglycemia-induced CTSL maturation and SARS-CoV-2 infection, we recognize the importance of tissue specificity and the liver’s significance as a target organ for COVID-19. Despite potential limitations, such as generalization of liver function abnormalities and lack of tissue specificity in SARS-CoV-2 impact, Huh7 cells offer practical advantages as a mature cell model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection, including accessibility, susceptibility to infection, and stable proliferation (reference 1-3). We have elaborated on these considerations in the discussion section at line 19-23, page 11 in the final edition manuscript, to provide context for our choice of experimental model.</p><p>References：</p><p>(1) Gupta A et al.

The differences observed in the processing of CTSL between cells (Fig. 5b) and tissues (Fig. 5d-e) may be attributed to the complexities inherent in tissue samples, which can impact the clarity of the images. Furthermore, in human tissue samples, it is pertinent to consider that patients in the diabetes group had their blood glucose levels controlled within or near the normal range prior to lung surgery. As a result, the evidence supporting CTSL maturation in human lung tissue blotting images may be less compelling. We have addressed this aspect in the revised results section (lines 10-13, page 9). Additionally, we will consider including blots with shorter exposure to enhance visual clarity in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Considering Fig2B and Figure S1, the evidence of an effect of hyperglycemia or high glucose medium on total CTSL protein concentration is not very strong.

We have revisited the section in question and made appropriate revisions. The original sentence has been modified to accurately reflect the findings: &quot;We found that plasma CTSL activity was strongly positively correlated with chronic hyperglycemia indicated by HbA1c and was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in euglycemic individuals (Fig. 2a, c). Additionally, plasma CTSL concentration showed a positive trend with chronic hyperglycemia indicated by HbA1c (Fig. 2b, d)&quot;. These changes have been incorporated into the revised results section (lines 12-16, page 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Overall, data hinting to increased CTSL activity is stronger than protein amount. This being said, in hyperglycemia, blood pH can be affected (metabolic acidosis). As CTSL has higher activity at low pH, could the increase in activity be caused by a drop in pH?

We have already addressed the potential impact of pH changes on CTSL activity in our response to Weakness No. 1. As indicated, although hyperglycemia can lead to metabolic acidosis and changes in blood pH, the pH levels observed in our study remained within the normal range (7.35 to 7.45). Therefore, we conducted experiments to investigate CTSL activity in response to changes in pH, which showed consistent activity levels within this range.
