This in turn ensures functionality of the neural tissue as it is the prerequisite for correct neuronal connectivity and circuit formation. Multipotent progenitors are key to maintain this balance. They first increase in number through a phase of active proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2015</xref>) which is followed by neurogenesis onset. At neurogenesis onset, subsets of progenitors leave the cell cycle and differentiate into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous and Harris, 2009</xref>). Expectedly, impairment of the intricate balance between proliferation and differentiation can lead to severe defects of brain development and is associated with numerous human diseases, including microcephaly and tumour formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fish et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thornton and Woods, 2009</xref>). Thus, understanding the parameters that differ between cells primed for continued proliferation versus cells that enter the neurogenic program is of utmost importance to comprehend brain development in health and disease.</p><p>Previous studies using the mammalian neocortex showed that at the onset of neurogenesis multipotent progenitors start dividing asymmetrically, generating one radial glial cell and one neuron or a basal progenitor and thereby balancing the ratio between differentiation and proliferation at early neurogenesis stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huttner and Brand, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012</xref>). Once a sufficient number of progenitors is produced, final symmetric consumptive neuronal divisions deplete the progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly to the mammalian cortex, asymmetric divisions have also been shown to be important in the fore- and hindbrain of the teleost <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) to ensure the maintenance of the progenitor pool before its final depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while some questions remain, the division modes responsible for the generation of the first neurons in these parts of the nervous system are relatively well explored. What is much less understood, however, is how neurogenic progenitors arise from the multipotent progenitor pool in the first place. Especially in the retina, the tissue that upon maturation enables the perception of visual information, this question has not yet gathered sufficient attention. Here, division patterns have mainly been investigated at later stages when the emergence of the seven different neurons that ensure retinal functionality has already commenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poggi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kechad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). It was shown that these late neurogenic divisions can be asymmetric, generating two neurons of different fate. However, how multipotent progenitors enter the neurogenic path in the first place and what type of division patterns and regulatory pathways these initial fate decisions entail is not yet well explored.</p><p>In many parts of the CNS, including the retina, asymmetric divisions leading to the formation of neurons have often been linked to the asymmetric inheritance of distinct cellular components. Examples of differentially inherited components are the basal process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okamoto et al., 2013</xref>), the apical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bultje et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandre et al., 2010</xref>) or polarity components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paolini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, signalling pathways including Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirabayashi et al., 2004</xref>) and very prominently Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cayouette et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohtsuka et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2012</xref>) have been shown to be involved. Notch, for example, can regulate the asymmetry of fate decisions through the asymmetric inheritance of Notch signalling endosomes, as shown in the zebrafish spinal cord and forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). In the vertebrate retina, Notch signalling maintains progenitors in a proliferative state through lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henrique et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jadhav et al., 2006</xref>). It was previously suggested that here Notch regulates neurogenic commitment of multipotent progenitors via an extracellular gradient along the apicobasal axis of the elongated neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murciano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Bene et al., 2008</xref>). It was postulated that when nuclei travel along the apicobasal axis during the cell cycle (a phenomenon termed interkinetic nuclear migration, IKNM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sauer, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baye and Link, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norden et al., 2009</xref>]), they are exposed to different Notch signalling levels, that in turn influence the progenitors’ probability to enter the neurogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murciano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baye and Link, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Bene et al., 2008</xref>). However, the division patterns of retinal progenitors that lead to neurogenic entry and their possible links to Notch signalling were not fully explored.</p><p>We here investigate the division patterns that give rise to the neurogenic progenitors, one cell cycle before the generation of post-mitotic neurons. We find that divisions generating neurogenic progenitors are almost always asymmetric and that sister cells do not enter the same lineage. While Notch is involved in the generation of this asymmetry, it does not act via an apicobasal activity gradient. Instead, we provide evidence that Notch signalling acts through the asymmetric inheritance of Sara-positive endosomes. We further show that these first neurogenic progenitors differ in their cell biological features from multipotent progenitors, indicating that they are an intermediate cell type <italic>en route</italic> to differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ath5 positive neurogenic progenitors arise from asymmetric divisions</title><p>To understand how neurogenic progenitors emerge from multipotent progenitors in the developing zebrafish retina, we asked how the earliest of these neurogenic progenitors arise.

Only 8% of divisions were symmetric, producing two Ath5+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’,D</xref>). Following Ath5- sister cells for another cell cycle showed that all cells divided again, but none of the daughter cells started expressing Ath5 (n = 5 divisions, N = 2 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). This suggests that Ath5- sister cells enter a different lineage than their Ath5+ counterpart. Together, these data provide first direct evidence that neurogenic progenitors in the retina emerge from asymmetric divisions, indicating that cellular asymmetry plays an important role in the selection of progenitors that enter the neurogenic program.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inhibition of Notch signalling affects the pattern of divisions generating Ath5 positive progenitors</title><p>To understand the asymmetry of divisions producing Ath5+ progenitors at the molecular level, we set out to investigate the signalling factors involved. One promising candidate that drives asymmetric divisions in many neurogenic lineages is the Notch pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bultje et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kechad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>). In the retina, Notch signalling has been shown to maintain progenitors in the proliferative state thus inhibiting neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Cepko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jadhav et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kechad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sato et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore tested whether and how Notch depletion influenced the asymmetry of divisions generating Ath5+ progenitors using two established Notch inhibitors, the γ-secretase inhibitors LY411575 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) and DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ninov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">MacDonald et al., 2015</xref>). In line with the reports that Notch signalling suppresses neurogenesis and thereby Ath5 expression onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>), we found that both Notch inhibitors led to an increase in the number of Ath5+ cells at 36 and 48 hours post fertilisation (hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). LY411575 treatment further led to a decrease in the number of EdU-positive proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). The increase of Ath5+ cells was accompanied by a striking reduction in tissue thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,G’</xref>) and retinal diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,G’’</xref>) compared to controls at 48 hpf. This retinal size reduction showed that indeed the balance between proliferation and differentiation in the retina was disturbed upon Notch inhibition, leading to tissue-wide consequences.</p><p>The increase in the number of Ath5+ progenitors observed upon Notch inhibition could arise from two not mutually exclusive scenarios: Ath5+ progenitors could emerge prematurely by asymmetric divisions that absorb multipotent progenitors too early, or an increase in symmetric divisions giving rise to two Ath5+ progenitors could occur that would result in less progenitors entering another cell cycle, thereby also depleting the pool of remaining progenitors prematurely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C’</xref>). To explore these possibilities, live imaging of LY411575 treated embryos was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Compared to controls, Notch inhibition led to a significant increase in symmetric neurogenic divisions that generated two Ath5+ progenitors (48% compared to 8% in controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>).

This outcome led to the idea that distinct Notch signalling milieus exist along the apicobasal axis of the retinal neuroepithelium and that these could influence neurogenic outcome due to nuclear movement along this axis during IKNM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murciano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baye and Link, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Bene et al., 2008</xref>). Based on these studies, we asked whether the observed cell division asymmetry that generates Ath5+ progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) could be explained by differential translocation depths between Ath5+ and Ath5- sister cells. To this end, we compared trajectories of Ath5+ and Ath5- sister cells after division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that indeed one sister cell soma always translocated more basally than the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with an average difference of 10.11 ± 7.292 μm between the maximal basal positions (n = 35 divisions, N = 9 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We thus asked whether basal process inheritance was correlated with faster basal displacement of Ath5+ soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, in 15 out of 16 cell pairs analysed, the cell that inherited the basal process initially translocated its soma more basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, only in 10/16 cases (60%), did that cell also become the Ath5+ progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, it was possible that additional factors were responsible for the more efficient basal somal translocation of Ath5+ cells. It was previously shown that stabilised microtubules emanating from the apically positioned centrosome facilitate somal translocation of emerging retinal ganglion cells, the first neurons born in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Icha et al., 2016a</xref>). To test whether stabilised microtubules could also drive translocation of Ath5+ progenitors, we stained for acetylated tubulin in Tg(ath5:gap-GFP/RFP) embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref>) at stages before and during Ath5+ progenitors emergence, 24, 28, 32, and 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This revealed that at 24 hpf, the developmental stage prior to neurogenesis onset, acetylated tubulin was seen only in the primary cilium of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, top left). However, once neurogenesis started, acetylated tubulin was also observed in the apical process of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> top right and bottom left, 28 and 32 hpf) as well as in retinal ganglion cells at 36 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> bottom right), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Icha et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether these stabilised microtubules were directly involved in the basal somal translocation of neurogenic progenitors, we backtracked Ath5+ progenitors overexpressing the microtubule-destabilising protein Stathmin-1 using an hsp70:Stathmin1-mKate2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Icha et al., 2016a</xref>). The soma of Ath5+ progenitors expressing Stathmin-1 did not translocate as basally as the soma of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,K</xref>). In contrast, the basal somal translocation of Ath5- progenitors was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,J</xref>), indicating that only progenitors that enter the neurogenic state use stabilised microtubules for basal somal translocation. This experiment further confirmed that Ath5 expression onset is independent of somal positioning along the apicobasal axis. While both sister cells remained at very apical positions after division, only one became an Ath5+ progenitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, 10/10 divisions). This is the opposite scenario to the dominant negative dynactin condition in which cell nuclei translocated more basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,K</xref>). Thus, the asymmetry of Ath5 expression onset persisted independently of sister cell basal or apical positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these experiments showed that the greater basal somal translocation of Ath5+ progenitors is driven by a combination of basal process inheritance and the presence of apically enriched stabilised microtubules.

We found that these components indeed co-localise in retinal progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,A’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,B’</xref>). To understand whether Sara endosomes are asymmetrically distributed between progenitors upon division as suggested elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coumailleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>), we injected mRFP-Sara RNA into membrane labelled Tg(actb1:HRAS-EGFP) embryos. At all developmental stages analysed, 24, 28 and 36 hpf, asymmetric distribution of Sara endosomes was observed in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Cells mainly contained 1–3 endosomes and rarely more than that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, n = 25 dividing cells, N = 7 embryos). In most cases, one of the two sister cells inherited all endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D’</xref>),suggesting that the majority of Sara endosome related Notch signalling is dispatched to only one sister cell. We further confirmed that Tp1-expressing cells carry Sara endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) meaning that they feature active Notch signalling through the endosomal pathway at 36 hpf. Furthermore, light-sheet live imaging confirmed asymmetric distribution of Sara- endosomes during multipotent retinal progenitor divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,E’</xref>). These experiments indicated that Notch signalling is asymmetrically partitioned through Sara-positive endosomes. Thus, Sara-endosomes inheritance could mediate asymmetric neurogenic commitment in the retina. Our finding that Ath5+ progenitors never displayed active Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) is in agreement with this notion. Combined, these findings argue that the depletion of Sara endosomes is linked to Ath5+ fate. We propose that Sara endosomes are mostly inherited by the Ath5- cell, which retains high Notch signalling and thus stays in the proliferative state (see working model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Notch signalling affects neurogenic commitment through Sara endosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-localisation of Sara-positive endosomes (RFP-Sara, magenta) and DeltaC staining (cyan) in 36 hpf embryos.

We found that the number of Ath5+ cells was greatly reduced compared to controls upon Sara inhibition, leading to the presence of fewer neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At the same time, the number of Tp1-positive cells increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F’</xref>) suggesting an increase in active Notch signalling in both daughter cells. This is the opposite scenario of what is observed upon Notch signalling inhibition which led to the generation of more neurogenic progenitors through an increase in symmetric neurogenic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,H,I</xref>). We excluded the possibility that this decrease in Ath5+ progenitor emergence is due to cells not being able to divide and progress through the cell cycle before neurogenesis, as pH3 staining showed similar amounts of mitotic cells in Sara morphants as in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, Sara morphants showed a higher number of EdU-positive cells than embryos injected with control morpholino, suggesting that indeed more cells remained proliferative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>We thus speculate that depletion of Sara led to more symmetric proliferative divisions generating two Ath5- cells. This finding differs from an earlier study in which Sara depletion led to an increase of neuronal production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>). However, in this study a different neuronal lineage was investigated, raising the possibility that diverse mechanisms of Sara-mediated regulation of Notch exist that are dependent on tissue and lineage context (see discussion). Overall, these results suggest that Sara-mediated intracellular Notch signalling is necessary to create asymmetries in Notch activity among progenitors, thereby selecting the progenitors that enter the neurogenic path.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We here used long-term live imaging to explore the emergence of neurogenic progenitors in the vertebrate retina. Our study reveals that early neurogenic commitment arises via asymmetric divisions of multipotent retinal progenitors that generate one Ath5+ neurogenic progenitor and one Ath5- progenitor that will enter a different lineage. This asymmetry is regulated by Notch signalling and is important to ensure the balance between proliferating cells and cells entering differentiation routes at early neurogenesis stages. Interference with the division asymmetry leads to premature or delayed differentiation. We further provide evidence that Notch does not act through an apicobasal activity gradient as previously proposed but via the endocytic pathway. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> summarises our main findings and presents a working model.</p><p>Our quantitative imaging approach showed that progenitor divisions that generate the earliest retinal neurogenic progenitors, Ath5 positive progenitors, are reproducibly asymmetric. Notch inhibition leads to more symmetric neurogenic divisions producing two neurogenic progenitors. This explains the increase in the total number of neurons at the lineage level, adding to previous findings that investigated this issue at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 1997</xref>). This increase in symmetric divisions eventually leads to the premature exhaustion of multipotent progenitors.</p><p>In line with our findings, it has been shown earlier that Notch is involved in asymmetric divisions that generate two different neurons or one neuron and one proliferative cell in other neural systems. including the vertebrate spinal cord and mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mizutani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>). For the early neurogenic progenitor divisions in the retina investigated here, it was speculated that Notch acts via a signalling gradient along the apicobasal axis of the neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murciano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Bene et al., 2008</xref>). It was further proposed that more basally translocating progenitors are more likely to become neurogenic, generating two neurons after the next division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murciano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baye and Link, 2007</xref>). This led to the hypothesis that Notch signalling acts mainly at the apical side of the neuroepithelium where it suppresses neurogenic fate. However, due to technical challenges at the time, these analyses could only take a small number of unrelated cells into consideration. It was reported in one of these previous studies that tissue wide treatment of chick retinae with cytochalasin B led to increased premature neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murciano et al., 2002</xref>). However, no tracking of nuclei was performed and the tissue wide effects that such drug treatment entail, including cell delamination, were not further investigated. We thus aimed to manipulate nuclear position affecting single cells, to have the possibility to track the basal translocation patterns of large cohorts of sister cells. This generated a more quantitative and direct assessment of the effects of nuclear positioning during IKNM on neurogenesis in the context of the first asymmetric neurogenic divisions. We indeed found that the more basally translocating sister cell is more likely to enter the Ath5+ lineage. However, when the entirety of Ath5+ cells was taken into account, a significant overlap of basal positioning of Ath5+ and Ath5- cohorts was observed. In addition, the asymmetry of neurogenic commitment persisted when the translocation position of sister cells was levelled towards either the basal or the apical side. Together, this shows that somal position along the apicobasal axis of the retinal neuroepithelium does not influence asymmetric neurogenic commitment.</p><p>Instead, we present evidence that it is the asymmetric partitioning of Sara endosomes that drives the asymmetry of retinal progenitor divisions to enter the neurogenic pathway. A similar idea was previously proposed for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory organ precursor and the zebrafish spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coumailleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>). Ideally, we would have directly correlated Sara-positive endosomes inheritance with neurogenic or proliferative fate occurrence in numerous cells. However, this correlation could not be systematically quantified over several instances of asymmetric divisions in our system, due to its complexity and long timeframes between division and fate readout. Nevertheless, we could follow one division in which Sara endosomes were asymmetrically inherited and assess the fate of the sister cells. As expected, the cell inheriting all endosomes became the Ath5- progenitor and thus remained proliferative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>), while the cell that did not inherit Sara endosomes started Ath5 expression and thereby entered the neurogenic lineage (see working model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). This outcome is in line with the finding that Ath5+ cells do not show active Notch signalling. These observations, combined with the finding that asymmetric inheritance is observed at stages at which asymmetric Ath5 decisions occur and that Sara knockdown impairs the balance between proliferation and neurogenesis in the Ath5 lineage, strongly argue that Notch signalling via Sara-positive endosomes is important for lineage asymmetry in the retina. The asymmetric distribution of Sara-positive endosomes most likely leads to the downregulation of Notch in one sister cell. When Sara is depleted however, more progenitors seem to express active Notch signalling, leading to a reduced amount of neurogenic Ath5+ cells at early neurogenic stages. This finding is different from what was presented in an earlier study that investigated the role of Sara endosomes on neurogenesis in the zebrafish spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressmann et al., 2015</xref>). Here, Sara depletion (mutant and morphant) had the same effect as direct inhibition of Notch signalling, namely the premature production of neurons. This argues that Sara can fine-tune Notch activity differently in different ttissues and neuronal lineage contexts. We speculate that in the context of the early retinal lineages we studied, asymmetric neurogenic decisions are influenced and regulated by Sara protein that guides the asymmetric dispatch of these endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coumailleau et al., 2009</xref>), consequently downregulating Notch in one of the sister cells and promoting Notch in the other. When Sara is not present however, Notch continues to be active. In this case, Notch distribution between sister cells is not regulated any more through the endosomal pathway, so it cannot be depleted from one sister cell during division, and as a consequence more cells maintain high Notch activity. These additional cells then also stay in the proliferative state, leading to a decrease in the number of neurogenic cells. The exact mechanism of how Sara fine-tunes lineage decisions in different contexts will be interesting to explore in future studies. One factor could be the commitment state of neurogenic progenitors which differs between spinal cord and retina, but this point will need further investigation.</p><p>It should be noted that our systematic analysis not only enhances the understanding of Notch signalling in this particular neurogenesis event, but also shows the importance of quantitative approaches in developmental systems. Only due to the analysis of large cohorts of sister cells combined with a backtracking approach could we achieve the depth of analysis needed to exclude the role of a possible Notch gradient, which led to the investigation of the Notch endocytic pathway. The advance of imaging techniques, image analysis algorithms, and the possibility of performing backtracking studies in the retina are exciting emerging tools to follow similar questions in future studies. Such sophisticated studies will in turn promote our understanding of reproducibility and/or plasticity of lineage decisions at diverse developmental stages in different tissues of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zechner et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fact that basal position is not directly linked to Ath5+ fate commitment, we find that the majority of progenitors entering the Ath5 lineage nevertheless translocate their somas more basally than their Ath5- sister cell. This observation argues that the more basal translocation of neurogenic Ath5+ progenitors is a consequence of neurogenic commitment, rather than a cause for it. We find that basal translocation of Ath5+ progenitors is linked to apically localised stabilised microtubules and basal process inheritance. This is remarkably similar to what has been shown for somal translocation events of retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Icha et al., 2016a</xref>). By contrast, this is different to nuclear and thereby somal translocation during IKNM in multipotent progenitors, which has been shown to be caused by passive nuclear displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kosodo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, an interesting interpretation of these findings could be that Ath5+ progenitors constitute an intermediate cell type placed between multipotent progenitors and differentiating neurons at the level of cellular arrangements including cytoskeletal components. This is reminiscent of intermediate progenitors found in the mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haubensak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noctor et al., 2004</xref>). To our knowledge, the existence of such intermediate progenitors has not been thoroughly investigated in the retina. However, a recent study performing single cell RNA sequencing of mouse retinae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) hints that a transitional state of retinal progenitors that express atoh7 and other neurogenic genes could exist. Therefore, it will be interesting to probe how cytoskeletal changes could be linked to these cell identity changes in the developing retina and beyond. Such studies will lead to new insights into the biology of fate decisions downstream of transcription profiles and towards the cell biological scale.</p><p>Asymmetric progenitor divisions are an important mean to maintain the balance between proliferation and differentiation in developing organs. To understand the regulation of these types of divisions and thereby embryogenesis as a whole, their investigation needs to span scales from the molecular to the cellular to the tissue level. Furthermore, investigations need to combine knowledge of cell type specific transcription factor profiles, the signalling factors involved in guiding fate decisions and the cell biological consequences that differentiation entails. The emerging possibilities of quantitative in vivo studies mentioned above in combination with the advent of single-cell sequencing data that is becoming more and more extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wagner and Klein, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), opens new perspectives for an understanding of these phenomena at a previously unimaginable level.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Nerli et al. addresses the molecular control of the first neurogenic divisions in the developing zebrafish retina. Progenitors fated to become neurons express the transcription factor Ath5. Using Ath5-driven transgenic lines in live light-sheet microscopy to retrospectively track neurogenic progenitors, the authors demonstrate that these progenitors originate from divisions that are asymmetric in fate (one daughter cell becoming Ath5+) and in Notch signaling (the Ath5- daughter is Notch signaling high, as revealed using her4- or TP1-driven transgenes), the latter being necessary for the Ath5- fate. The remainder of the paper then aims to identify the mechanism by which a Notch signaling asymmetry is generated between daughter cells at the onset of neurogenic divisions. The work reported specifically addresses and challenges the conclusions made by previous studies that interkinetic nuclear migration combined with an apicobasal Notch gradient exposes progenitor nuclei to different Notch signaling levels. This hypothesis is ruled out here using a series of elegant experiments tracing individual nuclei and modifying their position by means of manipulating dynactin or stathmin. The authors then address the alternative hypothesis of intra-lineage signaling with an implication of Sara endosomes, as previously shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Coumailleau et al., 2009) and zebrafish neural progenitors of the embryonic spinal cord (Kressmann et al., 2015). The authors observe (using overexpression of fluo-Sara mRNA) Sara endosomes carrying Notch1b and DeltaC proteins in retinal progenitors, and an asymmetric distribution of Sara endosomes in daughter cells. Knocking-down Sara (using a Sara MO) generates fewer neurons and an increased number of TP1-positive cells. The authors conclude that neurogenic asymmetry is driven by the asymmetric segregation of Sara endosomes, driving asymmetric Notch signaling in retinal progenitors.</p><p>This is a largely well-executed and nicely written piece of work. It convincingly rules out the previous hypothesis of apicobasal nuclear positioning, which had driven the field for years although solely based on in situ hybridization data. This in itself is important. However, the &quot;positive&quot; mechanistic data implying Sara endosomes remains correlative and describes a mechanism that has been previously reported. It is also at odds with previously published work (Kressmann et al., 2015). Key experiments directly implicating Sara endosomes in division asymmetry, asymmetrical Notch signaling and asymmetrical fate are lacking and should be provided to support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors report one case (=1 division) where Sara endosomes are concentrated in the Ath5- daughter cell. Attempts should be made to confirm this result. Live imaging may not be doable, but fixed material, where daughter cells are mosaically labeled could be analyzed for Ath5 and TP1 expression. This is crucial, as Sara is associated with the progenitor fate in the spinal cord (Kressmann et al), is postulated (but not shown) to have the same association here, but when depleted leads to more progenitors (Figure 5E, F and see point 3 below).</p><p>2) The effects of the Sara MO are suggestive of increased Notch signaling and symmetric proliferative, as opposed to asymmetric neurogenic, divisions. However, these hypotheses are not demonstrated directly. It could be possible, for example, that progenitors are blocked at the pre-division phase. The authors should directly show, using live cell tracking, that divisions become symmetric proliferative, generating two Ath5- (or TP1+) cells in the absence of Sara.</p><p>3) The results of the Sara MO experiments are strikingly different from those of Kressmann et al. In the present report, Sara knock-down leads to increased Notch signaling; in the spinal cord, Kressmann et al. showed that Sara knock-down led to decreased Notch signaling and a loss of the progenitor fate. Nerli et al. state &quot;We propose that Sara endosomes are mostly inherited by the Ath5- cell, which retains high Notch signaling and thus stays in the proliferative state&quot; and, under Sara knock-down: &quot;there is an increase in active Notch signaling in both daughter cells as postulated by our working model&quot;. These two statements, which a appear contradictory, and the discrepancies with the work of Kressmann et al., should absolutely be discussed. What is the authors' hypothesis on how Sara endosomes would associate with the future progenitor cell and increased Notch signaling, but lead to more progenitor cells and more Notch when functionally depleted?</p><p>4) Figure 3: The Notch1b and DeltaC fluorescent antibody stainings have a lot of background and the brain is equally stained. Proper negative controls are needed for the Notch1b antibody. This means, controls should be performed using specimen lacking Notch1b (e.g. mutants or morphants), rather than specimen where the primary antibody is omitted (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Also, could colorimetric in situs be performed? Given that the del Bene paper argued that it was notch1a, deltaB and deltaC RNA that was graded along the apicobasal axis of the retina, these in situ hybridization experiments should be repeated, in addition to the antibody stainings.</p><p>5) How do the authors reconcile that they did not observe graded DeltaC expression, whereas in the del Bene paper the RNA and antibody of DeltaC looks indeed graded? Murciano et al. (Figure 1C), also show clear Notch1 accumulation basally in the chicken retina, which should be discussed.</p><p>6) The author's state: “Heat shock expression of the hsp70:DNdynactin-mKate2 construct led to the translocation of both sister cell somas to greater and almost identical basal positions compared to controls. However, despite the fact that both sister cell somas reached very basal positions, only one became Ath5+.”</p><p>Murciano et al., also pharmacologically inhibited internuclear migration but saw and effect on neurogenesis. This finding should be discussed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Asymmetric neurogenic commitment of retinal progenitors is regulated via the Notch endocytic pathway&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Overall, this work is important in that it demonstrates the existence of asymmetric neurogenic divisions in the developing retina and rules out, in a clean and convincing way, previous hypotheses on graded Notch signaling along the apicobasal axis. The authors took the reviewer's comments to heart and adequately addressed critiques 1-6. However, the manuscript still shows a weakness in identifying the mechanism controlling this asymmetry. One key aspect that remains undemonstrated is the fact that Sara endosomes are involved in the asymmetry of progenitor division (requested revisions point 2). It is unclear why the authors state that live imaging is not possible to monitor symmetric divisions in Sara morphants, while the same method was used in the case of LY411575 application (Figure 1I). The absence of experiments showing that cell divisions become symmetric, diminishes the Sara-related message.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are enthusiastic about the work but believe that in the absence of live imaging of cell divisions in Sara morphants, it is important not to overstate the function of Sara, irrespective of how logical it may seem.</p><p>The authors already changed the text to state that they speculate that cell divisions become symmetric after Sara MO but key titles and sentences were not correspondingly changed. For example: (i) title of paragraph &quot;Asymmetric inheritance of Sara-positive endosomes affects the asymmetry of neurogenic commitment&quot; – the MO manipulation does not affect the asymmetric inheritance of Sara endosome but their overall presence, and the effect on asymmetrical neurogenic commitment is not shown; (ii) title of Figure 5 &quot;Sara-positive endosomes affect the asymmetry of divisions generating Ath5+ progenitors&quot;, and.… (iii) the title of the paper &quot;Asymmetric neurogenic commitment of retinal progenitors is regulated via the Notch endocytic pathway&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60462.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors report one case (=1 division) where Sara endosomes are concentrated in the Ath5- daughter cell.

This strongly argues that indeed Notch signaling is not active in cells starting to express Ath5 and our finding that Sara depletion increases the number of Tp1 positive cells and decreases the number of Ath5 positive cells argues that indeed Sara is responsible for a balanced distribution of this signaling pathway component (see also our interpretation on the Sara related pathway in point 3). In addition, we confirmed that Tp1 positive cells indeed carry Sara endosomes (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effects of the Sara MO are suggestive of increased Notch signaling and symmetric proliferative, as opposed to asymmetric neurogenic, divisions. However, these hypotheses are not demonstrated directly. It could be possible, for example, that progenitors are blocked at the pre-division phase. The authors should directly show, using live cell tracking, that divisions become symmetric proliferative, generating two Ath5- (or TP1+) cells in the absence of Sara.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point brought up by the reviewers and we previously had this idea ourselves. However, when we started to outline the actual experiments, we noted that we made a thinking mistake as this experiment is close to impossible to carry out. The reason is that at the stage at which the Ath5+ progenitors arise, most other progenitors still undergo symmetric proliferative divisions, generating two Ath5- cells, also in the control situation. Thus, finding symmetric proliferative Ath5- divisions would be the norm, not the exception, and it would not be feasible to detect an increase in symmetric proliferative divisions upon Sara knockdown with the cohort size that is possible in live-imaging experiments. We believe however that the experiments in response to Q1 and Q3 are convincing to substantiate our general hypothesis.</p><p>Nonetheless, to further underline this notion, we excluded the possibility that progenitors are stalled before or during division using pH3 staining. We find a similar amount of divisions in Sara morphants as in controls. This data in now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. Moreover, consistent with the hypothesis that Sara knockdown leads to more symmetric proliferative divisions, we demonstrate that morphant embryos feature a higher level of proliferation, an expected consequence for an increase in the number of symmetric proliferative divisions, shown by quantification of EdU labelling in controls versus Sara morphants (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C, D) at stages at which in control progenitors already leave the cell cycle and become Ath5+ (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, control embryos, and Figure 1 E, F, control embryos). These experiments confirm that the balance between proliferation and differentiation is changed in Sara morphants.</p><p>Nevertheless, as we do understand the reviewer’s point, we tuned down our statement to “We thus speculate that depletion of Sara led to more symmetric proliferative divisions generating two Ath5- cells.”.</p><p>We also added a statement and compare our findings to previous findings and added a paragraph in the Discussion (see also point 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results of the Sara MO experiments are strikingly different from those of Kressmann et al.

What is the authors' hypothesis on how Sara endosomes would associate with the future progenitor cell and increased Notch signaling, but lead to more progenitor cells and more Notch when functionally depleted?</p></disp-quote><p>While these two statements might on first sight sound slightly counterintuitive, we do not believe that they contradict each other. Our interpretation is the following: In the control scenario, in which the Sara protein is expressed, Sara-positive endosomes are linked to Notch signaling and can be unequally distributed during cell divisions generating imbalances/asymmetries/differences in Notch activity among progenitor cells. While the cell inheriting the endosomes and high notch activity remains a progenitor, its sister cell is depleted of Notch and enters neurogenesis. However, when Sara is depleted from all the cells by morpholino knockdown, Notch continues to be active. In this case, Notch distribution between sister cells is not regulated any more through the endosomal pathway, so it cannot be depleted from one sister cell during division. Consequently, more cells maintain high Notch activity (Figure 5F), leading to increased proliferation and decreased neurogenesis (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). This argues that Sara is responsible for controlled Notch distribution between sister cells.</p><p>Thus, the differences in outcome between retina and spinal cord imply that the fine-tuning of Notch depends on the specific neuronal system and lineage in which it is acting. One of these differences could be different commitment states in the lineages as seen between the spinal cord and the retina. The exact mechanisms of how this fine-tuning of Notch signaling through Sara-positive endosomes occurs will be interesting to explore in future studies.</p><p>We now discuss this point more explicitly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3: The Notch1b and DeltaC fluorescent antibody stainings have a lot of background and the brain is equally stained. Proper negative controls are needed for the Notch1b antibody. This means, controls should be performed using specimen lacking Notch1b (e.g. mutants or morphants), rather than specimen where the primary antibody is omitted (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Also, could colorimetric in situs be performed? Given that the del Bene paper argued that it was notch1a, deltaB and deltaC RNA that was graded along the apicobasal axis of the retina, these in situ hybridization experiments should be repeated, in addition to the antibody stainings.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added further controls and used the Notch1b and DeltaC antibodies on respective morphants (we used established morpholinos as the timeframe of the revisions and COVID situation did not allow for importing mutants).</p><p>In both cases, especially strong in the Notch scenario, we see disappearance or strong reduction of antibody staining compared to the control situation. Thus, we are confident that the antibody staining of controls is genuine in both scenarios (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B).</p><p>We further performed in situ hybridization for notch1a and deltaC, similar to experiments done in del Bene et al., 2008. We show the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> as we do not believe that they significantly add to the manuscript. We note that our staining looks very similar to what was reported by del Bene (their Figure 5 A-C). However, as these are RNA probes, we believe that the antibody experiments are more meaningful as they reflect the protein localization. Despite the fact that there might be some graded RNA distribution, which is hard to tell at this resolution, our findings that there is no correlation between apicobasal nuclear positioning and neurogenic fate determination shows that such an RNA gradient, if existent, does not influence neurogenic potential.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>In situ hybridization showing mRNA expression levels of notch1b (left) and deltaC (right).</title><p>RNA probes targeting notch receptor 1b and deltaC were synthesized with digoxigenin label.

Furthermore, in the Del Bene paper staining was performed using a different DeltaC antibody. We here used a DeltaC antibody that has been shown to be specific in zebrafish (see Wright et al., 2011 Development, Giudicelli, 2007 Plos Biology and others). It is not uncommon that RNA distribution and protein distribution slightly differ in tissues (shown in Spirov et al., 2009 for the bicoid mRNA and protein, and in Toyoda et al., 2010 for Fgf8 in the mouse telencephalon). However, as noted above, the fact that apicobasal nuclear positioning does not influence neurogenic fate determination shows that apicobasal graded distribution of Notch/Delta, if existent at the RNA level, is independent of neurogenic potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The author's state: “Heat shock expression of the hsp70:DNdynactin-mKate2 construct led to the translocation of both sister cell somas to greater and almost identical basal positions compared to controls.

This finding should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>It is hard to interpret the differences between our study and the previous study in which nuclear movement was blocked by a tissue wide cytochalasin B (CCB) treatment (Figure 5 in Murciano et al., 2002) due to the fact that CCB not only blocks IKNM (which was not explicitly shown as only fixed samples were presented) but also interferes with diverse other cellular processes such as cytokinesis (shown by the increase of mitotic figures in Figure 5B) and can lead to cell delamination (which could explain the non-apical mitotic cells observed in Figure 5B). It was not investigated which, if not all, of these effects apply in the previously presented scenario. Thus, it is hard to decipher in hindsight, the exact contributions that led to the increase in neurogenesis as division patterns (e.g. symmetric versus asymmetric) were not explored in this study.</p><p>In contrast, for our experiments we used genetic interference in single cells in an otherwise untreated neuroepithelium. Neither of the two independent genetic conditions, one that keeps cell soma at more apical positions and another one that sends cell soma more basally, had an influence on the asymmetric division patterns of cells producing one Ath5 positive sister cell. This fact makes us confident that the extent of basal migration does not influence the asymmetry of divisions leading to one neurogenic Ath5+ daughter cell.</p><p>We now added a brief statement discussing this item in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the reviewers are enthusiastic about the work but believe that in the absence of live imaging of cell divisions in Sara morphants, it is important not to overstate the function of Sara, irrespective of how logical it may seem.</p><p>The authors already changed the text to state that they speculate that cell divisions become symmetric after Sara MO but key titles and sentences were not correspondingly changed.

We changed:</p><p>– The title of the paper to “Asymmetric neurogenic commitment of retinal progenitors involves Notch through the endocytic pathway”;</p><p>– The title of the subsection to “Notch signalling affects neurogenic commitment of progenitors through Sara endosomes;”</p><p>– The title of Figure 5 to “Notch signalling affects neurogenic commitment of progenitors through Sara endosomes”.</p><p>We also like to take this opportunity to further clarify why we cannot monitor symmetric division with live imaging in Sara morphants as we did upon Notch inhibition. In the case of Notch inhibition using the LY411575 inhibitor, we showed that more symmetric neurogenic divisions occur, and more cells express Ath5 (Figure 1E, H). This experiment was possible as in this condition, both sister cells start expressing Ath5+, while in control conditions only one sister expresses Ath5 (Figure 1B) meaning we could use the onset of fluorescence as a readout. In Sara morphants however, fewer Ath5+ cells are present (Figure 5F) and we would expect to observe more symmetric proliferative divisions, in which both progenitors do not express Ath5.</p><p>However, as this type of symmetric proliferative divisions normally occurs also for the majority of cells in controls, we do not have a positive readout for cells that would have turned on Ath5 but do not do so in the Sara morphant condition. What we did show is an increase in the number of proliferative cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C) and a decrease in the number of Ath5+ cells (Figure 5F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C), which in our opinion can only be explained by an increase of symmetric proliferative divisions generating two Ath5- progenitors at the expenses of asymmetric neurogenic divisions. We hope this clarifies this issue, but we agree that tuning down our statements further improves the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
