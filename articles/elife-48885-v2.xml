bacterial colonies lead to intricate spatiotemporal dynamics, which can affect their growth and survival. Here, we describe the emergence of complex structures in a colony grown from mixtures of motile and non-motile bacterial species on a soft agar surface. Time-lapse imaging shows that non-motile bacteria 'hitchhike' on the motile bacteria as the latter migrate outward. The non-motile bacteria accumulate at the boundary of the colony and trigger an instability that leaves behind striking flower-like patterns. The mechanism of the front instability governing this pattern formation is elucidated by a mathematical model for the frictional motion of the colony interface, with friction depending on the local concentration of the non-motile species. A more elaborate two-dimensional phase-field model that explicitly accounts for the interplay between growth, mechanical stress from the motile species, and friction provided by the non-motile species, fully reproduces the observed flower-like patterns.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Communities of bacteria and other microbes live in every ecosystem on Earth, including in soil, in hydrothermal vents, on the surface of plants and in the human gut. They often attach to solid surfaces and form dense colonies called biofilms. Most biofilms found in nature are comprised of many different species of bacteria. How the bacteria interact shapes the internal structures of these communities.</p><p>Many previous studies have focused on the molecules that bacteria use to relate to each other, for example, some bacteria exchange nutrients or release toxins that are harmful to their neighbors. However, it is less clear how direct physical contacts between bacteria affect the whole community.</p><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a rod-shaped bacterium that is a good swimmer, but has a hard time moving on solid surfaces. Therefore, when a droplet of liquid containing these bacteria is placed in a Petri dish containing a jelly-like substance called agar, the droplet barely expands over a 24-hour period. On the other hand, a droplet containing another rod-shaped bacterium known as <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> expands rapidly on agar because these bacteria are able to crawl using microscopic “legs” called pili.</p><p>Here, Xiong et al. set out to investigate how a colony containing both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> developed on a solid surface. The experiments showed that when a droplet of liquid containing both species was placed on agar, both species grew and spread rapidly, as if the <italic>E. coli</italic> hitchhiked on the highly motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> cells. Furthermore, the growing colony developed a complex flower-like shape. Xiong et al. developed mathematical models that took into account how quickly each species generally grows, their ability to move, the friction between cells and the agar, and other physical properties. The models predicted that the <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that accumulate at the expanding boundary of the colony make the boundary unstable, leading to the flower-like patterns.</p><p>Further analysis suggested that similar patterns may form in other situations when motile and non-motile species of bacteria are together. These findings may help us understand the origins of the complex structures observed in many naturally occurring communities of bacteria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>motility</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>front instability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM069811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsimring</surname><given-names>Lev</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Liyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasty</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1707637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yuansheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Rappel</surname><given-names>Wouter-Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>San Diego Center for Systems Biology (P50-GM085764)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsimring</surname><given-names>Lev</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Liyang</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasty</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-16-1-2093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsimring</surname><given-names>Lev</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Liyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical interactions between bacterial species with different motility characteristics play an important role in spatial-temporal dynamics of multi-species bacterial colonies and can lead to formation of complex patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial communities inhabit every ecosystem on Earth, from soil to hydrothermal vents to plants to the human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moyer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fierer and Jackson, 2006</xref>). They often form dense biofilms, whose structures are shaped by biological, chemical, and physical factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stoodley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stubbendieck et al., 2016</xref>). In the wild, most biofilms are comprised of multiple bacterial strains. They feature a diverse repertoire of social interactions, including cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Jacob et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffin et al., 2004</xref>), competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hibbing et al., 2010</xref>), and predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jürgens and Matz, 2002</xref>). Bacteria often signal, sense, and respond to each other through secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Traxler et al., 2013</xref>) or antibiotic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garbeva et al., 2014</xref>), and co-cultures can even exhibit different motility from either species on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCully et al., 2019</xref>). These interactions may lead to the emergence of complex spatial structures, which can have a profound effect on bacteria survival and function, and promote biodiversity by optimizing the division of labor within the biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>). Spatial structure can also enhance horizontal gene transfer among different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to biochemical interactions, mechanical forces also play an important role in shaping the structure of bacterial communities. In dense colonies, bacteria push against each other due to growth and motility. Bacteria can exploit these mechanical interactions to adapt to the environment. For example, mechanical stresses cause buckling in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> biofilms that allows them to improve nutrient transport and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asally et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trejo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilking et al., 2013</xref>). Although the role of mechanical interactions in single-species colonies has been studied previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Volfson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xavier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kearns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Persat et al., 2015</xref>), dynamics of multi-species communities driven by mechanical forces have received much less attention. Since bacterial strains can have significant differences in their growth and motility characteristics, one can expect the development of highly-heterogeneous mechanical stress distribution, which in turn can result in a complex spatiotemporal dynamics of the colony.</p><p>To study the interactions between bacterial species with distinct biological and physical properties, we choose <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic>, a gram-negative bacterium that easily moves on soft surfaces using twitching motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harshey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bitrian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leong et al., 2017</xref>), and an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that is almost non-motile on soft agar. Additionally, wild-type <italic>A. baylyi</italic> possesses a Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) that enables them to kill other bacteria (including <italic>E. coli</italic>) on direct contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2017</xref>). We found that when these two strains are mixed together and inoculated on an agar surface, growing colonies develop intricate flower-like structures that are absent when either species is grown by itself.</p><p>To shed light on the mechanism behind this intricate pattern formation, we tested whether biological cell-cell communication or mechanical interaction between strains with different motilities played the key role. Experiments with <italic>A. baylyi</italic> mutants lacking T6SS showed that the pattern formation did not rely on this system. On the other hand, genetically impairing <italic>A. baylyi</italic> motility eliminated the patterns entirely. We also demonstrated that agar concentration affects cell motility and plays an important role in pattern formation. These findings suggested that the mechanical interactions between species are indeed primarily responsible for the pattern formation.</p><p>We then formulated and analyzed two models: a geometrical model of the colony boundary motion and a 2D phase-field model of the entire colony, to describe the mechanical interactions between two species. Our results show that growth and cell motility differences are sufficient to explain the emerging patterns. Since the mechanism of flower-like pattern formation is rather general, it may be broadly generalizable to other multi-species colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flower-like patterns in mixtures of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> on nutrient-rich soft agar</title><p>We inoculated a mixture of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> cells with an initial density ratio of 10:1 at the center of a Petri dish filled with soft LB agar (0.5% agar).

Up to 8 hr after inoculation, the expanding colony remained nearly uniform and circular. Then the colony front began to visibly undulate. As the colony expanded further, the undulations grew and formed cusps that in turn would leave behind tracks (or ‘branches’). These branches then merged, following the movement of cusps along the interface as the colony continued to expand. The branches were visible even in bright-field imaging, but they were also bright in the teal fluorescence channel, indicating that branches consisted of relatively more <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flower-like patterns in mixtures of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The pattern after 3 days of growth on a 0.5% LB agar surface.

The colony boundary was parameterized by 300 virtual ‘nodes’ connected by springs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machacek and Danuser, 2006</xref>). For each node, we measured local brightness (a proxy for <italic>E. coli</italic> concentration), front speed and front curvature. To offset the non-uniformity of the illumination and the overall change in speed and curvature for a growing colony, we detrended the data. The kymographs of these quantities for each node are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. Then we computed correlations between these quantities within the time window when the pattern began to form (about 9.5–11.5 hr after inoculation). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> (left), the brightness and expansion speed show strong anti-correlation (Pearson coefficient ρ=−0.67). This result confirms that higher <italic>E. coli</italic> density slows down the front propagation.

We tested this by knocking out T6SS in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (see Materials and methods for details). The growth rate of T6SS<sup>− </sup><italic>A. baylyi</italic> (1.09 ± 0.01 h<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>n</italic>=3) was not significantly different from the wild type, but their motility was slightly lower as determined by colony expansion rate. Still, their motility remained much higher than <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We inoculated mixtures of T6SS<sup>− </sup><italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> with different initial ratios on 0.75% LB agar, and observed that the colony formed an outer ring of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and subsequently developed front instability, branches of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and a flower-like pattern in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The only qualitative difference between the T6SS<sup>−</sup> and T6SS<sup>+</sup> cases was that in the non-killing case, <italic>E. coli</italic> remained at a high concentration within the area of the initial inoculum. We measured the average radius of the colonies with different initial density ratios 16 hr after inoculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, n = 3). In the case of a mixture of T6SS<sup>− </sup><italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, the more <italic>E. coli</italic> in the inoculum, the slower the colony expanded, which is consistent with our hypothesis that <italic>E. coli</italic> hinders the overall colony expansion. However, the trend is not as significant for the T6SS<sup>+</sup> case, likely because T6SS<sup>+</sup> <italic>A. baylyi</italic> kill most <italic>E. coli</italic> at the early stage, which increases and stabilizes the effective A:E ratio. We also counted the number of branches as they first emerged, when their circumferences were roughly the same, and found more branches in colonies seeded with less <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, n = 3). In general, the overall structure of the patterns remained unchanged in the mixture of T6SS<sup>− </sup><italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Thus, we concluded that the T6SS did not play a major role in the formation of flower-like patterns.</p><p>Third, the fact that two-species colonies expanded much more quickly than pure <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies strongly suggested that the high motility of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> is primarily responsible for the colony expansion. To test this hypothesis, we knocked out the <italic>pilTU</italic> locus of T6SS<sup>+</sup> <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, which is required for the pilus-based twitching motility of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leong et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, colonies of <italic>pilTU<sup>−</sup> A. baylyi</italic> cells did not expand significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, top) and did not form branching patterns when mixed with <italic>E. coli</italic> cells on 0.75% LB agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, bottom). The results were the same when the colonies grew on other concentrations of LB agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This demonstrates that the high <italic>A. baylyi</italic> motility plays a crucial role in the flower-like pattern formation.</p><p>Finally, we tested the pattern formation in mixtures of motile and non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (see Appendix 3). We found that flower-like patterns emerged in this case as well, which confirms the key role of the difference in motility for pattern formation. The patterns were less pronounced, but this can be probably explained by the fact that other physical parameters of non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (such as growth rates and effective friction) are more similar to motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> than <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pattern-forming instability originates at the colony interface</title><p>Experiments showed that the formation of flower-like patterns appears to be preceded and caused by growing undulations of the colony front, where <italic>E. coli</italic> cells concentrate and locally slow expansion.

Each node carries a fixed amount of <italic>E. coli</italic>, so the local density of nodes per unit length of the interface corresponds to the local density of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Nodes are driven by a constant outwards expansion force <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, surface tension, and a friction force that is proportional to the window-weighted average density of nodes per unit length. Additionally, we introduced short-range repulsive forces between nodes and between nodes and links, to prevent self-crossing of the interface. Detailed description of this model is also given in Appendix 1.</p><p>As an initial condition, we assumed that the chain forms a circle with nodes slightly perturbed from equidistant positions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> shows time-lapse snapshots of the interface in a sample simulation (also see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> shows the aggregate image of the interface during the colony expansion, with the color of a point corresponding to inverse local density of nodes when the interface passed through that point (also see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Assuming that a fixed fraction of <italic>E. coli</italic> is left behind the interface, this interface ‘fossil record’ should roughly correspond to the density of <italic>E. coli</italic> inside the colony. At the beginning, the interface remains nearly circular, but initial perturbations quickly grow as the colony expands, producing large front undulations. Regions with lower node density expand more quickly because they experience less friction, and this expansion stretches the chain and further reduces the node density per unit length, creating a positive feedback loop. Concave regions, on the contrary, accumulate nodes and thus move outward more slowly. Eventually, cusps are formed in these lagging regions that have very high node density and therefore move very slowly, if at all. The regions on both sides of the cusp continue to expand toward each other and eventually ‘collide’. After collision they form ‘double-layers’ that remain nearly static and only increase in length as the overall interface expands further. Thus, ‘branches’ with high concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic> form. As the front continues to expand, the interface already containing branches continues to undulate and form new cusps. This causes the earlier branches to merge, similar to what we observed in experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These simulation results suggest that indeed branch formation and merging can be explained by mechanics of a resistive ring surrounding a colony, which is stretched by the colony expansion. However, since this model neglects <italic>E. coli</italic> growth, the average density of nodes per unit length gradually decays, and eventually, the front instability ceases, in divergence with experimental results. To account for cell growth as well as for the diffusive leakage of <italic>E. coli</italic> from the interface into the bulk of the expanding colony, we developed a more elaborate 2D model of the growing multi-species colony.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48885-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>A sample simulation of the discrete colony interface model.</title></caption></media><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48885-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>A pattern forming as a ‘fossil record’ of node colors (corresponding to <italic>E. coli</italic> density on the interface) in the discrete interface model simulation of <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phase-field model of flower-like pattern formation</title><p>We also developed a more detailed two-dimensional, multi-component model of the expanding bacterial colony that is conceptually similar to the phase-field models used for description of eukaryotic cell motility and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camley et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

The frictional force in our model consists of two contributions: a small basal friction (characterized by parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and stronger contribution proportional to the local <italic>E. coli</italic> concentration with coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In this paper, we studied the structure of growing colonies comprised of two bacterial species, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, with very different motilities. Not only did the highly-motile species (<italic>A. baylyi</italic>) accelerate the spread of the slow species (<italic>E. coli</italic>), but the structure of the expanding colony quickly became highly heterogeneous and eventually produced very intricate, flower-like patterns.</p><p>Bacterial colonies can expand on a surface in a variety of ways, assisted by volumetric pressure from cell growth and division, multiple types of motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harshey, 2003</xref>), chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben Amar, 2013</xref>), osmotic pressure gradients from the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seminara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dilanji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>), secretion of surfactants that assist wetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kearns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trinschek et al., 2017</xref>), etc, and these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In our case, we found that the key, necessary driver for expansion of mixed <italic>A. baylyi</italic>/<italic>E. coli</italic> colonies is the motility of <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. The expansion force appears to be mediated by cells physically bumping into and pushing each other, as colonies do not begin to expand outward until they reach a near confluent monolayer density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Before this point, motility in the interior can simply result in cell rearrangement, but once a confluent monolayer is reached, growth combined with motility begins to push the boundary outward. In our models, the effective expansion and friction forces are physically and experimentally motivated, but it is unclear to what extent the effective forces result from true friction, wetting forces, etc. In future work, it would be interesting to explore the detailed mechanistic underpinnings of these forces.</p><p>Pattern formation in growing colonies of single bacterial species has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fujikawa and Matsushita, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Budrene and Berg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsushita et al., 1998</xref>), and branching patterns were often found in these experiments. The emergence of these patterns is usually driven by nutrient limitation and ensuing chemotaxis, with agar concentration also having a strong effect on their morphology. For example, colonies expand homogeneously on soft agar rich with nutrients, but under nutrient limitation and in semi-solid agar, complex patterns emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Budrene and Berg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsushita et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golding et al., 1998</xref>). In our system, however, we used rich LB media, and single-species colonies in the same conditions did not produce patterns, suggesting that the mechanism of pattern formation here is different.</p><p>Cell killing via the T6SS is an important ecological interaction, but it did not appear to play a major role in the formation of these patterns. We found no significant differences in pattern formation with T6SS<sup>+</sup> and T6SS<sup>−</sup> strains of <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. In fact, we did not observe noticeable killing of <italic>E. coli</italic> by T6SS<sup>+</sup> <italic>A. baylyi</italic> after a short initial period (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). We believe that an extracellular matrix may have played a role here, as recent studies showed that it protected bacteria from T6SS attacks from other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Molina-Santiago et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, our experiments and modeling provided strong evidence in favor of the mechanical nature of the pattern-forming instability, arising from the interplay between outward pressure generated by the growth and high motility of <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, and the friction provided by sessile <italic>E. coli</italic> that adhere to the agar surface.</p><p>Ecologically, one of the primary challenges for any species is to maximize its geographic dispersal. Motility enables bacteria to escape from local stresses, move to locations with more nutrients, or invade host tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harshey, 2003</xref>). However, motility, especially on hard surfaces, requires additional gene expression which could be a metabolic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kearns, 2010</xref>). So some bacteria take advantage of other species with larger motility to colonize new niches. For example, by hitchhiking on zooplankton, water-borne bacteria can reach places that are otherwise inaccessible for them due to density gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossart et al., 2010</xref>). Non-motile staphylococcal species hitchhike on swimming bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Samad et al., 2017</xref>). Motile swarming <italic>Paenibacillus vortex</italic> was shown to transport non-motile <italic>Xanthomonas perforans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagai et al., 2014</xref>) or <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finkelshtein et al., 2015</xref>) on agar surfaces. In our system, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> cells move by twitching instead of swarming, and our results suggest that slow-moving bacteria might take advantage of fast-moving twitching species by hitchhiking, or ‘surfing’ along the expanding boundary, and thus spread farther. This can be seen clearly from the experiment in which <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> were inoculated separately at a small distance on agar surface (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). The <italic>A. baylyi</italic> colony expanded and pushed <italic>E. coli</italic> to places where <italic>E. coli</italic> alone could not reach.</p><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48885-video6.mp4"><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>When T6SS<sup>+</sup> <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were inoculated separately on 10 mL LB agar (0.75% agar), the flower pattern formed only in a segment.</title></caption></media><p>The flower-like patterns appear to require a combination of several factors: motility of one of the two species, hitchhiking of the non-motile species with the motile one, and sufficiently strong effective friction from the non-motile strain. Indeed, no patterns form without motility of one of the species, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>. Hitchhiking appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for flower-like pattern formation. Indeed, without hitchhiking <italic>E. coli</italic> would simply be left behind and not present in the expanding colony of <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. On the other hand, we observed that <italic>E. coli</italic> also hitchhiked in round colonies (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, third panel), where patterns did not form, presumably because <italic>E. coli</italic> did not exert sufficiently strong effective friction, due to properties of the agar or too low cell density. In the phase-field model, lowering <italic>E. coli</italic>-dependent friction corresponds to reducing parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and indeed, for small <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, patterns do not form. Additionally, higher growth rate of the non-motile strain facilitates formation of a dense ring around the expanding colony, which makes patterns more robust. We also observed flower-like patterns when <italic>E. coli</italic> was replaced with non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> strain, but they were less robust, presumably because the growth rate of the non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> strain was lower than that of the motile one, although it is also possible that the effective friction of non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> could be less than that of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Although <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> may not necessarily find themselves in the same ecological niche, bacteria with different motilities are ubiquitous in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harshey, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms of codependent motility and pattern formation described here are likely to be broadly applicable in natural habitats or even have implications in the transmission of pathogenic microbes. For example, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, an increasing threat in hospitals due to multi-drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dijkshoorn et al., 2007</xref>), is closely related to <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Touchon et al., 2014</xref>), also has twitching motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eijkelkamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemmer et al., 2011</xref>), and coexists with <italic>E. coli</italic> in at least one known niche, namely hospitals. Thus, the generic pattern-formation and hitchhiking described here may be quite common in diverse environments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>We used <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ADP1 (ATCC #33305).

The bright-field images were first segmented to identify the colony using an active contour method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2000</xref>). The segmentation result is illustrated in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>. Then the colony boundary pixels were interpolated by a closed cubic spline and the boundary was parameterized by 300 virtual nodes, which were evolved in time as a coupled spring system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machacek and Danuser, 2006</xref>). For each node, three quantities were measured: brightness, extension speed and curvature. Brightness at each node was defined as the median of the neighboring pixels assigned to each node (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skoge et al., 2010</xref>). Extension speed was computed by the displacement of a node from <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic>+50 min. Curvature was calculated by taking derivatives of the spline contour. Then the time series of these quantities were detrended as following: At each time point, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is carried out for each variable across all nodes and in the resulting transform, the first few low frequencies are set to zero. Then inverse FFT is carried out to obtain the detrended values for each variable at each node. After detrending, all variables can be negative at certain nodes.

framework originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brower et al.

Each node is driven by the ‘expansion force’ <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> that acts along the unit vector <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that is directed outwards along the bisectrix of two adjacent edges, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf78"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf79"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

In addition, we introduce repulsion forces between all nodes and edges that prevent the interface from self-intersecting.

In particular, patterns were observed in the narrower range of initial density ratios for mixtures of motile T6SS<sup>− </sup><italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>pilTU<sup>−</sup> A. baylyi</italic>: Well-developed flower-like patterns were observed for initial density ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf222"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1:10 (motile:non-motile), however, unlike the case of T6SS<sup>−</sup> <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> mixtures, no patterns were observed for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf223"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1:1, and only weak patterning was observed for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf224"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1:100 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>, panels a-c). We hypothesize that the main reason for these differences is that in this case the non-motile strain did not have a faster growth rate. Non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> has a significantly smaller growth rate (1.03 ± 0.12h<sup>-1</sup>, n = 3) than our <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (1.53 ± 0.11h<sup>-1</sup>, n = 3). The non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> growth rate was actually even smaller than the growth rate of our motile strain, which may have been due to metabolic burden from the highly expressed <italic>tetA</italic> gene used to select them. Thus, for large <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf225"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ‘outruns’ the non-motile strain, which does not grow fast enough to first form a non-motile band around the colony. It is also possible that non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> provide less friction (less adhesion to the agar surface) and that this also contributes to the differences in pattern formation with the case of <italic>A. baylyi</italic>/<italic>E. coli</italic> mixtures. This hypothesis is confirmed by the simulations of phase-field model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2</xref>). When the non-motile strain growth rate and non-motile strain-dependent friction are large, the pattern occurs. When one of the two parameters decreases, the patterns still persist while the pattern disappears if both growth rate and friction drop.</p><fig id="app3fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 3—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Colonies of mixtures of motile (T6SS<sup>+</sup> or T6SS<sup>−</sup>) and non-motile (<italic>pilTU<sup>−</sup></italic>) <italic>A. baylyi</italic> after 18 hr of growth on 0.75% LB agar for different initial compositions, as indicated by the titles above the panels.</title><p>Red color indicates fluorescent motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and dark regions within the colony indicate non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> lacking fluorescent marker.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48885-app3-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app3fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 3—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Non-motile strain density at time t = 20 in simulations of mixtures of motile and non-motile strains using different non-motile strain growth rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf226"><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and non-motile strain-dependent friction coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf227"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48885-app3-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><media id="app3video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48885-fig1-v2.mp4"><label>Appendix 3—video 1.</label><caption><title>Pattern formation in a mixture of motile T6SS<sup>−</sup> and non-motile <italic>pilTU<sup>−</sup> A. baylyi</italic> with intitial density ratio 1:10 on 0.75% LB agar.</title></caption></media><p>We also found significant differences in patterning between mixtures of non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> with T6SS<sup>+</sup> or T6SS<sup>−</sup> motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic>.

Specifically, they show that combining <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> results in flower-like patterns while neither species individually produces this effect. They use genetic perturbations to show that this effect requires motility (mixed biofilms with non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> do not produce patterns) and does not depend on T6SS. They go on to reproduce the patterns using a mathematical model that captures the differences in motility between the 2 strains.</p><p>Overall, I thought this was a very nice and clearly presented study. The phenotype is quite interesting and the authors do a good job of providing a plausible explanation (mechanical effect resulting from differences in motility). I have only one experimental suggestion to confirm this explanation. Can the authors mix motile and non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> and produce the patterns in a single species <italic>A. baylyi</italic> biofilm? If the floral patterns are really a result of motility differences (and not other unknown interspecies effects) than this should be possible. They have already created the non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> mutant so it should be straightforward to try this experiment. If they observe this result, then I am enthusiastic for publishing the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I find the results interesting and convincing; I have a series of comments that I would like the authors to address before I can recommend this manuscript for publication. I am mainly concerned with justifying the choices made for the physical modeling and provide ideas to corroborate hitchhiking as a relevant evolutionary determinant. Below I detail my concerns, and suggest ways to improve clarity and strength of the results.</p><p>The experiments describing the evolution of the flower like pattern are clear and convincing. <italic>E. coli</italic> accumulates at boundaries and causes the colony to bend inward and fold onto this decelerating region creating cusps and branches. The speed of the boundary is anti-correlated with <italic>E. coli</italic> concentration and to curvature, corroborating the picture.</p><p>Flower like patterns are recovered by a simple model tracking the shape of the leading edge, assuming that each portion of the interface expands by a balance of friction, surface tension and an expanding force due to motility. Friction is proportional to concentration of (non-motile) E Coli, which causes instability.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to discuss the origin of the expansion force, since only part of the colony is motile. Are twitching cells pushing the other strain through cell-to-cell contact? (Can the authors provide a high-resolution image to show that cells are highly packed?) Or – given that an extracellular matrix is mentioned – is it entropically driven? (Is an extracellular matrix knock-out available to the authors?)</p><p>2) Are wetting forces negligible? An order-of-magnitude estimate of the different forces or experimental evidence would justify choice of these and not other forces.</p><p>3) In the more refined model, 2D concentrations of the two strains and of the phase field are evolved in time. I would imagine the two strains move relative to one another (<italic>E. coli</italic> remains attached to the substrate whereas <italic>A baylyi</italic> twitches). A two-fluid mixture appears a natural choice; the authors consider instead a single velocity field carrying all cells, and I am unclear what this velocity represents. Is there a way to relate it to actual velocities measurable experimentally, e.g. a weighted average of velocities of the two strains? Because I am confused about the meaning of v, I do not have an intuition why it follows Stokes equation.</p><p>4) The authors predict that at low friction, the colony expands quicker with no flower like pattern, unless a large concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic> is inoculated. Assuming agar concentration affects friction, these predictions are verified experimentally. A discussion is missing about the choice of ξ and β, which appears to me quite arbitrary. Also: is the value of η obtained by fitting the expansion rate a plausible value for a bacterial colony?</p><p>5) Hitchhiking is an appealing evolutionary advantage. The discussion would benefit from two additional points. First: the authors imply that flower-like patterns are directly related to hitchhiking. However from Figure 3A it looks like <italic>E. coli</italic> hitchhikes even in round colonies maybe less so than in flower-like colonies? Could you quantify this aspect? Second: what are the parameters that switch hitchhiking on/off in the model? Are there evidences that these parameters vary in different strains? Could genes control these parameters? This would help elucidate whether hitchhiking may be actively controlled (e.g. strains turning off motility would benefit from correspondingly turning on hitchhiking)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors studied interactions between a motile and a non-motile bacterial species in growing colonies, and observed the development of complex patterns that were not present in colonies consisting only of one of these species. These patterns included an undulated interface of the colony that correlated with branched structures inside of the colony. The authors provided several lines of evidence that the speed of colony expansion correlates negatively with the local concentration of the non-motile bacteria. Based on these findings, they showed that a quite simple model describing the dynamics of the 1D colony interface can account for the formation of undulations and branches. This model essentially describes the advection and dilution of the non-motile species with the motion of the front of the motile bacteria, where a local friction increases with the concentration of non-motile bacteria. To additionally account for growth and diffusion of the bacteria, the authors further introduce a more complex 2D phase field model. Similar to the 1D interface model, patterns similar to the experimentally observed ones could be qualitatively reproduced.</p><p>While I am not an expert on biofilms, I found this manuscript interesting and well written. I found particularly intriguing that pattern formation based on the collective motion of two different bacteria species can be at least qualitatively accounted for by a simple 1D model.</p><p>In the following, I will focus on discussing the mechanical modeling part, which falls more in my area of expertise. While the interface model has appeal due to its simplicity, there are a few things that need to be better clarified if not corrected about it (see below). The phase field modeling seems to be mostly appropriate with respect to the assumptions made, but also here at least some clarifications would be good, mostly related to the field Φ (see below).</p><p>More detailed comments:</p><p>1) A brief discussion on possibilities of where the force F<sub>0</sub> and the &quot;active pressure&quot; in Equation 22 could originate would be good (also in the initial phase where the colony is not expanding (Figure 1D)). In subsection “Pattern-forming instability originates at the colony interface” the authors suggest some kind of active pressure created by the <italic>A. Baylyi</italic> motility. However, it is not clear to me how this alone could explain an initial phase where the colony is not expanding at all (Figure 1D). The latter seems to be more consistent with a picture of nutrient consumption combined with chemotaxis (as proposed in earlier work, Discussion section paragraph two), which could also effectively create such an F<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>2) There are problems or at least a lack of clarity related to the way the friction force F<sub>r</sub> is included in both 1D models describing the interface behavior.</p><p>a) The authors assume F<sub>r</sub> to be proportional to the concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic>, c, but independent of velocity. As a consequence, if the concentration is high enough, the surface would move inward (even without surface tension F<sub>s</sub>=0), driven by this friction force. How realistic is such a friction force?</p><p>b) The normal velocity F[κ, g] is computed directly as a difference of normal forces (Equation 8). Apparently, the authors have implicitly assumed some additional, velocity-dependent friction here (and set the friction coefficient to one). It would be good to comment on how this additional friction is motivated.</p><p>c) As an alternative, one could assume F<sub>r</sub> itself to depend linearly on velocity, a common assumption for motile cells on a substrate, which is also used in the authors' phase-field model (Equation 22). In this case and without additional friction, through force balance (F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>s</sub>-F<sub>r</sub>=0) the normal velocity F[κ, g] would be given by a quotient between F<sub>0</sub>-F<sub>s</sub> and a friction coefficient that is a function of c.</p><p>3) Even though the phase field approach is similar to previous work, some explanations, in particular related to the field Φ would make the manuscript more self-contained.</p><p>a) In subsection “Phase-field model of flower-like pattern formation” the authors state that Φ is introduced to avoid computational difficulties of dealing with the boundary. However, these difficulties and hence the necessity of Φ is nowhere explained in more detail. Why are ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>E</sub> not sufficient?</p><p>b) Explanations on Equation 19 can be expanded on. In particular, brief comments on the second, diffusion-like term and the last term on the right-hand side could be helpful for readers.</p><p>c) The last term in Equation 19 is known to cancel the surface tension effect created by the second term (e.g. Biben and Misbah, 2003). Why do the authors explicitly remove surface tension in their phase field model while it is present in their interface models?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48885.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Xiong et al. describe how complex pattern formation arises within a 2-species bacterial biofilm.

We carried out additional experiments mixing non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> with motile ones and observed interesting spatial structures similar to the flower-like patterns in mixtures of <italic>E. coli</italic> and motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic>.

There could be several factors responsible for this: (i) the growth rate of non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> is less than that of <italic>E. coli</italic> (actually, it is even smaller than that of the motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> due to burden from the selection marker), so the band of non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> at the perimeter of the colony is not as thick as <italic>E. coli</italic>’s; (ii) the effective friction coefficient of non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> may be smaller than that of <italic>E. coli</italic> and close to that of motile <italic>A.baylyi</italic>. We added a new Appendix 3 (Mixtures of motile and non-motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic>) to discuss these new experimental results.

Based on our experimental findings that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> colonies expand but <italic>E. coli</italic> ones don’t, despite having comparable growth rates, we believe that the core reason for the colony expansion is motility, or effective temperature, i.e. it is entropically driven. Colonies do not begin to expand until they have completely covered the interior surface in a monolayer (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Therefore, we believe the entropic expansion acts through direct cell-cell contacts, when cells constantly bump and push each other. Because bacteria continuously grow and divide, the cell density remains high throughout the colony expansion. ECM has been shown to entropically drive phase separation and dispersion in non-motile, single-species colonies (Seminara et al., 2011, Dilanji et al., 2014, Ghosh et al., PNAS 2015), but this does not appear to be a driving factor here, given the dependence on both motility (Figure 3E) and a mixture of two species (Figure 1C). We have now added a discussion of the origin of the expansion force in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are wetting forces negligible? An order-of-magnitude estimate of the different forces or experimental evidence would justify choice of these and not other forces.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure about the importance of wetting forces, however the drastic difference between the expansion of motile <italic>A. baylyi</italic> colonies compared with <italic>E. coli</italic> colonies and non-motile mutant <italic>A.baylyi</italic> colonies (that presumably should have similar wetting properties), leads us to believe that passive wetting forces probably do not play an important role in the process. It leaves us with the (entropic by nature) expansion force and the resistance (bottom friction, viscosity) forces that comprise the force balance in the form of Stokes equation. We added such discussion in the Discussion section.</p><p>It is true that wetting forces could play a role in expansion of the colony onto new regions of agar. In principle, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> could generate more surface wetting, locally aiding expansion, and <italic>E. coli</italic> could generate less, or even inhibit wetting. This could indeed be part of the effective friction forces associated with the different cell types – with <italic>A. baylyi</italic> having less effective friction and <italic>E. coli</italic> having more. The expansion and friction forces are left here as largely phenomenological, though experimentally motivated. It would certainly be worthwhile to further explore the physical underpinnings of these forces, but we believe that is an area for future work, although worth including in the Discussion, which we have done in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the more refined model, 2D concentrations of the two strains and of the phase field are evolved in time.

We saw no evidence of the two strains expanding at different velocities: <italic>E. coli</italic> were carried with the surrounding <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (hitchhiking) or pushed by it in the front of the colony. Thus, we decided that it would make more sense to use a single local velocity, which represents the actual velocity of the bacterial cells. Since the single-velocity model already appears sufficient in capturing the salient features of the phenomenon, we did not see a reason to make it more complex than necessary. We mention this rationale in the revised version of Appendix 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors predict that at low friction, the colony expands quicker with no flower like pattern, unless a large concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic> is inoculated.

Thus, we selected the parameters based on fitting the observed colony dynamics, as we explain in more detail in Appendix 2. One of the parameters in the stationary Stokes equation (22) can be scaled out without affecting the velocity, and we chose the basal friction coefficient of pure <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, \xi=1. Base on the presence of sharp kinks in the developing front structure, we concluded that viscosity plays a minor role in the dynamics, so we chose the viscosity coefficient to be small. The remaining two parameters (η and β) were chosen based on fitting the average expansion rates of colonies of pure <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (η) and different <italic>A. baylyi / E. coli</italic> mixtures (β). We provided a more detailed discussion of the model parameters in revised Appendix 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Hitchhiking is an appealing evolutionary advantage. The discussion would benefit from two additional points. First: the authors imply that flower-like patterns are directly related to hitchhiking. However from Figure 3A it looks like <italic>E. coli</italic> hitchhikes even in round colonies, maybe less so than in flower-like colonies? Could you quantify this aspect? Second: what are the parameters that switch hitchhiking on/off in the model? Are there evidences that these parameters vary in different strains? Could genes control these parameters? This would help elucidate whether hitchhiking may be actively controlled (e.g. strains turning off motility would benefit from correspondingly turning on hitchhiking)</p></disp-quote><p>Hitchhiking appears to be a necessary but not sufficient condition for flower-like pattern formation. Indeed, we observed that <italic>E. coli</italic> also hitchhiked in round colonies (e.g. in Figure 5F third panel), however patterns did not form, presumably because <italic>E. coli</italic> did not exert significant friction in those conditions. In the phase-field model that would correspond to reducing parameter \β that controls <italic>E. coli</italic>-dependent increase in friction. For small β, patterns indeed don’t form, while hitchhiking fully persists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the following, I will focus on discussing the mechanical modeling part, which falls more in my area of expertise. While the interface model has appeal due to its simplicity, there are a few things that need to be better clarified if not corrected about it (see below). The phase field modeling seems to be mostly appropriate with respect to the assumptions made, but also here at least some clarifications would be good, mostly related to the field Φ (see below).</p><p>More detailed comments:</p><p>1) A brief discussion on possibilities of where the force F0 and the &quot;active pressure&quot; in Equation 22 could originate would be good (also in the initial phase where the colony is not expanding (Figure 1D)). In subsection “Pattern-forming instability originates at the colony interface” the authors suggest some kind of active pressure created by the A. Baylyi motility. However, it is not clear to me how this alone could explain an initial phase where the colony is not expanding at all (Figure 1D). The latter seems to be more consistent with a picture of nutrient consumption combined with chemotaxis (as proposed in earlier work, Discussion section paragraph two), which could also effectively create such an F0.</p></disp-quote><p>The origin of the expansion force F<sub>0</sub> is explained in the answer to the question 1 of reviewer 2. Briefly, it is related to the motility of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> so when they move randomly and bump into each other, it creates pressure field that leads to the colony expansion. However, when bacterial cells are inoculated, the cell density is low (see new Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and cells are not pushing against each other. That is the reason the colonies do not expand initially (Figure 1D). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> which shows the time course of the colony radius (of a mixture of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic>) obtained from numerical simulations of the phase field model with low initial density of <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, it can be seen that initially the colony does not expand, but once the cell density becomes large (order of 1), the colony starts to expand.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48885-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are problems or at least a lack of clarity related to the way the friction force F<sub>r</sub> is included in both 1D models describing the interface behavior.</p><p>a) The authors assume F<sub>r</sub> to be proportional to the concentration of <italic>E. coli</italic>, c, but independent of velocity. As a consequence, if the concentration is high enough, the surface would move inward (even without surface tension F<sub>s</sub>=0), driven by this friction force. How realistic is such a friction force?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, in the original formulation of the interface model the friction force F<sub>r</sub> was assumed to be independent of velocity. We neglected to mention that we enforced the condition that the friction force never exceeds F<sub>0</sub>, so the total normal force acting on the interface was always non-negative. Thus, the interface could stall but would never move backwards. We apologize for this omission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The normal velocity F[κ, g] is computed directly as a difference of normal forces (Equation 8). Apparently, the authors have implicitly assumed some additional, velocity-dependent friction here (and set the friction coefficient to one). It would be good to comment on how this additional friction is motivated.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is also correct here; in the original formulation of the interface model we assume an overdamped motion of the interface in which the normal velocity is proportional to the balance of the pushing force and the velocity-independent friction force acting on it. Indeed, this implied that there was an additional interface resistance force proportional to the interface velocity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) As an alternative, one could assume F<sub>r</sub> itself to depend linearly on velocity, a common assumption for motile cells on a substrate, which is also used in the authors' phase-field model (Equation 22). In this case and without additional friction, through force balance (F0-F<sub>s</sub>-F<sub>r</sub>=0) the normal velocity F[κ, g] would be given by a quotient between F0-F<sub>s</sub> and a friction coefficient that is a function of c.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we decided to implement it in order to make the interface model more consistent with the phase-field model where both basal and <italic>E. coli</italic>-dependent friction forces are proportional to the local velocity. Thus, we assumed that the normal velocity of the interface is proportional to the sum of the constant normal force F<sub>0</sub>, curvature-driven surface tension and interface self-repulsion forces divided by the “friction coefficient” that has a constant (basal) term and concentration-dependent term. It only required changing two lines of code, and we did not have to change any of the model parameters. As we expected, this modification of the model did not change its stability properties, and the resultant flower-like shape of the interface remained qualitatively the same. We changed the description of the model in the corresponding section of Appendix 1, and Figure 4B,C. We are grateful to the reviewer for this valuable input that made our model more reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Even though the phase field approach is similar to previous work, some explanations, in particular related to the field Φ would make the manuscript more self-contained.</p><p>a) In subsection “Phase-field model of flower-like pattern formation” the authors state that Φ is introduced to avoid computational difficulties of dealing with the boundary. However, these difficulties and hence the necessity of Φ is nowhere explained in more detail. Why are ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>E</sub> not sufficient?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment of the reviewer. Please note that the evolution of the boundary of the colony is determined by the velocity field u, which, in turn, depends on ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>E</sub>. Thus, it is not sufficient to have only equations for ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>E</sub> but need an additional equation that governs the motion of the colony. Tracking a moving boundary using traditional techniques is challenging. For this reason, we have chosen to use the phase field method to simulate our growing colony. We have now added additional text to explain this better.</p><p>Specifically, we now write in the main text:</p><p>“It is based on PDEs for the densities of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> ρ<sub>A</sub> and <italic>E. coli</italic> ρ<sub>E</sub>, together with an equation that describes the velocity field u of the colony. This velocity field drives the motion of the boundary of the colony and is generated by a combination of stress due to cell growth and motility, viscosity, and bottom friction that is dependent local <italic>E. coli</italic> density. The resulting free boundary problem is solved using the phase-field method, which introduces another PDE for an auxiliary field phi that changes continuously from 1 inside the colony to 0 outside (see Appendix 2 for the detailed formulation of the model). The boundary is then automatically defined as Φ=1/2 and can thus be computed without explicit tracking techniques.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Explanations on Equation 19 can be expanded on. In particular, brief comments on the second, diffusion-like term and the last term on the right-hand side could be helpful for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Our phase field description follows our earlier work on cell migration (Shao et al., 2012). To clarify this, we have added additional explanation for the different terms in Equation 19. Please note that the last term in this equation is added to stabilize the interface. This term is a computational technique, which was indeed described by Biben and Misbah, 2003 and Biben et al., 2005. We have now also added these references to the text in Appendix 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The last term in Equation 19 is known to cancel the surface tension effect created by the second term (e.g. Biben and Misbah, 2003). Why do the authors explicitly remove surface tension in their phase field model while it is present in their interface models?</p></disp-quote><p>The required restoring force in the interface model is provided by surface tension. Without such term, from Jacobian matrix (12), the positive eigenvalue λ(k) is proportional to k and goes to infinity as k increases. This restoring force ensures that the interface does not expand indefinitely. In our phase field model, the friction force constrains the expansion, resulting in finite expansion rates. Thus, surface tension, which can in principle be added to the phase field as a separate force term, is not necessary. We added such discussion in Appendix 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
