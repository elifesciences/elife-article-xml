co-activator β-catenin regulates self-renewal and differentiation of mammalian nephron progenitor cells (NPCs). We modulated β-catenin levels in NPC cultures using the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 (CHIR) to examine opposing developmental actions of β-catenin. Low CHIR-mediated maintenance and expansion of NPCs are independent of direct engagement of TCF/LEF/β-catenin transcriptional complexes at low CHIR-dependent cell-cycle targets. In contrast, in high CHIR, TCF7/LEF1/β-catenin complexes replaced TCF7L1/TCF7L2 binding on enhancers of differentiation-promoting target genes. Chromosome confirmation studies showed pre-established promoter–enhancer connections to these target genes in NPCs. High CHIR-associated de novo looping was observed in positive transcriptional feedback regulation to the canonical Wnt pathway. Thus, β-catenin’s direct transcriptional role is restricted to the induction of NPCs, where rising β-catenin levels switch inhibitory TCF7L1/TCF7L2 complexes to activating LEF1/TCF7 complexes at primed gene targets poised for rapid initiation of a nephrogenic program.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kidney development</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>TCF/LEF factors</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK054364 Cell Interaction in Development of the Mammalian Kidney</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMahon</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>β-Catenin-mediated expansion of nephron progenitors is independent of direct β-catenin/chromatin engagement, while progenitor induction proceeds with a β-catenin-driven switch of repressive TCFL1/TCFL2 to activating TCF7/LEF1 factors on transcriptionally poised enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The now classical model of canonical Wnt signaling invokes two transcriptional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiese et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steinhart and Angers, 2018</xref>). In the absence of Wnt ligand, HMG box family Tcf transcription factors bind enhancers of Wnt target genes recruiting co-repressors (Tle, Ctbp, and others) to silence target gene expression. In the cytoplasm, the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin is phosphorylated by an axin/GSK3β-dependent β-catenin destruction complex, resulting in ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Upon Wnt ligand binding to Fzd receptor/Lrp co-receptors on the cell surface, the β-catenin destruction complex is sequestered to the activated receptor protein complex through axin interactions, removing β-catenin from GSK3β-directed, phosphorylation-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schaefer and Peifer, 2019</xref>). As a result of increasing β-catenin levels, β-catenin is free to associate with TCF/LEF DNA binding partners, activating Wnt target gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>). While evidence suggests that all four mammalian Tcf family members are able to functionally interact with both Tle family co-repressors and β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brantjes et al., 2001</xref>), a variety of studies in a range of biological systems indicate that Tcf7l1 predominantly acts as a repressor, Tcf7l2 as a context-dependent activator or repressor, and Tcf7 and Lef1 as transcriptional activators, of Wnt target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lien and Fuchs, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The adult (metanephric) mammalian kidney arises from distinct cell populations within the intermediate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon, 2016</xref>). All nephrons – the repeating functional unit of the kidney – arise from a small pool of a few hundred nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) established at the onset of kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Short et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>). The subsequent balance in the maintenance, expansion, and commitment of NPCs is critical to ensuring a full complement of nephrons, approximately 14,000 in the mouse and 1 million in the human kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertram et al., 2011</xref>). A reduced nephron endowment has been associated with abnormal kidney function and disease susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luyckx and Brenner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertram et al., 2011</xref>). The maintenance and expansion of NPCs are supported by Fgf, Bmp, and Wnt signals produced by NPCs or adjacent mesenchymal interstitial progenitor and ureteric epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon, 2016</xref>). Within this nephrogenic niche, ureteric epithelium-derived Wnt9b is thought to act on NPCs in a β-catenin-dependent transcriptional process to regulate NPC target gene expression and expansion of the nephron progenitor pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karner et al., 2011</xref>). The removal of <italic>Wnt9b</italic> from the ureteric epithelium and NPC-specific production of β-catenin also results in the failure of NPC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>), whereas chemical inhibition of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davies and Garrod, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuure et al., 2007</xref>), or genetic activation within NPCs of a β-catenin form insensitive to GSK phosphorylation-mediated proteasomal degradation, leads to Wnt9b-independent ectopic induction of differentiation-promoting gene targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Genetic and chemical modification of Wnt pathway components suggest different levels of β-catenin distinguish maintenance and commitment of NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>). Genomic analysis of β-catenin engagement at TCF/LEF recognition motifs within enhancers linked to genes driving NPC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2012</xref>), and subsequent transgenic studies demonstrating TCF/LEF-dependent activity of cis regulatory elements, provides strong evidence for a canonical Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf regulatory axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mosimann et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, canonical Wnt signaling directs opposing NPC programs: maintenance and expansion of uncommitted NPCs and their commitment to nephron formation.</p><p>In this study, we employed an in vitro model to investigate the genomic regulatory mechanisms underlying the diverse action of canonical Wnt signaling in NPC programs. In this system, maintenance and expansion of NPCs, or their commitment to a nephrogenic program, are controlled by varying levels of CHIR99021 (CHIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen and Goedert, 2004</xref>) supplemented to a chemically defined nephron progenitor expansion medium (NPEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2015</xref>).

NPCs were cultured in NPEM supplemented with a maintenance level of CHIR (1.25 µM – low CHIR throughout) to promote self-renewal of NPCs.

Comparing input NPCs freshly isolated from the kidney cortex with NPC-free cortical preparations (NFC), the strong enrichment for NPC-relevant GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top panel) was consistent with a strong enrichment of Six2+ NPCs (more than 90% of isolated cells were Six2+). When NPCs cultured in high versus low CHIR conditions were compared, a strong enrichment was observed in terms associated with Wnt signaling pathway, as expected, on CHIR-mediated NPC induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, middle and bottom panels). Although primary NPCs, and their counterpart in low CHIR, showed similar expression patterns for NPC self-renewal and differentiation markers, transcriptome-wide comparison of all samples clustered primary NPCs into a distinct group from NPCs cultured in either low or high CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is explained by a pronounced metabolic shift in culture where there is a strong enrichment in GO analysis in metabolic processes such as sterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, freshly isolated NPCs showed a low-level inductive signature reflecting a co-contribution of small numbers of early induced NPCs (expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic>, <italic>Wnt4</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Heyl, Bmp4</italic>, <italic>Mafb</italic>, and <italic>Podxl</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As predicted, the Wnt4DE displayed an opposite trend in the shift from low to high CHIR: the ATAC and H3K27ac ChIP signals increased together with increased Pol II engagement in the gene body.

Comparing DNA regions bound by Tcf7l1 in low CHIR and those bound by Lef1 in high CHIR, we observed a significant overlap (p-value = 1e-569), though over half were unique to a data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We assigned the Tcf7l1/low CHIR-specific sites (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) as set 1 (also ‘lost,’ as no longer bound by TCF/LEF in high CHIR condition), overlapping sites as set 2 (also ‘switch,’ as TCF/LEF factors interchange at these sites between low and high CHIR conditions), and Lef1/high CHIR-specific sites as set 3 (also ‘de novo,’ as TCF/LEF binding sites arose on elevated CHIR levels). Interestingly, examining motif recovery across sets 1–3 indicated that only sets 2 and 3 showed a strong prediction for direct TCF/LEF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, Tcf7l1 likely associates with a large number of DNA regions without direct DNA binding at TCF/LEF response elements. The majority (73%) of Tcf7l1 sites bound in low CHIR with a predicted TCF/LEF motif overlapped with those bound by Lef1 in high CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, only 29% of Tcfl71 binding sites without a TCF/LEF motif prediction overlapped with Lef1 bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, switching from a Tcf7l1 to a Lef1-centered DNA interaction at TCF/LEF response elements was a general feature of NPC induction response. Comparing with set 3 (de novo), set 2 (switch) sites displayed stronger binding of Tcf7l2, Tcf7, Lef1, and β-catenin, as well as higher level of markers of activated chromatin (ATAC-Seq and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq) in high CHIR condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, the data suggests that TCF/LEF sites occupied by Tcf7l1 in low CHIR are poised for stronger binding (and therefore activation) by TCF/LEF activators in high CHIR condition. Interestingly, GO GREAT analysis of all three sets predicted expected kidney terms such as ‘metanephric nephron morphogenesis’ or ‘renal vesicle morphogenesis’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with biologically relevant interactions, arguing against artifactual responses to culture or CHIR treatment. More than half of the potential target genes (assigned bioinformatically by GREAT) of set 2 ‘switch’ sites overlap with those of set 3 ‘de novo’ sites (60%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, p=5.9e-627), although the latter are much broader. For this overlapping group, pre-engagement by Tcf7l1 may increase the likelihood of additional engagement in neighboring regions of DNA by Lef1 and potentially reinforce transcriptional input into a common gene target.</p><p>Examining chromatin features and RNA Pol II engagement, we observed stronger enrichment of active enhancer markers (H3K27ac and RNA Pol II) in low CHIR on set 1 sites predicting indirect Tcf7l1 engagement than set 2 sites, where Tcf7l1 was predicted to bind DNA directly through TCF/LEF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, direct binding of TCF7L1/TCF7L2 on set 2 sites was associated with putative enhancers in a less active chromatin state in low CHIR condition. Consistent with this view, a direct analysis of the expression of target gene set of set 2 sites showed the highest expression in high CHIR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting them tending to function in high CHIR. To examine whether elevated β-catenin correlates with chromatin activation, we examined change of active chromatin markers (ATAC-Seq and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq) and RNA Pol II loading on β-catenin bound sites. A dramatic elevation of all these signals in high CHIR condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) is consistent with β-catenin engagement enhancing an open chromatin, active enhancer signature. Together, the data support the conclusion that high CHIR increased β-catenin association, correlating with switching of TCF/LEF factors at existing active chromatin, de novo opening of new chromatin sites, and an active transcription program initiating nephron formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>β-Catenin uses both pre-established and de novo enhancer–promoter loops to drive NPC differentiation program</title><p>To examine genome organization and chromatin interactions at a higher level in self-renewing and induced NPC, Hi-C analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rao et al., 2014</xref>) was performed to characterize global chromatin–chromatin interactions.

In contrast, four interaction loops appeared in high CHIR conditions, one of which was associated with a strong Lef1/β-catenin interaction site, two mapped to CTCF bound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In high CHIR, a string of LEF1/TCF7/β-catenin binding events accompanied enhanced accessibility (ATAC-seq) and the appearance of an active chromatin signature (H3K27ac) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These data suggest that de novo loop formation may follow from de novo interaction of LEF1/TCF7/β-catenin binding complexes at the <italic>Lef1</italic> enhancer, in a feedback mechanism driving NPC commitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genetic analysis of mouse models points to a requirement for β-catenin in both the maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karner et al., 2011</xref>) and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2007</xref>) of NPCs. Genetically modulating Wnt inputs and chemically modifying Wnt-pathway activity suggest Wnt-modulation of β-catenin levels is critical to these alternative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ramalingam et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies directly examining β-catenin association in differentiating NPCs showed direct engagement of β-catenin at enhancers regulating expression of differentiation promoting genes such as <italic>Wnt4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Data here confirmed these earlier findings and extended our understanding through a comprehensive analysis of Wnt-directed transcriptional engagement and epigenetic organization in a simple in vitro model of mammalian NPC programs. TCF/LEF factors are the transcription factors that ultimately mediate the transcriptional response to Wnt signaling. The direct analysis of all four TCF/LEF factors enables several key observations to be made, and conclusions drawn, from the analysis of NPC responses to CHIR modulation of β-catenin levels.</p><p>(1) In low CHIR, NPC maintenance and expansion conditions, the mitogenic activity mediated through CHIR stimulation of Wnt signaling appears to be independent of TCF/LEF binding to TCF/LEF motifs in target genes. (2) CHIR-mediated elevation of β-catenin is accompanied by reduced expression of mRNAs for transcriptional inhibitory TCF factors (<italic>Tcf7l1</italic> and <italic>Tcf7l2</italic>) and dramatic increase in expression of mRNAs for activating forms (<italic>Tcf7</italic> and <italic>Lef1</italic>), promoting an inductive program. (3) Direct binding of inhibitory Tcf7l1 and Tcf7l2 engagement at target motifs within putative cis-regulatory elements prefigures engagement of Tcf7 and Lef1 in a chromatin landscape primed for the transcriptional activation of the nephron-forming program. (4) High CHIR invokes a switch from inhibitory to activating TCF/LEF engagement at enhancers promoting nephron differentiation consistent with β-catenin controlling TCF/LEF target engagement. (5) In addition to enhancer–promoter loops pre-established in uncommitted NPCs associated with switching of inhibitory to activating TCF/LEF binding signatures on high CHIR induction, TCF/LEF/ β-catenin interactions at de novo sites may play additional roles in the inductive process, including positive feedback in the Lef1 program promoting nephrogenesis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Wnt signaling, β-catenin, and TCF/LEF factors in NPC maintenance and expansion</title><p>Though genetic evidence supports a direct role for β-catenin in regulating the maintenance and expansion of NPCs, and low CHIR activity is essential for normal NPC expansion in vitro, direct analysis of Tcf, Lef, and β-catenin engagement does not provide support for a direct transcriptional mechanism mediated through direct TCF/LEF DNA interactions with low CHIR-dependent target genes. We directly examined 16 genes identified in genetic screens in vivo to display <italic>Wnt9b-</italic>dependent expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karner et al., 2011</xref>). In total, 7 of the 16 showed elevated expression of at least one isoform in low CHIR versus no CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) consistent with a Wnt signaling input.

Our data corroborated the upregulation of <italic>Tafa5</italic>/<italic>Fam19a5</italic> but not <italic>Pla2g7</italic> in high CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). However, ChIP-qPCR data arguing for β-catenin engagement around the TSS bindings sites of <italic>Pla2g7</italic> and <italic>Fam19a5/Tafa5</italic> could only be corroborated near one site in our data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Comparing NPC gene expression profiles in low CHIR versus no CHIR conditions revealed highly significant GO enrichment in cell cycle-related terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with pro-proliferation roles of β-catenin in self-renewing NPCs. However, among the 85 genes associated with the term ‘cell cycle,’ only one gene showed significant β-catenin association within 500 kb of the TSS in low CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), arguing against a scenario that directs transcriptional regulation of these genes through β-catenin engagement.</p><p>These findings raise the possibility that β-catenin acts through an alternative transcriptional mechanism. A prominent association of TCF7L1 is observed in low CHIR to DNA regions where the absence of a TCF/LEF motif may suggest indirect means of association, through protein–protein interactions. However, no strong consensus target emerges from examining motif enrichment in this subset of the TCF7L1 binding data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Alternatively, β-catenin may play an essential, non-transcriptional role that links to control of cell proliferation. TCF-β-catenin nuclear complexes have been reported to oscillate with the cell cycle, suggesting potential nuclear roles independent of DNA association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). Further, β-catenin is reported to play an essential, non-transcriptional role in self-renewal of mouse epiblast stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, CHIR-mediated inhibition of GSK3 outside of β-catenin regulation might play a role. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acebron et al., 2014</xref> have reported that GSK3 inhibition by Wnt ligand administration leads to deubiquitylation and stabilization of target proteins. Importantly, our studies cannot exclude unknown complicating actions of β-catenin or GSK3-independent CHIR responses. Wnt-ligand mimetics and direct knockout of β-catenin activity offer a promising future approach to confirm CHIR-β-catenin-centered findings in the current study.</p><p>In mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture, canonical Wnt signaling, induced by CHIR, supports long-term self-renewal of ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ying et al., 2008</xref>). Tcf7l1 has been shown to repress expression of genes involved in stem cell maintenance while Tcf7 and Lef1 activate targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wray et al., 2011</xref>) consistent with a classic canonical Wnt transcriptional activation program of stem cell renewal. However, other studies directly analyzing β-catenin interactions at the chromatin level suggest an indirect process where β-catenin may block the negative interplay of Tcf7l1 binding at the Sox motif of Sox-Oct bound stem cell promoting enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In this ESC system, β-catenin target sites containing TCF/LEF motif correlate strongly with differentiation promoting targets, consistent with the normal role of β-catenin in vivo in regulating gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haegel et al., 1995</xref>). Addition of a second small molecule (PD03) inhibiting MEK/ERK signaling is essential to block this differentiation promoting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Further, depletion of both <italic>Tcf7l1</italic> and <italic>Tcf7</italic> is sufficient to maintain Wnt ligand-independent expansion of ESCs, consistent with the implication that β-catenin activation can abrogate the repressive effect of Tcf7l11 independent of an activator Tcf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In hair follicle stem cells (HFSC), Wnt induces a transition of the stem cells from the quiescent to the proliferative state. Tcf7l1 and Tcf7l2 are preferentially expressed in HFSC, while Lef1 and Tcf7 are preferentially expressed in the differentiated HFSC, that is, hair germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merrill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lien et al., 2014</xref>). TCF7L1/TCF7L2 repress genes involved in HFSC differentiation, which are activated by Tcf7/Lef1, correlating with replacement of TCF7L1/TCF7L2 by Tcf7/Lef1 on relevant enhancers, a close parallel to activity in NPC programs described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adam et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Elevating β-catenin leads to activation of Tcf/Lef-bound enhancers</title><p>In the Wnt-off state, Tcf factors are known to recruit Groucho family co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavallo et al., 1998</xref>) and histone deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billin et al., 2000</xref>) to repress Wnt target gene expression. Upon Wnt ligand stimulation, Groucho is replaced by β-catenin for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brantjes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daniels and Weis, 2005</xref>). From evidence in vitro, β-catenin has been shown to be able to recruit various chromatin modulators, including histone acetyl transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hecht et al., 2000</xref>), histone methyl transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sierra et al., 2006</xref>), and chromatin remodeler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, through interaction with Pygo and Bcl9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kramps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwab et al., 2007</xref>), as well as direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), β-catenin can form a complex with the Mediator complex, which bridges the Tcf-bound enhancer to RNA Pol II complex at the target gene promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeronimo and Robert, 2017</xref>). In addition, Six2 binding at certain TCF/LEF targets in NPCs might also confer a repressive effect; Six2 interacts with histone deacetylation complexes (HDACs), and depletion of the HDACs in NPC elevates <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Lef1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the repressive chromatin modifiers <italic>Ezh1</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> also repress Wnt4 and Lef1 expression in NPC through maintaining H3K27me3 mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), although the repressive functions of such chromatin modifiers tend to have broader effects.</p><p>The potential for an extended interaction of Tcf7l1 and Tcf7l2 with co-repressors in suppressing the NPC commitment program has not been addressed in this study. However, given the observation that activation of target genes committing NPCs to a nephrogenic program correlates with a switch to Tcf7 and Lef1 engagement, it seems unlikely that removal of a co-repressor input would be sufficient for full activation in the absence of these strong activators. The observed shift in TCF/LEF factor engagement at DNA targets through elevating CHIR levels raises the question of how rising levels of β-catenin might regulate this transcriptional switch. Given a dual role for Tcf7l2 as both a transcriptional repressor and activator in canonical Wnt transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Korinek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lien and Fuchs, 2014</xref>), β-catenin may switch Tcf7l2 to an activator state. Alternatively, low levels of Tcf7 present in low CHIR may be sufficient for β-catenin engagement and transcriptional activation. In this model, binding of a Tcf7-β-catenin complex would be favored over inhibitory TCF complexes. In either scenario, it is likely that the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>Tcf7</italic> and <italic>Lef1</italic> creates a feed-forward loop to amplify the transcriptional activation response. Distinguishing among these possibilities will require effective and sensitive strategies to specifically modify regulatory components in the experimental model system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pre-establishment of enhancer–promoter loops prefigures a nephrogenic program</title><p>Classical embryological studies have identified two broad categories of inductive processes by which uncommitted stem or progenitor cells make subsequent cell fate choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saxén and Sariola, 1987</xref>). Instructive signaling leads to cells adopting distinct cell fates each determined by the signaling input. In this scenario, cells have multiple fate choices. In contrast, permissive signaling only leads to a single outcome. The observation that nephron anlagen only undergo a restricted nephrogenic response, and no other, to inductive signals, was taken as evidence that NPCs are in an inflexible regulatory state, predetermined for kidney formation. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have indicated that during development certain enhancer–promoter loops are stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2014</xref>), that is, the enhancer–promoter loop is established before the target gene is activated as a mechanism to prime developmentally potent cells to differentiate into predestined cell fates.</p><p>Analysis of Hi-C data shows that enhancer–promoter loops present in low CHIR condition are consistent with NPCs exhibiting a primed genomic state promoting nephron-forming programs. Approximately 56% of loops observed in high CHIR were observed in low CHIR. Of these, 70% connected to a TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Example of genes where such ‘conserved’ loops connect TCF/LEF/β-catenin binding events to TSS includes a number of genes within the nephrogenic program including <italic>Wnt4</italic>, <italic>Lhx1</italic>, <italic>Emx2</italic>, <italic>Bmp7,</italic> and <italic>Cxcr4</italic>. These data are consistent with the concept that at least a part of Wnt/β-catenin-activated differentiated program in NPC is primed through enhancer-TSS loop establishment, most likely at the time of specification of the NPC lineage, though these remain to be determined. These findings also raise an interesting possibility that Tcf7l1 and Tcf7l2 engagement at such enhancer–promoter regions may maintain the primed state during an extensive period of progenitor expansion in the course of kidney development. Interestingly, in low CHIR maintenance conditions, the Wnt4DE showed higher levels of PolII association than in high CHIR conditions where <italic>Wnt4</italic> is transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>), consistent with a stable enhancer/promoter/PolII association in the primed state. Indeed, Tcf7l1 and Tcf7l2 might serve as a platform for assembly of the transcriptional machinery to facilitate target gene activation with a sufficient level of β-catenin. Hi-C studies also identify new loop interactions consistent with de novo gene activation, notably in a predicted Lef1 feed-forward loop.</p><p>In summary, NPC culture provides a powerful model for deepening a mechanistic understanding of the regulatory processes balancing maintenance, expansion, and commitment of NPCs. This is a valuable model for stem cells as bulk isolation of stem progenitor cells is problematic for many stem/progenitor systems. Further, in vitro conditions enabling the controlled switching between stem/progenitor and differentiation programs have only been described for a few of these systems. Given a broad role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in regulating stem and progenitor cell programs in metazoans, the findings here may have broader significance for Wnt-directed control of organogenesis. Further, Notch and PI3K activity can also drive early nephrogenic responses in vivo or in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindström et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2011</xref>). Recent evidence also argues that not all NPCs entering the differentiation program differentiate. A minor subset returns to an NPC state after activating Wnt4, suggesting a variability in the epigenetic state among differentiating NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawlor et al., 2019</xref>). The NPC culture model will provide a rigorous analytical platform for future exploration of how distinct pathway activities and variable epigenetic organization determine the induction of mammalian nephrons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-Six2</td><td>ProteinTech</td><td>11562-1-AP;

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Edward Morrisey as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Melissa H Little (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments may be required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Most of the requested revisions can be addressed without the need for additional experiments. Of note, the editors do not feel that the request for additional Western blotting noted by reviewer 2 is required for the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a detailed and careful analysis of the mechanism by which cultured mouse nephron progenitors respond to low versus high levels of CHIR, a GSK3β inhibitor used to mimic canonical Wnt activation. It includes transcriptional profiling, ATAC-Sed ChIP seq and Hi-C analyses. The work is a collaboration between two groups who have established the duality of the action of Wnt signalling on nephron progenitors at the cellular and molecular level and developed protocols for their isolation and maintenance in vitro using a support medium called NPEM. Having titrated two concentrations of CHIR as representing the low (NPC maintenance ) and high (commitment) inducing states, they investigate how this translates into transcriptional output in vitro, revealing a shift in the interactions between b-catenin and specific TF complexes at a range of target genes (associated with either self-renewal or commitments) and novel genes. They relate this back in some instances to previously proposed targets. The work is logical, careful, comprehensive and extensive. The claims made are well supported by the data. In essence, this study both supports the authors prior findings but clarifies the interaction of b-catenin with specific chromatin complexes and target genes. There is no particular need to ask for any further studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I am not a bioinformation and I will therefore restrict my comments to the biology behind the data. In general the manuscript is very well written and the majority of conclusions drawn supported by the data. However, there are a number of points that need to be clarified.</p><p>1) The study is based on MACS isolated cells that are treated with varying concentrations of CHIR, but I was unable to find a detailed description of the experimental set up. How long were the cells cultured before they were harvested for the analysis? What was the plating density? These are important parameters that can dramatically influence the cellular response. Please provide a dedicated paragraph in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2) Figure 1A evaluates expression of different proteins by inferring levels from immunofluorescence intensity. Western blots are much more accurate for a quantitative analysis and should be shown instead. (A Western blot for β-catenin is actually shown in Supplementary Figure 3C, but no quantification is provided).</p><p>3) Axin2 is considered a direct target of β-catenin and is often used as a read out for canonical signaling. Axin2 appears to be expressed in renal progenitors, albeit at relatively low levels (Vidal et al., 2020). How does expression, occupation of enhancer sites and looping at this gene change under the different conditions?</p><p>4) The Hi-C studies allows drawing interesting conclusions about chromatin looping under two different CHIR conditions and clearly shows that certain genes are &quot;primed&quot; on the chromatin level to engage in transcription, whereas others only make contact with their enhancers upon High CHIR treatment. In this context, Figure 5C examines the distal enhancer of Wnt4 and the authors demonstrate a clear switch of enhancer occupation from TCF7l1/2 and SIX2 towards TCF7 and LEF1. β-catenin seems already bound to this enhancer under low CHIR conditions, but increases under High CHIR (this is also stated in the subsection “β-catenin uses both pre-established and de novo enhancer-promoter loops to drive NPC differentiation program”). Figure 5D, however, suggests that under low CHIR conditions b-catenin does not bind to the WNT-DE. This is confusing and needs to be clarified</p><p>5) Schuijers et al., 2014, identified two classes of β-catenin binding sites in murine intestine and two different cell lines and concluded that the vast majority of β-catenin transcriptional activity is mediated through TCF/LEF transcription factors. This paper needs to be cited and discussed.</p><p>6) The study uses CHIR to mimic different levels of β-catenin activity. CHIR is an inhibitor of GSK3β, a central component of a protein destruction complex that not only influences β-catenin stability, but also other signaling and cellular pathways. The authors acknowledge this shortcoming in their Discussion and suggest themselves that &quot;Wnt-ligand mimetics offer a promising future approach to confirm CHIR-β-catenin-centered findings&quot;. The paper would gain impact, if some of the most important findings could be verified by testing target site occupation on some key sites using WNT surrogates (ChIP-qPCR experiments).</p><p>7) Under low CHIR conditions only 234 β-catenin ChIP-seq peaks were detected and the authors hypothesize that WNT signaling may regulate proliferation (at least partly) independently of DNA binding. In this context the Wnt/STOP model should be discussed (DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2014.04.014), a mechanism that protects proteins from GSK3-dependent degradation, but does not seem to involve β-catenin activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Aspects of the manuscript that require further clarification/revision:</p><p>1) Details on in vitro NPC culture conditions and incubation hours with low or high CHIR are not provided and could be included in the Materials and methods.

Trends in gene expression from mRNA-seq were confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B)&quot;. However this is not fully supported by the data presented in Figure 1C, Supplementary file 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, which do not show a significant increase in Pax8 and Ffg8 transcript levels.</p><p>Please comment whether these differences in the expression of these differentiated genes in High CHIR are due either to the different ex vivo inductive culture conditions or another alternative explanation.</p><p>6) “Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

However, ATAC-seq was performed on freshly isolated E16 NPCs. It would be important to discuss and compare these previous results of Hilliard et al. with those obtained here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64444.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I am not a bioinformation and I will therefore restrict my comments to the biology behind the data.

The result is consistent with the original conclusion from immunostaining data in the original manuscript (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Axin2 is considered a direct target of β-catenin and is often used as a read out for canonical signaling. Axin2 appears to be expressed in renal progenitors, albeit at relatively low levels (Vidal et al., 2020). How does expression, occupation of enhancer sites and looping at this gene change under the different conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Referring to new Supplementary file 2 (replacement of old Supplementary file 3), the mean TPM for Axin2 transcript is 4.6 in low CHIR and 41.7 in high CHIR: an approximately 10-fold change with an adjusted p-value of 1e-17. In line with this trend, TPM of Axin2 is 1.0 in no CHIR condition, which is significantly lower than that in the low CHIR condition (p = 1e-24). The data is consistent with an activation of canonical Wnt signaling activation. We did observe strong binding of β-catenin, Tcf7 and Lef1 near Axin2 promoter and a distal site 30 kb upstream in high CHIR condition only. This agrees with RNA PolII loading and H3K27 acetylation of the promoter region in high but not low CHIR. Tcf7l2 binding is present in both conditions but weaker in the high CHIR condition. However, we did not capture a loop to the Axin2 promoter in either condition in the Hi-C date. A caveat of Hi-C studies is an under-representation of promoter-proximal interactions which are difficult to distinguish from the high expectation of interactions for near-adjacent genomic sequences. For readers’ convenience, we provided a table of all loops connecting to at least one gene’s promoter (new Supplementary file 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Hi-C studies allows drawing interesting conclusions about chromatin looping under two different CHIR conditions and clearly shows that certain genes are &quot;primed&quot; on the chromatin level to engage in transcription, whereas others only make contact with their enhancers upon High CHIR treatment.

We have adjusted Figure 5D to make it reflect the data where weak β-catenin binding is present in some sites in low CHIR condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Schuijers et al., 2014, identified two classes of β-catenin binding sites in murine intestine and two different cell lines and concluded that the vast majority of β-catenin transcriptional activity is mediated through TCF/LEF transcription factors.

We have modified the text in describing the NPC ChIP-seq data in the Results as follows: “In both low and high CHIR conditions, β-catenin association overlapped extensively with the binding of cognate TCF/LEF factors specifically enriched in each condition (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B). […] This is consistent with previous findings in murine intestinal studies that localization of β-catenin is primarily dependent on TCF/LEF factors (Schuijers et al., 2014)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The study uses CHIR to mimic different levels of β-catenin activity.

Any reader can search for name of genes they are interested in and see their expression levels, fold changes and p-values between two specific conditions, referring to the “Notes” sheet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the previous comment, Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 show the Top 5 enriched GO terms on the basis of lists of selected transcripts that are not shown (i.e. NPC&gt;NFC= 241 transcripts, High CHIR &gt; Low CHIR= 194 transcripts, Low CHIR&gt; High CHIR=208 transcripts…).</p><p>Similarly Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows GO terms of Low CHIR&gt;NPC and NPC &gt;Low CHIR of additional lists of transcripts.

Also, Figure 4—figure supplement 2E does not contain any GO terms; maybe there is a typo here.

However, it was not identified as a “differentially expressed gene” in this comparison because the TPM of the highest transcript did not pass 5 – our criteria for inclusion (explained in the Materials and methods and new Supplementary file 2) though the change in expression is significant. For Pax8, we agree, this is an error, there is no significant change between low and high CHIR conditions and we have accordingly corrected the statement. In contrast, there is a significant change in Pax8 expression between the low CHIR and no CHIR conditions (p-adj &lt;0.001; new Supplementary file 2), which suggests Pax8 expression maybe hyper-sensitive to CHIR concentration. Interestingly, mouse genetic studies suggest up-regulation of Pax8 is the first response in NPC commitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) “Figure 2—figure supplement 1.

However, the heatmap (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) shows the R-squared values between each sample and does not reflect information on particular regions. On the other hand, the GO term results shown in Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C were based on the differentially accessible regions between the specified conditions. Therefore, there is not a direct connection between the heatmap and the GO terms. Instead, we came up with heatmaps showing signal of the DA regions across sample and attached corresponding GO terms and motifs found and added this to a revised Figure 2C with the intention of generating a visual representation similar to the reviewer’s suggestion. We have also improved our workflow and Supplementary file 3 for better statistical rigor and making the data more accessible to the reader with accompanying minor changes in Figure 2 and figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Supplementary Figure 3C.

In the Hilliard et al., 2019 study, a major focus was the identification of epigenetic differences that may relate to maturation of the Six2+ NPC state between E16 and P2, shortly before the NPC population is lost. Consequently, ATAC-seq data in this work aimed to identify epigenetic differences reflecting elevated Wnt/ β-catenin signaling activity as NPCs underwent developmental aging. While there are some expected similarities, i.e., an enhanced differentiation signature in P2 vs. E16 also observed in high CHIR vs. low CHIR condition. Importantly, the in vivo data are interpreted as reflecting, at least in part, elevated Wnt-signaling. However, this is an interpretation in contrast to our study which directly modulates the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway to determine an effect on NPCs. Given these differences, we have not incorporated additional analyses of the Hilliard et al., 2019 data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
