Genomic safe harbour (GSH) loci have been proposed as safe sites in the human genome for transgene integration. Although several sites have been characterised for transgene integration in the literature, most of these do not meet criteria set out for a GSH and the limited set that do have not been characterised extensively. Here, we conducted a computational analysis using publicly available data to identify 25 unique putative GSH loci that reside in active chromosomal compartments. We validated stable transgene expression and minimal disruption of the native transcriptome in three GSH sites in vitro using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their differentiated progeny. Furthermore, for easy targeted transgene expression, we have engineered constitutive landing pad expression constructs into the three validated GSH in hESCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genomic safe harbour</kwd><kwd>targeted transgene expression</kwd><kwd>cell therapy</kwd><kwd>human embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>landing pad cassette</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012415</institution-id><institution>Biomedical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1610851033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Autio</surname><given-names>Matias I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202D8020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Autio</surname><given-names>Matias I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depiction of novel human genomic safe harbour loci that have been validated in vitro for safety and stable expression in human embryonic stem cells and cell types from all the three germ lineages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stable expression of transgenes is essential in both therapeutic and research applications. Traditionally, transgene integration has been accomplished via viral vectors in a semi-random fashion, but with inherent integration site biases linked to the type of virus used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 2004</xref>). The randomly integrated transgenes may undergo silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mok et al., 2007</xref>) and more concerningly, can also lead to dysregulation of endogenous genes. Gene dysregulation can lead to malignant transformation of cells and has unfortunately given rise to cases of leukaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2003</xref>) in gene therapy trials. GSH loci have been previously suggested as safe sites for transgene integration. Criteria proposed for a putative GSH include; a set distance from coding and non-coding genes; with added separation from known oncogenes and miRNAs, and no disruption of transcriptional units or ultra conserved regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papapetrou and Schambach, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papapetrou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sadelain et al., 2011</xref>). To date, a number of sites in the human genome have been used for directed integration; however none of these pass scrutiny as bona fide GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papapetrou and Schambach, 2016</xref>). Here, we conducted a computational analysis to filter sites that meet criteria for GSH loci. In addition to the safety criteria, we identified regions that reside in active chromosomal compartments in many human cell and tissue types. Our analysis yielded a final list of 25 unique putative GSH that are predicted to be accessible in multiple cell types. We used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their differentiated progeny to validate stable transgene expression in three of the putative GSH sites in vitro. Furthermore, to enable easy targeted transgene expression, we generated hESC lines with constitutive landing pad expression constructs targeted into the three validated GSH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Computational filtering for safe and accessible loci</title><p>A list of criteria has previously been suggested for a given locus to qualify as putative GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papapetrou and Schambach, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sadelain et al., 2011</xref>). These criteria state that GSH: must not be in proximity to genes coding or non-coding, with added distance from known oncogenes and miRNAs, and must not disrupt transcriptional units or ultra-conserved genomic regions. To shortlist putative GSH we conducted a computational search of the human genome using publicly available data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We included the previously published safety criteria and added a further filter to exclude any regions of DNaseI hypersensitivity, as these regions are likely enriched in transcription factor binding and regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meuleman et al., 2020</xref>). A total of 12,766 sites, ranging from 1 b to approximately 30 Mb, passed the filters used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For a universal GSH site to be useful, it needs not only to be safe, but also enable stable expression of a transgene in any tissue type. We filtered the human genome for regions consistently in the active chromatin compartment based on 21 different human cell and tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>). To extend the analysis beyond the limited set of samples, we utilised RNA-seq data of all available tissue types from the GTEx portal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carithers et al., 2015</xref>). We selected an empirical set of ubiquitously expressed genes with low variance. We then cross referenced the chromosomal locations of these genes with the consistently active chromatin regions. This analysis yielded 399 1 Mb active regions that overlapped with a ubiquitously expressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By overlapping the two datasets, we found 49 safe sites within the active regions. We further filtered the 49 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) using BLAT to remove candidate sites that had highly similar sequence matches at other genomic loci and generated a final shortlist of 25 unique putative universal GSH sites in the human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computational search for candidate GSH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the computational workflow for defining candidate GSH.

To minimise potential off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting, we used a version of Cas9 with enhanced specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slaymaker et al., 2016</xref>) and effective guides with highest predicted specificity available. Following antibiotic selection, single clones were expanded and screened for successful homology directed repair driven integration of the expression construct with junction- and digital-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

When compared to un-targeted H1 hESCs, the mean log2 fold-change (log2-FC) values of the three nearest genes in the three H1 GSH clones as well as an independent un-targeted H1 sample ranged from –0.067 to 0.065 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The results from same comparison with our established H9 lines ranged from log2-FC of –0.14 to 0.04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Only three one sample Student’s t-tests on the log2-FC results showed p-values of less than 0.05, including the H1 vs. H1 comparison of <italic>MAGI3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Overall, the nearest genes to our targeted GSH sites showed minimal change in expression levels when compared to untargeted cells.</p><p>We then conducted RNA-seq analysis to look for gene expression changes on a global scale. Pairwise comparisons of our GSH targeted clones to un-targeted H1 hESCs yielded very low numbers of differentially expressed (DE) genes; 96, 111, and 119 out of 29,696 observed genes respectively for Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19 and 260 genes for independent H1 un-targeted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Notably <italic>CASP9</italic>, the suicide gene included in our targeting construct, was the gene with lowest false discovery rate (FDR) in all three GSH lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). A high proportion of the DE genes found in our GSH targeted lines were shared with the DE genes found from pair-wise comparisons of the independent set of wild-type H1 cells to the un-targeted H1 hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Same RNAseq analysis on the H9 GSH targeted lines also yielded a low number of DE genes; 60, 51, and 91 out of 35,070 observed genes respectively for Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Pairwise comparison of the independent un-targeted H9 samples to the control H9 samples yielded 15 DE genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). <italic>CASP9</italic> was identified as a DE gene in all GSH samples, although unlike in the H1 clones in H9 it did not have the lowest FDR in any comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We also compared the genomic locations of all the observed DE genes from our RNAseq analysis to the GSH targeting locations. The closest DE gene found from our analysis in both H1 and H9 cells lies &gt;3 Mb away for Pansio-1, &gt;5 Mb for Olônne-18 and approximately 1 Mb for Keppel-19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>). None of the DE genes shared across the H1 and H9 cells are located on the same chromosome as the respective GSH loci that were targeted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), except <italic>CASP9</italic>, part of our targeting construct, and Pansio-1 on chromosome 1.</p><p>Functional enrichment analysis of the DE genes revealed relatively few terms; 2, 15, and 25 in H1 cells and 6, 5, and 18 in H9 for Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>). Many of the terms highlighted by the functional enrichment included the <italic>CASP9</italic> gene, which is over expressed from our targeting construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>). As a further safety check, we also conducted karyotyping of the established H1 and H9 lines and observed no abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2–figure supplement 6</xref>). We also used the Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19 H1 hES lines to generate teratomas in immunodeficient mice. All three lines were able to give rise to tissues from endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest minimal disruption of the native genome or the pluripotent cell identity and show a lack of karyotypic abnormalities following transgene integration to our three GSH.</p><p>In addition to safety, a functional GSH also needs to allow for stable expression of a transgene. We took advantage of the landing-pad design of our targeting construct to swap in a sequence coding for Clover-fluorophore, by introducing a plasmid expressing BxbI-integrase as well as a donor construct into the three GSH lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A &amp; B</xref>) in both H1 and H9 cells. Targeted cells were enriched with fluorescence activated cell sorting. Introduction of the payload transgene did not alter the expression of pluripotency markers OCT3/4 and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We maintained the Clover targeted GSH lines in hESC state over 15 passages and consistently observed &gt;98% Clover-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To investigate the stability of our GSH in other cell types, we conducted directed differentiation of our Clover-integrated hESC lines into cell types from the three germ lineages. Clover expression remained consistent in neuronal, liver, and cardiac cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>) in Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19 targeted H1 and H9 cells. In addition to neuronal, liver, and cardiac lineages, we also differentiated cells to pancreatic β-cells using the Pansio-1 targeted H9 line and observed Clover-transgene expression in marker-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To further quantify the Clover-transgene expression in differentiated cell types, we conducted high-content imaging on the Pansio-1 Olônne-18, and Keppel-19 targeted H9 cells differentiated to neuronal, liver, and cardiac lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Quantification of the captured images indicated high correlation of the lineage markers and the Clover transgene signal, ranging from 75% to 99% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). The expression from our landing-pad cassette is driven by a constitutive CAGG promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A &amp; B</xref>). To study whether our candidate GSH loci support transgene expression driven by other promoter sequences, we constructed an ‘all-in-one’ donor cassette for Tet-inducible transgene expression (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2–figure supplement 8A</xref>). H1 Pansio-1 hESC successfully targeted with the donor cassette were first selected with puromycin and then treated with doxycycline. Twenty-four hour incubation with 1 µg/ml doxycycline was sufficient to drive expression of the GFP transgene on average in 73% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Results from the above experiments indicate that our landing-pad GSH cell lines are able to support stable transgene expression under the CAGG promoter in hESC and derived cell types and that inducible expression from a tet-driven promoter can be observed in hESC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Integration and validation of transgene expression in GSH targeted H1 hESC and their differentiated progeny.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of integrase expression construct (pMIA22) and transposon donor construct (pMIA10.5).

Our pipeline defines 25 unique candidate GSH and we conducted in vitro validation experiments for three of them, Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19. Targeting and transgene expression in hESC at the three sites led to minimal or no change in the expression levels of the nearest native genes or the transcriptome overall and did not interfere with directed differentiation to the three germ lineages. The three tested GSH support transgene expression in the pluripotent state and in derived cell types from all the germ lineages. Furthermore, we established landing pad expression lines in H1 and H9 hESC of Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19, which we hope will serve as useful research tools.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A GSH site is an ideal location for transgene integration.

However, in contrast to the candidate sites we present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), the previously reported sites do not utilise criteria to avoid potential regulatory elements or criteria for universally stable and active genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papapetrou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pellenz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez-Fornes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eyquem et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aznauryan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odak et al., 2023</xref>).

Thus, their utilisation in a clinical setting would require extensive further safety data.

The three candidate sites we tested, Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19, demonstrated stable expression of the Clover transgene in hES cells and from all three germ-lineages identified by two lineage-specific markers after differentiation from hESC, including both hepatocyte- and cardiomyocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptome analysis of our GSH targeted hESC lines showed very low number of differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 5 and 6</xref>) when compared to untargeted H1 or H9 hESC. Furthermore, many of the DE genes we observed were shared with independent wild type hESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The nearest observed DE genes to each targeted candidate GSH were located &gt;1 Mb away from the targeted site, which is beyond the distance generally suggested for enhancer-promoter interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jerkovic and Cavalli, 2021</xref>). If the transgene integration to our GSH candidate site had a direct <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effect on expression of nearby genes, it would be expected that the genes affected would be shared between both the H1 and H9 cells in each respective GSH. The number of DE genes shared between the clones from the two cell lines is very low; 6, 9, and 8 for Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and <italic>CASP9</italic> is the only shared DE gene from all the GSH targeted lines that is located on the same chromosome as the respective GSH site. However, as <italic>CASP9</italic> is over expressed as part of our targeting construct, the effect seen is unlikely due to activation of the endogenous transcript. Overall, the transcriptomic data does not indicate direct <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effect on the expression levels of any genes from the transgene integration into targeted candidate GSH sites Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19. A more likely plausible explanation to the differences observed in our qPCR and RNA sequencing data could be heterogeneity arising from the derivation of clonal lines in our targeting process.</p><p>We show that the three tested candidate GSH sites are able to support constitutive transgene expression both in the pluripotent state and in derived cell types from all the three germ lineages. Furthermore, our data indicates that Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19 sites are able to support inducible expression in the pluripotent state. Previous studies have indicated the complex interplay between the site of transgene integration and the components of the expression cassette (promoter, enhancer, and insulators; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ordovás et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Odak et al., 2023</xref>). Further experiments using our established cell lines may help to shed light on this interaction in the future.</p><p>Our data suggest that the three candidate GSH, Pansio-1, Olônne-18, and Keppel-19, are able to support stable transgene expression in different cell types, and integration at these sites shows minimal perturbation of the native transcriptome. As hESC currently offer the best available model to test the stability of transgene expression from a GSH in the human genome, we generated landing-pad H1 and H9 hESC lines for all three candidate sites. These cell lines will allow easy integration of various transgenes to the candidate GSH for research applications. Advances in genome engineering technologies using for example e.g. novel integrases or CRISPR RNA-guided transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durrant et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yarnall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lampe et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anzalone et al., 2022</xref>) will likely lead to easier integration of more complex transgene constructs. We hope that our list of 25 candidate GSH and the three in vitro validated sites will serve as a resource for research applications in many different cell types.

Target amplification within each droplet was conducted in the C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction Module (Bio-Rad, 1851197) through the following PCR protocol: (1) Enzyme Activation at 95 °C for 10 min, (2) 40 cycles of Denaturation and annealing/extension at 94 °C for 30 s and 55 °C for 1 min, respectively, (3) Enzyme Deactivation at 98 °C for 10 min. The QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad, 1864003) then derived the number of target-containing droplets through assessing each droplet for elevated, target-specific fluorescence. Blasticidin (FAM)-positive droplet counts were normalised using its respective well-specific RPP30 (HEX)-positive counts prior to downstream analysis. All experiments were done in duplicates, with data visualised and assessed using the QuantaSoft software version 1.7.4.917 (Bio-Rad). We analysed the counts of RPP30 locus, a control locus on chr10 with a copy number of two, and the counts of Blasticidin, positive selection gene included in our landing pad targeting construct (Supp. File 3). We included a no template control, untargeted H1 and H9 cells and previously targeted H1 cells with known single copy integration of Blasticidin as controls for the copy number analysis. Clones whose normalised copy number was approximately 1 were selected for downstream analysis and banking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>qPCR analysis</title><p>RNA was extracted from five biological replicates of the GSH targeted H1 &amp; H9 hESC Pansio-1, Olônne-18 and Keppel-19and two independent cultures of untargeted cells using Direct-zol<sup>Tm</sup> RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, ZYR.R2052). One µg of RNA was converted into cDNA with Superscript IV Vilo MM (ThermoFisher Scientific, 11766050).

Each reaction was run in three technical replicates on the same reaction plate. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>) and resulting log2 fold change gene expression data was compared against reference H1 untargeted samples.

RNA concentration and quality were checked with an Agilent 2100 RNA Pico Chip (Agilent, 5067–1513). RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, 20020596) including Ribo-Zero to remove abundant cytoplasmic rRNA. The remaining intact RNA was fragmented, followed by first- and second-strand cDNA synthesis using random hexamer primers. ‘End-repaired’ fragments were ligated with a unique illumina adapters. All samples were multiplexed and pooled into a single library. Sequencing was done on a HiSeq 4000 to a minimum depth of 50 million 150 bp paired-end reads per biological sample.

In addition to the revisions relating to the reviewer comments we have also provided further experimental support for our manuscript.</p><p>Some of the reviewer suggestions include extensive engineering of new hES lines for further validation and comparison of our candidate GSH. We value these suggestions and have made plans to complete some of them, however a subset of the experiments suggested are not possible for us to complete due to time and man power constraints. We have detailed our reasoning for the experiments that can and cannot be accomplished below. The engineering of new hES lines does take considerable time and effort, hence we estimate that the experiments that we have planned will take us approximately 6-months to complete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>2. please add data that quantifies the number of cells expressing Clover, in the differentiated cell types.

We will repeat our differentiation protocols and will include quantification of Clover expression using high content imaging and/or flow cytometry.

However, this does not guarantee stable expressions from other promoters. Since the CAG promoter is very strong, it may be resistant against cellular silencing activity. For research purpose, tetracycline-regulatable promoters are often used, and it has been reported that although CAG promoter is not silenced, the TRE promoter is silenced when an expression unit is placed at AAVS1 locus (Ordovas L et al. Stem Cell Rep, 5: 918-931, 2015). Therefore, before concluding that these loci are GSH, expression from the TRE promoter should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer raising this point. Indeed testing a promoter different than CAG in our candidate GSH is an important experiment.

Please expand on the rationale for selection of the seven sites that were selected for initial targeting (i.e. what differentiated these from the other 18 sites as being suitable), and on the results for why no successful edits were identified for 4 of these loci.</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>The second major issue is that it is unclear how the authors picked seven loci for more extensive targeting out of the 25 initially identified. Without knowing the criteria used for these selections, it is challenging to know if there was a bias in selection of sites for further analysis that could alter results, or if the other identified sites are truly acceptable targets. In addition, only three of those GSH sites were successfully targeted. As a result, it is hard to determine the validity of the authors claim that they identified 25 unique GSH loci when they only fully characterize three of them. While it is not necessary to test all 25, it might be beneficial to test more than three before making these conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not making the selection criteria for our in vitro experiments clearer in the manuscript. To clarify, the 7 sites were chosen at random from the 25 candidate sites (by running a command in R <italic>round(runif(1, min = 1, max = 25))</italic>.</p><p>We capped the selection at 7 candidate loci due to the considerable amount of hands-on cell culture work in growing, CRISPR-targeting and screening clones in hES cells. We established successfully targeted clones from 3 candidate GSH in the single round of targetings done. It is likely that with further rounds of targeting and possible optimisation we would be able to generate positive clones from the remaining candidate GSH, however as a result of practical limitations of time and man power we proceeded with the characterisation of the three established sites. While it is true that we do not have validation data of all 25 candidate sites, all the sites are the result of the same bioinformatic selection and hence we class them as <italic>candidate GSH</italic>. Between the detailed curation of possible safe harbour sites and the generation of usable and functional safe harbour stem cell lines, there are a number of practical issues such as the efficiency of CRISPR targeting, which fall outside the present studies scope. Therefore after successful targeting of 3 candidates we proceeded with characterisation of the successfully engineered sites.</p><p>We have edited the main text and the methods section to clarify the selection of target sites.</p><p>Main text page 4</p><p>“To validate our candidate GSH, we selected seven of the 25 sites at random for in vitro experiments (Figure 1 C).”</p><p>Supp methods page 2</p><p>“Selection of candidate GSH for in vitro validation</p><p>Sites for in vitro validation were chosen by running the command round(runif(1, min = 1, max = 25)) in R to generate seven unique numbers.

However, Southern blotting is also a very labour intensive method and requires the use of radio labelled probes. Digital PCR has been extensively verified as a reliable method to accurately evaluate copy number of transgenes and native gene loci (Bell <italic>et al.</italic> 2018, <italic>Meth in Mol Biol</italic>; Collier <italic>et al.</italic> 2017, <italic>Plant J</italic>; Hu <italic>et al.</italic> 2020, <italic>Jour Trans Med</italic>, Härmälä <italic>et al.</italic> 2017, <italic>Meth in Mol Biol</italic>). We used droplet digital PCR to evaluate the copy number of our landing pad construct (assay targeting the Blasticidin gene) and discarded any clones which had multiple copies. Using PCR and Sanger sequencing of the target locus we established that all the clones had only a single copy integration at the target site, given that all clones amplified a wild-type allele with primers flanking the gRNA target (Supp Figure 2). Hence any clone with a copy number of more than ~1 was discarded as they contained an off-target integration (Supp Table 2).</p><p>PCR and Sanger sequencing of the top 5 predicted off-targets was conducted to check for off-target cutting by CRISPR/Cas9, which was not evident at any of the analysed sites.</p><p>We have now edited the methods section and supplementary table 3 to clarify the process of clone screening with ddPCR</p><p>Supp methods page 4</p><p>“We analysed the counts of RPP30 locus, a control locus on chr10 with a copy number of two, and the counts of Blasticidin, positive selection gene included in our landing pad targeting construct (Supp. Table 3).

Notably CASP9, the suicide gene included in our targeting construct, was the gene with lowest false discovery rate (FDR) in Pansio-1 and Olônne-18 and second lowest in Keppel-19 (Figure 2 D and Supp. Table 4). A high proportion of the DE genes found in our GSH targeted lines were shared with the DE genes found from pair-wise comparisons of control targeted H1 cells and an independent set of wild-type H1 cells to the un-targeted H1 hESCs (Figure 2 E and Supp. Table 4) Suggesting that the observed changes were unrelated to the GSH targeting and transgene expression.”</p><p>Supp methods page 5</p><p>“The differential expression analysis was conducted by DEseq2 (Love et al., 2014) evaluating all pairwise comparisons of the five test samples (1.

Cancer</italic> and Papapetrou &amp; Schambach 2016 <italic>Mol. Ther.</italic> each of the three traditional sites has a number of drawbacks (including disruption of coding or non-coding genes and proximity to oncogenes). The points highlighted in the above papers may limit application of the traditional sites in a clinical setting. The criteria used to define the GSH in this study specifically avoid gene transcription units as well as setting a limit on the distance from known oncogenes, as such our candidate sites by definition will not have the potential issues highlighted for the traditional sites.</p><p>While we agree that a direct comparisons between our new GSH and the traditional sites are of interest, these comparisons would require a very significant amount of work. We would have to establish targeting at the traditional sites with our own donor constructs and then target hESC, screen for correct clones, establish the cell lines, followed by all the analyses (e.g. RNAseq, transgene expression, lineage differentiations).
