Here, we demonstrate that B cells are not central mediators of PCOS pathology and that their frequencies are altered as a direct effect of androgen receptor activation. Hyperandrogenic women with PCOS have increased frequencies of age-associated double-negative B memory cells and increased levels of circulating immunoglobulin M (IgM). However, the transfer of serum IgG from women into wild-type female mice induces only an increase in body weight. Furthermore, RAG1 knockout mice, which lack mature T- and B cells, fail to develop any PCOS-like phenotype. In wild-type mice, co-treatment with flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, prevents not only the development of a PCOS-like phenotype but also alterations of B cell frequencies induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Finally, B cell-deficient mice, when exposed to DHT, are not protected from developing a PCOS-like phenotype. These results urge further studies on B cell functions and their effects on autoimmune comorbidities highly prevalent among women with PCOS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is a lifelong condition associated with disrupted hormone levels, which affects around 15-20% of women. Characterised by increased levels of male sex hormones released by ovaries and adrenal glands, the condition affects menstrual cycles and can cause infertility and diabetes.</p><p>Alongside the increase in male sex hormones, changes in the number of B cells have recently been observed in polycystic ovary syndrome. B cells produce antibodies that are important for fighting infection. However, it is thought that they might aggravate the condition by releasing antibodies and other inflammatory molecules which instead attack the body. It remained unclear whether changes in the B cell numbers were a result of excessive hormone levels or whether the B cells themselves were responsible for increasing the levels of male sex hormones.</p><p>Ascani et al. showed that exposing female mice to excess male sex hormones leads to symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome and causes the same changes to B cell frequencies as observed in women. This effect was prevented by simultaneously treating mice with a drug that blocks the action of male sex hormones. On the other hand, transferring antibodies from women with polycystic ovary syndrome to mice led to greater body weight and variation in B cell numbers. However, it did not result in clear symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome. Furthermore, mice without B cells still developed symptoms when exposed to male sex hormones, showing that B cells alone are not solely responsible for the development of the condition.</p><p>Taken together, the experiments show that B cells are not central mediators of polycystic ovary syndrome and the variation in their numbers is due to excess male sex hormones. This raises the question of whether B cells are an appropriate target for the treatment of this complex condition and paves the way for studies on how other immune cells are altered by hormones. Future work should also investigate how B cell function affects symptoms associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, given the association between antibody transfer and weight gain in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polycystic ovary syndrome</kwd><kwd>androgens</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>immune</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

common endocrine-metabolic disorder affecting 5–18% of women in reproductive age worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joham et al., 2022</xref>). As a multifactorial disorder with no clearly defined etiology, PCOS is diagnosed based on the criteria of hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joham et al., 2022</xref>). The syndrome is characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation and potential autoimmune sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaberšček et al., 2015</xref>), further aggravated by obesity. Indeed, women affected with PCOS are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azziz, 2018</xref>) with a number of studies indicating also a higher prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and particularly hypothyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaberšček et al., 2015</xref>). In support of this observation, serological parameters of autoimmunity, such as anti-histone and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, are relatively high among these women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hefler-Frischmuth et al., 2010</xref>). However, attempts to identify an autoimmune cause of PCOS have been uninformative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gleicher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mobeen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petríková et al., 2010</xref>). Hyperandrogenemia is a hallmark feature of PCOS that plays a key role in the pathophysiology and seems to be directly related to disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diamanti-Kandarakis and Dunaif, 2012</xref>). Although chronic inflammation and altered immune function have been proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS and T2D, it remains unknown whether the observed immune responses and autoimmune alterations in women with PCOS are a cause or consequence of hyperandrogenemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The notion of B cells exacerbating metabolic disease has been known for over a decade, both in the pathogenesis of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2016</xref>) as well as in obesity-associated insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winer et al., 2011</xref>). Although being an extreme model, biological variations in mu heavy chain knockout mice (MuMt<sup>-</sup>; B<sup>null</sup>), which fail to produce mature B cells, have contributed to this knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winer et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, muMt<sup>-</sup> mice reconstituted with B cells derived from mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) develop an impaired glucose tolerance. However, when transferring immunoglobulin G (IgG) from DIO mice to muMt mice, systemic inflammatory changes were noticeable only when the recipient mice were exposed to an high-fat diet, suggesting that metabolic effects stemming from B cells may require exposure to a prior stimulus as a determinant of reaction, via induced conditioning or induction of target autoantigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>These observations led us to investigate whether the hyperandrogenic hormonal milieu in PCOS could have a predominant role in B cell fate as the androgen receptor (AR) is expressed both in immune organs as well as on precursors and some mature immune cells, potentially implicating various levels of susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gubbels Bupp and Jorgensen, 2018</xref>). Testosterone is also an indirect regulator of the cytokine B cell activating factor (BAFF)<italic>,</italic> also known as TNFSF13B, an essential survival factor for B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelmson et al., 2018</xref>), which has been shown to be increased in women affected with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). This may be a plausible candidate mechanism as excessive BAFF levels allow for the survival of autoreactive cells and autoantibody production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vincent et al., 2014</xref>). Recent research has shown that the proportions and activity of peripheral B cells in women with PCOS are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), though it remains unclear whether B cells alone are the main inflammatory drivers of PCOS pathogenesis and whether hyperandrogenemia through AR activation may lead to the acquisition of their unique characteristics. When examining potential autoreactive B cells in PCOS, it is important and clinically meaningful to discern the role of androgen exposure alone on the immune system from that of obesity-deriving inflammation. Plasma of individuals with obesity has been shown to be enriched in IgG antibodies with anti-self-reactivity, which have been positively associated with blood frequencies of double negative (DN) B cells, considered the most pro-inflammatory B cell subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frasca et al., 2021</xref>). How androgen exposure alone, through androgen receptor activation, affects B cells and their function in a PCOS-like mice model exhibiting a reproductive and metabolic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Risal et al., 2019</xref>) remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the role of B cells in the underlying inflammation of PCOS by assessing the effect of hyperandrogenism on B cell populations and whether B cells are contributing to the pathology. For this purpose, in line with previous data coupling increased B cells numbers (CD19<sup>+</sup>) with PCOS, we first aimed to define which main B cell lineages are affected in hyperandrogenic women with PCOS. Next, we assessed whether B cells with self-reactive potential may have a causal effect on both the development of a PCOS-like phenotype, including metabolic dysfunction, and the immune profile in mice by transferring IgG from women with PCOS. To further study whether B cell frequencies are altered in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues, major variations of B cell subsets were analyzed in a dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced PCOS-like mouse model. Furthermore, we investigated whether these DHT-induced alterations are a result of androgen receptor activation by simultaneous administration of flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist. Finally, we questioned whether B cell-deficient muMt<sup>-</sup> mice are protected from developing PCOS traits when exposed to DHT.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that AR activation is a direct modulator of B cell frequencies in PCOS pathogenesis. We show that the transfer of circulating IgG from women with PCOS disrupts B cell proportions and causes an increased body weight and sex steroid imbalance in female WT mice. Collectively, our data support a model wherein activation of B cells promotes the development of a PCOS-like metabolic phenotype in mice. We also suggest caution toward therapeutically targeting CD19<sup>+</sup> cells as DHT-exposed B cell-deficient mice develop a PCOS-like phenotype, showing that a lack of B cells is not protective and reiterates the need for broader studies on alterations of the immune system within the complex hormonal frame of PCOS, including activation of T cells and tissue-resident immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Androgens are associated with altered B cell frequencies and immunoglobulin M increase in women with PCOS</title><p>As alterations of B cell frequencies have previously been shown in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), we first characterized main B cell lineages and subpopulations based on pan B cell surface marker CD19 in the serum of 15 hyperandrogenic women with PCOS and of 22 women without PCOS (controls). Women with PCOS fulfilled all three Rotterdam Criteria, displaying oligo-/amenorrhea, hirsutism, and PCOM. Women with PCOS were younger than controls, with median ages of 26 and 36, respectively, with no difference in body mass index (BMI), but with significantly higher total testosterone and androstenedione, elevated total triglycerides, and reduced HDL-cholesterol (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell memory populations were phenotypically analyzed based on surface markers IgD and CD27. Our initial assessment showed a remodeling of B cell repertoire in women with PCOS compared to controls. The frequency of age-associated DN B memory cells lacking surface expression of CD27 and IgD was significantly higher in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), with declined ‘innate-like’ unswitched CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>+</sup> B memory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). While naïve B cells populations did not differ among study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), switched CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>–</sup> were increased in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), which may directly affect unswitched B cells frequency variance. We did not find direct evidence of activation of DN B cells among women affected by PCOS. Analysis of surface marker CD38, generally expressed on antibody-secreting plasma cells, proved similar values in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Expression of CD86, a co-stimulatory molecule that usually is upregulated following activation of B cells and in turn can activate T cells, did not differ significantly either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). When assessing circulating serum antibodies, immunoglobulin M (IgM) were higher in hyperandrogenic women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) exhibiting high testosterone and increased free androgen index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h and i</xref>) compared to controls with similar BMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>).

Hence, to assess whether PCOS may have an underlying autoimmunological effector component, we investigated a possible role for IgG in PCOS systemic inflammation. IgG antibody extracted from serum of four women with PCOS diagnosed as phenotype A fulfilling all three Rotterdam Criteria, displaying oligo-/amenorrhea, hirsutism, and PCOM and of healthy controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), were purified and pooled, then transferred intraperitoneally (i.p.) into wild-type (WT) mice. Following the same procedure, IgG deriving from four hormonally healthy women was equally purified, then pooled and transferred into similar age and weight-matched WT mice. Both groups of donors were age-homogeneous with no significant differences in BMI or circulating androgen levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Among the recipient mice, there were no differences in ovulatory cycles between controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and mice receiving PCOS IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Three weeks post IgG transfer, mice receiving IgG from women with PCOS increased in body weight compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Body composition assessment showed no difference in proportion of fat or lean mass between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Interestingly, as an effect of human PCOS IgG transfer, recipient mice had also altered subsets of B lymphocytes in blood, ovary, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Circulating DN B memory cells were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) while blood-naïve cells were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), resembling the B cell distribution described in donor women with PCOS.

We further demonstrate how these highly regulated mechanisms are intrinsically AR activation-dependent. Most importantly, we show that B cells are not the central mediators of systemic inflammation or glucose metabolism impairment in PCOS as a lack of these lymphocytes does not protect from the induction of a PCOS-like phenotype following DHT exposure. Rather the DHT-exposed muMt<sup>-</sup> mice display an aggravated phenotype with higher fat mass accumulation.</p><p>In line with data combining increased BAFF levels and higher B cell frequencies in PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), hyperandrogenic women with PCOS had a significant rearrangement of the B cell repertoire, resulting in higher frequencies of ‘age-associated B cells’ (ABCs) DN B memory cells that notably differ from naïve B cells for their lack of IgD. This occurred independently of the significant age difference noted between the two cohorts both randomly recruited as PCOS-affected women were notably younger than control participants. These are in fact age-associated tissue-based atypical memory B cells that represent a low-prevalence population, generally noted in the elderly, positively impacting immunosenescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2011</xref>). They have been however described in previous studies as autoantibody enriched, poised for plasma cell differentiation, and may overaccumulate prematurely in chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiencies, thus playing a role in the regulation of humoral responses. However, based on B cells activation status and antibody-secreting potential, our findings did not support an ongoing proinflammatory activity driven by this specific heterogenous cluster as a major underlying mechanism in PCOS. Markers for B cell activation and T cell co-stimulatory capacity (CD86), as well as antibody secretion potential (CD38), did not differ from the DN memory B cells of our control population. Moreover, DN B memory cells deriving from women with PCOS were largely IgM-positive, resembling IgM-only cells. Previous studies have suggested this subset to be a major origin of switched-memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagnara et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, switched memory B cells have the propensity to differentiate into plasma cells upon reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dogan et al., 2009</xref>). These results may indicate that PCOS represents a state of prolonged trained immunity, susceptible to secondary triggers of inflammation. Consistent with this finding, by combining both markers IgD and CD27 in our study, we were able to distinguish a decrease in unswitched CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>+</sup> memory B cells accompanied by increased proportions of switched CD27<sup>+</sup> IgD<sup>-</sup> memory B cells in women with PCOS. Interestingly, a strong positive correlation was found between circulating IgM prevalence and androgens in women with PCOS, which was not affected by BMI. While increased adiposity is a determining factor in chronic inflammation, PCOS clearly triggers a condition-specific antigenic stimulus that is most likely independent of age, causing rearrangement of the humoral immune system.</p><p>There are data describing increased serum levels of autoantibodies (e.g., anti-histone and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies) in PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hefler-Frischmuth et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, a dose-dependent activation effect has been shown in vitro using PCOS-derived purified serum IgG antibodies on the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kem et al., 2020</xref>) (GnRH). In the present study, the transfer of purified and concentrated serum IgG antibodies deriving from women affected with PCOS did increase body weight in recipient mice, although there was no biological variation in ovulatory cycles, a universal PCOS-like trait. A limitation of the study that should be noted is that the number of PCOS donors for IgG transfer was low with no significant difference in circulating androgen values, potentially affecting the biological effects resulting from the transfer. Based on the availability of purified serum, the number of recipient mice was also limited potentially leading to a loss of precision and statistical power in the case of missing values in the outcome. Nonetheless, interestingly we found a concomitant disruption of B cell frequencies and a sex hormone imbalance among estrogens, partially reflecting the status of PCOS donors. Recipient mice of human PCOS IgG had in fact increased circulating DN memory B cells, with tissue-specific higher proportions of unswitched memory cells in VAT and higher frequencies of switched memory B cells in the ovaries. These effects would suggest a regulated action by PCOS-derived IgG, altering energy metabolism that led to an immediate increase in body weight while concomitantly inducing a shift in both circulating and tissue-resident B cells toward altered cellular functionality. A metabolic shift could also further lead to a reprogramming of B cells toward a phenotype with a higher pro-inflammatory propensity as suggested by a recent study where peripheral B cells from women with PCOS were shown to have an increased capacity to produce TNF-α, which is attenuated by metformin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>). However, no variations were noted in the WT IgG-recipient mice metabolic phenotype as glucose metabolism was not affected. This would be in line with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Winer et al., 2011</xref> already suggesting that preceding sterile inflammatory stimuli such as diet-induced pre-conditioning or induction of target autoantigens is required for proinflammatory IgG to have a critical role in rapid local and systemic metabolic changes. Such a stimulus affecting B cells frequencies may derive from direct or indirect testosterone/androgen receptor activation within the specific hyperandrogenic hormonal environment of PCOS.</p><p>Yet, although directly exposed to DHT before the onset of puberty, circulating B cell frequencies in the blood of peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS-like mouse model did not entirely reflect the distribution as seen in hyperandrogenic women. Additionally, we found a distinct profile of immunoglobulins in the peripheral blood of the peripubertal PCOS mouse model, with reduced levels of proinflammatory IgG2b and IgG2c titers. The increased concentration of circulating IgM in PCOS women was also not replicated. This raises the outstanding question regarding the influence of developmental origin and to what extent, if at all, does timing of androgen exposure alter B cell effector functionality in PCOS. Sensitivity of B cells to the influence of androgens is primarily during development as both pro- and pre-B cells within bone marrow express the AR, as do hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gubbels Bupp and Jorgensen, 2018</xref>). Indeed, during fetal and early postnatal origin unique innate-like lymphocytes, such as Vg3+ dendritic epidermal T cells as well as so-called B-1a cells, and a fraction of innate-like marginal zone B cells emerge that are not equally generated by adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendelac et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshimoto et al., 2011</xref>). These cell types are characterized by distinct common features extending to both adaptive and innate immunity including their semi-invariant, often self-reactive antigen receptors, rapid responses to antigen stimulation and tissue resident localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bendelac et al., 2001</xref>). Hence, the variations of observed IgM titers in PCOS women may be due to different B-1a cells frequencies, responsible for spontaneous testosterone-independent secretion of natural IgM antibodies (NAbs), which represent a large extent of circulating serum IgM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boes, 2000</xref>) that act with homeostatic housekeeping functions to multiple inflammatory reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lutz et al., 2009</xref>). Although this remains purely speculative, as to whether this may be via immune activation related to the disease or a result of the disease driving the production of NAbs of IgM, we have previously shown that prenatal androgen exposure has severe effects on the health of offspring across generations, that is, transgenerational transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Risal et al., 2019</xref>), and alterations of IgM titers in lupus-prone (MRL/lpr) mice does induce a more severe autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boes, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, while the focus of our findings was on the B cell lineage, early androgen exposure in ontogeny may have a similar impact on T cells and other innate lymphoid cells, with significant implications for the development of PCOS pathology. However, we also know that regulation of B cell number by testosterone/AR may occur also in mature B cells lacking AR independently of developmental effects as demonstrated in spleen from short-term castration of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Gendt et al., 2004</xref>). Within the context of sexual dimorphism in immunity and the effects of testosterone on B cells, previous research has focused on human male data or conditional AR knockout (ARKO) and castrated male mice. Both global ARKO models as well as castration cause a systemic alteration, which does not allow to distinguish in these studies if changes in the distribution of lymphocytes are due to a direct action of androgens on immature B cells expressing the AR or from secondary effects of surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A recent study has demonstrated how endogenous testosterone regulates indirectly mature splenic B cell number in a BAFF-receptor dependent manner via testosterone-mediated increase in sympathetic nervous transmission regulating BAFF-producing fibroblastic reticular cells in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelmson et al., 2018</xref>). There is, however, no data available regarding the concentration–response relation between BAFF levels, both local or systemic, and B cell numbers in mice. BAFF levels are overall tightly regulated and human studies suggest that serum BAFF levels within normal homeostatic ranges are inversely associated with peripheral B cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferrer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kreuzaler et al., 2012</xref>). This has led to the notion that estradiol accelerates autoimmunity while testosterone has an inhibiting action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>). However, the singular setting of hyperandrogenic PCOS, with increased circulating and tissue-specific levels of testosterone along with higher estrogen-to-progesterone ratios leading to anovulatory cycles, as well as high estrogen levels during prenatal life, may disrupt the development of the thymus and its function in maintaining immune tolerance and are suspected to heighten autoimmune response in PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kowalczyk et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, serum levels of BAFF have been shown to be higher in women diagnosed with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings in the peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS mouse model showed metabolic alterations in glucose metabolism accompanied by variations among B cell populations, not only in blood-derived cells but also in immune cells seeding peripheral tissues. Trends of differential expression of complement receptor type 2 (CR2/CD21) on IgD<sup>+</sup>-naïve cells in both metabolic, immune, and reproductive tissues may suggest an effect deriving from BAFF overexpression affecting transitional B cell maturation. BAFF is critical for the upregulation of expression of CD21, leading to greater proliferation and Ig secretion potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suryani et al., 2010</xref>); however, there is no direct link with the development of an autoimmune state. These effects were prevented and overall reduced by concomitant treatment with flutamide, supporting the idea that any modulation of B cells is regulated via AR activation. Finally, the lack of phenotype entirely with no variations neither in metabolic nor reproductive parameters in B cell reconstituted muMt<sup>-</sup> mice as well as in IgG-recipient T cell-deficient RAG1 KO<sup>-/-</sup> mice further suggest that the effects of B cells deriving from a PCOS-like environment may be dependent on androgen exposure of other leukocytes to fully promote impairment of metabolic parameters.</p><p>The fact that B cell depletion has profound effects on glucose homoeostasis is well accepted. For example, rituximab, an anti-human CD20 mAb, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as well as B cell malignancies, can cause both hyperglycemia and severe hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hussain et al., 2006</xref>). Depletion of B cells in mice with a CD20 mAb early in atherosclerotic disease has also shown therapeutic benefits in the abnormal glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Oufella et al., 2010</xref>). It is important to note that in these CD20 mAb therapies the beneficial effects were linked to reduced T cell activation. In the present study, the lack of B cells did not prevent the development of a PCOS-like phenotype in muMt<sup>-</sup> mice exposed to DHT, with both reproductive and metabolic effects, such as higher deposits of adipose tissue. Based on these results, in accordance with the lack of phenotype in RAG1 KO<sup>-/-</sup> mice following IgG transfer, identification of the precise role for T cell activation in PCOS warrants further investigation as well as of tissue-resident immune cells such as macrophages, potentially skewing to a pro-inflammatory phenotype, which may, in turn, be responsible for inflammatory cytokine production.</p><p>In conclusion, our study uncovers a previously unrecognized regulation via AR signaling, indirectly affecting B cell production of pathogenic IgG antibodies affecting energy metabolism. Moreover, our data raise a concern about uniquely identifying CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells as a potential therapeutic target for PCOS as our findings do not support the notion that depletion of B cells is protective from developing PCOS-like traits. Concurrently increased levels of IgM may rather suggest a dual housekeeping function activity. Differences in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity may be unique within the specific hormonal state of women with PCOS and should be investigated further.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

frequencies and particularly the distribution of DN B cells among women with PCOS, from September 2019 to March 2021, 42 women, all Caucasian ethnicity, were screened for a PCOS diagnosis at the Medical University Clinics in Graz (Austria) for either of the two main PCOS hyperandrogenic phenotypes. Phenotype A: clinical hyperandrogenemia, oligo- anovulation, and PCOM; or phenotype B: clinical hyperandrogenemia and oligo- anovulation. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed using the modified Ferriman–Gallwey (FG) score, with a self-reported score of 8 or higher indicating hirsutism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yildiz et al., 2010</xref>). For total testosterone, a cut-off of 0.6 ng/mL (2.1 nmol/L) was used based on previously published data from a representative population sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindheim et al., 2017</xref>). Oligo-/anovulation was defined as menstrual cycles with a duration &gt;35 d or the absence of menstruation for three or more consecutive months. PCOM, diagnosed by a gynecological ultrasound, was assessed based on medical history. Thyroid disorder, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, androgen-secreting tumors, and pregnancy were excluded by laboratory measurements of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OH-P), cortisol, prolactin, pregnancy test, and clinical examination. Exclusion criteria considered multiple factors affecting participants’ immune and hormonal profiles, such as neoplastic, infectious, and autoimmune diseases as well as currently used hormonal contraceptives or immunomodulating drugs. The final analyses of fasting blood samples for B cell frequencies were performed from a group of 15 women with PCOS and 22 controls. Antibody variation titers were examined in the same cohort of women specifically in 15 PCOS and in 18 of the 22 controls. In the case of missing values due to lack of measurement, patients were excluded from the analysis report for that variable. All recruitment took place at the endocrinological Outpatient Clinic of the University Hospital Graz by routine doctors, and nurses involved in the project. All participants provided oral and written informed consent after a positive vote of the Ethics Committee of the Medical University Graz (EK 31-560 ex 18/19). The work here described has been carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. For the extraction of IgG, from February 2020 to October 2020, a second cohort of 10 women were randomly recruited to voluntarily participate in the study for transfer of purified antibodies. Seven women were diagnosed with PCOS, one did not fulfill the inclusion criteria and two decided to drop out, leaving four women with PCOS and four healthy donors. The diagnosis was conducted at the Medical University Clinics in Graz (Austria) according to the aforementioned criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Clinical examination, blood sampling, and biochemical measurements</title><p>Anthropometric measures included weight, height, waist circumference, and BMI, which was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaberšček et al., 2015</xref>) and waist-to-hip circumference. Baseline fasting blood samples were drawn for each participant in serum, EDTA, and lithium heparin tubes. Hormonal levels were assessed in fasting serum samples: total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone were measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindheim et al., 2017</xref>); sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and insulin were measured by automated chemiluminescence immunoassay (ADVIA Centaur XP, Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland); serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, DIAsource Immunoassay, Belgium); plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose were measured by automated enzymatic colorimetric assay (Cobas, Roche, Germany). The area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin was calculated from the oGTT using the trapezoidal method. Serum SHBG and testosterone were used to calculate the free androgen index as serum testosterone/SHBG ×100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Chemiluminescent ELISA</title><p>Chemiluminescent ELISA of human samples was performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hendrikx et al., 2016</xref>) for total IgM, IgG, and IgA. In brief, purified anti-human IgM, IgG, and IgA (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) at concentrations of 5 μg/mL in 50 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-EDTA were added to each well of a 96-well white, round-bottom microtitration plate (MicrofluorII round-bottom; Thermo, Rochester, NY) and incubated overnight at 4°C. After washing and blocking with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with or without EDTA (pH 7.4, containing 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 30 min at room temperature [RT]), the plate was incubated with plasma samples in their respective dilutions in 1% BSA in TBS with EDTA (pH 7.4) for 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C. Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-labeled goat anti-human IgM (μ-chain specific; Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria; 1:50,000 in TBS BSA), AP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (γ-chain specific; Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria; 1:50,000 in TBS BSA), and AP-labeled goat anti-human IgA (α-chain specific; Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria; 1:50,000 in TBS BSA) were used for detection. AP-conjugated secondary reagents were detected using Lumi-Phos (Lumigen, Southfield, MI; 33% solution in water) and a Synergy 2 Luminometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Washing steps were performed on an ELx405 Select Deep Well Microplate Washer (BioTek) with PBS or PBS-EDTA. Internal controls were included on each microtiter plate to detect potential variations between microtiter plates. The intra-assay coefficients of variation for all assays were 5–15%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lymphocyte phenotyping of human samples</title><p>Blood samples from the baseline visit were processed within 4 hr for analysis by flow cytometry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schulz et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, for B-cell phenotyping, PBMCs were isolated from lithium heparin whole blood by Ficoll gradient density centrifugation. One million PBMCs were incubated with the following antibodies: CD19-VioGreen (clone REA675), anti-IgD-VioBlue (clone IgD26), CD27-APC (clone M-T271), CD86-PE-Vio770 (clone FM95), CD38-FITC (clone IB6), and anti-IgM-PE (clone PJ2-22H3, all purchased from Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Samples were measured using a FACSLyric flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Data were analyzed using the FACSSuite (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Animals and study design</title><p>All mice experiments were carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986, and associated guidelines, EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Stockholm Ethical Committee for animal research (20485-2020) in accordance with the Swedish Board of Agriculture’s regulations and recommendations (SJVFS 2019:9) and controlled by Comparative Medicine Biomedicum at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. Mice were maintained under a 12 hr light/dark cycle and in a temperature-controlled room with ad libitum access to water and a diet. All mice were on female on C57BL/6J background. For the transfer of human IgG 24 five-week-old female C57BL/6JRj mice were obtained from Janvier Labs. Rag1 KO<sup>-/-</sup> were generated by breeding 10 male and 10 female B6.129S7-Rag1 (homozygous for Rag1) breeding pairs from Jackson Laboratory. For immune characterization of the peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS mice, 30 three-week-old female C57BL/6JRj mice were obtained from Janvier Labs and left to acclimatize for 1 wk. For the B cell reconstitution, 10 three-week-old female C57BL/6JRj mice were obtained from Janvier Labs to develop the peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS model. This peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS mouse model was developed by implanting a 5 mm silastic implant containing 2.0–2,5 mg of continuously releasing DHT according to previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2018</xref>), which was implanted subcutaneously in the neck region of 28–29-day-old C57BL/6JRj female mice. Surgery was performed under light anesthesia with isoflurane. Control mice were implanted with an empty, blank implant. To investigate androgen receptor activation, a third group received, in addition to the DHT implant, a 4.5 mm continuously releasing pellet containing 25 mg of flutamide (releasing time 90 d, Innovative Research of America, Cat# NA-152), an androgen receptor antagonist. Mice were randomly allocated to one of these three groups: control, DHT, and DHT-flutamide. A PCOS-like phenotype was fully developed after 3 weeks of exposure. MuMt<sup>-</sup> mutant mice were generated from 10 male and 10 female B6.129S2-Ighm (homozygous for Ighm) breeding pairs from Jackson Laboratory. No mice received further monthly implants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Purification and transfer of IgG</title><p>IgG from human sera was purified utilizing a HiTrap Protein G HP purification column (Bio-Sciences AB) according to the vendor’s instructions. Briefly, samples were centrifuged at 3000 RCF for 5 min at 4°C and supernatant was diluted 5× with binding buffer. The final elution containing IgG was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against endotoxin-free PBS and further filtered to obtain sterile antibody solution. IgG concentration in each sample was measured by QUBIT (Thermo Scientific) according to the vendor’s instructions and stored at –20°C. Samples from the serum of PCOS-affected women cohort or serum of the control group were separately pooled. The day before injection, samples were filtered and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters (30 kDa MWCO – 15 mL sample volume) according to the vendor’s instructions (Merck Millipore). Briefly, samples were thawed and kept at 4°C the night before concentration; after filtering samples through sterile 0.22 µm syringe filter, desired concentration was obtained by spinning multiple times at 1000 × <italic>g</italic>/4°C until reaching final concentration of 4 mg/mL of IgG antibody in a total volume of 450 µL at injection days 1 and 3, and 365 µL at injection day 10 of endotoxin-free PBS. Final IgG concentration was measured once again by QUBIT (Thermo Scientific). 7-week-old female C57BL/6JRj mice, randomly divided into two study groups of six mice each, received purified human IgG (&gt;98% pure) via i.p. injection in endotoxin-free PBS on days 1, 3, and 10. To assess the role of T cells mediating the response to IgG, the same procedure was repeated utilizing age-matched in-house bred mutant Rag1 KO<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Assessment of reproductive phenotype</title><p>In all groups, anogenital distance, a biomarker for androgen exposure, was measured at baseline and at sacrifice. For the transfer of human IgG, anogenital distance was measured 1 wk after first i.p. injection in both WT and RAG1 KO<sup>-/-</sup> mice. For immune characterization, anogenital distance was measured 3 wk after DHT/flutamide implantation. For B cell reconstitution, anogenital distance in reconstituted muMt- mice was measured 2 wk after reconstitution. Estrous cyclicity was assessed by daily vaginal smear for 12 consecutive days (three ovulatory cycles).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Assessment of metabolic phenotype</title><p>Body weight development was recorded weekly. Body composition was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (EchoMRI-100 system, Houston, TX) to measure total fat and lean mass in conscious mice. Glucose metabolism was measured by oGTT after a 5 hr fast. Mice received 2 mg per gram body weight of D-glucose (20% glucose in 0.9% NaCl) administrated by orally by gavage. Blood glucose was measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 60, and 90 min following glucose administration (Free Style Precision). Blood was collected in EDTA-coated capillary tubes at baseline and 15 min for insulin measurement by tail bleeding. Plasma separation is obtained by spinning the samples at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C and stored at – 20°C. Based on the study design for individual project objectives, for the transfer of human IgG as well as B cell reconstitution, mice were first assessed for oGTT when the expected effects from the transfer on glucose metabolism were most likely at their peak, followed by EchoMRI evaluation. For project characterization of DHT-induced PCOS-like mouse model as well as the characterization of androgen-exposed muMt- mouse model, mice were first screened through EchoMRI to measure total fat and lean mass and then subjected to an oGTT evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Biochemical assessment of insulin and sex steroids in mice</title><p>Plasma insulin from oGTT was analyzed by an ELISA kit (Crystal Chem).

Rag1 KO<sup>-/-</sup> receiving human IgG were sacrificed at 16–17 weeks of age. For immune characterization of the peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS model, two independent experiments were conducted to evaluate separate timepoints: a first cohort of C57BL/6JRj mice were sacrificed at 20–22 weeks of age, while in a following assessment DHT-exposed C57BL/6JRj mice were sacrificed at 13–14 weeks of age. For the reconstitution of B<sup>null</sup> muMt<sup>-</sup> mice with splenic B cells following DHT exposure, a cohort of C57BL/6JRj mice were sacrificed at 8 weeks of age, 4 weeks after DHT implant, for the retrieval of spleen B cells. The B cell reconstituted muMt<sup>-</sup> mice were sacrificed at 11–12 weeks of age. For characterization of DHT-exposed MuMt<sup>-</sup> model, mice were sacrificed at 13–14 weeks of age. All mice were sacrificed based on their ovulatory cycle stage in metestrus or diestrus, assessed by vaginal smears less than 2 hr prior sacrifice. Mice were fasted for 2 hr and anesthetized with isoflurane (Isoflo vet, Orion Pharma Animal Health). Blood was drawn by cardiac puncture using a 21G needle; an aliquot of 150 µL was directly transferred to EDTA-coated tube, and placed on ice for FACS analysis. The remaining amount of blood was transferred to microvette capillary tubes (Sarstedt) for serum separation. After dissection, spleen and lymph nodes were kept on ice in PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (DPBS). Ovaries, endometrium, and VAT tissues were maintained in RPMI containing 2% FBS on ice for cell isolation.

All tissue-deriving cells were plated on 96-well round-bottom plates and stained (Sarstedt, 83.3925.500) with FC-blocking antibody surface antigen staining (CD16/32, clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:100 in flow cytometry buffer, followed by incubation with the following antibodies: IgD-Pacific Blue (clone 11-26c.2a, BioLegend), CD19-BV480 or PE/Cyanine7 (clone 1D3, BD Biosciences, or clone 6D5, BioLegend, respectively), CD45R/B220-FITC (clone RA3-6B2, BD Biosciences), CD21/CD35-PE-CF594 (clone 7G6, BD Biosciences), CD138-PE/Cyanine7 (Syndecan-1, clone 281-2, BioLegend), CD27-APC (clone LG.3A10, BD Biosciences), IgM-APC/Cyanine7 (clone RMM-1, BioLegend), and CD86-BV510 (clone GL1, BD Biosciences). Samples were measured using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Total antibody quantification in plasma by ELISA</title><p>Chemiluminescent ELISA was performed as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsiantoulas et al., 2021</xref>). Total IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3, and IgA antibodies in plasma were measured by ELISA. In brief, 96-well white round-bottomed MicroFluor microtiter plates (Thermo Lab Systems) or immunoGrade, 96-well, PS Standard plates (781724; Brand) were coated with an anti-mouse IgM (Sigma; M8644; at 2 μg/mL), anti-mouse IgG1 (BioLegend; RMG1-1; at 2 μg/mL), anti-mouse IgG2b (BD Biosciences; R9-91; at 3 μg/mL), anti-mouse IgG2c (STAR135; at 1 μg/mL), anti-mouse IgG3 (BD Biosciences; R2-38; at 4 μg/mL), or anti-mouse IgA (BD Biosciences; C10-3; at 3 μg/mL) in PBS overnight and then washed three times with PBS and blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% BSA (TBS/BSA) for 1 hr at RT. Then wells were washed with either PBS (plates for IgM, IgG2b, and IgG2c) or PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween (plates for IgG1, IgG3, and IgA), and diluted mouse plasma was added in TBS/BSA to the wells and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed, and bound Igs were detected with an anti-mouse IgM antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma; A9688), the biotinylated forms of anti-mouse IgG1 (BD Biosciences; A85-1) or anti-mouse IgG2b (BD Biosciences; R12-3), anti-mouse IgG2c (JIR 115-065-208), anti-mouse IgG3 (BD Biosciences; R40-82), or anti-mouse IgA (BD Biosciences; C10-1). Wells were washed again as before and neutravidin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was added where appropriate. Then, wells were washed again as before and rinsed once with distilled water, and 25 μL of a 30% LumiPhos Plus solution in dH<sub>2</sub>O (Lumigen Inc) was added. After 75 min, the light emission was measured with a Synergy 2 luminometer (BioTek) and expressed as RLU per 100 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>For statistical evaluation, Prism (version 9; GraphPad Software) and SPSS (version 28.0; SPSS) were used. All continuous data were screened for normality by Shapiro–Wilk test and equality of variance. Normally distributed data were compared using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests, and when not normally distributed differences between groups were compared using Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Differences between more than two groups were determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05. One patient or one animal was considered a biological replicate. In the case of missing values, patients or animals were excluded from the analysis for that variable.</p><p>For the first cohort, the human monocentric case–control explanatory study based on B cell frequencies, the sample size was calculated taking into account the distribution associated with specific PCOS phenotypes A and B. More than half of PCOS patients identified within the clinical setting demonstrate phenotype A, whereas the other three phenotypes (i.e., B, C, and D) have almost equal prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lizneva et al., 2016</xref>), added to the observations that the presence of hyperandrogenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrmann et al., 2006</xref>), BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrmann et al., 2006</xref>), and degree of menstrual irregularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brower et al., 2013</xref>), while no ovarian morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Legro et al., 2005</xref>), may be considered independent predictors of metabolic dysfunction. Finally, with the aim to evaluate the effects of double negative autoreactive B cells and assuming a predicted variation of 10% among total CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell populations in PCOS patients based on previously reported assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), we aimed for a total sample of 40 subjects, 20 PCOS, and 20 controls, to achieve 90% power to detect differences among the means versus the alternative of equal means using an <italic>F</italic> test with a 0.05 significance level. The size of the variation in the means is represented by the effect size f = σm/σ, which is 0.31. Sample size was generated using PASS 15.0.6.</p><p>For the second study cohort, for the transfer of purified IgG, a predefined sample size was not assigned.</p><p>For animal studies, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size, based on previous reported assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Risal et al., 2019</xref>). Animals were allocated to experimental groups arbitrarily without formal randomization. Investigators were not formally blinded to group allocation during the experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Participants provided oral and written informed consent after a positive vote of the Ethics committee of the Medical University Graz (EK 31-560 ex 18/19).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Licy Yanes Cardozo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please, consider this list of essential issues that could help you to improve the clarity and presentation of your work:</p><p>1) Check the number of subjects at each stage of study and report it correctly in the tables and figures.</p><p>2) Explain the reasons for the use of T-test criteria for some comparisons presented in Tables S1-2.</p><p>3) Discuss the limitations of the study considering sources of potential bias.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study is well-designed, the methods are convincing. Generally, results are based on the compelling strength of evidence, but there are some remarks regarding the data presentation.</p><p>The total number of screened women should be presented in the Material and Methods section (page 13), because n=15 is the final number of recruited women with PCOS.</p><p>It looks reasonable to present the number of observations in all the Figures.</p><p>Please, comment on the significant age difference between women from the PCOS and control groups, which may cause some biases.</p><p>At the same time, the use of the T-test when comparing data on age (Table S1), which is obviously characterized by the absence of equality of variances, should be explained.</p><p>T-test was also used when comparing data, presented in Table S2, with a number of observations in the group = 4. Please confirm that, with such few observations, the data had a normal distribution without variance differences.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this article, the role of B cells in immune cell activation in PCOS was determined. This is a very exciting paper with novel information in an area of growing interest and highly clinically relevant. One of the clear strengths of this manuscript is that it combines basic research with clinical studies in PCOS women. The main findings of the manuscript are:</p><p>– Androgens are associated with altered B cell frequencies and immunoglobulin M increase in women with PCOS.</p><p>– Transfer of human-derived IgG antibodies results in increased body weight in WT female mice but not glucose impairment.</p><p>– Altered B cell frequencies are replicated in a DHT-induced PCOS-like mouse model and seen in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues.</p><p>– DHT-induced PCOS-like mice show a distinct IgG profile.</p><p>– B cell transfer from DHT-induced PCOS-like mice into B cell-deficient mice does not induce a PCOS-like phenotype.</p><p>– B cell deficiency does not protect from the induction of a PCOS-like phenotype by DHT exposure</p><p>Experiments were carried with adequate control.</p><p>I have the following suggestions that the authors may consider.</p><p>Please clarify the number of PCOS participants for IgG donor experiments, in figure looks like n of 5 while in Table S2 only 4. Regardless, the low number of participants should be included in the weakness section of the discussion.

We have now referenced the number of subjects within all legends of individual figures and tables and hope to add clarity also for future readers' sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Explain the reasons for the use of T-test criteria for some comparisons presented in Tables S1-2.</p></disp-quote><p>In re-analyzing the test assumptions for the data in Tables S1-2 (now included in the main file as Table 1 and 2), we acknowledge that the T-Test may not be the most fitting for the comparisons presented. Hence, we used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test for statistical analyses in Tables 1-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discuss the limitations of the study considering sources of potential bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editors that this aspect needs to be clearly addressed for the readers within the discussion. One limitation was the number of participants recruited throughout the pandemic years, particularly for the extraction of purified IgG. We have now highlighted within the discussion our main concerns and stated as follows:</p><p>“A limitation of the study that should be noted is that the number of PCOS donors for IgG transfer was low with no significant difference in circulating androgen values, potentially affecting the biological effects resulting from the transfer. Based on the availability of purified serum, the number of recipient mice was also limited potentially leading to a loss of precision and statistical power in the case of missing values in the outcome.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study is well-designed, the methods are convincing. Generally, results are based on the compelling strength of evidence, but there are some remarks regarding the data presentation.</p><p>The total number of screened women should be presented in the Material and Methods section (page 13), because n=15 is the final number of recruited women with PCOS.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is of importance and the number of included participants has been clarified in Material and Methods (Page 13-14) and is also given in tables and legends of figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It looks reasonable to present the number of observations in all the Figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and to assist readers we have added the number of subjects for each stage of the study in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please, comment on the significant age difference between women from the PCOS and control groups, which may cause some biases.</p><p>At the same time, the use of the T-test when comparing data on age (Table S1), which is obviously characterized by the absence of equality of variances, should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we expanded the Discussion section with an indepth consideration regarding the potential effects stemming from the age differences between cases and control in the first cohort. We believe this facilitates a better understanding of double negative (DN) B cells in PCOS for the readers.</p><p>We clarified their nature as notably “age-associated” (ABCs) immunosenescent B cells and stated the following (page 9):</p><p>“This [finding] occurred independently of the significant age difference noted between the two cohorts both randomly recruited, as PCOS affected women were younger than control participants. These are in fact age-associated tissuebased atypical memory B cells which represent a low prevalence population, generally noted in the elderly, positively impacting immunosenescence. They have been however described in previous studies as autoantibody enriched, poised for plasma cell differentiation, and may over-accumulate prematurely in chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiencies thus playing a role in the regulation of humoral responses”. In the following paragraph we further highlighted this aspect in our interpretation based on the results that a condition-specific antigenic stimulus deriving from PCOS inflammatory state “which is most likely independent of age, causing rearrangement of the humoral immune system” (page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>T-test was also used when comparing data, presented in Table S2, with a number of observations in the group = 4. Please confirm that, with such few observations, the data had a normal distribution without variance differences.</p></disp-quote><p>In re-analyzing the test assumptions for the data in Tables S1-2 (now included in the main file as Table 1-2), we acknowledge that the T-Test may not be the most fitting for the comparisons presented. Instead, we now use the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test for statistical analyses in Tables 1-2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have the following suggestions that the authors may consider.</p><p>Please clarify the number of PCOS participants for IgG donor experiments, in figure looks like n of 5 while in Table S2 only 4. Regardless, the low number of participants should be included in the weakness section of the discussion. The lack of effects on the full manifestations could be due to a low number of participants and also in those women the level of androgens was normal.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in presenting this aspect of the data. Figure 5 describes the experiment where we investigate androgen-mediated regulation of B cell phenotypes, DN B memory cells as well as circulating antibody titers, in tissues other than blood, in the well-established peripubertal DHT-induced PCOS mouse model.</p><p>The donor experiment is presented in Figure 2 and we have now added the exact number of IgG donors as well as the number of recipient mice described.</p><p>Following the reviewer`s recommendation, we have proceeded by noting the clinical characteristics of the IgG donors firstly within the results (page 6) which is stated as following:</p><p>“Both groups of donors were age-homogeneous with no significant differences in BMI or circulating androgen levels” as well as within the discussion (page 10) describing a relevant limitation of this study´s outcome by stating as follows:</p><p>“A limitation of the study that should here be noted is that the number of PCOS donors for IgG transfer was ultimately quite low with normal androgen values, potentially affecting the biological effects resulting from the transfer. Based on the availability of purified serum, the number of recipient mice was also restricted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>IgA was decreased in PCOS, but was not significant, perhaps due to the low number of subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the low number of participants decreased the statistical power, although an interpretation of the overall decrease in IgA may not be as equally straightforward based on our findings. It remains unclear if the decrease in IgA is indeed a distinct humoral profile in PCOS possibly due to defective germinal center reactions and the extrafollicular expansion of unique IgM<sup>+</sup> DN B cells, or rather a compensatory mechanism to the increase of IgM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7, was a group treated with flutamide in this cohort?</p></disp-quote><p>No, and indeed it may have been a more elegant manner to complete the results. This aspect of the study was designed to challenge the main hypothesis that a complete lack of B cells would be protective. Based on the previous wild-type experiments we reasoned to have demonstrated sufficiently the effects of androgen receptor activation in an attempt to follow the 3R principles, optimizing the amount of information with fewer animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clinical characteristics of the PCOS participants should be moved to the main result section.</p></disp-quote><p>The clinical characteristics has now been included in the main manuscript as Table 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statistical section mentions 40 participants. This is confusing as two sets of PCOS were used.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is of importance and the number of included participants has been clarified in Material and Methods (Page 13-14) and is given in tables and legends of figures. Regarding samples size estimation we have clarified as follows (Statistics; page 19):</p><p>“For the first cohort, the human monocentric case-control explanatory study based on B cell frequencies […] we aimed for a total sample of 40 subjects, 20 PCOS and 20 controls”; “For the second study cohort, for the transfer of purified IgG, a predefined sample size was not assigned.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
