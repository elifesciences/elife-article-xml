As ribonucleotide reduction has on occasion been lost in parasites and endosymbionts, which are instead dependent on their host for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, it should in principle be possible to knock this process out if growth media are supplemented with deoxyribonucleosides. We report the creation of a strain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> where all three ribonucleotide reductase operons have been deleted following introduction of a broad spectrum deoxyribonucleoside kinase from <italic>Mycoplasma mycoides.</italic> Our strain shows slowed but substantial growth in the presence of deoxyribonucleosides. Under limiting deoxyribonucleoside levels, we observe a distinctive filamentous cell morphology, where cells grow but do not appear to divide regularly. Finally, we examined whether our lines can adapt to limited supplies of deoxyribonucleosides, as might occur in the switch from de novo synthesis to dependence on host production during the evolution of parasitism or endosymbiosis. Over the course of an evolution experiment, we observe a 25-fold reduction in the minimum concentration of exogenous deoxyribonucleosides necessary for growth. Genome analysis reveals that several replicate lines carry mutations in <italic>deoB</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic>. deoB codes for phosphopentomutase, a key part of the deoxyriboaldolase pathway, which has been hypothesised as an alternative to ribonucleotide reduction for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. Rather than complementing the loss of ribonucleotide reduction, our experiments reveal that mutations appear that reduce or eliminate the capacity for this pathway to catabolise deoxyribonucleotides, thus preventing their loss via central metabolism. Mutational inactivation of both <italic>deoB</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic> is also observed in a number of obligate intracellular bacteria that have lost ribonucleotide reduction. We conclude that our experiments recapitulate key evolutionary steps in the adaptation to life without ribonucleotide reduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribonucleotide reduction</kwd><kwd>endosymbiosis</kwd><kwd>intracellularity</kwd><kwd>deoxyribonucleotide synthesis</kwd><kwd>phosphopentomutase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society Te Apārangi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-UOA-257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogawa</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Anthony M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> line lacking deoxyribonucleotide synthesis has been created and subjected to experimental evolution, revealing that endosymbionts and pathogens that lack ribonucleotide reduction avoid loss of deoxyribonucleotides to central metabolism by disruption of the salvage pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All life on our planet requires ribonucleotide reduction for de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, from ribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>). The emergence of ribonucleotide reduction likely drove the transition from RNA to DNA early in the evolution of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reichard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Torrents et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poole et al., 2002</xref>) and its centrality is reflected in its near ubiquity in organismal genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>). Structural analyses indicate that the catalytic cores of ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are homologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sintchak et al., 2002</xref>), despite sequence similarities between them being extremely limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tauer and Benner, 1997</xref>). RNRs catalyse deoxyribonucleotide synthesis via a common mechanism wherein a cysteinyl-free radical is generated in the active site. While this similarity in catalysis underscores a common evolutionary origin, RNRs have diverse mechanisms for radical generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>). Three broad, evolutionarily distinct, families exist which are also divided on the basis of their radical generation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>). This divergence likely coincides with adaptation to varied environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>). Class I enzymes are strictly aerobic in that they require oxygen or superoxide for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rose et al., 2018</xref>). This typically, though not exclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaesi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Srinivas et al., 2018</xref>), occurs through oxidation of a dimetal ion centre from which a stable cysteine radical is generated, either directly, or indirectly through formation of a tyrosyl radical in the small subunit. Class III enzymes generate a stable glycine radical via cleavage of <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine, and are strictly anaerobic, while class II enzymes generate a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical through cleavage of adenosylcobalamin and operate irrespective of oxygen presence or absence.</p><p>To date, very few species have dispensed with ribonucleotide reduction, albeit indirectly, in that they instead rely on their hosts for deoxyribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>). Examples include a strain of <italic>Buchnera aphidicola str. Cc</italic> from the Cedar bark aphid, <italic>Cinara cedri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez-Brocal et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> are maternally inherited aphid endosymbionts that synthesise amino acids in short supply in the aphid diet, are obligately intracellular, and appear to be on the path to transitioning to an organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tamas et al., 2002</xref>). Two bacterial pathogens that live in very close association with their hosts—<italic>Ureaplasma urealyticum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glass et al., 2000</xref>) and <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fraser et al., 1997</xref>)<italic>—</italic>have also lost genes for ribonucleotide reduction, as have two eukaryotic parasites, <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>While ribonucleotide reduction is essential, we reasoned that it should be possible to dispense with genes for ribonucleotide reduction if deoxyribonucleotides or their precursors are available via growth media. We report the successful elimination of all three RNR operons from the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The knockout strain was created by introducing a broad-spectrum deoxyribonucleoside kinase from <italic>Mycoplasma mycoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2001</xref>), which we predicted would enable use of media-supplied deoxyribonucleosides for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis in the absence of ribonucleotide reduction. As predicted, the resulting strain is dependent on deoxyribonucleosides in the growth medium but cannot grow if the media are supplemented with deoxyribose (dR) plus the four nucleobases (A, G, C, T). To understand the impact of limited deoxyribonucleoside availability, we subjected our knockout line to experimental evolution followed by genome sequencing. We were interested in establishing whether, under such conditions, our lines would utilise the reverse deoxyriboaldolase (DERA) pathway for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. This pathway is reversible in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horinouchi et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogawa et al., 2003</xref>), and has long been considered a plausible alternative to ribonucleotide reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Racker, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Racker, 1952</xref>) for dNTP synthesis, with some considering it to be a plausible ancestral route for the origin of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). Our evolution experiments reveal that this pathway is not coopted for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis following loss of ribonucleotide reduction, with cells grown under limiting deoxyribonucleoside levels exhibiting a filamentous morphology indicative of stress. Instead, it appears that the DERA pathway is a liability under conditions of limited deoxyribonucleotide availability; we observe loss-of-function mutations in <italic>deoB</italic>, which are predicted to prevent catabolism of 2-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate. Available genome sequence data from obligate intracellular bacteria that lack ribonucleotide reduction indicate that <italic>deoB</italic> has in fact been lost on multiple occasions, suggesting that recycling of dR is disadvantageous under conditions where this sugar is in limited supply; deletion of <italic>deoB</italic> would enable this sugar to be rerouted for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis but would also preclude de novo synthesis via the reverse DERA reaction. Our results thus illuminate a key adaptive step taken by obligate intracellular and pathogenic species to mitigate the loss of ribonucleotide reduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Creation of an <italic>E. coli</italic> line lacking ribonuclease reduction</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> carries genes for three RNRs: aerobic class Ia (encoded by the <italic>nrdAB</italic> operon), class Ib (<italic>nrdHIEF</italic>), and anaerobic class III (<italic>nrdDG</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

To eliminate ribonucleotide reduction, we sequentially deleted the RNR operons using a scarless deletion protocol (Materials and methods). We first deleted <italic>nrdDG</italic>, as this operon is known not to be expressed under aerobic conditions. We next deleted the <italic>nrdHIEF</italic> operon from the resulting <italic>ΔnrdDG</italic> line. Finally, we attempted to delete the <italic>nrdAB</italic> operon the <italic>ΔnrdHIEF ΔnrdDG</italic> line, grown in the presence of deoxyribonucleosides (dNs). We were initially unsuccessful in deleting <italic>nrdAB</italic>. This is not unexpected as, while dNs are known to be taken up, some (deoxyguanine [dG], deoxycytidine [dC], deoxyadenine [dA]) are unavailable for DNA synthesis, even when genes in the DERA pathway are mutated, preventing their catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlström, 1970</xref>). We reasoned that may be because of the absence of a suitable deoxynucleoside kinase activity for converting those dNs to deoxyribonucleotides. We therefore tried knocking out <italic>nrdAB</italic> in the presence of a heterologously expressed deoxyadenosine kinase (<italic>dAK</italic>) gene from <italic>M. mycoides</italic>.

At high dN concentrations (1 mg/mL), ΔRNR grows favourably, though shows a clear lag compared to wild-type on equivalent media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At lower dN concentrations, ΔRNR growth is impaired, but there is still discernible growth at 0.05 mg/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Of these 59 were present in two lines, 16 in three lines, and 4 in four lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I</xref>).</p><p>One gene, <italic>deoB</italic>, was mutated in eight lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and is particularly noteworthy in the context of our experiment in that it codes for phosphopentomutase. This enzyme catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group between the C1 and C5 carbon atoms of deoxribose and is responsible for the committed step in deoxyribonucleotide salvage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Closer analysis revealed that several of the mutations to <italic>deoB</italic> were identical. It is possible that these mutations have occurred independently, but it may also be possible that these were the result of cross-contamination between lines during the evolution experiment. To assess this, we examined whether the affected lines carried a large number of shared mutations. Lines L1.1 and L1.8 had 47 and 157 unique mutations, with only the deoB mutation shared. For this pattern to be explained by cross-contamination, this mutation would have had to have been the very first mutation to appear, and cross-contamination would have had to have occurred before any other mutation occurred. With no evidence of <italic>deoB</italic> mutation in the progenitor line at transfer 30 (∆RNR250_T30_L1), we consider it unlikely that cross-contamination between these lines has occurred. In the second case, L1.3 (53 SNPs), L1.5 (40 SNPs), and L1.10 (123 SNPs) share a common <italic>deoB</italic> mutation along with 13 other mutations. On these data, it is harder to rule out cross-contamination. Conservatively, it thus appears that <italic>deoB</italic> has independently mutated five or six times under the conditions of our experiment.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Impact of mutations on deoxyribonucleotide synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deoxyribonucleotides in free-living bacteria are primarily synthesised intracellularly via ribonucleotide reduction (RNR), with some uptake of deoxyribonucleosides (dNs) from the environment also possible in principle.

The remaining two mutations are not directly associated with the active site but result in amino acid substitutions not observed in any sequences in our alignment.

Cc</italic>. We were therefore interested in examining if loss of <italic>deoB</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic> genes observed in our experiments extends to these species and the genera to which they belong. Sequences used for blast searches are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1J</xref>. For the three specific species above, blastp searches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1K</xref>) confirmed absence of RNRs and phosphopentomutase (encoded by <italic>deoB</italic>). A hit to cytidine deaminase (encoded by <italic>cdd)</italic> was identified for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. To examine if our results extend to other members of each genus, we repeated our searches for all members of each genus for which there are genome assemblies in the NCBI genome database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/</ext-link>). For <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> (taxid:2129), of 58 genome assemblies, only one, <italic>Candidatus</italic> Ureaplasma intestinipullorum (a MAG from a chicken gut microbiome study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilroy et al., 2021</xref>) returned hits to RNR query sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1L</xref>). No other <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> assemblies revealed evidence of RNR, PPMase, CDD, or YohK coding potential. Thus, with the possible exception of <italic>Candidatus</italic> Ureaplasma intestinipullorum, no members of the genus <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> carry genes for RNR, PPM, or CDD. These results align well with our experimental evolution study, where loss of ribonucleotide reduction resulted in subsequent loss of <italic>deoB</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic> genes.</p><p>The situation in <italic>Borrelia</italic> (taxid:138) is more complex. We screened 77 available genome assemblies, recovering 73 hits to NrdE and 67 to NrdF, indicating that the majority of <italic>Borrelia</italic> genome species code for class Ib RNR. At the time we performed our analysis, we noticed that <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> has been renamed <italic>Boreliella burgdorferi</italic>, following a proposal from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeolu and Gupta, 2014</xref>, to split <italic>Borrelia</italic> into two genera, <italic>Borrelia</italic> and <italic>Borreliella</italic>. While this reclassification is the subject of ongoing debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Margos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta and Bergström, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Margos et al., 2020</xref>), we expanded our search to all members of <italic>Borreliella</italic> (taxid: 64895, 17 species, 607 genome assemblies), and use the taxonomic distinction here so as to enable replication of our analyses. Only one member of the <italic>Borelliella</italic> returned any hits to RNR: <italic>Candidatus</italic> Borreliella tachyglossi appears to have a class Ib RNR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1M</xref>). Given that the placement of <italic>Candidatus</italic> Borreliella tachyglossi is deep but appears unresolved, this may help to pinpoint the timing of RNR Ib loss from the clade/genus <italic>Borelliella</italic>.</p><p>For CDD, our search against <italic>Borrelia</italic> (taxid:138) returned 20 hits, all annotated as cytidine deaminases but these are approximately half the length of the query sequence. This is not unexpected as the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein is known to carry two cytidine deaminase domains and is a homodimer, whereas the shorter (homotetrameric) cytidine deaminase proteins from <italic>Borrelia</italic> are common across bacteria. For the same search against <italic>Borreliella</italic> (taxid:64895), 33 hits were returned, all annotated as cytidine deaminases. For all genome assemblies from both candidate genera, no significant hits to either PPM (<italic>deoB</italic>) or YohK were returned. These data indicate that no members of either <italic>Borrelia</italic> or <italic>Borreliella</italic> carry <italic>deoB</italic>, with only the <italic>Borreliella</italic> apparently lacking ribonucleotide reduction.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>, noted that only one specific strain of <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> (from the cedar aphid <italic>C. cedri</italic>) lacked RNR genes. At the time, this was the smallest <italic>Buchnera</italic> genome, and remains one of the smallest genomes reported for a bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez-Brocal et al., 2006</xref>). A search against <italic>B. aphidicola Str. Cc</italic> (taxid:372461) revealed no coding potential for RNR, PPMase, CDD, and YokH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1K</xref>). We next examined all members of <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> (taxid:9). This revealed widespread presence of RNR Ia (encoded by <italic>nrdA, nrdB</italic>) and PPMase (<italic>deoB</italic>), but no evidence of either CDD or YohK coding potential. Of 74 assemblies, we found 22 strains that lack both ribonucleotide reduction and phosphopentomutase coding, two strains that possess a <italic><underline>deoB</underline></italic> gene but lack genes for ribonucleotide reduction, and two with the opposite pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1N</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While all life is dependent on ribonucleotide reduction for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, a handful of species are known to lack RNR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>) and presumably depend on their host for a source of dNTPs. In this work, we report the successful deletion of all RNR operons from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The resulting line (∆RNR) was sequenced to confirm genomic deletion of RNR genes. Our ∆RNR knockout line grows on MOPS minimal media + 1% glucose supplemented with dNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but does not grow when provided with their constituent components (dR and the four bases A, G, C, T). Growth experiments reveal that, of the four dNs, only dC is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Under limiting levels of dNs, our lines exhibit a filamentous phenotype that can be reversed by increasing dN supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Filamentous phenotypes have been documented under a range of stress conditions, including in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stevenson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yao et al., 2012</xref>). As cell length changes during growth in our experiment, it is not possible to use OD measurements for quantification of either doubling time or cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stevenson et al., 2016</xref>). Our experiments should thus be taken as a qualitative indication of growth. Interestingly, we found that this phenotype reduced over the course of the experiment, suggesting that our lines were adapting to the scarcity of dNs. It will be interesting to determine whether this change is associated specifically with disruption of <italic>deoB</italic>, the effect of which is predicted to make dNs more readily available for DNA synthesis.</p><p>In order to understand how obligate intracellular bacteria adapted to the loss of ribonucleotide reduction, we established an evolution experiment where we serially passaged replicate lines in either 1 mg/mL or 0.25 mg/mL dNs. The resulting lines were sequenced after 30 transfers and one line evolved in 0.25 mg/mL dNs (ΔRNR_250_T30_1) was selected for a second round of evolution at 0.01 mg/mL dNs through a further 10 transfers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Genome sequencing revealed independent mutations to two genes across our replicate lines. One gene, <italic>cdd</italic>, carried mutations in 8/10 lines by transfer 30. The <italic>cdd</italic> locus codes for cytidine deaminase, which converts dC to deoxyuridine, which in turn will be available for dTTP production. Our data reveal two independent mutations (a segmental deletion in seven lines, and an inactivating SNP in the eighth). The segmental deletion eliminated part of the <italic>cdd</italic> ORF and part of ORF of the upstream gene, <italic>yohK</italic>, which, together with <italic>yohJ</italic>, has been shown to code a 3-hydroxypropionate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen-Vo et al., 2020</xref>), and was positionally identical across all seven lines. This deletion likely occurred prior to the establishment of our replicate lines, but appeared not to have gone to fixation. An independent ∆RNR line (∆RNR34) that lacked this deletion rapidly lost <italic>cdd</italic> when passaged in the experimental growth media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). This, together with the independent truncation mutation in ∆RNR_T30_250_L5, which impacts <italic>cdd</italic> but not <italic>yohK</italic>, suggests there is selection against <italic>cdd</italic> but not necessarily <italic>yohK</italic>. Given the fact that our ∆RNR lines can grow with dC as sole dN supplement but do not grow if dC is omitted from the dN mix, it may be that eliminating cytidine deamination prevents loss of this key dN through deamination. We have not assessed growth on dU, but one possibility is that deoxyuridine is less amenable as a substrate for production of all four deoxyribonucleotides. One intriguing observation is that, despite the rapid loss of <italic>cdd</italic>, this loss of function appears not to have occurred across all replicates by transfer 30. This may be a consequence of the length of the evolution experiment. Comparing the genomes of species known to lack genes for ribonucleotide reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundin et al., 2009</xref>) indicates that absence of <italic>cdd</italic> frequently coincides with this state. Our genome analyses show that all confirmed members of the genus <italic>Ureaplasma</italic> lack <italic>nrd</italic> genes and <italic>cdd</italic>, suggesting that loss of <italic>cdd</italic> function is selectively advantageous. Establishing whether loss of one gene drives the loss of the other is not straightforward however. An analysis of strains of <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> revealed that 48/74 strains retain ribonucleotide reduction, but 0/74 possess <italic>cdd</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1N</xref>), indicating that the latter gene can be lost in lines capable of synthesising their own deoxyribonucleotides. The picture is also not clear in <italic>Borrelia</italic>, with <italic>cdd</italic> found in species variously possessing or lacking ribonucleotide reduction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1M</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of <italic>yohK</italic> and <italic>cdd</italic> results in a small, but intact ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). While this seems unlikely to be functional, the creation of an ORF, particularly where the upstream gene codes for a transmembrane protein, may be consistent with the ‘Car Trunk’ hypothesis for the avoidance of mutations that would create a toxic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Omer et al., 2017</xref>). The fact that deletion of these genes is reproducible under defined experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggests that this region might be suitable for testing this hypothesis.</p><p>All lines grown in 0.25 mg/mL dNs showed a marked mutational skew (A:T→G:C) that differs from the G:C→A:T mutational skew expected for <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), and more generally for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hershberg and Petrov, 2010</xref>). Knockout of <italic>cdd</italic> does not appear linked to this skew; 4/5 lines grown at 1 mg/mL dNs do not show an obvious A:T→G:C skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For lines grown at 0.25 mg/mL dNs, two (L2, L3) carry intact <italic>cdd</italic> genes and both genomes show evidence of A:T→G:C mutational skew. Such skew has been previously shown to be associated with defective mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). By transfer 30, we observe only two lines with SNPs in mismatch repair genes, with only one mutation being nonsynonymous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, the skew we observe cannot be explained by widespread mutation to the mismatch repair pathway. The skew may instead be driven in part by the growth dependency on dC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), with the other dNs unable to compensate for lack of dC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) but appearing to provide minor improvements to growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is not currently clear why this should be so. The two major nucleoside transporters in <italic>E. coli</italic>, NupC and NupG, are able to transport dNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patching et al., 2005</xref>), so import does not appear to be a barrier.</p><p>We also observed loss of function of <italic>deoB</italic> in our experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This observation is interesting for several reasons. First, it indicates that loss of ribonucleotide reduction does not lead to compensatory deoxyribonucleotide synthesis via the DERA pathway, which has been speculated to be an ancestral route for dNTP synthesis, predating the advent of ribonucleotide reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). While the enzymes from this pathway can operate biosynthetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horinouchi et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horinouchi et al., 2006b</xref>), loss of phosphopentomutase function via mutation of <italic>deoB</italic> suggests that this pathway is not readily accessible for synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides in vivo, even though there would have been a strong selective advantage to such an alternative synthetic route during our experiment. We note however that both acetaldehyde toxicity (to both DERA and cells more generally) and low intracellular availability may preclude a simple switch to using the DERA pathway for dNTP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poole et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, under the conditions of our experiment, where dN supplementation is reduced by 25-fold, we observe strong selection to dispense with <italic>deoB</italic>. This suggests that not only is the reverse DERA pathway inaccessible for biosynthesis, but salvage is selected against when dNTPs are scarce. In the second phase of our experiment, dN supplementation is dropped from 0.25 mg/mL to 0.01 mg/mL, and it is under these conditions of severe dN restriction that we observe parallel loss-of function mutations at the <italic>deoB</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We conclude that, when deoxyribonucleotides are in short supply, <italic>deoB</italic> loss of function ensures that dNTPs are not lost to glycolysis via salvage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The biochemistry of the DERA pathway supports mutation of <italic>deoB</italic> as the most plausible target, since this step is responsible for interconversion of deoxyribose-5-phosphate and deoxyribose-1-phosphate. The latter is the substrate for phosphorylase-mediated addition of nucleobases, generating dNs, whereas the former is the substrate for DERA-mediated salvage. Thus, <italic>deoB</italic> loss-of-function mutations serve to prevent dR loss to central metabolism while still permitting phosphorylase-mediated dN resynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, while conversion of DERA to a synthetic pathway might be a better long-term solution to loss of ribonucleotide reduction, loss of function of this pathway is advantageous in the short term, precluding its cooption to deoxyribonucleotide synthesis. This interpretation is consistent with a recent experiment where mutation of dihydrofolate reductase led to <italic>deoB</italic> loss of function to prevent loss of deoxyribose-5-phosphate to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodrigues and Shakhnovich, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of species that lack <italic>nrd</italic> genes reveals frequent loss of <italic>deoB</italic>, suggesting that loss of ribonucleotide reduction might drive loss of <italic>deoB</italic>, as observed in our experiments. For members of <italic>Ureaplasma</italic>, the pattern is clear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1L</xref>): all members of this genus completely lack genes for ribonucleotide reduction and show no evidence of coding for either <italic>deoB</italic> or <italic>cdd</italic>, the two most mutated genes in our experiments. For <italic>B.</italic> aphidicola <italic>cdd</italic> appears to have been completely lost from all sequenced strains. Close to half of sequenced <italic>Buchnera</italic> strains show co-occurrence of ribonucleotide reduction and phosphopentomutase genes (48/74 strains), with 30% (22/74 strains) lacking genes for both functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1N</xref>), suggesting that loss of one function frequently results in loss of the other. However, two strains appear to carry <italic>deoB</italic> while lacking <italic>nrd</italic> genes, and two further strains show the opposite pattern. If confirmed, this would indicate loss of one function may not always result in loss of the other.</p><p>We observe a very clear pattern in members of the Borreliaceae<italic>.</italic> The NCBI Taxonomy Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoch et al., 2020</xref>) lists two genera with genome data, <italic>Borrelia</italic> and <italic>Borreliella,</italic> following a recent proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeolu and Gupta, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta and Bergström, 2019</xref>) to split the genus <italic>Borrelia</italic> into two (though this proposal has been contested; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Margos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Margos et al., 2020</xref>). Our analyses indicate that <italic>Borrelia</italic> (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeolu and Gupta, 2014</xref>) code class Ib RNRs but lack <italic>deoB</italic>, while <italic>Borrelliela</italic> lack both <italic>deoB</italic> and RNR genes. This pattern could be taken to indicate that members of the <italic>Borrelia</italic> lost <italic>deoB</italic> but retained ribonucleotide reduction. However, phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong et al., 2006</xref>) and location on linear plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2013</xref>) indicate that the class Ib RNR genes (<italic>nrdEF</italic>) in <italic>Borrelia</italic> has been acquired via horizontal gene transfer, presumably following initial loss of ribonucleotide reduction in the Borreliaceae.</p><p>It is noteworthy that class Ib RNR, carried by members of the <italic>Borrelia</italic>, is manganese-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2010</xref>), whereas class Ia is an iron-dependent enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Torrents, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the most well-studied member of the Borreliaceae, <italic>Borreliella burgdorferi</italic> (sensu Adeolu and Gupta) does not require iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Posey and Gherardini, 2000</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that initial loss of ribonucleotide reduction was driven by selection for iron independence, with subsequent reacquisition of ribonucleotide reduction favouring the manganese-dependent enzyme.</p><p>More generally, the switch to an intracellular existence may result in relaxed selection on ribonucleotide reduction if host-derived deoxyribonucleotides are sufficient to replace endogenous production. This appears to be an infrequent outcome as most intracellular bacteria retain ribonucleotide reduction. This rare event might be driven by additional pressures, as evolution of iron independence in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> suggests. Our experiments indicate that, in the absence of endogenous ribonucleotide reduction, disruption of the DERA pathway via mutations to <italic>deoB</italic> may serve to minimise loss of these building blocks when dNTP availability is limited. Given the necessity of genome replication, we conclude that life without ribonucleotide reduction drives the loss of dNTP catabolism via DERA, enabling building block reuse for DNA synthesis.</p><p>It is interesting to note that loss of ribonucleotide reduction appears extremely rare in the evolution of endosymbiosis and parasitism, despite the seeming ubiquity of host-derived deoxyribonucleotides. Loss of production in favour of acquisition from the host ought perhaps to be a more common outcome. Acquisition from the host would appear straightforward as many bacteria are known to possess mechanisms for uptake of dNs, deoxyribonucleotides, and even DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). With respect to dN uptake, <italic>E. coli</italic> for instance codes for two broad-spectrum nucleoside transporters, NupC and NupG, which have been reported to take up dNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patching et al., 2005</xref>). These broad specificities are noteworthy in the context of our experimental results showing ΔRNR is viable when the media is supplemented with dC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It may be that imported dNs are not readily utilised in DNA synthesis as they must first be converted to deoxyribonucleotides for utilisation in genome synthesis. In our experiments, it was only possible to eliminate ribonucleotide reduction after first introducing a broad-spectrum deoxyadenosine kinase gene from <italic>M. mycoides</italic>, presumably because it improves the opportunity for imported dNs to be coopted for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis instead of being catabolised. Indeed, a recent study shows that dNs, deoxyribonucleotides, and DNA can all be used as a nitrogen source by <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Those authors noted elevated expression of genes involved in catabolism, including <italic>deoD</italic>, which codes nucleoside phosphorylase, part of the DERA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, under conditions where DNA and its monomeric building blocks are important sources of nitrogen and phosphorus, loss of ribonucleotide reduction would presumably have a deleterious impact on growth. This trade-off may explain the small number of instances of loss of ribonucleotide reduction.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether there are conditions wherein the reverse DERA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poole et al., 2014</xref>) can operate synthetically in vivo as an alternative to ribonucleotide reduction, but one possibility is that this may be favoured under conditions where other nitrogen and phosphorous sources are abundant.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>All <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> B strain REL606 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>) was used as the wild-type strain for all experiments. We elected to perform experiments using REL606 as it is well suited for experimental evolution, having been subjected to a long-running evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>). Two key features that make this strain convenient for such work are genomically coded resistance against streptomycin and a selectively neutral mutation in the <italic>araA</italic> gene, making it easy to detect via colony colour when grown on tetrazolium arabinose. This makes it suitable for tracing during competition assays.</p><p>Strains were grown in LB (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, and 0.5% yeast extract ± 2% agar) with the addition of 1 mg/mL each of the four dNs (dG, dA, dC, and dT (AK Scientific)) for mutant strains, unless stated otherwise. For evolution experiments, strains were grown in 1× MOPS media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidhardt et al., 1974</xref>) supplemented with dNs, as specified.

Deletion of RNR operons from the BL-21 <italic>E. coli</italic> line REL606 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) was carried out in series using a scarless genome engineering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fehér, 2008</xref>): the <italic>nrdDG</italic> operon (class III RNR) was deleted first, followed by <italic>nrdHIEF</italic> (class IB) then <italic>nrdAB</italic> (class IA). For each operon, 500 bp upstream and downstream from the start and stop codon was PCR amplified. A second round of overlap PCR combined fragments together and the three resulting product was cloned into pST76a. The resulting construct was transformed into wild-type at 30°C, then with genome integration induced by increasing temperature to 42°C. Helper plasmid (pSTKST) was transformed into the resulting strain, and deletion was induced with chlortetracycline. Successful deletion was confirmed using PCR across the operon (primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>To knock out the <italic>nrdAB</italic> operon, we sought to identify conditions where de novo deoxyribonucleotide synthesis could be replaced by supplementation. We determined that dN supplementation could replace de novo synthesis provided that we first introduced dN kinase (dNKase) activity to make dNs available for dNTP synthesis. We therefore transformed our lines with a pBAD33 construct containing a dNKase gene from <italic>M. mycoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2001</xref>) that had been previously shown to phosphorylate dA, dG, and dC.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Landry as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anders Hofer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise the introductory text about cofactor usage by class I RNRs recommended by reviewer #1. Also, modify the discussion of pathogens as detailed by reviewer #2 and comment on the selection of the starting strain as suggested by reviewer #3.</p><p>2) Make the changes to Figure 9 that are described by reviewer #2.</p><p>3) Comment further on how observation of cell elongation would impact OD measurements (reviewer #1 comment) and address the concerns of reviewer #3 about cell morphology changes and analysis of evolutionary trajectory.</p><p>4) Modify the abstract and introduction to include a statement about the need to introduce a nucleotide kinase gene.</p><p>5) Describe the control experiment to identify selective pressures induced by the antibiotic.</p><p>6) Clarify whether population-level sequencing experiments were performed as detailed by reviewer #3.</p><p>7) Revise Figure 1 to include the entire gel and include more effective annotations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 72-73 – revise terminology referring to &quot;an oxygen-containing metal ion centre&quot; to describe Cys radical generation by class I RNRs. The Cys oxidant cofactor employed by class I enzymes does not contain oxygen. Class I RNR cofactors are assembled from either oxygen or an oxygen-derived oxidant (superoxide). But the important part about the oxygen dependence during assembly is not the incorporation of oxygen per se – it has not been established whether that happens in every case anyway – but the fact that oxygen provides oxidizing equivalents that can convert the precursor form of the cofactor (Mn(II), Fe(II), etc) to an oxidant with sufficient potency to oxidize a Cys side chain. Also, class Ie RNRs do not contain metal in their activated form – so it is also not accurate to say that all class I RNRs use a metal center to accomplish Cys oxidation.</p><p>Line 284 – there are a number of more recent studies that support the idea that class Ib RNR is used under conditions of iron limitation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Line 643 – missing word.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The broad questions are already described in the Public Review section (major findings and possible future experiments). Generally, I think the findings are very interesting but I have a few things that I would like to be corrected.</p><p>I find it a bit misleading that it is mentioned in the manuscript that the few organisms that lack RNR are obligately intracellular and Borrelia burgdorferi is mentioned as one of them. B. burgdorferi is mainly extracellular in the mammalian host, although it has been suggested that it can have intracellular stages. Another extracellular pathogen that lacks RNR is Giardia (several species). This is a protozoan parasite (eukaryote) that is extracellular. I think this organism should be mentioned as well in the manuscript. I am also surprised that it is stated that Mycoplasma is known to be dependent on salvage synthesis for dNTP production (row 300). They actually encode a novel subclass of class I RNRs that was published a few years ago (DOPA radical-dependent RNRs). Remove the sentence or explain this part further. The statement of lacking RNR is valid for Ureaplasma but not Mycoplasma.</p><p>I also think some adjustments need to be made in Figure 9. First of all, I think it would be good to use &quot;ribonucleotides&quot; and &quot;deoxyribonucleotides&quot; instead of NTPs and dNTPs in the top part of the figure showing the RNR reaction. This will both solve the problem that many RNRs use diphosphates as substrates and also that dNKs phosphorylate deoxyribonucleosides to the monophosphate level and not the triphosphate level. Another problem with the figure is that PPase normally means pyrophosphatase and because of that I think it is better to write &quot;nucleoside phosphorylase&quot; or alternatively just &quot;phosphorylase&quot; if the space is limited. A third problem is that it looks like the cells are taking up dNTPs, which is usually not the case, at least not in prokaryotes that do not have endocytosis. The uptake arrow from the outside should instead lead to dNs.</p><p>It should be stated in the abstract and introduction that they needed to introduce an exogenous deoxynucleoside kinase gene to the <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in order to get the system to work (<italic>E. coli</italic> can normally only phosphorylate thymidine). I would also like them to discuss more what is known about the substrate specificity of the kinase and what transporters <italic>E. coli</italic> has for the uptake of the deoxynucleosides.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific questions/comments for the authors:</p><p>– A general question, why did the authors choose REL606 as opposed to other strains? Is this due to evolutionary experiment convenience? If so, please briefly discuss this.</p><p>– Please clarify if a clonal and/or population-level sequence was performed, and how.</p><p>– What is the control experiment (i.e. a strain evolved in parallel) to detect any selective pressures that could be introduced by the strep in the evolution media?</p><p>– What is the significance of the cell morphology analyses for the evolutionary trajectory hypotheses presented in the study? An earlier justification or a better-justified discussion would be helpful here. To my knowledge, REL606 does not particularly exhibit a morphologically distinct response to many environments the bug has been tested/evolved before, or is this not the case? If so, then why is this a key observation attributable to the hypothesis tested here?</p><p>– Is there a correlation between the number of mutations vs. the morphological modifications of the evolved cell?</p><p>– Please clarify what is meant by this sentence (line 414): Note however that elongate cell morphology and clumping preclude use of OD measurements for accurate estimation of doubling time or cell counts (reflected in the large standard error relative to REL606 controls), so can only be used to give a general indication of growth.</p><p>– I'm intrigued by the cross-contamination speculation (and lack thereof) for the T30.L1 line. Did the authors perform population-level sequencing? Shouldn't that reveal whether early contamination took place?</p><p>– As a general comment, the second half of the Results section is rather difficult to follow. Some arguments are emphasized in this part (especially the loss of deoB and cdd genes section) and others can move to Discussion; there is a lot of back/forthing going on in this section, making it harder to grasp the sequence of events. Similarly, some paragraphs emphasize results are in the Discussion section (see, for instance, section starting line 653).</p><p>– Please include what blue/red lines correspond to on Figures 2 and 3 directly, in addition to the legend.</p><p>– Figure 1 should include the entire gel, not a trimmed version. Include an arrow pointing to exactly what we are looking at here.</p><p>– Overall summary figure (indicating the &quot;Sequence&quot; would be a good place to specify what you mean by sequence: and how (clonal, genome, how many replicates, etc.)).</p><p>– Specify what you mean by length (uM) on the figure in addition to the caption. The colors here do not indicate the specific strain on the Figure – is red the WT? Blue evolved WT? Unclear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83845.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise the introductory text about cofactor usage by class I RNRs recommended by reviewer #1. Also, modify the discussion of pathogens as detailed by reviewer #2 and comment on the selection of the starting strain as suggested by reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now reworded the introductory text for accuracy and added references to recent papers reporting on the advances that reviewer #1 notes (ll 72-76). We also added references regarding the recent studies showing a likely role for Ib in replication during iron starvation (ll 295-296). Thanks for alerting us to these.</p><p>Thanks to Reviewer #2 for noting some inaccuracies in our descriptions of the key lineages that do not have RNRs. We have corrected these errors. We had originally omitted the eukaryote cases as our work is focused on bacteria, but agree it is helpful to mention these, so we have now added these in for completeness (ll 81-89).</p><p>We have also corrected the statement regarding the presence of ribonucleotide reductase in <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> (l 312). We now cite the discovery of DOPA radical-dependent RNRs in the introductory text. (ll 73-74)</p><p>Regarding the choice of starting strain, we did indeed choose this because of some of the convenient features of this strain for experimental evolution, including genomically coded antibiotic resistance and presence of a neutral SNP in a gene involved in arabinose utilisation, which makes this lineage suitable for competition experiments. We made use of the former in the project, but not the latter.</p><p>We have now made a statement regarding choice of strain under the methods subsection, ‘Strains and growth conditions’. (ll 125-131)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Make the changes to Figure 9 that are described by reviewer #2.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 9 has been updated for clarity, following advice from Reviewer #2. We have replaced NTPs/dNTPs with ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides, respectively. Thanks for this suggestion. While we and others have used the abbreviation PPase elsewhere, we do appreciate the point, and have altered this to remove any ambiguity. PPase is now replaced with “nucleoside phosphorylase&quot;. The arrow from outside the cell has been corrected to lead to the deoxyribonucleotides label inside the cell, and the cell boundary has been redrawn for clarity. We have also updated the figure legend (ll 834-845).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Comment further on how observation of cell elongation would impact OD measurements (reviewer #1 comment) and address the concerns of reviewer #3 about cell morphology changes and analysis of evolutionary trajectory.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned this in the abstract, but we have now added brief mention of this in the final paragraph of the introduction, where we summarise key findings (ll 109-111).</p><p>For establishing if there is either growth or no growth under various conditions, as we have done, a qualitative assessment such as the one presented in Figure 3 is sufficient. The issue of whether OD is impacted by cell elongation has been documented previously (Stevenson et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38828), and is only a problem if trying to quantify parameters such as doubling time or when trying to estimate cell counts. We do not do either of these, as calculation of both requires an assumption of normal cell morphology in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We have added a note to clarify this in the first paragraph of the Discussion section, as per the suggestion from Reviewer #1. (ll 606-613)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Modify the abstract and introduction to include a statement about the need to introduce a nucleotide kinase gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added statements to this effect in the abstract (ll 38-39) and in the final paragraph of the introduction (ll 94-98).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Describe the control experiment to identify selective pressures induced by the antibiotic.</p></disp-quote><p>Both the control and the experimental lines are resistant to streptomycin. The basis of the resistance is a genomic mutation in the <italic>rpsL</italic> gene which occurred following selection for resistance in the creation of REL606 (see Studier et al. 2009; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.09.021). As streptomycin is included in the growth media of both the control and experimental lines, it should not affect interpretation of results.</p><p>If additional mutations do appear as a result of antibiotic resistance or some other form of media adaptation, they would be expected to appear in both control and experimental lines as both are evolved in the same antibiotic-containing growth media. Our genome sequencing indicated only one gene is mutated in both control and experimental lines. This gene, <italic>kdbD</italic>, encodes a putative histidine kinase. Across the control and experimental lines, we observe a range of mutations, including synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, plus one apparent frameshift in <italic>kdbD</italic>. Mutation of this gene cannot be specifically linked to any selection pressures associated with antibiotic resistance, and we note that this gene is not well studied. However, we plan to revisit this matter in a follow-up paper where we plan to present detailed population-level genomic data (see response to point 6, below).</p><p>Given that antibiotic presence is a constant across all lines, and given that we do not see evidence of specific adaptation to this antibiotic (as the lines are already preadapted to its presence) we do not believe it is necessary to discuss this, so we have not made any changes to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Clarify whether population-level sequencing experiments were performed as detailed by reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in the Methods section (under Sequencing and genome assembly), genome data are derived from single colonies (ll 235-237). We have since performed population-level sequencing which we will present as part of a subsequent study, where we have extended the evolution experiment through to 100 transfers, and examined population dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Revise Figure 1 to include the entire gel and include more effective annotations.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure now edited and figure legend updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 643 – missing word.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Please clarify if a clonal and/or population-level sequence was performed, and how.</p></disp-quote><p>Clonal – see above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the control experiment (i.e. a strain evolved in parallel) to detect any selective pressures that could be introduced by the strep in the evolution media?</p></disp-quote><p>Note that a control experiment is presented, but not for Streptomycin, for reasons noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What is the significance of the cell morphology analyses for the evolutionary trajectory hypotheses presented in the study? An earlier justification or a better-justified discussion would be helpful here. To my knowledge, REL606 does not particularly exhibit a morphologically distinct response to many environments the bug has been tested/evolved before, or is this not the case? If so, then why is this a key observation attributable to the hypothesis tested here?</p></disp-quote><p>See above. The cell morphology is reversible, so it is not significant in evolutionary terms. As now explained in the revised text, this type of morphology has been seen in a range of conditions, and is associated with stress. We show it is specifically a response to the environment (i.e. low [dN]) and is alleviated when cells are grown in higher [dN]. Perhaps what is interesting is that this environmental phenotype appears to be less severe as the experiment proceeds. This might be due to improved capacity to utilise dNs, perhaps via reduction of loss to catabolism following mutation of deoB. We now make this suggestion in the discussion (l l613-617).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there a correlation between the number of mutations vs. the morphological modifications of the evolved cell?</p></disp-quote><p>No. We show that the morphology is environmental, not genetic – our cell lines lose this phenotype when grown in higher [dNs], though note above comment about mutations that might influence the availability of dNs for DNA synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please clarify what is meant by this sentence (line 414): Note however that elongate cell morphology and clumping preclude use of OD measurements for accurate estimation of doubling time or cell counts (reflected in the large standard error relative to REL606 controls), so can only be used to give a general indication of growth.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now discussed, as noted above. We cite a key paper (Stevenson et al.) which explains why these types of cellular morphology/behaviour preclude use of OD measurements for estimating doubling time/cell counts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I'm intrigued by the cross-contamination speculation (and lack thereof) for the T30.L1 line. Did the authors perform population-level sequencing? Shouldn't that reveal whether early contamination took place?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed population sequencing for the present work. However, we are currently undertaking this for a follow-up study which takes our evolution experiment through to 100 transfers. As the reviewer notes, with population data, we should indeed be able to confirm the status of the SNP in deoB in lines 1 and 8, and we look forward to presenting that work in our next article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As a general comment, the second half of the Results section is rather difficult to follow. Some arguments are emphasized in this part (especially the loss of deoB and cdd genes section) and others can move to Discussion; there is a lot of back/forthing going on in this section, making it harder to grasp the sequence of events. Similarly, some paragraphs emphasize results are in the Discussion section (see, for instance, section starting line 653).</p></disp-quote><p>We presume that, by the ‘second half’ of the results, the reviewer is referring to the bioinformatics-based analyses presented. We presented the results of screens for several genes for three genera, and elected to present results by genus, rather than by gene. We believe this is the more logical way to follow for understanding the results in biological context, but it does inevitably result in some back and forth, since we are discussing the same gene sets in several genera.</p><p>Regarding the results from line 653, we felt it useful to reemphasise the key results, but we have now added some further discussion around uptake of deoxyribonucleosides, which we hope puts this in clearer context. This is at ll 680-682 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please include what blue/red lines correspond to on Figures 2 and 3 directly, in addition to the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1 should include the entire gel, not a trimmed version. Include an arrow pointing to exactly what we are looking at here.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Overall summary figure (indicating the &quot;Sequence&quot; would be a good place to specify what you mean by sequence: and how (clonal, genome, how many replicates, etc.)).</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected. The legend to Figure 5 now reads:</p><p>“Five lines of ∆RNR and three lines of wild type progenitor (REL606) were established at one of two conditions (1 mg/mL or 0.25 mg/mL dNs in MOPS+1% glucose), and serially passaged for 30 transfers. Genomic material from each line was then extracted from a single colony and sent for sequencing giving us clonal level genome information. To further investigate adaptation to low concentrations of dNs, the “fittest” ∆RNR line grown at 0.25 mg/mL dNs (∆RNR_250_T30_1) was used to seed a subsequent experiment. Ten replicate lines of ∆RNR_250_T30 _1 were serially passaged for an additional 10 transfers in MOPS+1% glucose and 0.01 mg/ml dNs. DNA from a single colony of each of these 10 lines (∆RNR_10_T40_1-10) was then extracted and sent for whole genome sequencing”.</p><p>We have also indicated this in methods and in the main text, and we have also altered the text in the figure itself to make it clear we sequenced from single colonies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Specify what you mean by length (uM) on the figure in addition to the caption. The colors here do not indicate the specific strain on the Figure – is red the WT? Blue evolved WT? Unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected. Figure 6 has been updated to include the axis label to read “cell length (uM)”. The missing colour indicators in the key have been updated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
