breathing in response to tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. The RTN and greater parafacial region may also function as a chemosensing network composed of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic interactions. In the context of disease, we showed that loss of inhibitory neural activity in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome disinhibited RTN chemoreceptors and destabilized breathing (Kuo et al., 2019). Despite this, contributions of parafacial inhibitory neurons to control of breathing are unknown, and synaptic properties of RTN neurons have not been characterized. Here, we show the parafacial region contains a limited diversity of inhibitory neurons including somatostatin (<italic>Sst</italic>)-, parvalbumin (<italic>Pvalb</italic>)-, and cholecystokinin (<italic>Cck</italic>)-expressing neurons. Of these, Sst-expressing interneurons appear uniquely inhibited by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. We also show RTN chemoreceptors receive inhibitory input that is withdrawn in a CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner, and chemogenetic suppression of <italic>Sst+</italic> parafacial neurons, but not <italic>Pvalb+</italic> or <italic>Cck</italic>+ neurons, increases baseline breathing.

Of particular interest are RTN neurons that function as central respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nattie and Li, 2012</xref>). Chemosensitive RTN neurons express the transcription factor Phox2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>), are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mulkey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weston et al., 2004</xref>), and are intrinsically responsive to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> by mechanisms involving acid inhibition of TWIK-related Acid-Sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channel 2 (TASK-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>) and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). Activity of RTN chemoreceptors is also subject to modulation by purinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mulkey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wenker et al., 2012</xref>) most likely from local astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huckstepp et al., 2010</xref>) as well as excitatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mulkey et al., 2007</xref>) and inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guyenet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moreira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takakura et al., 2007</xref>) synaptic input. In addition, previous work showed using a Phox2b-eGFP reporter line that RTN chemoreceptors have numerous presumptive inhibitory (symmetric) and glutamatergic synapses (asymmetric) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lazarenko et al., 2009</xref>). These results are supported by functional evidence showing in urethane-anesthetized rats that unilateral RTN injection of glutamate receptor blockers (AP5 or CNQX) decreased baseline breathing and the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nattie and Li, 1995</xref>), whereas unilateral RTN injection of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker bicuculline stimulated baseline breathing and blunted CO<sub>2</sub>-stimulated respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nattie et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic drive to the RTN from distal and possibly local sources are required for maintenance of baseline breathing and CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> chemoreception. Furthermore, in the context of disease, suppression of parafacial inhibitory neural activity in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome caused a disordered breathing phenotype, and at the cellular level increased baseline activity and CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dependent firing of RTN chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuo et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest loss of inhibitory neural activity disinhibited RTN chemoreceptors and contributed to breathing problems. Despite this potential significance, contributions of parafacial inhibitory neurons to control of breathing are undetermined and synaptic properties of RTN neurons have not been characterized.</p><p>Based on in vivo multi-electrode array recordings in cats that showed the RTN contains CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-activated and -inhibited neurons that communicate through CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent excitatory and inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that ventral parafacial inhibitory neurons in the region of the RTN sense changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> and regulate baseline breathing by a mechanism involving disinhibition. To address this, we first performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to further characterize molecular signatures of chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify types of inhibitory neurons present in the parafacial region. We confirm the RTN is composed of two subsets of glutamatergic <italic>Phox2b</italic>- and <italic>Nmb</italic>-expressing neurons with similar levels of proton sensing machinery (<italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Kcnk5</italic>) but differ in galanin (<italic>Gal</italic>) expression. We also determined that parafacial inhibitory neurons are predominantly GABAergic and glycinergic and are composed of <italic>Sst</italic>, <italic>Pvalb</italic>, <italic>Ndnf</italic>, and <italic>Cck</italic> subtypes, including an <italic>Sst</italic> subset that is strongly inhibited by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. At the network level, we show that the RTN functions as a CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensing network where excitatory and inhibitory neurons interact in a CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner to augment respiratory drive. Also, at the whole animal level, we show that ventral parafacial inhibitory neurons, and more specifically <italic>Sst</italic>+ inhibitory neurons, regulate respiratory activity under baseline conditions but do not contribute to respiratory output under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. The CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> response profile of <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons, together with their preferential contribution to baseline breathing, suggest these cells are important determinants of resting respiratory drive.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular profiles of glutamatergic and GABA/glycinergic parafacial neurons</title><p>Single cells from the ventral parafacial region were isolated from 10-day-old wild type C57BL/6J (N = 16; 8 of each sex). Note that four male and four female mice included in this cohort received 4OH-tamoxifen (0.2 mg/daily for 3 days). However, since tamoxifen treatment did not affect the proportion of cells obtained or relative transcript profiles across all major cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), these data sets were pooled. Single-cell RNA-seq was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium Controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and 10X v2 chemistry targeting 16,000 barcoded cells. After quality control filtering and doublet removal (see Materials and methods), we analyzed 11,810 cells with a median of 2892 unique transcripts (UMIs) and 1472 genes per cell. We used the 2000 most highly variable genes, measured by dispersion, as input for dimensionality reduction using PCA, BBKNN, and UMAP, and found 20 distinct clusters using Leiden community detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Non-neuronal cells comprised roughly 90% of the dataset, so we employed a two-state mixture model parameterized on four general neuronal markers (<italic>Snap25, Tubb3, Elavl2, Syp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>) to segregate putative neurons from non-neuronal cells. A second mixture model was then used to classify the neurons into three groups: vesicular glutamate-transport type 2 (Vglut2+; <italic>Slc17a6</italic>) glutamatergic excitatory neurons (N = 197), vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat+; <italic>Slc32a1</italic>) inhibitory neurons (N = 445), and cholinergic (<italic>Chat</italic>) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resulting neuronal populations had markedly higher molecular content, with a median of 4587 UMIs and 2317 genes per <italic>Slc17a6</italic>+ neuron and 4439 UMIs and 2299 genes per <italic>Slc32a1</italic>+ neuron.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular signatures of ventral parafacial glutamatergic and inhibitory neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Through a normalized dispersion analysis for dimension reduction, a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was created of ventral parafacial single-cell transcriptome, with cells color coded by cluster.

These results suggest <italic>Sst</italic>-expressing parafacial neurons are important determinants of respiratory activity under baseline conditions. This is important because disruption of baseline breathing is the root cause of disordered breathing in various disease states.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular profile of glutamatergic and GABA/glycinergic ventral parafacial neurons</title><p>Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dubreuil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>), we show that several types of ventral parafacial neurons express <italic>Phox2b</italic> including presumptive cholinergic neurons (<italic>Chat</italic>+), C1 pre-sympathetic neurons (<italic>Th</italic>+) and two subsets that express <italic>Nmb</italic> and similar levels of H<sup>+</sup> sensing machinery (<italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Kcnk5</italic>) but differ in galanin expression. It is not clear whether both <italic>Nmb</italic>+ populations have similar or divergent roles in control of breathing. Based on <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Kcnk5</italic> expression both <italic>Nmb</italic>+ subtypes likely function as chemoreceptors, however, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-activated <italic>Phox2b</italic>+ parafacial neurons also contribute to pre-inspiratory rhythmogenesis early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Onimaru et al., 2008</xref>) so perhaps differential expression of galanin denotes these functional differences. It is also not clear whether expiratory parafacial neurons express <italic>Phox2b</italic> and respond to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> similar to RTN chemoreceptors or comprise a functionally discrete respiratory center. For example, selective activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Souza et al., 2020</xref>) or inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marina et al., 2010</xref>) of ventral parafacial <italic>Phox2b</italic>-expressing neurons increased and decreased expiratory activity, respectively, suggesting expiratory parafacial neurons may be an extension of <italic>Phox2b</italic>-positive RTN chemoreceptors that differentially regulate inspiratory or expiratory activity depending on projection targets. However, others have shown that expiratory parafacial neurons are not Phox2b-immunoreactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Britto and Moraes, 2017</xref>), suggesting these neurons are distinct from RTN chemoreceptors. In any case, since expiratory parafacial neurons are putatively glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silva et al., 2016</xref>), this population is most likely included in clusters 1–3. Of these, cluster 3 is of particular interest because it lacks <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Kcnk5</italic> and so is not likely to function as an RTN chemoreceptor. It is also worth noting that <italic>Slc17a6</italic> clusters 3–4 express high levels of <italic>Stmn4</italic>, an important regulator of neural differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Lee, 2016</xref>), so perhaps these populations diverge at later developmental time points. In any case, we are unable to disentangle putative rhythmogenic or expiratory parafacial neurons from other <italic>Phox2b</italic>+ cell types at this time. Nonetheless, it is also important to recognize that <italic>Phox2b</italic> is expressed by multiple cell types in the parafacial region, thus confounding interpretation of previous work that relied primarily on <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression to target RTN chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We also determined that the ventral parafacial region contains a limited diversity of inhibitory neurons including one <italic>Cck</italic>+ cluster, one <italic>Pvalb</italic>+ cluster, one <italic>Ndnf</italic>+ cluster and three <italic>Sst</italic>+ clusters that differ in terms of calretinin, reelin and <italic>Nos1</italic> expression. Although our cellular experiments suggest Sst+ cells are CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we were not able to identify which Sst+ cluster(s) function as chemoreceptors based on gene expression. We also found the ventral parafacial region did not include <italic>Htra3</italic>-, <italic>Vip</italic>-, or <italic>Npy</italic>-expressing inhibitory neurons. This is in marked contrast to the cortex where <italic>Htra3</italic>+ inhibitory neurons represent ~30% of the total interneuron population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). By defining the diversity if inhibitory neurons in this brainstem region, these results provide a basis for understanding how disruption of inhibitory neural function in diseases like Dravet syndrome cause brainstem disfunction and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Sst</italic>-expressing parafacial neurons are intrinsically inhibited by CO<sub>2</sub></title><p>The RTN is an important respiratory chemoreceptor region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>); therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that any neurons in this region that respond to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> might do so in a manner tailored to support this reflex. Consistent with this, we found that a subset of inhibitory parafacial neurons (37%) are inhibited by 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. This response was retained when purinergic signaling or fast neurotransmission was blocked, suggesting these cells are intrinsically CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive. We also showed that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited parafacial neurons express <italic>Sst</italic> while CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-insensitive cells did not, thus honing the list of inhibitory chemoreceptor candidates to clusters 3, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the majority of inhibitory neurons in this region did not respond to this level of CO<sub>2</sub>, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons are specialized to contribute to RTN chemoreceptors and respiratory drive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The network basis of RTN chemoreception</title><p>Previous evidence based on multi-electrode extracellular recordings from cats suggests that RTN neurons including CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-activated (presumably chemoreceptors) and -inhibited (most likely <italic>Slc32a1</italic>+ based on evidence presented in this study) interact through paucisynaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ott et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, we show that exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> increased the frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic input to RTN neurons while simultaneously decreasing frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic inputs.</p><p>Mechanisms contributing to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced activation of the RTN network likely involves both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms. At the presynaptic level, we consider other chemosensitive RTN neurons or medullary raphe neurons which may co-release glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</xref>) as most the likely sources of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dependent glutamatergic drive to RTN chemoreceptors. Also, since CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> inhibited the activity of some parafacial <italic>Slc32a1</italic>+ neurons, we consider these cells the most likely substrate responsible for CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced suppression of sIPSC frequency. It should be noted that few inhibitory parafacial neurons were activated by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting RTN chemoreceptors do not project to and regulate activity of parafacial inhibitory neurons. The differential effects of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> on EPSC and IPSC frequency also argue against potential non-specific inhibitory effects of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> on voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 2001</xref>) and neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sinning and Hübner, 2013</xref>). However, the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guyenet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takakura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang and Feldman, 2018</xref>) and parafacial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2020</xref>) receive inhibitory input from various elements of the respiratory circuit that serves to limit chemoreceptor function during times of high respiratory activity, and we cannot exclude potential effects of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> on transmitter release from these inputs.</p><p>At the postsynaptic level, our finding that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> minimally affected sEPSC amplitude is consistent with evidence that AMPA receptors are largely unaffected by acidification. Conversely, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent suppression of sIPSC amplitude may involve H<sup>+</sup>-dependent inhibition of GABA or glycine receptors on RTN neurons. For example, depending on the subunit composition, certain recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Dillon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) and glycine α1 and α1β receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) are reversibly inhibited by acidification near the physiological range. It should also be noted that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> may elicit release of non-glutamatergic neuromodulators that alter postsynaptic conductance and potentially contribute to diminished IPSC amplitude; however, we consider this unlikely since this non-specific mechanism is expected to affect both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. Together these results suggest the RTN functions as a CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensing network composed of both faciliatory and disinhibitory interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Parafacial inhibitory neurons contribute to baseline breathing</title><p>The possibility that disinhibition contributes to chemoreception is not novel or unique to the RTN. For example, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited cells have been found in several putative chemosensitive regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Conrad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nichols et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Richerson, 1999</xref>) including GABAergic neurons in the medullary raphe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iceman et al., 2014</xref>) and parafacial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuribayashi et al., 2008</xref>). These results suggest disinhibition contributes to respiratory chemoreception. However, in the absence of evidence that inhibitory neurons in these regions actually influence chemoreceptor function or contribute to respiratory behavior, this possibility has remained largely speculative. We addressed these knowledge gaps by first showing that chemosensitive RTN neurons receive inhibitory synaptic input under control conditions that is withdrawn in a CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also show that chemogenetic suppression of <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons increased minute ventilation (frequency and tidal volume) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, we propose that <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons contribute to the drive to breathe by regulating baseline activity of RTN chemoreceptors. When the activity of <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons is diminished under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, it is perhaps not surprising that further inhibition of this population by chemogenetic means had negligible effect on respiratory output. These results are consistent with pharmacological evidence from anesthetized rats showing that application of bicuculline (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker) to the ventrolateral medulla increased inspiratory activity under control conditions but not during exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gourine and Spyer, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, disinhibition of neurons located more laterally in the ventral parafacial region contributed to emergence of active expiration during exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huckstepp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pagliardini et al., 2011</xref>). Recent work suggests GABAergic neurons in medullary raphe regions regulate expiratory output of the lateral parafacial region during high CO<sub>2</sub> (60); however, the source of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent disinhibition of expiratory parafacial neurons remains unclear. Our evidence that <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons show a CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> response consistent with disinhibition and their close proximity to the lateral parafacial region makes them ideal candidates for such a function. However, potential roles of these neurons in regulation of expiratory activity requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Potential physiological significance</title><p>The ability of respiratory chemoreceptors to sense and respond to tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> is what maintains breathing during sleep. As CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> levels decrease so too does respiratory activity until the apneic threshold is reached and breathing ceases. Therefore, baseline CO<sub>2</sub> levels and the apneic threshold are critical determinants of stable breathing during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakayama et al., 2002</xref>). The ability of ventral parafacial Sst+ neurons to respond to CO<sub>2</sub> in the low physiological range (minimally active under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions) and preferentially regulate baseline breathing suggests these cells are important determinants of baseline CO<sub>2</sub> levels and the apneic threshold. Although we did not observe an apnea phenotype during chemogenetic suppression of parafacial inhibitory neurons, these experiments were performed in awake mice in which arousal-dependent mechanism may help stabilize breathing. Interestingly, a yet unidentified population of <italic>Slc32a1</italic>+ neurons in nearby and potentially overlapping medullary regions are known to regulate rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, where activation of these cells promotes a REM-like state and inhibition of these cells does the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weber et al., 2015</xref>). Considering that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> also stimulates arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guyenet and Bayliss, 2015</xref>), it is possible CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> inhibition of parafacial <italic>Slc32a1</italic>+ neurons suppresses REM and promotes arousal, thus directly coordinating chemoreceptor activity with sleep-wake state. However, these possibilities require further investigation. An additional caveat to note is that in addition to RTN chemoreceptors, <italic>Sst+</italic> parafacial neurons likely regulate respiratory activity at other levels of the respiratory circuit. Therefore, an important future direction of this work will be to identify projection targets of <italic>Sst</italic>+ parafacial neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

procedures were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health and University of Connecticut Animal Care and Use Guidelines. All animals were housed in a 12:12 light dark cycle with normal chow ad libitum if of weaning age. The single-cell RNA-seq experiments used mixed sex wild-type C57BL6/J animals. The <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (JAX # 016962) and TdTomato (Ai14) reporter mice (JAX # 007914) were maintained on 129S1/SvlmJ and C57BL6/J backgrounds, respectively, and only F1 pups were used for electrophysiological experiments.

Coronal brainstem slices (300 μm thick) were prepared and then immediately enzymatically treated at 34°C with protease XVIII (6 mg/mL, Sigma) for 6 min. After enzyme incubation, slices were washed three times in cold dissociation solution and then transferred to an enzyme inhibitor mix containing trypsin inhibitor (10 mg/mL, Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 10 mg/mL, Sigma) in cold sucrose dissociation solution. Next, we isolated the parafacial region which included cells within ~100 µm from the ventral surface and extended ~600 µm medially from the border of the trigeminal nucleus and ~500 µm rostrally from the caudal end of the facial nucleus. Motor neurons, adrenergic C1 cells and raphe neurons were identified based on expression of cell type specific markers and excluded from analysis. These tissue chunks were then warmed to 34°C for 10 min before trituration. A single cell suspension was achieved by trituration using a 25 and 30 gauge needles sequentially, attached to a 2 mL syringe. Samples were triturated for an average of 5 min. Immediately after, the samples were placed back on ice and filtered through a 30-micron filter (Miltenyi Biotech) into sterile microcentrifuge tubes for cell viability assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Cell viability for each sample was assessed on a Countess II automated cell counter (ThermoFisher), and 12,000 cells were loaded for capture onto an individual lane of a Chromium Controller (10X Genomics). Single cell capture, barcoding and library preparation were performed using the 10X Chromium platform according to the manufacturer’s protocol (#CG00052) using version 2 (V2) chemistry. cDNA and libraries were checked for quality on Agilent 4200 Tapestation, quantified by KAPA qPCR. All libraries were sequenced on individual lanes of an Illumina HiSeq4000 targeting 6000 barcoded cells with an average sequencing depth of 50,000 reads per cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>scRNA-seq data processing, quality control, and analysis</title><p>Illumina base call files for both libraries were converted to FASTQs using bcl2fastq v2.18.0.12 (Illumina) and FASTQ files were aligned to the mm10 (GRCh38.84, 10X Genomics mm10 reference 2.1.0) using the version 2.2.0 Cell Ranger count pipeline (10X Genomics), resulting in two gene-by-cell digital count matrices. Source code for FASTQ files is available on GitHub at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ventral-parafacial-neuron-scrnaseq">https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ventral-parafacial-neuron-scrnaseq</ext-link> or through GEO accession GSE153172. Downstream analysis was performed using Scanpy (v1.4.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). Individual libraries were subjected to quality control and filtering independently. Putative doublets were first removed using Scrublet on the raw matrixes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>). Then, for each matrix, cells containing fewer than 800 genes, more than 50 hemoglobin transcripts, or more than 20% mtRNA content were excluded from downstream analyses. Genes present in five or fewer cells, with fewer than 10 total counts were also excluded. For the dataset depicted in this work, we used two lanes of 10X Chromium chip with the following conditions: P10 C57BL6/J pups and 4-OH Tamoxifen treated P10 C57BL6/J pups. We used both of these conditions to create a comprehensive control database to compare Cre dependent and inducible lines with a C57BL6/J background strain. The individual filtered matrices (containing 3345 and 9054 cells, respectively) were concatenated together resulting in an initial aggregated counts matrix of 12,399 cells by 15,923 genes. This aggregated counts matrix was normalized by the total number of counts per cell then multiplied by the median number of counts across all cells, log2 transformed, and lastly scaled to zero mean and unit variance column-wise.</p><p>The 2000 most highly variable genes computed using 'scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes' with `flavor=”cell_ranger’` were selected for the computation of principal components (PCs). Genes related to cell cycle, stress response, the Y-chromosome, hemoglobin as well as ribosomal, mitochondrial, and the gene Xist were excluded from this list of highly variable genes prior to the computation of PCs. Briefly, the list of cell cycle genes was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giotti et al., 2019</xref>, using all annotated genes except those with labels ‘Other’, ‘Function known but’, and ‘Uncharacterized’, whereas the stress response genes were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Flanagan et al., 2019</xref>. The first 25 PCs were computed and were used to create a k = 16 batch-balanced nearest-neighbor graph using BBKNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Polański et al., 2020</xref>) measured by cosine distance. A 2D UMAP embedding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf</ext-link>) was subsequently generated using this graph ('min_dist = 0.5'). Initial clusters were assigned via the Leiden community detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Traag et al., 2019</xref>) at 0.7 resolution on this k-NN graph, resulting in 20 initial clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To further analyze the neuronal populations, all cells were first classified as neuronal or non-neuronal using a simple two-state Gaussian mixture model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>), and neuronal cells were further classified as inhibitory or excitatory using a three-state Gaussian mixture model. Briefly, the median expression of <italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Syp</italic>, <italic>Tubb3</italic>, and <italic>Elavl2</italic> in each cluster was used to fit the first model and classify the clusters as neuronal (high expression) and non-neuronal (low expression). Median expression of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> and <italic>Slc32a1</italic> was then used to classify the neurons as <italic>Slc17a6<sup>high</sup></italic> (excitatory), <italic>Slc32a1<sup>high</sup></italic> (inhibitory), or other. Inhibitory and excitatory neurons were subsequently reanalyzed separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The raw expression matrices of the 210 excitatory and 464 inhibitory neurons were re-normalized, batch corrected, and embedded with UMAP independently as described above, using only 1000 highly variable genes. Clustering with Leiden community detection led to four excitatory and seven inhibitory neuron clusters. In both analyses, a small population of <italic>Slc17a6</italic> high/<italic>Slc32a1</italic> high cells emerged (n = 28); it is unclear whether these cells are doublets, but due to the limited number of such cells, this unique population was discarded from both analyses, resulting in 197 excitatory and 445 inhibitory neurons analyzed. Markers genes for each cluster in each analysis were computed using the Wilcoxon-ranked sum test in a one-versus-rest fashion using the `scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups` function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice (<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::TdT, <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::TdT, <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> infected with virus) were transcardially perfused with 20 mL of room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 20 mL of chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline. The brainstem was then removed from the animal and post-hoc fixed for 24 hr. After, 150 µm slices were made using a Zeiss VT100S vibratome. In the case of live slices from electrophysiology recordings, individual slices were placed in chilled 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 24 hr before processing. Free floating slices were then incubated in a 0.5% Triton-X/PBS solution for 45 min to permeabilize the tissue. The slices remained in a 0.1% Triton-X/10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, ThermoFisher)/PBS solution for a 12 hr primary antibody incubation of selected primary antibody (see <bold>Key Resource Table</bold>). The tissue was then washed three times in 0.1% Triton-X/10% FBS/PBS solution; the secondary antibody was incubated with the tissue after the third wash for 2 hr (see <bold>Key Resource Table</bold>). The tissue was then washed three times in PBS before mounting on precleaned glass slides with Prolong Diamond with DAPI (ThermoFisher). Imaging of brain slices was achieved with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescent in situ hybridization</title><p>To prepare fresh frozen slice, two week old <italic>Slc32a1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>::TdT mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, and brainstem tissues were rapidly frozen with dry ice and embedded with OCT compound. Brainstem slices (14 µm thick) containing the RTN were cryosectioned and collected onto SuperFrost Plus microscope slides. Slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and dehydrated with ethanol. This tissue was processed with the instruction of RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Assay (ACD, 320850); the probes used in our study were designed and validated by ACD. Confocal images were obtained using a Leica Sp8 and confocal image files containing image stacks were loaded into ImageJ (version 2.0.0, NIH, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Acute brainstem slice preparation and in vitro electrophysiology</title><p>Slices containing the RTN were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo et al., 2016</xref>). In short, mice were anesthetized by administration of ketamine (375 mg/kg, I.P.) and xylazine (25 mg/kg; I.P.) and rapidly decapitated; brainstems were removed and transverse brainstem slices (250–300 µm) were cut using a microslicer (DSK 1500E; Dosaka) in ice-cold substituted Ringer solution containing the following (in mM): 260 sucrose, 3 KCl, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, and 1 kynurenic acid.

All recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1322A A/D converter and recorded using pCLAMP 10.0 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>). The firing response of chemosensitive RTN neurons to 10% CO<sub>2</sub> (duration of ~5 min) was assessed at room temperature (~22°C) in the cell-attached voltage-clamp configuration (seal resistance &gt;1 GΩ) with holding potential matched to resting membrane potential (Vhold = −60 mV) and with no current generated by the amplifier (Iamp = 0 pA). Patch electrodes had a resistance of 5–6 MΩ when coated with Sylgard 184 and filled with a pipette solution containing the following (in mM): 120 KCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 4 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 3 Mg‐ATP and 0.3 GTP‐Tris, 0.2% Lucifer yellow (pH 7.30). Firing rate histograms were generated by integrating action potential discharge in 10 to 20 s bins using Spike 5.0 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000903">SCR_000903</ext-link>). In a subset of experiments, we obtained whole-cell access to characterize input resistance over voltages ranging from −20 to −80 mV by injecting current steps (1 s) of varying amplitudes (−100 pA to −20 pA). Also, in the whole cell configuration, we filled cell types of interest with Lucifer Yellow for <italic>post hoc</italic> immunohistochemical identification using cell type specific markers.</p><p>Spontaneous synaptic currents were characterized in the absence of TTX using a Cs-based pipette solution containing the following (in mM): 135 CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.2 TEA-Cl, 5 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP (pH 7.3 using CsOH). To record spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs), cells were held at the reversal potential for AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs; Ihold 0 mV) and confirmed with bath application of GABA and glycine blockers. To record EPSCs, cells were held at −60 mV. Although this voltage is positive to the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential under our experimental conditions, potential contaminating IPSCs could easily be excluded from analysis based on the direction of synaptic currents; inward for EPSCs and outward for IPSCs. We also pharmacologically confirmed EPSCs as glutamatergic at the end of each experiment by bath application of 6-cyano-7- nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were analyzed using the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft) and detected events based on amplitude (minimum 5 pA) and characteristic kinetics (fast rising phase followed by a slow decay). Each automatically detected event was also visually inspected to exclude obvious false responses. All whole-cell recordings had an access resistance (Ra) &lt;20 MOhm, recordings were discarded if Ra varied 10% during an experiment, and capacitance and Ra compensation (70%) were used to minimize voltage errors. A liquid junction potential of −10 mV (KCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) or +11 mV (CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) was corrected off-line.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RTN viral injections</title><p>Adult <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, <italic>Sst</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, <italic>Pvalb</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, and <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (&gt;20 g) were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. The right cheek of the animal was shaved and an incision was made to expose the right marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. The animals were then placed in a stereotaxic frame and a bipolar stimulating electrode was placed directly adjacent to the nerve. Animals were maintained on 1.5% isoflurane for the remainder of the surgery. An incision was made to expose the skull and two 1.5 mm holes were drilled left and right of the posterior fontanelle, caudal of the lambdoidal suture. The facial nerve was stimulated using a bipolar stimulating electrode to evoke antidromic field potentials within the facial motor nucleus. In this way, the facial nucleus on the right side of the animal was mapped in the X, Y, and Z direction using a quartz recording electrode. The viral vector, AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (Addgene #44361, titer 5.3 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC∕mL), was loaded into a 1.2 mm internal diameter borosilicate glass pipette on a Nanoject III system (Drummond Scientific). One 10 µL injection of virus per side was delivered at least −0.02 mm ventral to the Z coordinates of the facial nucleus, to ensure injection into the RTN. These same coordinates were used for the left side of the animal. In all mice, incisions were closed with nylon sutures and surgical cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mice were placed on a heated pad until consciousness was regained. Meloxicam (1.5 mg/kg) was administered 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. Plethysmography was performed 2 weeks after viral injection. The location of all injection sites were later confirmed by post hoc histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Unrestrained whole-body plethysmography</title><p>Respiratory activity was measured using a whole-body plethysmograph system (Data Scientific International; DSI), utilizing a small animal chamber maintained at room temperature and ventilated with room air or carbogen mixtures at a constant flow rate of 1.16 L/min.

Respiratory activity was recorded using Ponemah 5.32 software (DSI) for a period of 20 min in room air immediately after I.P. injection of saline or clozapine followed by exposures to 0, 3, 5, and 7% CO<sub>2</sub> (balance O<sub>2</sub>) (10 min/condition). For the chemogenetic experiments, we sequentially tested saline followed by clozapine on the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> in the same animals on the same day (~2.5 hr between trials). Plethysmography experiments began immediately after injection of either saline or clozapine. Parameters of interests including respiratory frequency (FR, breaths per minute), tidal volume (VT, measured in mL; normalized to body weight and corrected to account for chamber and animal temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure), and minute ventilation (VE, mL/min/g) were measured during a 20 s period of relative quiescence, confirmed with synchronous video monitoring, after 5 min of exposure to each condition. All experiments were performed between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to minimize potential circadian effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are reported as mean ± SE.

called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) is an important respiratory control center that responds vigorously to CO<sub>2</sub> changes, contributes to arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> homeostasis and regulates breathing during sleep. Within the RTN, glutamatergic neurons function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. However, only very limited attention has been devoted so far to investigate the role of inhibitory neurons in RTN function. The present study by Mulkey's lab explores the possible contribution of local inhibitory neurons to the activity and acid-sensitivity of RTN neurons. The authors used multiple technologies (RNAscope, RNA seq, electrophysiology, chemogenetics) in vivo and in vitro to specifically target inhibitory interneurons located at the anatomical site of the RTN. They show that this region contains a limited diversity of inhibitory neurons. Among these, only Sst-expressing inhibitory interneurons appear inhibited by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> and to send inhibitory inputs on the RTN chemosensitive neurons. By doing so these neurons finely tune resting respiratory drive according to CO<sub>2</sub> changes in low physiological ranges. These new findings establish parafacial SST-expressing inhibitory neurons as important regulators of baseline breathing and contributor of RTN chemoception. Furthermore, this paper brings valuable mechanistic insights into how loss of inhibition within the RTN might disrupt breathing in pathological conditions such as in the Dravet syndrome.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ventral parafacial inhibitory neurons regulate baseline breathing by a mechanism involving disinhibition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Clément Menuet (Reviewer #1); Natasha N Kumar (Reviewer #2); Patrice Guyenet (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>More specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the three reviewers have carefully examined your manuscript and while they found a great interest for your results they also pointed out on several important aspects of the paper that require modifications. Their reviews are detailed below but I would like to emphasize on two major concerns that must be adequately addressed before suitability for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> could be considered:</p><p>First, they all noted a lack of precision in the description of the different methods used, in the size of the samples analyzed and illustrated in the figures, the parameters measured, etc… In addition, the experimental conditions in some cases are not always clear. More importantly, the authors must provide evidences for the specificity and selectivity of the transgenic lines used and the Dreadd and TdTomato expression and viral injections. In general, the methods need to be more precise and better explained throughout the text.</p><p>Second, the transcriptomic part, as it stands, does not really add much to the physiological question and remains a little apart from the rest of the study. For instance, it does not help in the identification of the neuronal cluster involved in the acid sensitivity of the RTN, and potential specific genes that could be indicative of a specific population of inhibitory neurons playing a role here are not used in the subsequent experiments presented after. Thus, either you put less emphasis in this part of the results (and even consider presenting these data at the end of the result section) or you provide a deeper analysis and a better link with the other presented data that would definitively bring a level of specificity and understanding that would greatly enhance the quality of the work and the interest of providing such genetic findings.</p><p>Note that acceptability will have to be reassessed upon submission of the revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The proposed study is a Research Advance paper aimed at investigating the role of inhibitory parafacial neurons in the control of breathing. The authors first performed single cell RNA sequencing of the RTN/parafacial region to identify clusters of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Then they showed using whole-cell recordings in slices that about 25% of recorded inhibitory parafacial neurons are tonically active and inhibited by hypercapnia, and that chemosensitive RTN neurons receive tonic inhibitory inputs that are decreased by hypercapnia, and excitatory inputs that are increased by hypercapnia. Chemogenetic inhibition of inhibitory parafacial neurons increased normocapnic/normoxic and normocapnic/hyperoxic breathing but not hypercapnic breathing in mice in vivo.</p><p>To my knowledge, this is the first study investigating the specific role of inhibitory parafacial neurons in the control of breathing activity. The main finding, that inhibitory parafacial neurons enable fine tuning of resting respiratory drive according to variations of CO2 in the low physiological range, is very interesting to the field, and potentially to a broader audience. The study is well-designed, using state-of-the-art techniques, and the paper is well written.</p><p>1. The Results section starts with single cell RNA sequencing data of RTN/parafacial neurons, identifying clusters of glutamatergic and GABA/glycinergic neurons. In itself, this is very valuable data, which could justify a stand-alone paper with further analysis. However, starting the Results section with these data is a bit awkward, as they are poorly linked to the rest of the study. Indeed, the authors provide new subclasses of inhibitory neurons, but then focus the rest of the study on overall inhibitory neurons without attempting to link their functional results with the subclasses of neurons molecularly identified. The transition line 164, to show that TdT is expressed in overall inhibitory neurons, without using tools for further specificity as one would expect after reading the previous paragraph on scRNAseq, is somewhat frustrating.</p><p>The paragraph starting line 172 shows that a subset of parafacial inhibitory neurons are CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive, and finishes with a statement (lines 188-190) that the identity of this subset of neurons remains to be determined. Testing whether this subset corresponds to a specific cluster of inhibitory neurons identified in the scRNAseq data presented just before would seem the obvious next step for the present study. The authors could have done immunohistochemistry on the neurons patched, as several of the clusters identified have markers for which antibodies exist, or better (but harder) they could have aspirated the patched cytoplasm and performed qPCR to reach the same results. Such data would not only provide a natural link between the first two experimental sets performed, but also provide more detailed information on the inhibitory parafacial neurons that are CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive that would significantly enhance the impact of this study.</p><p>With these comments in mind, if no further experiment is done for this paper, it might be better to move the scRNAseq data to the end of the Results section, to open the work towards more specificity in future studies. On that line, the end of the sentence lines 168-170, which closes the scRNAseq data presentation, is more suited for the end of the Results section, rather than the beginning.</p><p>2. In a previous article by the same group (Kuo FS et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2019, DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.43387), mice expressing a Dravet syndrome-associated Scn1a missense mutation conditionally in inhibitory neurons presented breathing alterations including diminished chemosensitivity, with hypo-excitable inhibitory neurons and hyper-excitable excitatory neurons in the RTN. The present study is proposed as Research Advance of this previous article. To strengthen the continuity with the previous study, the authors could have analysed the expression of Snc1a in their scRNAseq data, to identify whether Scn1a is expressed in a cluster of inhibitory neurons, and link it with the cluster that is responsive to CO2/H<sup>+</sup>. This way, the link would be more evident, and the present study would really make use of the scRNAseq data. In the current state of this study, I somewhat fail to see its strong and direct continuity with the previous work justifying a Research Advance format, it would maybe be better suited as a traditional stand-alone Research Article.</p><p>3. Was synaptic isolation performed when testing the CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of parafacial inhibitory neurons? Did you also block the usual gliotransmitters? The methods section is not clear, please provide more details, as whether these neurons are intrinsically sensitive to CO2/H<sup>+</sup> or not is critical for interpretation of these data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General assessment: Previous work from the Dan Mulkey group demonstrated that mice expressing a Scn1a mutation exhibit a Dravet syndrome associated phenotype, wherein inhibitory neurons of the RTN were less excitable, whereas glutamatergic chemosensitive neurons were hyperexcitable. In this manuscript, Cleary and colleagues used multiple technologies (RNAscope, RNA seq, electrophysiology, chemogenetics) to target inhibitory interneurons located at the anatomical site of the retrotrapezoid nucleus, which harbours glutamatergic respiratory chemosensory neurons. It is now established that inputs from other chemoreceptor neurons as well as astrocytes-derived paracrine signals, contributes to RTN chemoreceptor drive. Here they show that RTN neurons receive tonic inhibitory inputs from non-chemosensing VGAT neurons in the parafacial region. The authors provide careful control conditions. The manuscript figures are presented well experimental procedures and results are sound and support the conclusions. This work warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in principle, the results are novel both technically and from a biological perspective, upon the condition that the authors adequately address the reviewers questions.</p><p>1. In the first paragraph of the discussion, the authors conclude that inhibitory inputs to chemosensing RTN neurons are withdrawn/inhibited during exposure to high CO2. The net result is a lessening of GABA restraint on chemosensing neurons and an increase in their neural drive and neurotransmitter release. Another valid interpretation could be that increased neurotransmission from other tonic inputs to the RTN (arising from chemoreceptors activated during high CO2 exposures) contributes to the ventilatory response? Ie the VGAT inhibitory input isn't withdrawn but rather contributes much less to RTN drive during exposure to high CO2. Please include this interpretation, and other alternatives in the discussion.</p><p>2. DREADD-mediated inhibition of inhibitory RTN neurons increased baseline minute ventilation but had no effect on ventilatory responses to CO2. Figure 6D-E – most columns do not include data from n=11 mice. Please explain why certain mice/replicates were excluded from the dataset. Figure 6 figure legend is incomplete – there is no description of the data shown for control Vgatcre (Figure 6F-H). Also, there are two Figure 6F.</p><p>3. CO2/H<sup>+</sup> synaptic properties of RTN neurons studies (page 8, line 193):</p><p>&quot;As previously defined (26), RTN neurons were considered chemosensitive if they show some level of spontaneous activity under control conditions and a robust firing rate response to 10% CO2 (1.6 {plus minus} 0.36 Hz; N=10).&quot; – 10% CO2 FR response of 1.6 {plus minus} 0.36 Hz does not seem 'robust' when compared to other previous studies. For example, Wang S et al. 2013 Figure 2D (citation #64), demonstrates FR at pH 7 (~8% CO2) to be &gt;4 Hz for both TypeI and TypeII dissociated RTN neurons. Wouldn't you expect FR to be &gt;&gt;4Hz in 10% CO2, for RTN neurons in an intact brain slice?</p><p>4. Figure 2 and Figure 2 legend:</p><p>Figure 2B – error bars appear to be missing for this n=4 quantified data.</p><p>Figure 2Aii is an enlarged version of the image at bregma -6.05mm. You could omit this, I don't think it adds anything to the paper. Alternatively, magnify further, use arrows to draw attention to cells of interest.</p><p>Figure 2 legend: include abbreviations (7N, b)</p><p>5. Figure 3C legend: It is not clear what the summary data corresponds to. Indicate this in the figure legend as follows: ' firing responses of CO2/H<sup>+</sup> -inhibited (n=20, blue), -insensitive (n=53, grey) and -activated (n=7, red). What parameters do the authors use, to define inhibited versus activated neurons?</p><p>6. Figure 5 – please confirm that there are no outliers in these values. One replicate seems to have a much higher baseline sEPSC frequency than the others.</p><p>7. Supplementary Figure 1 figure legend states that the colors of distributions correspond to classes shown in Figure 1A however Figure 1A displays only 3 colours, whereas Supp Figure 1D displays 5 colours/classes. Please clarify.</p><p>8. Authors used RNA seq to identify differentially expressed and coregulated genes in RTN neurons in order to infer biological meaning for further studies on this preeminent central chemoreceptor population. Single cell isolation method and RNA-seq methodology was extremely detailed, valuable information regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. The authors use tSNE to investigate segmentation, clustering of genes in the pFRG transcriptome. The data are convincing, since it is well established using other methods, that ~50% of glutamatergic RTN neurons express galanin. Could the authors clarify how they minimised batch effect, which can occur during the experiment, the RNA library preparation, or the sequencing run?</p><p>There are 20 global clusters (from 2000 genes) – the distribution of cells/cluster and genes/cluster is illustrated in Supp Figure 1C. The basis for the clustering was not clear – could the authors clarify this and make it clear in the text. It appears (from Supp Figure 1 B) that each cluster is defined by related genes that display a high level of expression within the cluster.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>RTN is a small cluster of lower brainstem neurons with a well-described molecular signature. These neurons respond vigorously to CO2 in vivo, contribute to arterial PCO2 homeostasis and maintain breathing automaticity during sleep. Their synaptic inputs are not well identified however and the way in which they encode brain PCO2 in vivo is complex and much debated. Several mechanisms have been proposed (intrinsic pH sensitivity of RTN neurons, astrocyte-mediated paracrine effect of acid, paradoxical acid-mediated contraction of microvessels and synaptic inputs from acid-activated neurons, e.g. serotonergic). The present study explores the possible contribution of local inhibitory neurons to the activity and acid-sensitivity of RTN neurons. Consistent with prior EM evidence, the results show that RTN neurons receive GABA/glycinergic inputs. The contribution of a subset of this input to the CO2 response of RTN neurons is suggested by the results of experiments in slices but the existence of this mechanism is not convincingly supported by the in vivo experiments.</p><p>The authors confirm the transcriptome of RTN neurons and describe that of several subsets of inhibitory neurons (likely GABA- and glycine-ergic) that reside in their vicinity. This work greatly extends existing observations regarding these local inhibitory neurons. Unfortunately this work did not help identify the particular inhibitory interneurons postulated to be CO2-responsive.</p><p>Next, the authors show that a subset of these inhibitory neurons are mildly inhibited by acidification in slices. The effects are small and variable from cell to cell but suggest that CO2-triggered disinhibition could perhaps contribute to the overall excitatory effect of CO2 on RTN neurons.</p><p>This hypothesis is then tested, by determining whether chemogenetic inhibition of these inhibitory interneurons enhances breathing and the respiratory chemoreflex in conscious mice. The authors show is that inhibition of the GABA/glycine interneurons (via a Gi-coupled DREAAD) in unanesthetized mice elevates breathing slightly at rest but seems to have no effect on the breathing stimulation elicited by CO2. The increase in resting breathing is consistent with prior evidence that breathing is increased when a GABA-receptor antagonist is microinjected into the region containing the RTN neurons (Nattie et al) but this fact does not demonstrate that the increase in breathing is caused by activation of RTN neurons. As the authors acknowledge in the discussion the increase in breathing produced by inhibiting GABA interneurons in this brain region could also result from arousal. The increase in breathing could also result from the disinhibition of neurons other than RTN, for example the C1 neurons.</p><p>Finally, the main interpretative difficulty is that inhibition of the GABA/glycine interneurons does not change the respiratory chemoreflex; this is difficult to reconcile with the results obtained in slices and makes one wonder whether the acid inhibition of the GABA interneurons observed in slices is an artifact or at least whether it is a phenomenon that has any relevance to the CO2 response of RTN neurons in vivo.</p><p>1. Re: results line 177. Although the authors are probably correct, they need to validate the assumption that their reporter line (Vgatcre::TdT) does indeed &quot;allow for selective targeting of inhibitory neurons in the region of interest&quot;. If this has been demonstrated before please give the specific quote. If not, the authors must demonstrate that the vast majority of the tomato-red positive neurons in their region of interest express VGat (transcript or protein) at the relevant postnatal age.</p><p>2. Re: lines 240-241. &quot;Specifically, we bilaterally injected AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (10 nL/side, Addgene) into the medial portion of the RTN in VGAT-cre mice&quot;. The authors need to also demonstrate here that VGat+-neurons were selectively transduced (i.e. that mCherry and VGat were colocalized). The selectivity of this type of approach is typically overrated (ectopic expression of Cre and Cre-independent effects of the DIO viral prep) and must be verified.</p><p>3. Re: results lines 177-183. The defining criteria for pH sensitivity is fine but the results are less than impressive: 20% of neurons were inhibited to some degree (-20% or more) when exposed to a fairly severe acidification (pH 7.0), 66% were unaffected and 9 % were judged to be excited. Figure 3C should be replaced with a distribution histogram summarizing the % response of all the VGAt neurons sampled (e.g. 10% effect binning). Small positive or negative effects of acidification on unit-activity in slices have frequently been reported in other brainstem areas such as the nucleus of the solitary tract. Cherry-picking neurons that are excited and those that are inhibited is not terribly convincing unless this grouping correlates with an identifiable biochemical or structural marker, which was not the case here.</p><p>4. Re: lines 248-249 and discussion. The increase breathing could have many causes and may not have nothing to do with CO2 chemoreception. For example, selective activation of the rostral C1 neurons produces a very strong increase in breathing in unanesthetized mice and these neurons are tonically inhibited by GABA-ergic input (the basis of the baroreflex). The increased breathing noted at baseline (no CO2 added) could also denote arousal from sleep, an effect produced by activation of the C1 neurons, the RTN itself and perhaps other neurons in the area.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Somatostatin-expressing parafacial neurons regulate baseline breathing&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Some of the SSt-expressing neurons were inhibited by hypercapnia/acidosis and chemogenetic inhibition of SSt neurons, including the SSt neurons insensitive and activated by hypercapnia/acidosis, increases the baseline breathing. Besides, the RTN neurons receive inhibitory synaptic transmission at low frequency, which was reduced in response to hypercapnia/acidosis. Therefore, the authors conclude that the ventral medullary SSt neurons contribute to RTN chemoreception and respiratory activity. The topic of this manuscript is original, relevant, and worth studying. Several omissions cloud the interpretation, and I have several concerns that preclude the straightforward interpretation of the data, which have not been adequately considered in the manuscript. The main issue is in the interpretation, or overinterpretation, of the data.</p><p>1. It would be essential to define the hypothesis of the present study clearly. The authors &quot;considered&quot; the possibility that ventral medullary neurons in the region of the RTN sense changes in CO2/H<sup>+</sup> and regulate RTN chemoreception by a mechanism involving disinhibition. However, the authors provided evidence for the ventral medullary inhibitory neurons' involvement in neither the RTN chemoreception nor RTN disinhibition. The authors then propose a novel mode of chemotransduction involving regulation of basal breathing by CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent disinhibition. In fact, the experiments involving the chemogenetic inhibition of SSt neurons did not demonstrate that the RTN neuronal function was affected. The neurons in the ventral medullary region close to RTN project to the pre-Bötzinger Complex (PMID: 26855425), and these projections could be involved in the increases of baseline breathing following SSt neurons chemogenetic inhibition.</p><p>2. There are no clear functional connections between some of the results described. The authors described the presence of a diversity of inhibitory neurons in the ventral medullary region and that the inhibition of SSt neurons increased the baseline breathing without affecting the ventilatory responses to hypercapnia/acidosis. On the other hand, there are data showing that RTN neurons receive synaptic inhibition, which was reduced in response to hypercapnia/acidosis. Therefore, the authors need to demonstrate that: i) the three different populations (activated, insensitive, and inhibited) of SSt neurons are projecting to RTN chemosensitive neurons, and: ii) the chemogenetic inhibition of SSt neurons increases the RTN neurons firing frequency by reducing the inhibitory synaptic transmission. The SSt neurons recorded in vitro were labeled, and the projections to the RTN neurons can be revealed in the same slice. Besides, the effects of SSt neurons inhibition (chemogenetics) on the RTN firing frequency and inhibitory synaptic transmission can also be analyzed in in vitro experiments using the transfected animals. It is important to note that without new experiments to prove the role of the inhibitory ventral medullary SSt neurons in the RTN chemosensitivity, the authors should consider presenting the data in two (I – somatostatin-expressing RTN neurons regulate baseline breathing; II – the effects of hypercapnia/acidosis on the synaptic transmission to RTN neurons) different manuscripts.</p><p>3. The authors demonstrated that the inhibitory neurons are located close to the RTN chemoreceptors. In fact, it is possible to observe in the provided images that the Tdt cells of Slc32a1 animals are in the RTN. The anatomical nomenclature is highly confusing in the manuscript. There is no evidence that the described inhibitory neurons are outside of the RTN. Parafacial or even pFRG terminologies only add to the confusion regarding the cell types present in this region of the brain and their role. Therefore, the authors studied the inhibitory neurons of the RTN of mice.</p><p>4. Is the CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of RTN neurons different before and after the inhibitory synaptic transmission blockade? In other words, what is the contribution of the synaptic disinhibition to the RTN neuronal firing response to hypercapnia/acidosis? The RTN neurons receive inhibitory synaptic inputs with very low frequency (0.2 Hz) and amplitude (12 pA), and hypercapnia/acidosis reduces it by nearly half. Therefore, in which extension such rare and small events contribute to the increases in RTN neurons firing frequency and breathing after SSt neurons chemogenetic inhibition?</p><p>5. The authors should provide the number and the rostro-caudal distributions of transfected SSt, CCK and Pvalb neurons, not only the &quot;center&quot; of bilateral virus injections or percentage of neurons, in the chemogenetic experiments. It is an important issue to report considering data reproducibility by other groups, and the extension of the transfected cells in the ventral medulla can provide evidence for different clusters of inhibitory neurons in mice controlling different functions.</p><p>6. What about the anatomical distribution of insensitive, activated, and inhibited SSt neurons in the RTN? The authors could provide this information in Figure 2. Are the capacitance values different between these neurons? In this regard, the neurons seem bigger (~100 µm) than other neurons described in the RTN based on the scales provided in Figure 2, panels Aii and Bii. Are the scales right?</p><p>7. Please remove the word &quot;tonic&quot; during the description/discussion of RTN neurons' synaptic inhibition. The authors did not evaluate whether or not the inhibitory synaptic events are tonic because there are no respiratory oscillations in the applied in vitro preparation.</p><p>8. Is the scale for measured current of the Figure 4 panel A right? The grouped data in panel B show that the amplitude of sEPSCs is -10 pA, but the representative traces show that it is the level of the electrical noise. Besides, the VC traces in Figure 3 panel A are not representing the grouped data of sIPSCs amplitude in panel B. The events are ~ 50 pA, while the grouped data are ~12.5 pA.</p><p>9. Please check the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential; it is unlikely to be – 60 mV using the described intracellular and extracellular solutions.</p><p>10. – Discussion section, line 330: Expiratory neurons in the lateral parafacial region do not express Phox2b in rats (PMID: 28004411). Besides, what evidence shows that the expiratory neurons in the lateral parafacial region are not sensitive to hypercapnia/acidosis?</p><p>11. Discussion section, line 413: There is no evidence that disinhibition of Phox2b neurons in the lateral parafacial region evokes forced expiration in rats. In fact, previous studies (references: 19 and 53 and PMID: 28004411) demonstrated that bilateral disinhibition of neurons of the lateral parafacial region, which are located more laterally to the Phox2b positive RTN neurons, induces forced expiration in rats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5:</italic></p><p>The most important finding of this study is that Sst-expressing neurons in the parafacial region are involved in regulation of baseline respiratory activity via inhibitory effects on the RTN chemoreception. Authors provided evidences that supported this hypothesis.</p><p>This manuscript is revised version that has been reviewed by three referees. Authors' responses to comments seemed to be adequate.</p><p>First, they showed that the parafacial region contained a limited diversity of inhibitory neurons including somatostatin (Sst)-, parvalbumin (Pvalb)- and cholecystokinin (Cck)-expressing neurons. They showed that a subset of inhibitory parafacial neurons were inhibited by 10% CO2 and the response was retained when purinergic signaling and fast neurotransmission was blocked, suggesting these cells were intrinsically CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive. Next, they showed that CO2/H<sup>+</sup> -inhibited cells were Sst-immunoreactive and were not immunoreactive for Pvalb or Cck, whereas CO2/H<sup>+</sup> -insensitive cells did not express Sst. They also showed that sIPSCs in the RTN chemoreceptor neurons were depressed by 10% CO2. These results suggest that Sst-expressing neurons of inhibitory parafacial neurons were inhibited by CO2/H<sup>+</sup> and then contributed to hypercapnic response of the RTN chemoreceptor. This hypothesis was further supported by results from in vivo experiment in which chemogenetic suppression of Sst+ parafacial neurons increases baseline breathing.</p><p>Although I have no major concern about this paper, please see below for my comments.</p><p>1. Page 9, line 212-214, &quot;We found that 5 of 5 CO2/H<sup>+</sup> -inhibited cells were Sst-immunoreactive (Figure 2Aii) and were not immunoreactive for Pvalb or Cck (data not shown), whereas 0 of 5 CO2/H<sup>+</sup> -insensitive cells expressed Sst (Figure 2Bii).&quot;: This part is most important parts because it was the results indicating that Sst neurons were indeed inhibited by hypercapnic stimulation. Before this part, they showed 48 of 130 (37%) cells that were thought to be inhibitory neurons were inhibited hypercapnic stimulation (page 8). To further clarify properties of these cells, authors investigated 5 cells with combination of whole-cell recordings and immunoreactive examination and showed that cells that were inhibited by hypercapnic stimulation were Sst-immunoreactive. However, this result did not simply mean that all of above 37% neurons were Sst-immunoreactive. Although in vivo experiments supported the idea, is this number (n=5) really enough for the verification? In addition, I suppose that examination for Pvalb or Cck immunoreactivity was performed in cells different from the Sst examination group. Please describe the number of cells tested for Pvalb and Cck. Relating this issue, it would be important to show an example of detailed distribution of Sst (and maybe Pvalb and Cck) immunoreactive cells in the parafacial region together with Phox2b-expressing cells.</p><p>2. Page 8, the response to 10% CO2 was retained when purinergic signaling and fast neurotransmission was blocked: I suppose that these experiments were performed separately but not in the presence of purinergic signaling blockers plus fast neurotransmission blockers.

Their reviews are detailed below but I would like to emphasize on two major concerns that must be adequately addressed before suitability for publication in eLife could be considered:</p><p>First, they all noted a lack of precision in the description of the different methods used, in the size of the samples analyzed and illustrated in the figures, the parameters measured, etc… In addition, the experimental conditions in some cases are not always clear. More importantly, the authors must provide evidences for the specificity and selectivity of the transgenic lines used and the Dreadd and TdTomato expression and viral injections. In general, the methods need to be more precise and better explained throughout the text.</p><p>Second, the transcriptomic part, as it stands, does not really add much to the physiological question and remains a little apart from the rest of the study. For instance, it does not help in the identification of the neuronal cluster involved in the acid sensitivity of the RTN, and potential specific genes that could be indicative of a specific population of inhibitory neurons playing a role here are not used in the subsequent experiments presented after. Thus, either you put less emphasis in this part of the results (and even consider presenting these data at the end of the result section) or you provide a deeper analysis and a better link with the other presented data that would definitively bring a level of specificity and understanding that would greatly enhance the quality of the work and the interest of providing such genetic findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for their time and thoughtful suggestions. To address the first concerns, we have significantly updated our descriptions and explanations in the results and methods sections. We have also confirmed specificity and selectivity of materials used and those new results are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>To address the second concerns, we performed two additional sets of experiments to identify CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive inhibitory neurons in vitro and their contribution to respiratory activity in vivo. The details of these new experiments are described below but in short we show that i) CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited Vgat+ neurons express Sst (new Figure 2A-B), ii) and chemogenetic inhibition of Sst expressing parafacial neurons, but not Pvalb+ or CcK<sup>+</sup> populations, modulated baseline breathing in a manner consistent with a role of these cells in regulating baseline respiratory activity (new Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These new results clearly link our transcriptomic analysis of subpopulations of Vgat+ parafacial neurons to cellular CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity and respiratory behavior.</p><p>In short, we believe that we have address all noted concerns and hope that the editor and reviewers agree the manuscript is ready for publication. Please seen point-by-point responses below for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note that acceptability will have to be reassessed upon submission of the revised version.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. The Results section starts with single cell RNA sequencing data of RTN/parafacial neurons, identifying clusters of glutamatergic and GABA/glycinergic neurons. In itself, this is very valuable data, which could justify a stand-alone paper with further analysis. However, starting the Results section with these data is a bit awkward, as they are poorly linked to the rest of the study. Indeed, the authors provide new subclasses of inhibitory neurons, but then focus the rest of the study on overall inhibitory neurons without attempting to link their functional results with the subclasses of neurons molecularly identified. The transition line 164, to show that TdT is expressed in overall inhibitory neurons, without using tools for further specificity as one would expect after reading the previous paragraph on scRNAseq, is somewhat frustrating.</p><p>The paragraph starting line 172 shows that a subset of parafacial inhibitory neurons are CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive, and finishes with a statement (lines 188-190) that the identity of this subset of neurons remains to be determined. Testing whether this subset corresponds to a specific cluster of inhibitory neurons identified in the scRNAseq data presented just before would seem the obvious next step for the present study. The authors could have done immunohistochemistry on the neurons patched, as several of the clusters identified have markers for which antibodies exist, or better (but harder) they could have aspirated the patched cytoplasm and performed qPCR to reach the same results. Such data would not only provide a natural link between the first two experimental sets performed, but also provide more detailed information on the inhibitory parafacial neurons that are CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive that would significantly enhance the impact of this study.</p><p>With these comments in mind, if no further experiment is done for this paper, it might be better to move the scRNAseq data to the end of the Results section, to open the work towards more specificity in future studies. On that line, the end of the sentence lines 168-170, which closes the scRNAseq data presentation, is more suited for the end of the Results section, rather than the beginning.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have invested considerable time and effort into addressing this shortcoming. To identify CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive Vgat+ neurons, we used slice-patch electrophysiology to characterize Vgat+ parafacial neurons as CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited or -insensitive based on their firing response to 10% CO2. Once the cell type of interest was identified, we gained whole cell access to fill the cell with lucifer yellow (included in the pipette solution) followed by cell type specific immunolabeling. We found that 5 of 5 CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited neurons were Sst+, whereas 0 of 5 CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-insensitive neurons were Sst+. These new results (illustrated as new Figures 2Aii, Bii) suggest that Sst+ inhibitory neurons are CO2/H<sup>+</sup> inhibited.</p><p>Next, we used chemogenetics to systematically suppress the activity of each main inhibitory neural population in the parafacial region. Specifically, we made bilateral injections of AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry into the medial parafacial region of Sst-Cre (JAX #: 013044), Pval-Cre (JAX #: 008069) or Cck-Cre (JAX #: 012706) mice. After two weeks recovery, we found that systemic administration of clozapine increased baseline breathing (room air and 100% O2) in Sst-Cre mice but not the Pval- or Cck-Cre lines. In fact, inhibition of just Sst+ parafacial neurons recapitulated our original observation using a Vgat-cre line (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), suggesting that of these populations of parafacial inhibitory neurons only the SST+ population contribute to respiratory activity. Note that all chemogenetic experiments were compared pairwise to saline control, and we confirmed that clozapine had negligible effect on breathing control animals that did not receive AAV injections (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Our RNAseq results show that Sst+ defines the largest inhibitory population that varies based on expression of calretinin (<italic>Calb2</italic>, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>), reelin (<italic>Reln</italic>, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase 1 (<italic>Nos1</italic>, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>). We have not yet determined whether CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitivity is specific to one subset of Sst+ neurons or is a common feature of all Sst+ neurons in this region. These new results are shown in a new figure 5 and the text has been modified accordingly. Note that we opted to keep the scRNAseq results as figure 1 as it sets the stage for identifying populations of CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive inhibitory neurons and determine their contribution to breathing. We hope the reviewers agrees that these new data make for a more complete and exciting story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In a previous article by the same group (Kuo FS et al., eLife 2019, DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43387), mice expressing a Dravet syndrome-associated Scn1a missense mutation conditionally in inhibitory neurons presented breathing alterations including diminished chemosensitivity, with hypo-excitable inhibitory neurons and hyper-excitable excitatory neurons in the RTN. The present study is proposed as Research Advance of this previous article. To strengthen the continuity with the previous study, the authors could have analysed the expression of Snc1a in their scRNAseq data, to identify whether Scn1a is expressed in a cluster of inhibitory neurons, and link it with the cluster that is responsive to CO2/H<sup>+</sup>. This way, the link would be more evident, and the present study would really make use of the scRNAseq data. In the current state of this study, I somewhat fail to see its strong and direct continuity with the previous work justifying a Research Advance format, it would maybe be better suited as a traditional stand-alone Research Article.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous study noted by the reviewer showed that expression of a Dravet syndrome associated ion channel mutation in inhibitory neurons disrupted RTN chemoreceptor function and respiratory activity. These findings underscore the need to understand whether and how inhibitory neurons in the parafacial region contribute to breathing. Here, we meet this need by i) characterizing inhibitory neuron diversity within the parafacial region, ii) identifying which subsets of inhibitory neurons are CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive, iii) establishing that inhibitory synaptic activity regulate activity of RTN chemoreceptors in a CO2/H<sup>+</sup> dependent manner, and iv) showing how specific subsets of inhibitory parafacial neurons contribute to respiratory activity. Therefore, we believe these results represent an important extension of our previous study and are entirely appropriate for the Research Advance format.</p><p>To further link the present result to our previous study, we agree that it would be useful to characterize expression of Scn1a in the parafacial region. We have included a supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) that shows expression of Scn1a transcript in parafacial cells from 10 day old mice. Consistent with our previous study noted above, we show that Scn1a transcript is widely expressed in the parafacial region including both glutamatergic and inhibitory neurons. We have modified the text to include this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Was synaptic isolation performed when testing the CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of parafacial inhibitory neurons? Did you also block the usual gliotransmitters? The methods section is not clear, please provide more details, as whether these neurons are intrinsically sensitive to CO2/H<sup>+</sup> or not is critical for interpretation of these data.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We performed additional slice-patch experiments to determine whether Vgat+ neurons are intrinsically inhibited by CO2/H<sup>+</sup>. We found that exposure to 10% CO2 decreased activity by 1.7 ± 0.2 Hz under control conditions, 2.6 ± 0.3 Hz when glutamate and GABA/glycine signaling was blocked with CNQX (10 µM), strychnine (2 µM) and gabazine (10 µM), and by 1.1 ± 0.1 Hz when purinergic receptors were blocked with 8PT (10 µM) and PPADS (100 µM). Note that CO2/H<sup>+</sup> evoked ATP release from astrocytes is the only form of glial communication implicated in RTN chemoreception (PMID: 20647426) and previous work showed that inhibitory input to RTN neurons is augmented by P2X signaling (PMID: 16822980). Therefore, for these experiments we targeted purinergic signaling as a means of probing for roles of glia in this response. These results are shown a new Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1. In the first paragraph of the discussion, the authors conclude that inhibitory inputs to chemosensing RTN neurons are withdrawn/inhibited during exposure to high CO2. The net result is a lessening of GABA restraint on chemosensing neurons and an increase in their neural drive and neurotransmitter release. Another valid interpretation could be that increased neurotransmission from other tonic inputs to the RTN (arising from chemoreceptors activated during high CO2 exposures) contributes to the ventilatory response? Ie the VGAT inhibitory input isn't withdrawn but rather contributes much less to RTN drive during exposure to high CO2. Please include this interpretation, and other alternatives in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we think CO2/H<sup>+</sup> increases excitatory synaptic drive to RTN chemoreceptors while simultaneously decreasing inhibitory synaptic input. To support this, we show that exposure to high CO2/H<sup>+</sup> increased the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (Figure 4) and decreased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) recorded from RTN chemoreceptors (Figure 3). Note that these experiments were performed using a Cs+ based internal to block all postsynaptic K<sup>+</sup> channels (including TASK2 and leak K<sup>+</sup> targeted by GPR4). We also study the effects of CO2/H<sup>+</sup> on EPSCs and IPSCs in relative isolation by holding membrane potential at the reversal potential for chloride (-60 mV) or AMPA receptors (0 mV). For example, to study IPSCs we held membrane potential at 0 mV which eliminated AMPA mediated EPSCs. Under these conditions, the observed effect of CO2/H<sup>+</sup> on IPSC frequency is not due (at least directly) to changes in excitatory input. However, to the reviewers point, CO2/H<sup>+</sup> may elicit the release of non-glutamatergic neuromodulators that alter postsynaptic conductance to indirectly effect postsynaptic current amplitude. We cannot exclude involvement of this mechanism in the observed CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-induced decrease in IPSC amplitude. Therefore, we have added the following statement to the discussion “It should also be noted that CO2/H<sup>+</sup> may elicit release of non-glutamatergic neuromodulators that alter postsynaptic conductance and potentially contribute to diminished IPSC amplitude; however, we consider this unlikely since such a non-specific mechanism is expected to have similar effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. DREADD-mediated inhibition of inhibitory RTN neurons increased baseline minute ventilation but had no effect on ventilatory responses to CO2. Figure 6D-E – most columns do not include data from n=11 mice. Please explain why certain mice/replicates were excluded from the dataset. Figure 6 figure legend is incomplete – there is no description of the data shown for control Vgatcre (Figure 6F-H). Also, there are two Figure 6F.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Results from all 11 mice are shown in Figure 6C-I (now moved to supplemental figure 1). Some data points overlap making is somewhat difficult to see all individual data points. We have restructured this figure (now Figure 5—figure supplement 1) to omit any panel numbering redundancies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. CO2/H<sup>+</sup> synaptic properties of RTN neurons studies (page 8, line 193):</p><p>&quot;As previously defined (26), RTN neurons were considered chemosensitive if they show some level of spontaneous activity under control conditions and a robust firing rate response to 10% CO2 (1.6 {plus minus} 0.36 Hz; N=10).&quot; – 10% CO2 FR response of 1.6 {plus minus} 0.36 Hz does not seem 'robust' when compared to other previous studies. For example, Wang S et al. 2013 Figure 2D (citation #64), demonstrates FR at pH 7 (~8% CO2) to be &gt;4 Hz for both TypeI and TypeII dissociated RTN neurons. Wouldn't you expect FR to be &gt;&gt;4Hz in 10% CO2, for RTN neurons in an intact brain slice?</p></disp-quote><p>The CO2/H<sup>+</sup> response of RTN chemoreceptors described here is consistent with what has been previously described for type I RTN chemoreceptors in both the brain slice and acute dissociated preparations. For example, we show here that increasing CO2 from 5% (pH 7.3) to 10% (pH 7.0) increased activity by 1.6+/- 0.36 Hz. The study by Wang S et al., noted by the reviewer showed that acutely dissociated RTN chemoreceptors fire at ~2 Hz under control conditions (pH 7.3) and increase their firing discharge to ~3.5 Hz in pH 7.0. Thus, 0.3 pH unit acidification increased activity by ~ 1.5 Hz. Likewise, RTN chemoreceptors in medullary slices showed a similar degree of CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity (PMID: 15558061).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Authors used RNA seq to identify differentially expressed and coregulated genes in RTN neurons in order to infer biological meaning for further studies on this preeminent central chemoreceptor population. Single cell isolation method and RNA-seq methodology was extremely detailed, valuable information regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. The authors use tSNE to investigate segmentation, clustering of genes in the pFRG transcriptome. The data are convincing, since it is well established using other methods, that ~50% of glutamatergic RTN neurons express galanin. Could the authors clarify how they minimised batch effect, which can occur during the experiment, the RNA library preparation, or the sequencing run?</p></disp-quote><p>During library preparation, prep kits from the same batch/lot were used and libraries were constructed in parallel. To limit bias from sequencing on different flow cell lanes, and to remove unwanted biological variation, the scRNA-seq data analysis attempted to minimize batch effects in several ways.</p><p>After quality control (removing low quality cells) and data normalization, the subsequent analysis is guided by the selection of a set of influential genes. Often called highly-variable genes, these genes are those with the largest variance in expression relative to their mean expression (dispersion) within different bins of mean expression. Due to their high variance, using these genes as the primary features for downstream analysis preserves the variability in the dataset while greatly reduces its dimensionality. From this set of highly-variable genes, we exclude genes which may represent sources of unwanted biological and technical variation so that they do not influence downstream analysis; mitochondrial, ribosomal, hemoglobin, cell-cycle, and stress-related genes are excluded as are sex-related genes such as Xist and genes on the Y-chromosome.</p><p>One of the downstream analysis steps involves computing a nearest-neighbor graph- which is a weighted network connecting neighborhoods of related cells together based on shared (influential) gene expression levels. It’s at this step where we utilize the fast and efficient batch correction tool BBKNN (10.1093/bioinformatics/btz625) which computes a batch-corrected nearest-neighbor graph. This graph is then used for downstream clustering and the ensuing cell-type identification and sub-clustering analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are 20 global clusters (from 2000 genes) – the distribution of cells/cluster and genes/cluster is illustrated in Supp Figure 1C. The basis for the clustering was not clear – could the authors clarify this and make it clear in the text. It appears (from Supp Figure 1 B) that each cluster is defined by related genes that display a high level of expression within the cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that is roughly correct. As described above, the analysis is guided by the selection of roughly 2000 influential genes that are fed into principal component analysis and then the construction of a batch corrected nearest-neighbor graph. The clustering assignments come from the Leiden community detection algorithm (10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z) which operates on a graph to yield near-optimal partitioning/clustering at a specified resolution (effective partition size). In other words, cells are organized into communities similar to a social network based on their shared expression patterns of these 2000 influential genes, and cluster labels are given to groups of cells based on how similar cells within the group are to one another versus cells outside the group.</p><p>This clustering process is the current standard in the field and is integrated into the two most popular scRNA-seq analysis toolkits, ScanPy (used in this study) (10.1186/s13059-017-1382-0) and Seurat (10.1038/nbt.4096).

These neurons respond vigorously to CO2 in vivo, contribute to arterial PCO2 homeostasis and maintain breathing automaticity during sleep. Their synaptic inputs are not well identified however and the way in which they encode brain PCO2 in vivo is complex and much debated. Several mechanisms have been proposed (intrinsic pH sensitivity of RTN neurons, astrocyte-mediated paracrine effect of acid, paradoxical acid-mediated contraction of microvessels and synaptic inputs from acid-activated neurons, e.g. serotonergic). The present study explores the possible contribution of local inhibitory neurons to the activity and acid-sensitivity of RTN neurons. Consistent with prior EM evidence, the results show that RTN neurons receive GABA/glycinergic inputs. The contribution of a subset of this input to the CO2 response of RTN neurons is suggested by the results of experiments in slices but the existence of this mechanism is not convincingly supported by the in vivo experiments.</p><p>The authors confirm the transcriptome of RTN neurons and describe that of several subsets of inhibitory neurons (likely GABA- and glycine-ergic) that reside in their vicinity. This work greatly extends existing observations regarding these local inhibitory neurons. Unfortunately this work did not help identify the particular inhibitory interneurons postulated to be CO2-responsive.</p><p>Next, the authors show that a subset of these inhibitory neurons are mildly inhibited by acidification in slices. The effects are small and variable from cell to cell but suggest that CO2-triggered disinhibition could perhaps contribute to the overall excitatory effect of CO2 on RTN neurons.</p><p>This hypothesis is then tested, by determining whether chemogenetic inhibition of these inhibitory interneurons enhances breathing and the respiratory chemoreflex in conscious mice. The authors show is that inhibition of the GABA/glycine interneurons (via a Gi-coupled DREAAD) in unanesthetized mice elevates breathing slightly at rest but seems to have no effect on the breathing stimulation elicited by CO2. The increase in resting breathing is consistent with prior evidence that breathing is increased when a GABA-receptor antagonist is microinjected into the region containing the RTN neurons (Nattie et al) but this fact does not demonstrate that the increase in breathing is caused by activation of RTN neurons. As the authors acknowledge in the discussion the increase in breathing produced by inhibiting GABA interneurons in this brain region could also result from arousal. The increase in breathing could also result from the disinhibition of neurons other than RTN, for example the C1 neurons.</p><p>Finally, the main interpretative difficulty is that inhibition of the GABA/glycine interneurons does not change the respiratory chemoreflex; this is difficult to reconcile with the results obtained in slices and makes one wonder whether the acid inhibition of the GABA interneurons observed in slices is an artifact or at least whether it is a phenomenon that has any relevance to the CO2 response of RTN neurons in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive suggestions.

Although the authors are probably correct, they need to validate the assumption that their reporter line (Vgatcre::TdT) does indeed &quot;allow for selective targeting of inhibitory neurons in the region of interest&quot;. If this has been demonstrated before please give the specific quote. If not, the authors must demonstrate that the vast majority of the tomato-red positive neurons in their region of interest express VGat (transcript or protein) at the relevant postnatal age.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We confirmed that 81% and 83% of TdT labeling co-colocalize with Gad67 in P7 and P20 <italic>VgatCre::TdT</italic> mice, respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). At both developmental timepoints we found 8% of cells labeled with TdT only and the remaining were Gad67 only. Furthermore, cell type-specific expression of Cre recombinase in Sst-Cre (PMID 24690741), Pvalb-Cre (PMID 31160332) and Cck-Cre (PMID 33173030) lines used here have been confirmed previously. Therefore, we are confident in our ability to selectively target these populations for in vivo functional assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Re: lines 240-241. &quot;Specifically, we bilaterally injected AAV2-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (10 nL/side, Addgene) into the medial portion of the RTN in VGAT-cre mice&quot;. The authors need to also demonstrate here that VGat+-neurons were selectively transduced (i.e. that mCherry and VGat were colocalized). The selectivity of this type of approach is typically overrated (ectopic expression of Cre and Cre-independent effects of the DIO viral prep) and must be verified.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We confirmed that 99% of AAV mCherry labeled cells were Gad67-immunoreactive. We also confirm that 95% of Gad67-immunoreactive neurons in the parafacial region were co-labeled with mCherry (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These results confirm the specificity and efficiency of our viral expression system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Re: results lines 177-183. The defining criteria for pH sensitivity is fine but the results are less than impressive: 20% of neurons were inhibited to some degree (-20% or more) when exposed to a fairly severe acidification (pH 7.0), 66% were unaffected and 9 % were judged to be excited. Figure 3C should be replaced with a distribution histogram summarizing the % response of all the VGAt neurons sampled (e.g. 10% effect binning). Small positive or negative effects of acidification on unit-activity in slices have frequently been reported in other brainstem areas such as the nucleus of the solitary tract. Cherry-picking neurons that are excited and those that are inhibited is not terribly convincing unless this grouping correlates with an identifiable biochemical or structural marker, which was not the case here.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional experiments and found that 48 of 130 (37%) parafacial Vgat+ cells are robustly and reversibly inhibited by 10% CO2. The fact that most inhibitory neurons in this region do not respond to this level of CO2 is reassuring because it suggests that our stimulus is not a sledgehammer. It also suggests those cells that do respond are different and perhaps specialized sense and respond to CO2 and considering this is an important respiratory chemoreceptor region, it’s tempting to speculate these CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited parafacial neurons contribute to RTN chemoreception. As suggested, we included a histogram showing CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-induced change in firing for all Vgat neurons sampled (Figure 2D).</p><p>We have also determined that CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited parafacial neurons are SST-immunoreactive, whereas Vgat+ neurons that do not respond to CO2/H<sup>+</sup> are also not SST-immunoreactive (Figure 2A-B). Based on this and guided by our RNAseq results that identify the main subsets of parafacial inhibitory neurons (Figure 1C), we went on to show that chemogenetic inhibition of Sst+ cells (Figure 5A) but not Pvalb+ (Figure 5E) or CcK<sup>+</sup> (Figure 5F) parafacial neurons increased baseline breathing in manner consistent with disinhibition. These results also mimic the respiratory phenotype elicited by silencing all parafacial inhibitory neurons (Figure 5 Supplement 1), thus suggesting Sst+ parafacial neurons have a unique role in control of breathing. The text has been modified extensively to include these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Re: lines 248-249 and discussion. The increase breathing could have many causes and may not have nothing to do with CO2 chemoreception. For example, selective activation of the rostral C1 neurons produces a very strong increase in breathing in unanesthetized mice and these neurons are tonically inhibited by GABA-ergic input (the basis of the baroreflex). The increased breathing noted at baseline (no CO2 added) could also denote arousal from sleep, an effect produced by activation of the C1 neurons, the RTN itself and perhaps other neurons in the area.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have modified the last paragraph of the discussion to make clear that parafacial inhibitory neurons (Sst+ in particular) likely regulate breathing at multiple levels of the respiratory circuit. It is worth noting that activation of adrenergic C1 has been shown to increase sigh activity, whereas CO<sub>2</sub> or optogenetic activation of chemosensitive RTN neurons has been shown to increase respiratory output but with no change in sighing (PMID: 25325789). Also chemogenetic inhibition of Vgat-cre or Sst-cre parafacial neurons did not elicit obvious sigh activity. Therefore, we do not think C1 neurons have a dominate role in this response.</p><p>On the other hand, a yet unknown population of parafacial Vgat+ neurons influence sleep-wake states and so arousal may contribute to baseline breathing responses caused by inhibition of Vgat+ or Sst+ parafacial neurons. This interesting possibility will require additional experiments that are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We apologize for the delay in providing this review.

We have included this as a future direction in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] 1. It would be essential to define the hypothesis of the present study clearly. The authors &quot;considered&quot; the possibility that ventral medullary neurons in the region of the RTN sense changes in CO2/H<sup>+</sup> and regulate RTN chemoreception by a mechanism involving disinhibition. However, the authors provided evidence for the ventral medullary inhibitory neurons' involvement in neither the RTN chemoreception nor RTN disinhibition. The authors then propose a novel mode of chemotransduction involving regulation of basal breathing by CO2/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent disinhibition. In fact, the experiments involving the chemogenetic inhibition of SSt neurons did not demonstrate that the RTN neuronal function was affected. The neurons in the ventral medullary region close to RTN project to the pre-Bötzinger Complex (PMID: 26855425), and these projections could be involved in the increases of baseline breathing following SSt neurons chemogenetic inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We show that chemogenetic inhibition of Sst+ parafacial neurons increased baseline breathing, and our cellular data is consistent with CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent disinhibition of RTN chemoreceptors; however, we do not show that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive Sst+ neurons directly innervate RTN chemoreceptors or that Sst+ parafacial neurons regulate breathing via the RTN. Based on this, we broadly define our hypothesis as “ventral parafacial inhibitory neurons in the region of the RTN sense changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> and regulate baseline breathing by a mechanism involving disinhibition”. We also noted in the discussion that it is not yet clear whether CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> inhibited parafacial neurons regulate breathing by disinhibition of RTN or other elements of respiratory control including the pre-BötC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are no clear functional connections between some of the results described. The authors described the presence of a diversity of inhibitory neurons in the ventral medullary region and that the inhibition of SSt neurons increased the baseline breathing without affecting the ventilatory responses to hypercapnia/acidosis. On the other hand, there are data showing that RTN neurons receive synaptic inhibition, which was reduced in response to hypercapnia/acidosis. Therefore, the authors need to demonstrate that: i) the three different populations (activated, insensitive, and inhibited) of SSt neurons are projecting to RTN chemosensitive neurons, and: ii) the chemogenetic inhibition of SSt neurons increases the RTN neurons firing frequency by reducing the inhibitory synaptic transmission. The SSt neurons recorded in vitro were labeled, and the projections to the RTN neurons can be revealed in the same slice. Besides, the effects of SSt neurons inhibition (chemogenetics) on the RTN firing frequency and inhibitory synaptic transmission can also be analyzed in in vitro experiments using the transfected animals. It is important to note that without new experiments to prove the role of the inhibitory ventral medullary SSt neurons in the RTN chemosensitivity, the authors should consider presenting the data in two (I – somatostatin-expressing RTN neurons regulate baseline breathing; II – the effects of hypercapnia/acidosis on the synaptic transmission to RTN neurons) different manuscripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our results fall short of definitively proving that Sst+ parafacial neurons directly regulate activity of RTN chemoreceptors. Specifically, we show that i) Sst+ parafacial neurons are inhibited by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>, ii) RTN chemoreceptors receive inhibitory input that is withdrawn during CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>; iii) bath application of GABA and glycine receptor blockers increase baseline activity of RTN chemoreceptors (new results), and iv) chemogenetic inhibition of Sst+ but not Pvalb+ or CcK<sup>+</sup> parafacial neurons increased baseline breathing. Based on this, we think it is reasonable to suggest Sst+ parafacial neurons regulate activity of RTN chemoreceptors. We also believe these complementary results should be published as one manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors demonstrated that the inhibitory neurons are located close to the RTN chemoreceptors. In fact, it is possible to observe in the provided images that the Tdt cells of Slc32a1 animals are in the RTN. The anatomical nomenclature is highly confusing in the manuscript. There is no evidence that the described inhibitory neurons are outside of the RTN. Parafacial or even pFRG terminologies only add to the confusion regarding the cell types present in this region of the brain and their role. Therefore, the authors studied the inhibitory neurons of the RTN of mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers point. All cells included in this study were located in the ventral parafacial region that overlaps with the RTN. However, since the term RTN is typically used to define CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> activated glutamatergic neurons in this region (PMID: 31635852) (clusters 1-2 in Figure 1B), we referring to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> sensitive inhibitory neurons as ‘inhibitory neurons of the RTN’ is more confusing then CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-inhibited parafacial neurons. We used this terminology throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is the CO2/H<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of RTN neurons different before and after the inhibitory synaptic transmission blockade? In other words, what is the contribution of the synaptic disinhibition to the RTN neuronal firing response to hypercapnia/acidosis? The RTN neurons receive inhibitory synaptic inputs with very low frequency (0.2 Hz) and amplitude (12 pA), and hypercapnia/acidosis reduces it by nearly half. Therefore, in which extension such rare and small events contribute to the increases in RTN neurons firing frequency and breathing after SSt neurons chemogenetic inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this point. We added new in vitro results to show that bath application of bicuculine (10 µM) and strychnine (2 µM) increased activity of RTN chemoreceptors by 0.7 ± 0.2 Hz (T<sub>12</sub>=2.201, p=0.022). This finding suggests inhibitory input partly limits activity of RTN chemoreceptors under baseline conditions. We also found the firing response to 10% CO<sub>2</sub> was similar under control conditions and in the presence of bicuculine and strychnine (Δ -0.3 ± 0.2 Hz; T<sub>12</sub>=1.246, p&gt;0.05).

The authors should provide the number and the rostro-caudal distributions of transfected SSt, CCK and Pvalb neurons, not only the &quot;center&quot; of bilateral virus injections or percentage of neurons, in the chemogenetic experiments. It is an important issue to report considering data reproducibility by other groups, and the extension of the transfected cells in the ventral medulla can provide evidence for different clusters of inhibitory neurons in mice controlling different functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not systematically characterized the rostro-caudal distribution of transfected cells for each cre line.

Is the scale for measured current of the Figure 4 panel A right? The grouped data in panel B show that the amplitude of sEPSCs is -10 pA, but the representative traces show that it is the level of the electrical noise.

The events are ~ 50 pA, while the grouped data are ~12.5 pA.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks.

Please check the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential; it is unlikely to be – 60 mV using the described intracellular and extracellular solutions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The reviewer is correct, the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential for our experimental conditions is approximately -84 mV. Therefore, the holding potential used for recording EPSCs was depolarized to the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential. However, we consider this a minor issue because potential contaminating IPSCs could easily be excluded from EPSC analysis based on the direction of synaptic currents; inward for EPSCs and outward for IPSCs. We also pharmacologically confirmed EPSCs as glutamatergic at the end of each experiment by bath application of CNQX.

They also showed that blocking glutamate receptors in the lateral parafacial region minimally effected CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced active expiration. These results suggest expiratory parafacial neurons are distinct from and not dependent on RTN chemoreceptors. Conversely, other work in rats showed selective activation (PMID: 32973046) or inhibition (PMID: 20844141) of ventral parafacial Phox2b+ neurons increased and decreased expiratory activity, respectively.
