infected cells, and cross biological barriers. The glideosome-associated connector (GAC) is a conserved protein essential to this process. GAC facilitates the association of actin filaments with surface transmembrane adhesins and the efficient transmission of the force generated by myosin translocation of actin to the cell surface substrate. Here, we present the crystal structure of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> GAC and reveal a unique, supercoiled armadillo repeat region that adopts a closed ring conformation. Characterisation of the solution properties together with membrane and F-actin binding interfaces suggests that GAC adopts several conformations from closed to open and extended. A multi-conformational model for assembly and regulation of GAC within the glideosome is proposed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apicomplexa</kwd><kwd>glideosome</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>connector protein</kwd><kwd>protein crystallography</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG_2018_107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/W001764/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013325</institution-id><institution>Swiss Re Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10030_185325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soldati-Favre</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013325</institution-id><institution>Swiss Re Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII5_198545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soldati-Favre</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/D524840/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202926/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8021-00133B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Interactions between cells and their environment are essential for the transmission of intracellular forces to the extracellular matrix. In multicellular eukaryotes, cell-cell adhesion ensures tissue integrity while providing footholds for the migration of cell within tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Pascalis and Etienne-Manneville, 2017</xref>). Cadherins and integrins are major examples of such adhesive molecules that are coupled to the actin cytoskeleton via intracellular bridging components, such as the catenins, vinculin, and talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachir et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Pathogenic organisms also exploit adherent junctions to facilitate movement with respect to host cells and invasion. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular unicellular parasite and a prominent member of the Apicomplexa phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim and Weiss, 2004</xref>), which also includes Plasmodium, the causative agent of human malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 1995</xref>). These parasites share a common set of specialised apical organelles, the micronemes and rhoptries, that are critical for invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carruthers and Sibley, 1999</xref>). The sequential secretion of both organelles leads to the formation of a moving junction (MJ) formed between the parasite and host cell plasma membranes that participates in active penetration. Apicomplexan parasites also actively egress from infected host cells and migrate across biological barriers. Substrate-dependent, forward parasite propulsion is known as gliding motility and powered by a multiprotein structure referred to as the glideosome. A myosin motor comprising myosin A (MyoA), a class XIV myosin heavy chain and its myosin light chains, together with glideosome-associated proteins (GAPs) interact with and generate rearward translocation of actin filaments (F-actin) along the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Powell et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The glideosome-associated connector (GAC) protein is a central bridging component of the gliding machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>). This large protein composed of numerous armadillo repeats (ARMs) is highly conserved throughout the Apicomplexa phylum and links F-actin to the TRAP/MIC family of surface adhesins at the plasma membrane, which targets host cell ligands and mediates adherent anchor points. A key member of the TRAP/MIC family is the transmembrane micronemal protein 2 (TgMIC2) that supports gliding motility and host cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huynh and Carruthers, 2006</xref>). The ectodomain of TgMIC2 comprises a von Willebrand factor A domain and multiple thrombospondin repeat domains that associate with an accessory protein (M2AP) and host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huynh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jewett and Sibley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song and Springer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tonkin et al., 2010</xref>). TgMIC2 is predicted to connect the parasite actomyosin system through an interaction between GAC and its cytoplasmic tail. GAC moves dynamically with the MJ from the parasite apical to the basal pole during gliding motility, host cell egress, and invasion. Rearward translocation of adhesins anchored to both the parasite plasma membrane and the host membrane by the inner-membrane-associated glideosome generates parasite forward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carruthers and Tomley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frénal et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>The initial apical location of GAC depends on the activity of an apical lysine methyltransferase (AKMT), through a yet unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>). Recently ultrastructure expansion microscopy localised GAC and formin 1 (FRM1) to the preconoidal rings (PCRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dos Santos Pacheco et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, FRM1 is the only and essential nucleator of actin polymerisation to drive conoid extrusion and parasite motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). As part of the conoid, the PCRs serve as platform for the assembly of the glideosome. Membrane association of GAC relies on its capacity to bind phosphatidic acid (PA), an essential lipid mediator for microneme secretion which assists in the correct engagement of GAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullen et al., 2016</xref>). Despite significant efforts, high-resolution structural insight into GAC and its multiple interactions has not been available since its discovery. An initial small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) model predicted an elongated club-shaped conformation with the C-terminal Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain lying at the extremity of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe combined X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), SAXS, and hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) with course-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MDs) analyses to illuminate the structure and conformations adopted by full-length GAC from <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Structure validation by biochemical and parasite assays provides insights into membrane and actin binding, ultimately allowing us to propose a model for assembly within the glideosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The structure of full-length TgGAC</title><p>Well-diffracting and reproducible crystals were obtained at pH 5 for native full-length TgGAC (residues 1–2639; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>).

The presence of an extended N-terminal-helix is reminiscent of the PH domains from TgAPH and TgISP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darvill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tonkin et al., 2014</xref>) and appears to be a common feature among apicomplexan PH domains. To provide an illustrative model for full-length TgGAC, the validated structure of TgGAC<sub>2505–2639</sub> (TgGAC<sub>PH</sub>) was positioned in the available electron density map for N-terminus of this region and a linker modelled with MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiser et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of TgGAC<sub>7–2504</sub> comprises 169 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) arranged in 53 consecutive helical bundles that resemble ARM and HEAT-like repeats (AHRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kippert and Gerloff, 2009</xref>) linked to the mixed α/β C-terminal PH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The architecture can be divided into three major regions (RI, RII, and RIII). RI (residues 1–1665) comprises 37 consecutive AHRs of approximately 40 residues long that are supercoiled into a three-layer pyramid structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The final ARM of region I (AHR 37) is extended with a six amino acid linker (L1) to start a second large AHR region (RII). RII comprises 16 canonical armadillo repeats (AHR38-53) and forms a superhelical arch that contacts the base of the RI pyramid helical regions. This interface encompasses a surface area of 1550 Å<sup>2</sup>, with AHR1 and AHR17-18 from RI forming one side while AHR48-50 from RII form the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The interface comprises several prominent electrostatic interactions (K2254-D11, E2436-H24, D2330-R629, D2346-K672, and D2197-R716; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). AHR50 also has a large helix-loop-helix insertion (residues 2278–2337) between the second and third helices which creates a prominent protrusion that also stabilises the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). A basic AHR53 completes the region, (II) and an ordered linker from 2489 to 2510 (L2) extends to the adjacent C-terminal PH domain which comprises region III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Residues forming these key features of the structure are highly conserved across GAC orthologues in Apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Glideosome-associated connector (GAC) adopts both open and closed structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superimposition of the experimentally determined composite structure of TgGAC with those generated from AlphaFold2 for TgGAC and PfGAC, showing that the closed structure is conserved (left).

To shed light on this, we examined AlphaFold2 structures predicted for full-length TgGAC and PfGAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). Remarkably, the overall architecture of the predicted structures is very similar to that observed in the crystal structure of TgGAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as it is characterised by a series of tandem AHRs that are supercoiled into a large ring and is closed by specific interactions between N- and C-terminal AHRs. While the interface in the predicted TgGAC and PfGAC is partially separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the interacting regions overlap with those identified experimentally for TgGAC. The N-/C-terminal interface that characterises the closed structure is conserved at the amino acid sequence level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We next performed a SAXS analysis over a range of solution conditions to determine whether an open structure is indeed present in solution. GAC was measured at a concentration of 1.3 mg/mL as a function of pH from 4.0 to 8.0. We chose this concentration as a compromise between having the lowest concentration to avoid intermolecular interactions leading to aggregation whilst maintaining good signal to noise. The largest difference is observed as an increase in intensity at low scattering vector moduli, <italic>q</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), where the intensity is proportional to the mass of the protein/complexes, suggesting that oligomerisation/aggregation is occurring and is most pronounced at pH 5.0. This is consistent with SEC profiles at pH 5 and 8 showing significantly earlier elution of TgGAC at pH 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of salt has no effect of the elution volume at both pHs.</p><p>To explore the structure of TgGAC in solution at pH 8.0, the mass and size were determined both by a Guinier fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and using an indirect Fourier transform (IFT) routine for calculating the pair distance distribution function, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Note that due to the oligomerisation/aggregation at low pH, the overall size of the complex is too large to be resolved by our instrument setup, as the slope of the intensity at low <italic>q</italic> is too large. When the overall size cannot be established, the mass and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) functions cannot be reliably calculated. At pH 8.0, masses of 264 kDa (Guiner) and 286 kDa (IFT) were obtained, which are close to the expected value of 286 kDa for a TgGAC monomer. The radius of gyration, <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub>, values of, respectively, 105 Å and 122 Å were obtained, which are much larger than the <italic>R</italic><sub>g</sub> of 48 Å calculated from the crystal structure of TgGAC. This discrepancy in size is also clearly seen when comparing the <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) function calculated from the SAXS data and the crystal structure, where the maximum intramolecular distances are 394 Å and 138 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The theoretical scattering curve can be calculated from the coordinates of the full-length TgGAC structure and compared to the measured data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It shows that at medium to large <italic>q</italic>, the structures are relatively similar, indicating that they contain similar structural components on shorter length scales, but at medium to low <italic>q</italic>, there is a large difference showing that the overall size and shape are very different. To explore this further, an ab initio model was build using the ATSAS program GASBOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Svergun et al., 2001</xref>), which is highly extended and fits the low <italic>q</italic> part of the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A dimensionless Kratky plot also illustrates that the structure in pH 8.0 solution is much more flexible than would be predicted from the crystal structure, but also it is not completely unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate the conformation changes occurring at pH 8.0 compared to the crystal structure in solution, a series of extended models were generated by steered-MD by applying a pulling force between the C- and N-terminal side of the interface, followed by the subsequent separation of the supercoiled pyramid. The model of these that fits best with the data is the most extended, which maintain the domain structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The curve fits the data well at high and low <italic>q</italic>; however, it is significantly above the data in the intermediate range. This means that further loss of domain structure is likely occurring. We did not attempt to pursue this further as it would be too speculative to predict which regions lose their secondary structure. Note that the p(r) function and the Kratky plot of the scattering for the extended structure are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Overall, the data and the models show that even though TgGAC is primarily a monomer in solution at pH 8.0, it forms a much more extended structure than seen in the crystal structure whilst maintaining key structural elements. Collectively, it can be concluded that a closed structure is likely to be an important stable functional state as the N-/C-interface is encoded within the sequence conservation. The extended, flexible structures observed in solution may play a role is a facilitating the assembly GAC with its binding partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mapping the PA-binding interface for the C-terminal PH domain of GAC</title><p>An extended patch of conserved basic residues is formed on one face of the PH domain in GAC which is reminiscent of the charge distribution on TgAPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darvill et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a similar role in phospholipid binding.

Titration with LUVs composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and POPA (50:50% POPC:POPA) caused a significant loss in PfGAC<sub>PH</sub> NMR signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating binding to the ‘NMR invisible’ LUVs, whilst almost no loss in signal was observed upon titration with LUVs composed solely of POPC.

HDX-MS is a powerful method that examines protein dynamics by monitoring the exchange rate of protein amide hydrogens with the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2022</xref>). Information on protein secondary structure and conformation is provided by measuring overall deuteration levels, and the comparison of H/D exchange rates between protein constructs reveals differences in protein dynamics and conformation. To evaluate whether the 1–619 region adopts the same conformation in TgGAC<sub>1–619</sub>, TgGAC<sub>1–1114</sub>, and TgGAC-FL, HDX-MS analyses of peptides encompassing residues 1–619 were compared for all three constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

NMR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) also confirms that this fragment is predominantly well folded.

GAC, an abundant protein that crucially localises to the PCRs that belong to the conoid complex at the apical tip of parasite, was shown to adopt multiple conformations to regulate its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The most striking feature of the TgGAC structure is the large continuous supercoiled ARM region (residues 1–2490) which forms a ring. The closure of the ring results from an extensive interface between the ARM1 and ARMs14-16 from RI and ARMs46-48 from RII (N/C-interface - <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This closed conformation was unexpected as an earlier SAXS model suggested an extended, club-shaped molecule in solution with no evidence for a N-/C-terminal interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this discrepancy, the interface formed in the closed structure is highly conserved at the protein sequence level suggesting that it is a functionally relevant state. Subsequent pH-dependent SAXS analyses reported in the present study revealed that an open structure exists at high pH, but oligomerised/aggregrated forms predominate at low pH. The nature of the N/C interface in the closed structure is hydrophilic with several electrostatic interactions, including some that are readily titratable, such H24 and H2164. It is conceivable that deprotonation of these residues at high pH removes key salt bridges that stabilise the closed conformation and facilitate a conformationally labile open structure. Our SAXS data at low pH may provide some support for this notion, as it reveals a multimerised/aggregated state. While this is unlikely to reflect oligomerisation in vivo, it could result from the reformation of these electrostatic interactions in an intermolecular manner. The ability of GAC to adopt both a flexible open conformation and transition to a closed ring structure could play a role in regulating the multiple interactions of GAC assembly on the glideosome and to the parasite membrane. This behaviour is reminiscent of the unrelated ARM-rich protein, HUWE1, which is a quality-control E3 ligase, which forms a large, closed ring from 34 tandem ARM repeats. The closed structure is believed to represent a latent state but can adopt a range of open conformations to regulate its interactions with accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grabarczyk et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>GAC interacts with PA-enriched membranes that are generated through a signalling cascade in activated parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bullen et al., 2016</xref>). The C-terminal PH domain within GAC presents a conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), positively charged surface, and while this is important for PA binding in vitro, its mutation does not cause a significant defect in GAC localisation, translocation, or parasite fitness. Other regions in GAC, such as the basic protrusion in AHR53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), are also likely to contribute to membrane binding in vivo. Furthermore, the presence of a membrane interaction surface within the TgGAC<sub>PH</sub> suggests that the binding site for the juxtamembrane region of the MIC2 cytoplasmic tail is located nearby, and these interactions may also be cooperative. Even though the PH domain represents a minor portion of the full-length GAC structure, its interaction with RII region seems crucial for GAC structural integrity, as a construct lacking the PH domain cannot fold properly.</p><p>The principal <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> F-actin binding region is localised to the first 1114 residues of TgGAC (TgGAC<sub>1–1114</sub>), which forms a large, supercoiled base of the N-terminal pyramid (TgGAC-R1:1–1656 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and provides a platform with several potential sites of interaction with a helical actin filament. A shorter fragment encompassing only the first turn of the supercoiled pyramid (TgGAC<sub>1–619</sub>) does not interact with F-actin. Analysis of the protein conformation by HDX-MS showed that TgGAC<sub>1–619</sub> adopts a similar conformation for residues 1–558 as in full-length TgGAC, suggesting that the minimal actin-binding interface lies between residues 559–1114 (AHRs 15–25) in which the second supercoiled turn starts. The absence of F-actin binding for the N-terminal portion (1–619), which forms the base of GAC pyramidal structure, suggests a role in this region in stabilising the closed conformation as it makes direct contact with the C-terminal end of the RII region. Membrane association simulations for TgGAC reveal a specific membrane-binding surface involving the PH domain and RII, and this orientation places the TgGAC<sub>1–1114</sub> region distal for interaction with the actin filament.</p><p>As the available pellicular space between the parasite inner membrane complex and the plasma membrane is insufficient for the open structure of GAC (i.e. with RII and RIII extended) to bridge F-actin to the plasma membrane lengthways, the closed structure is likely to represent a functional important state of cytosolic GAC or during GACs initial engagement within the glideosome. Other actin-membrane bridging proteins, like the ERM (ezrin, moesin, and radixin) family of proteins, crosslink cortical actin to plasma membrane, and full engagement is achieved by a reorganisation of actin-binding regions by cooperative interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Aissa et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that PA binding and MIC2 recruitment at the plasma membrane by GAC contribute to conformational changes to GAC structure, i.e., a transition from closed to open and extended structures.</p><p>The function of GAC in bridging parasite cytoskeleton to the host cell substrate is reminiscent of that for the mammalian catenins within adherens junctions, which comprise several components. The C-terminal AHR arch region (AHRs 38–53) displays significant structural similarity with the armadillo repeat region (ARM) of the ß-catenins, superimposing with an RMSD of 4.2 Å over the backbone of 348 equivalent residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Nominally, α-catenin crosslinks F-actin to β-catenin, while β-catenin establishes the connection to the E-cadherin tails. The single chain of GAC carries out both these roles, i.e., RI acts like the actin-binding α-catenin and is linked via L1 to RII ARM arch structure, which like β-catenin tethers the system to the cell surface adhesins. The ß-catenins bind extended cadherin tails emerging from the plasma membrane via a superhelical surface formed by 12 tandem ARM repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiyama et al., 2010</xref>). As TgGAC likely binds the cytoplasmic C-terminal tails of the plasma membrane adhesin TgMIC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that a similar interface formed in ß-catenin/E-cadherin complexes is used by TgGAC to link TgMIC2 to the glideosome machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the extensive interface within and between the catenins and E-cadherin facilitates molecular transduction via mechanical strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angulo-Urarte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Valenta et al., 2012</xref>). Mechanical force induces a rearrangement of binding interfaces that result in a strengthening of its interaction with F-actin, and this effect is dependent on the direction of applied force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Such catch bond behaviour may also be relevant for GAC function. Importantly, part of the 559–1114 F-actin binding region is not fully accessible in the closed conformation; therefore, it is also conceivable that optimal F-actin binding requires significant structural rearrangement of the closed structure. The stabilised closed conformation would be able to both resist and sense the significant inter parasite–substrate forces generated by MyoA translocation of F-actin. Such force acting along parasite–host cell interface could induce opening of the GAC structure and unveil additional cryptic binding sites that strengthen F-actin binding and ensure a coordinated direction of motion. The lower affinity of full-length TgGAC compared to TgGAC<sub>1–1114</sub> for F-actin supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>Structural similarity also exists between the C-terminal ARM region of GAC (TgGAC<sub>1670–2639</sub>) and the family of myosin-specific chaperones which possess ARM-rich UCS (UNC-45/Cro1/She4) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hellerschmied and Clausen, 2014</xref>) that interact with myosin motors domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). While <italic>T. gondii</italic> possesses a dedicated UCS chaperone for TgMyoA (TgUNC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bookwalter et al., 2014</xref>), which is critical for successful folding of all the parasite myosin motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frénal et al., 2017b</xref>), the similarity between the GAC C-terminal ARM region and the UCS chaperones is intriguing. Myosin chaperones also have the propensity to multimerise and, in some cases, form chains that assist myosin assembly on the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gazda et al., 2013</xref>). Although no direct evidence for an interaction between TgGAC and TgMyoA has been found, it is tempting to speculate that TgGAC may assist TgMyoA organisation on F-actin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Full-length TgGAC gene with TEV cleavable N-terminal 6xHis-tag has been cloned into the pET28a vector as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Amy Andreotti as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the structure of GAC is overall well described it requires further polishing in terms of model quality and accuracy (as it stands it appears like a structure at an early stage of refinement). Please carefully address the reviewer comments as detailed below in the recommendations for the authors.</p><p>2) Alternative interpretation of the SAXS data should be considered concerning the oligomerization state of GAC induced by pH.</p><p>3) The manuscript should be carefully reviewed to correct numerous errors in the text, figures and legends.</p><p>4) The model presented in Figure 8 is too speculative and the figure should be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The crystal structure model a long way from being good enough in quality and appears like a structure at an early stage of refinement. It has a large number of Ramachandran and bond length and angle outliers. Looking at the model, there are also large areas in which the model does not fit the map. I have not mentioned this in the public report, to be kind, but this really must be fixed, or it will be embarrassing. A structure at this resolution should really have no outliers (except perhaps for a few Ramachandran outliers if the density shows them to be genuine) of these types and should fit the maps.</p><p>– Figure 1 does not make clear what is a model and what an experimentally derived structure is. I would show the NMR and crystal structures as the first two panels and only then the composite. In the era of AlphaFold, it is important to distinguish clearly between experimentally determined structures and models.</p><p>– There are quite a lot of errors in the text and figures and legends.</p><p>– Error in Figure 4 legend – two (e) and no (f).</p><p>– Error in Figure 5 legend – there is no (d) or (e) in the figure.</p><p>– Comment on the differential effect of mutations – for example, KER – on full–length and PH domains.</p><p>– Figure 7d/e – what are GAC N100 and GAC N70? What is peptide centroid? Why is this not shown for the full protein length when GAC fl has been studied in this way? What is e?</p><p>– It felt to me that the data in Figure 7d/e would fit better with the SAXS data and make more sense to readers here when describing the flexibility of GAC.</p><p>– Personally I would remove Figure 8 as it is extremely speculative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Structure (X–ray and NMR) description.</p><p>The full–length and quite large (2639 residues) structure was solved in a composite way. The largest part (7–2504) solved Se–MAD crystallography revealing 53 modules resembling armadillo/heat–like repeats and a small (2505–2639) and dynamic pleckstrin homology–like domain C–terminal domain solved by NMR assisted with AlphaFold2 modelling.</p><p>The structure is well–described and illustrations are relatively clear to get a sense of the modular organization of this large modular protein. Figure S2 in particular is to be mentioned as the Authors took the time to generate a SS mapping of the entire large structure on the sequence.</p><p>This reviewer is a crystallographer and inspected the density map in its entirety in COOT using the PDB and two maps provided 2Fo–Fc and Fo–Fc (thank you for the PDB and maps). It is a large protein so I am aware it represents a considerable amount of work but the repetitive modular organization is actually helpful to guide building (especially with other related structures at hand). This structure still requires some significant polishing in some areas where things can be improved and clearly cleaned up especially for this resolution range considering it was phased by MAD.</p><p>A lot of seleno methionines need to be adjusted better in the maps. Especially the Selenium atoms are electron–dense so it should be easy to fix. Quite a few side chains are built in but have no density, might want to do something about that and a few missing could be built in or readjusted.</p><p>I listed down some of the most obvious problems.</p><p>SeMet 30</p><p>R84</p><p>SeMet 89</p><p>S120</p><p>Q125</p><p>E128</p><p>T160 &lt;-&gt;Q203</p><p>Loop 275-285.

It is a cytoplasmic protein in the parasite and was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The maps show that the C2420 SH and C2467 point outwards and would not be engaged into an S-S bridge that looks wrong in the Fo-Fc negative maps. So recheck this and refine accordingly. C2420 looks towards T2470 while C2467 would rather look towards the backbone carbonyl of T2466.</p><p>Would these cysteines be conserved in Plasmodium?</p><p>Recheck your waters. Some dense peaks could be assigned to waters.</p><p>The statistics for crystal structure resolution (i.e., Se-MAD phasing) are not reported accurately. This should be remedied.</p><p>Phasing and refinement.</p><p>Data quality and refinement/phasing.</p><p>Outer shell statistics with <italic>Rmerge</italic> and Rmeas of over 100% with an I/σ(I) of only 0.71 are a bit extreme even to me. I know that the contributions of weak reflections are weighted down with all the maximum likelihood refinement procedures but still. Please report the multiplicity/redundancy of the overall data set and the outer shell in this present version of the study.</p><p>Table 1. Since no phasing information is reported there, it would be adequate to remove phasing from its title. It is only data quality and refinement statistics.</p><p>That said it is expected to scientifically and rigorously report the phasing statistics since no phasing statistics can be found anywhere in this manuscript. I am sure the first and last authors will agree with me on this. Citing the other article *, which however does report multiplicity, is of no interest in this case.</p><p>Kumar A, Zhang X, Vadas O, Stylianou FA, Dos Santos Pacheco N, Rouse SL, Morgan ML, Soldati–Favre D, Matthews S (2022) Secondary Structure and X–rayCrystallographic Analysis of the Glideosome–Associated Connector (GAC) from <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. Crystals 12</p><p>Refinement. In light of what I saw while inspecting the whole structure and ED Fourier difference maps, it might be useful to consider anisotropic TLS refinement of atomic displacement parameters, especially in light of the 'subdomain' structures suggested by SAXS/HDX and MD simulation data. Coloring the structure by the B factor on the backbone is quite indicative actually.</p><p>2-SAXS analysis.</p><p>The authors use SAXS to characterize the solution–extended conformation of TgGAC and show that it is different from the crystal conformation.</p><p>Reading Kumar et al. (2021) one notices that crystals were grown at pH=5 using a protein initially purified at pH=8.0.</p><p>There is a piece of data that could be shown by the Authors in that study. It would be the superimposed SEC profiles of purified TgGAC at pH 8 and pH 5 under a diluted regime maybe (but with some salt around) see my comment below.</p><p>Authors show SAXS profiles at different pHs in a diluted regime (Figure 2b), how is pH change performed? They notice that oligomerization seems the most pronounced at pH5 (the crystallization pH) but we will also make the observation that the SAXS buffer has virtually no salt (25 mM Tris) and these are not ideal conditions to limit intermolecular interactions and maybe aggregation independently of molecular compaction (closing of the structure as in the crystal conformation).</p><p>The P(r) compared are different. The solution curve was obtained at pH 8 but the calculated curve was done on a structure obtained at pH 5. The N/C interface being so charged it would not be surprising that it is sensitive to pH changes. In this case, why not measure and calculate the experimental P(r) function at pH5 would it fit (or not, like what is observed in pH 8) the crystal structure? The SAXS study of Jacot et al. (2016) mentions a range of concentrations from 1.2 to 4.6 mg/ml for the equivalent construct (FL–TgGAC) on a wider angular range it seems compared to what is described here.</p><p>Since the authors present P(r) analysis, in addition to the large difference in RG it would be meaningful to emphasize in the figures the maximum intramolecular distance (Dmax) calculated with the X–ray structure (~145 Å from what I see in Figure S3b/S2c) to the 400Å distance estimated by Fourier inversion of the experimental scattering curve. This clearly shows that the structure seems more elongated in solution providing that there is no significant aggregation or oligomerization.</p><p>Concerning the ab initio reconstruction approach, since the authors have a crystal structure could they not model a few subsets of extended structures using simple rigid body motions or the models later discussed in Fig8 and assess the quality of the corresponding I(q) fit with programs such as Crysol.</p><p>Figure S3a.</p><p>Small typo in the figure, it should be eight instead of eight and the X–axis unit legend is partially occulted for the scattering angle q2 (Å–2).</p><p>For the Guinier analysis. Fitting a straight line on a scattering curve is usually done indicating the corresponding q.RG range of points (only 8 points here based on what is reported).</p><p>Thus the q.RG range would be going up to ~ 0.017x105=1.8 which is rather generous but not unheard of. I understand this was done with a high–flux in–house instrument (described in Lyngso and Pedersen J. Appl. Cryst. 2021, 54), not on a synchrotron beamline. Could the distance between the sample and detector be specified and also the resulting angular range(s) used to measure in the Guinier (low q) and P(r) regimes (high q), were two curves merged or was it a single I(q) curve used for the Fourier inversion?</p><p>Figure S3b which is also Figure 2c? For the pair–distance distribution function P(r) derived from experimental scattering curves, it is unclear to me if the error bars are included in the graphs. The concentration range seems quite low to obtain a scattering curve with a good s/n ratio in the large q, high–resolution regime.</p><p>There is also a typo. MW should be 286 kDa instead of mg/ml</p><p>I agree overall with the conclusions of the SAXS section despite an issue with the role of pH and the buffer conditions used here. Besides the few errors that need to be corrected in the figures and some experimental details that could be added in the methods section.</p><p>Page 6. &quot;collectively, it can be concluded that a closed structure…&quot;</p><p>Would there be a way to illustrate this then? Using a sequence co–conservation projection coloring projected on the two surfaces (N/C) involved.</p><p>The PH domain of TgGAC binds to membranes enriched in PA through two basic patches as shown by nice MD simulations (Figures3 and S3) and NMR studies using also the corresponding PfGAC PH domain using elegant (at least to me) relaxation methods to map and somehow quantify interactions between PH domain and either nanodiscs or LUVs which they should define as large unilamellar vesicles somewhere in their manuscript although they also assimilate them to liposomes (Figures4, S4 and S5).</p><p>I would suggest the authors state the sequence conservation (similarity or identity) % based on PH structure–guided sequence alignments for Pf and Tg. Sequence conservation is mentioned in the introduction but not 'quantified' explicitly, as a matter of fact, the information would be useful for the full–length structure. This brings back my comments about my surface conservation analysis for Apicomplexa.</p><p>While Pf is obviously also of 'interest' (maybe more so than Tg) and it emphasizes conservation of the process throughout the phylum Apicomplexa, is there a practical/technical reason to jump between Tg and Pf systems for the PH–lipid interaction studies by NMR? It sometimes gets a bit confusing to jump back and forth.</p><p>The mapping of the PA binding site on the PH domain is well described and is validated by site–directed mutagenesis on isolated TgGAC–PH domain but also on full–length TgGAC (Figure 5). Although the liposome binding assay is a simple centrifugation assay not a classical flotation assay with gradient centrifugation separation in sucrose, the results are rigorously presented and support the conclusion about the role played by the PH domain during GAC preferential binding to PA–enriched membranes</p><p>Page 9. The title 'Targeted mutations in GAC PH domain are not fitness conferring in vivo' confuses me. Is conferring truly what the authors intended? I would think they meant targeted mutations do NOT affect fitness or virulence. Am I missing something?</p><p>The next two sections of the manuscript (but not the discussion) lack clarity and require some substantial rewriting/detailing to help the reader follow the intellectual thread developed by the Authors.</p><p>H/D exchange analysis and Figure 7 as a whole</p><p>While panels b and c are clear and show some endogenous interaction between TgGAC and endogenous parasitic actin. The rest of the section associated with Figure 7 needs some serious rewriting and explaining. What are GAC N70 and GAC N100? Despite figure S3 I genuinely do not understand.</p><p>I have absolutely no clue as to what I am looking at in Figures 7d and 7e and furthermore, panel 7e is not captioned either so please clarify this (at least to me) in the figure and the main text of the manuscript.</p><p>Also in Fig7 panel a. Something seems wrong or misleading between the helical cartoon model on the left and the schematic on the right. Why is there magenta on the top of the schematic? Is that the linker, if so it should be colored differently and in a thinner line, then the linear protein schematic below should be edited accordingly.</p><p>Page 10/11. Modelling of TgGAC binding to MIC2.</p><p>I would suggest precision (again) about what MIC2 is, some kind of adhesin. It is only briefly mentioned once in the introduction on page 3, but that is about it. Please help us (re)connect some dots there. Not everyone is an addict to glideosome machineries.</p><p>Figure 8 should be annotated more rigorously. In the legend.</p><p>8a left side should be captioned a bit more carefully and rigorously GAC ARII–ARIII it seems, the rest is omitted. MIC2 tail (red I guess).</p><p>The description becomes increasingly unclear and we are left trying to guess what we are looking at. Page 11.</p><p>De facto these are not superimpositions. Correct me if wrong.</p><p>You have a model (green GAC arch 39–42 + red MIC2 ?) of your complex (left panel) and shown next to them in the same relative orientation as the corresponding other structurally/functionally related complexes p120, catenin, etc to emphasize peptide/ARM repeats interactions.

(2021) one notices that crystals were grown at pH=5 using a protein initially purified at pH=8.0.</p><p>There is a piece of data that could be shown by the Authors in that study. It would be the superimposed SEC profiles of purified TgGAC at pH 8 and pH 5 under a diluted regime maybe (but with some salt around) see my comment below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a supplementary figure of the SEC profiles (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) which show that as expected TgGAC behaves significantly larger at pH 5 than pH 8, and salt does not influence the elution volume (lines 158-160).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors show SAXS profiles at different pHs in a diluted regime (Figure 2b), how is pH change performed? They notice that oligomerization seems the most pronounced at pH5 (the crystallization pH) but we will also make the observation that the SAXS buffer has virtually no salt (25 mM Tris) and these are not ideal conditions to limit intermolecular interactions and maybe aggregation independently of molecular compaction (closing of the structure as in the crystal conformation).</p></disp-quote><p>The pH was adjusted from pH 8.0 to the desired pH by addition of the appropriate amount of 1 M HCl, which gives rise to a maximum salt concentration of 30 mM at pH 4.0. This is now added to the Materials and methods section. As the increase in ionic strength increases the screening of intermolecular interactions, lowering the pH should decrease rather than increase the tendency towards oligomerization for GAC. We presume the oligomerization observed at lower pH must stem from conformation changes rather than this small difference in ionic strength. We present our SEC profiles at high/low pH and salt concentration and demonstrate and no beneficial effect of salt on elution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The P(r) compared are different. The solution curve was obtained at pH 8 but the calculated curve was done on a structure obtained at pH 5. The N/C interface being so charged it would not be surprising that it is sensitive to pH changes. In this case, why not measure and calculate the experimental P(r) function at pH5 would it fit (or not, like what is observed in pH 8) the crystal structure?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the p(r) functions are from, respectively, a structure at pH 5.0 and solution data at pH 8.0. Ideally, we would like to compare the structures at pH 5.0 in solution with the crystal structure, but as GAC oligomerises/aggregates at pH 5.0, we are not able to determine an overall size accurately. The absence of aggregation and the ability to determine overall size is a prerequisite for calculating the p(r) as one needs to estimate the D<sub>max</sub>. We have now stressed this point in the manuscript to make it clearer. We compare SAXS data at two pH values to demonstrate the presence of a much larger (aggregated) structure at a higher pH relative to the crystal structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The SAXS study of Jacot et al. (2016) mentions a range of concentrations from 1.2 to 4.6 mg/ml for the equivalent construct (FL–TgGAC) on a wider angular range it seems compared to what is described here.</p></disp-quote><p>We measure at relatively low concentration (1.3 mg/mL), as we want to go as low as possible to avoid any affect from intermolecular interactions that could promote aggregation. On the other hand, we cannot go significantly lower as the statistics on the data will then be considerable worse, so 1.3 mg/mL turned out to be the best compromise. We have added a comment about this in the Results section “GAC adopts multiple extended conformations in solution”. SAXS data in Jacot et al. (2016) are shown as a function of <italic>s</italic> (equivalent to <italic>q</italic>) on a linear scale, where we show data on a logarithmic s/q scale. We believe a logarithmic scale is more suitable as it more clearly shows the data at low <italic>q</italic>, where one would see effects from intermolecular interactions. On a linear s/q scale, this region is very small, and these important effects can be more difficult to detect. As data are on either a logarithmic or linear scale, it is not straightforward to compare the scales. Jacot et al. (2016) do not give a <italic>q</italic> range in the article, but we have copied the figure and estimated the position of the first and last point, which give a <italic>q</italic> range of around 0.012 – 0.43 Å<sup>-1</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> for estimation of first and last point). Apparently, the two curves at the top have a larger range, however, this is in fact extrapolated model fit curves and not data. In our data we have a <italic>q</italic> range of 0.0098 – 0.42 Å<sup>-1</sup> (which is also mentioned in the Materials and methods section now), so the range is similar to Jacot et al. (2016).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86049-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors present P(r) analysis, in addition to the large difference in RG it would be meaningful to emphasize in the figures the maximum intramolecular distance (Dmax) calculated with the X–ray structure (~145 Å from what I see in Figure S3b/S2c) to the 400Å distance estimated by Fourier inversion of the experimental scattering curve.

There is no salt present, even under the relatively low protein concentration described here it is reasonable to think that they could be non–specific interactions between molecules.</p><p>I would temper the interpretation of the data at pH 5 with that so–called oligomerization that could be aggregation in disguise.</p></disp-quote><p>The buffer choice came out of numerous screens for GAC stability, homogeneous behaviour in size exclusion chromatography, reproducibility in crystallisation and we concluded that high pH, low or no salt and reducing agent is where GAC behaved best. Agreed the low pH behaviour this could be an in vitro artifact of aggregation, so the discussion has been toned down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are several areas in which the manuscript could be improved.</p><p>– A schematic diagram placing the GAC in the context of the parasite would be a valuable addition to figure 1, as would including the sequence diagram from Figure 7a in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More information is required to judge the reproducibility of binding data in the relevant figure panels. How many times were binding experiments repeated? Do repeats represent technical repeats with the same protein preparation or different preparations? Do error bars represent SEM? Please add this information to relevant figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>These are now included in caption and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure S1. It is difficult to judge concordance between experimental NOE data and NOE count from the AlphaFold model. Can a chart of experimental NOEs be shown for comparison? Panel E requires colour key.</p></disp-quote><p>We took the opportunity to calculate an NMR structure from our available NOESY data and made a comparison with the Alphafold model. Figure S1 has been modified to show the calculated NMR ensemble and illustrate the comparison (paragraph from line 91)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Sequence conservation of the N/C interface is mentioned in the text several times, but it would be useful to show this plotted on the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a surface representation of the interface with Consurf conservation scoring in Figure 2b and a full sequence alignment in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The AlphaFold prediction of the interface between GAC and MIC2 is interesting but not convincing in its current form. A PAE plot is required to judge the confidence of the GAC–MIC2 interface. pLDDT scores (ideally plotted on the structure) are required to judge confidence in the conformation of the MIC2 peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>The confidence scores are reasonable for the MIC2 peptide however due to it speculative nature we now removed Figure 8 as suggested, but keep the basic comparison of the C-terminal ARM arch of GAC with the catenins and display this in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does AlphaFold predict TgGAC to be fully closed, as in crystal structure, or partially separated, as in the PfGAC prediction?</p></disp-quote><p>We have calculated an Alphafold model for TgGAC and like PfGAC the N/C interface is also partially separated. This is now shown together in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– p9. The section titled &quot;Targeted mutations in GAC PH domain are not fitness conferring in vivo&quot; is confusing. Key lipid–binding residues in the GAC PH domain are not essential for parasite invasion.</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been reworded as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8b, middle panel. The basis for how the GAC is placed with respect to actin is unclear – it would seem that there are many other ways it could be placed that are equally compatible with the data.</p></disp-quote><p>See above but the figure has removed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
