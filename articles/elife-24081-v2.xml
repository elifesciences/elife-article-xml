matched to the extent of venous filling. At the cellular level, heart muscle cells generate higher force when stretched, but despite intense efforts the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. We applied a fluorescence-based method, which reports structural changes separately in the thick and thin filaments of rat cardiac muscle, to elucidate that mechanism. The distinct structural changes of troponin C in the thin filaments and myosin regulatory light chain in the thick filaments allowed us to identify two aspects of the Frank-Starling relation. Our results show that the enhanced force observed when heart muscle cells are maximally activated by calcium is due to a change in <italic>thick</italic> filament structure, but the increase in calcium sensitivity at lower calcium levels is due to a change in <italic>thin</italic> filament structure.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24081.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24081.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24081.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart needs to pump out the same volume of blood that enters it. This is not as simple as it sounds, as changes in heart rate – for example, in response to exercise – alter how hard the heart must pump.</p><p>When blood flows into the heart it stretches the heart muscle, which consists of units called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres contain two types of protein filament, known as thick filaments and thin filaments. When a heartbeat is triggered by calcium ions flowing into the heart muscle cells, the thick filaments slide over the thin filaments. This causes the heart muscle cell to contract.</p><p>The Frank–Starling mechanism helps to regulate the contraction of the heart. This mechanism has two aspects. Firstly, as the sarcomere lengthens, its protein filaments are able to contract with more force for a given high level of calcium ions. Secondly, the lengthening of the sarcomere makes the filaments more sensitive to calcium ions, which again causes the heart to contract more forcefully. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects were not clear.</p><p>Zhang et al. have now studied rat heart muscle cells using a new fluorescence-based method that can detect structural changes in the thick and thin filaments. The results show that the increased force that is generated when sarcomeres are stretched can be accounted for by changes in the structure of the thick filament. In contrast, the increase in calcium sensitivity that occurs as the sarcomere lengthens is largely due to structural alterations in the thin filament. These two processes can be controlled independently, but work together in the Frank–Starling mechanism.</p><p>Now that we better understand the molecular basis of the Frank–Starling mechanism, further work could investigate new strategies for designing and testing treatments for heart disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24081.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24081.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cardiac muscle regulation</kwd><kwd>fluorescence polarization</kwd><kwd>length-dependent activation</kwd><kwd>thin filament</kwd><kwd>thick filament</kwd><kwd>Frank-Starling law of the heart</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/15/1/31071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yin-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/09/001/26329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yin-Biao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Frank–Starling law of the heart and its underlying mechanism of length-dependent activation involve distinctive structural changes in both the thin and thick filaments of cardiac muscle cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Frank-Starling law of the heart describes the relationship between cardiac stroke volume and end-diastolic volume and operates on a beat-to-beat basis. At the cellular level, the Frank-Starling relationship implies that increasing cardiac sarcomere length results in enhanced performance of cardiac muscle cells during the subsequent contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Kentish, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">de Tombe et al., 2010</xref>). This myofilament length-dependent activation (LDA) is two-fold: with an increase in sarcomere length (SL), there are increases in (1) the maximum force developed by the myofilaments at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> and (2) their sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Impaired LDA and hence a defective Frank–Starling relationship may also contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwinger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sequeira et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although the Frank-Starling law of the heart is one of its fundamental properties and has been investigated for over a century, the detailed molecular mechanism for the LDA in heart muscle remains elusive. Over the last forty years, the main focus has been on the myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity component of LDA.</p><p>Contraction of cardiac muscle is driven by an interaction between myosin and actin that is controlled by the transient binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to troponin in the actin-containing thin filament on a beat-to-beat basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tobacman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi and Solaro, 2005</xref>). An increase in SL leads to a decreased inter-filament spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Irving et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) and it has been suggested that this leads directly to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McDonald and Moss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs and Smith, 2001</xref>). However, when osmotic compression of inter-filament spacing matches that induced by SL, the myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is only affected by SL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konhilas et al., 2002</xref>), indicating that the reduction of inter-filament spacing is unlikely to mediate LDA.</p><p>Titin-based passive tension in the heart muscle cells seems to play an important role in LDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cazorla et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Such a mechanism might involve a strain sensor and a signal transduction pathway that conveys the strain signal to the contractile machinery. A single titin molecule runs from the Z-disc to the M-line in the A-band contributing to muscle assembly and passive tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Labeit and Kolmerer, 1995</xref>). The fact that titin is largely responsible for the length-dependent passive tension of cardiac muscle and also possesses both actin and myosin binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granzier and Labeit, 2004</xref>), makes it a candidate for the link between SL and force generating apparatus. Small-angle X-ray diffraction studies suggest that length-dependent changes in the myosin head orientation in diastole may be a factor in LDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farman et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, a recent X-ray study shows that length-dependent structural changes are also observed in the thin filament in diastole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Mou et al., 2016</xref>), supporting the notion that thin filament activation may also play an important role in LDA. The length-dependent changes in the structure of both thick and thin filaments are related to the titin strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Mou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To identify the molecular mechanism(s) underlying LDA, we measured the structural changes in the thin and thick filaments of intact sarcomeres in heart muscle induced by SL changes using bifunctional rhodamine (BR) probes on the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) and myosin regulatory light chain (cRLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampourakis et al., 2014</xref>). These probes allowed us to differentiate the structural changes in both types of filament caused by calcium activation, force-generating myosin heads and SL changes in the native environment of the cardiac sarcomere. The results presented here show that LDA is accompanied by distinctive structural changes in both the thin and thick filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increase of maximum active force at longer SL is not associated with increased thin filament activation</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force development was determined in demembranated ventricular trabeculae from rat heart.

The IT arm of troponin, a rigid domain containing the C-terminal lobe of TnC and a coiled-coil formed by α-helices from troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT), anchors the troponin complex to the thin filament. To determine whether the changes in SL-dependence of force are accompanied by structural changes in the thin filaments of cardiac muscle cells, we measured the orientation of the regulatory head and IT arm of troponin. Cardiac troponin C with bifunctional rhodamine (BR) cross-linking residues 55 and 62 along the C helix (BR-cTnC-C) in the regulatory head or 95 and 102 along the E helix (BR-cTnC-E) in the IT arm of troponin was incorporated into demembranated trabeculae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2009</xref>).

These two observations together suggested that the activation of the thin filament at maximum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (pCa 4.5) was not changed by increasing SL. The increased &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; at longer SL at all [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may be related to the fact that ventricular trabeculae are made up of short branched cardiac muscle cells in which the myofibrils are not perfectly parallel.

These results suggest that the thin filament may already be fully activated at pCa 4.5 in control conditions at short SL, and that the length-dependent increase in maximum active force is determined by processes downstream of thin filament activation in the signalling pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Length-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of cTnC structural changes is independent of the presence of force-generating myosin heads</title><p>It is generally thought that force-generating myosin heads sensitise the thin filament to calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2009</xref>), and this led to the idea that LDA might be a consequence of the higher force or number of myosin heads attached to actin at longer SL. We tested the role of force-generating myosin heads in the length-dependent structural changes of cTnC by inhibiting force generation using blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Straight et al., 2003</xref>). In the presence of 25 μM blebbistatin, the active force was reduced to 1.5% ± 0.4% (n = 12) of the control value. It should be noted that blebbistatin may inhibit active force generation by stabilising the OFF structure of the myosin thick filament in which the myosin heads are folded back on the surface of the thick filaments and unavailable for interacting with actin in the thin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2009</xref>).

We therefore tested the possibility that it might be due to a different structural or regulatory state of the thick filament using a probe on the RLC region of the myosin motors. The orientation of this probe has previously been shown to be sensitive to both the change in orientation of the myosin heads associated with force generation per se and to interventions like RLC phosphorylation that alter the regulatory or structural state of the thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampourakis et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2016</xref>).

The results presented above show that changes in muscle length produce distinct structural changes in the thin and thick filaments of heart muscle. Although the present results were obtained from steady state measurements, they establish a molecular hypothesis that can be tested in future dynamic studies of LDA on the timescale of the heartbeat.</p><p>It has been shown previously that, due to the flexibility of the central linker between the D- and E-helices in cTnC, the conformation of the N-terminal domain of cTnC (NcTnC), the regulatory head of troponin, moves dynamically during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sevrieva et al., 2014</xref>). Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to NcTnC and its subsequent interaction with the switch region of cTnI initiate the removal of cTnI from its actin binding site by bending NcTnC towards the C-terminal domain of cTnC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takeda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sevrieva et al., 2014</xref>). Considering that the opening of NcTnC due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and interaction with cTnI switch region is relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 1999</xref>), the C helix probe is likely to be much more sensitive to NcTnC re-orientation than to opening. Thus, the present results do not exclude the possibility that SL affects the opening of the NcTnC during cardiac muscle activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The E-helix probe (BR-cTnC-E) in the IT arm of troponin, on the other hand, is less likely to involve such multi-domain conformational changes since the IT arm acts as a scaffold holding NcTnC and the actin binding regions of cTnI in a fixed orientation on the thin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sevrieva et al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Length-dependent structural changes in troponin are distinct from those induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation or force generating myosin heads</title><p>Increasing SL induced a change in the orientation of both cTnC probes in the direction associated with lower activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). In particular, the SL-dependent change in the orientation of the E helix probe in the IT arm of troponin occurred over the whole range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], independent of the presence of force generating myosin heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These results show that the changes in troponin structure induced by increased SL are distinct from those induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation or force generation.</p><p>A recent study by time-resolved small-angle X-ray diffraction also showed that increasing SL induces changes in troponin conformation in relaxed cardiac muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Mou et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, FRET measurements showed that the conformation of the switch region of cTnI relative to cTnC is also sensitive to SL in relaxed cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2016</xref>). These SL-dependent changes in troponin structure could be related to the increased passive force at long SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In cardiac muscle cells, the passive force is attributed to the giant protein titin, which runs from the Z-disc to the M-line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Labeit and Kolmerer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Granzier and Labeit, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2012</xref>). Titin-based passive force plays an important role in LDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cazorla et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukuda et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2003</xref>). The length-dependent passive force is reduced in cardiac muscle from transgenic rats that express a giant splice isoform of titin, and the length-dependent change in the X-ray troponin reflection is also reduced in these muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Mou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The combination of the present results with those of the X-ray and FRET studies mentioned above suggests that length-dependent changes in the structure of the thin filament of cardiac muscle can be one of the mechanisms underlying LDA, and hence the Frank-Starling law of the heart.</p><p>As discussed above, the increase in maximum active force in LDA is likely to be determined by processes downstream of thin filament activation in the signalling pathway. Our previous study described the SL-induced structural changes in the myosin filament over the whole range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kampourakis et al., 2016</xref>). However, it made no direct comparison of &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; for the BSR-cRLC-BC probe at different SLs as the primary focus of that work was on the effects of cRLC phosphorylation. The present results have shown that &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; for the BSR-cRLC-BC probe increased during Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation and increased even further when SL was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that the length-dependent increase of isometric force in cardiac muscle is due to the change in the number of force-generating myosin heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caremani et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these results show that the higher active force at longer SL is associated with a more ON state of the thick filament.</p><p>X-ray measurements on resting cardiac muscle showed a close correlation between the orientation of myosin heads before activation and enhanced force generation as SL increases, further supporting the idea of a direct effect of SL on thick filament structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farman et al., 2011</xref>). Again, titin is implicated in the length-dependent structural changes in the thick filament. In resting cardiac muscles from rats that express the mutant titin described above, the SL-dependent changes in the intensities of the myosin-based X-ray reflections were greatly reduced, suggesting that titin-based passive force mediates the effect on thick filament structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Mou et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dual filament regulation of length-dependent activation in cardiac muscle</title><p>It has long been established that an increase in SL in cardiac muscle results in increases in both the myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and the maximum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kentish et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobesh et al., 2002</xref>).

The present results provided evidence that two distinct pathways are involved in LDA. Increasing SL exerts a direct effect on the structure of troponin in the thin filament, which is the main contributor to the length-dependent increase of myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in LDA. A structural change of myosin in thick filament is responsible for the increase of maximal force generation in LDA.</p><p>It is well known that cTnI plays an important role in the LDA of cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arteaga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konhilas et al., 2003</xref>). It has also been shown that phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 at its cardiac-specific N-terminal region enhances the length-dependent increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity while having no effect on the length-dependent increase in maximum force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wijnker et al., 2014</xref>). This is in support of our conclusion that the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in LDA is mediated through a change in thin filament structure. The thin filament mediated length-dependent change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity may play an important role in the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by missense mutations in the sarcomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sequeira et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The LDA occurs immediately after a length change and independently of the increase in the intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen and Kurihara, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mateja and de Tombe, 2012</xref>). Recent evidence has suggested that the passive force originated by titin plays a critical role in the transduction of the length signal to contractile apparatus in cardiac LDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukuda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Methawasin et al., 2014</xref>). Increasing SL increases the passive force of cardiac muscle by stretching the titin that links the thick filament to the Z-disk and also relays its mechanical strain to the thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linke, 2008</xref>). A recent X-ray study on skeletal muscle showed a connection between increased thick filament stress and its transition to ON state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linari et al., 2015</xref>). This mechano-sensing mechanism may also exist in cardiac muscle as the X-ray measurement of cardiac muscle has indicated a structural rearrangement within the thick filament associated with titin strain and LDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait-Mou et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The results presented here, together with the previous studies described above, also demonstrated that increasing SL in cardiac muscle changes the structure of troponin in the thin filament. This length-dependent change in troponin structure is correlated with the titin strain and is present in the absence of active force-generating myosin heads. It is not known how either titin strain or the ON state of the thick filament can be transmitted to the thin filament, although MyBP-C may be involved in this interfilament signal transmission. MyBP-C is localised to the central region of each half-thick filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luther et al., 2011</xref>). It is bound to the thick filament via its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flashman et al., 2004</xref>) and its N-terminal region can activate the thin filament to trigger force generation in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampourakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mun et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of MyBP-C, while the length-dependent increase in the maximum force generation is preserved, the length-dependent increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity is blunted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mamidi et al., 2014</xref>). cMyBP-C is one of the key components in modulating cardiac contractility in a manner that depends on its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kunst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfuhl and Gautel, 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of MyBP-C, which inhibits the interaction of its N-terminal region with the thin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaffer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampourakis et al., 2014</xref>), has been shown to modulate LDA in cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mamidi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, MyBP-C is a strong candidate for transmitting the signal of titin strain generated by SL change from the thick to the thin filament.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were in accordance with Schedule 1 of the UK Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Adult Wistar rats (200–250 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The hearts were excised and rinsed free of blood with Krebs-Henseleit solution (K3753, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) oxygenated with a carbogen mixture of 95% O2% and 5% CO2. Suitable trabeculae (free running, unbranched, diameter &lt;250 µm) were dissected from the right ventricle in Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 25 mM 2,3-butanedione-monoxime, permeabilised in relaxing solution (see below) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and stored in relaxing solution for experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Preparation of labelled cTnCs and cRLC</title><p>Double cysteine mutants E55C/D62C and E95C/R102C of human cTnC were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

The fraction of cTnC replaced by BR-TnC was about 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sevrieva et al., 2014</xref>). BSR-cRLCs were exchanged into demembranated trabeculae by extraction in CDTA-rigor solution (mM: 5 CDTA, 50 KCl, 40 Tris-HCl pH 8.4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) for 30 min followed by reconstitution with 40 mM BSR-cRLC in relaxing solution for 1 hr, replacing 30–50% of the endogenous cRLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampourakis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Following exchange of cTnC or cRLC, the trabeculae were mounted horizontally via aluminum T-clips between a force transducer (SI-KG7, World Precision Instruments) and a fixed hook in a 60 μl trough containing relaxing solution.

Ionic strength was adjusted to 200 mM with potassium propionate; pH was 7.1 at 20°C. The concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> was calculated using the program WinMAXC V2.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html">http://www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html</ext-link>). The calculated free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], expressed as pCa (i.e., −log[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]), was in the range 1 nM (pCa 9) to 32 µM (pCa 4.5). In pre-activating solution, [EGTA] was 0.2 mM and no calcium was added.

A central 0.5 mm segment of a trabecula exchanged with BR-cTnC was briefly illuminated from below with 532 nm light polarised either parallel or perpendicular to the trabecular axis. BR fluorescence at 610 nm was collected in line with the illuminating beam that was propagating perpendicular to the trabecular axis. The emitted fluorescence was then separated into parallel and perpendicular components. Together with the order parameter &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2d</sub>&gt; that describes the amplitude of rapid (sub-nanosecond) probe motion and has been measured in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2009</xref>), two independent orientation order parameters were calculated from these measured intensities: &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; and &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>4</sub>&gt;, describing the distribution of angles between BR fluorescence dipole and trabecular axis averaged over slower timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dale et al., 1999</xref>). &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; would be +1 if every BR dipole were parallel to the trabecular axis, and −0.5 if they were all perpendicular. &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>4</sub>&gt; provides higher resolution angular information, and orientational disorder decreases the absolute values of both &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; and &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>4</sub>&gt;. The detailed results are presented here only for &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt;, which can be measured with greater signal-to-noise ratio. If there are multiple populations of BR dipoles with distinct orientations, the observed &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; is linearly related to the fraction of dipoles in each population.</p><p>Each trabecular activation was preceded by a 1 min incubation in pre-activating solution. Isometric force and fluorescence intensities were measured after steady-state force had been established in each activation. Maximum force was recorded before and after each series of activations at sub-maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. If the maximum force decreased by &gt;15%, the trabecula was discarded. The experiment was completed when full Ca<sup>2+</sup>-force relationships at both short and long SLs were obtained from the same trabecula. The dependence of force and &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt; on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was fitted to data from individual trabeculae using nonlinear least-squares regression to the Hill equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where pCa<sub>50</sub> is the pCa corresponding to half-maximal change in either force or &lt;<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub>&gt;, and <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> is the Hill coefficient.</p><p>The steepness of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-force relationships in the present study (<italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> = ~4, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) was less than that in a study where SL was kept constant during the contraction by adjusting overall muscle length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobesh et al., 2002</xref>). This is likely due to the end-compliance of trabecular preparations that allows SL shortening during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">ter Keurs et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kentish et al., 1986</xref>). As the trabecula generates more force at higher concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the central sarcomeres shorten more. Consequently, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-force relationship shifts to the right at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and becomes less steep. Therefore, both pCa<sub>50</sub> and <italic>n</italic><sub>H</sub> of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-force relationship at a given SL were likely to be underestimated in fixed end conditions as in the present study. To minimise the impact of SL shortening during activation on the interpretation, only the data from experiments in which full Ca<sup>2+</sup>-force relationships at both short and long SLs were obtained from the same trabecula were fit to the Hill equation. In addition, paired-comparisons were used throughout the present study. Thus, the differential shortening of the fixed-end contractions at the different lengths would not affect the interpretation of the results. All values are given as mean ± standard error except where noted, with <italic>n</italic> representing the number of trabeculae.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr John Corrie for the bifunctional rhodamine.

At the cellular level, the Frank-Starling relationship implies that increasing cardiac sarcomere length results in enhanced performance of cardiac muscle cells during the subsequent contraction. Although the Frank-Starling law of the heart is one of its fundamental properties, the detailed molecular mechanism for this length-dependent activation (LDA) in heart muscle is still not understood. The work described here uses fluorescence-based methods to analyze the changes that occur in orientation of cardiac TnC on the thin filament and the regulatory light chain of the myosin heads, the molecular motor domains of myosin, as the muscle is stretched, and provides evidence that the primary reason for increased force production upon stretch is activation of myosin heads in the thick filaments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results clearly show that LDA is accompanied by distinctive structural changes in both the thin and thick filaments. The authors conclude from those structural changes that they reflect the changes in calcium sensitivity (TnC structural change) and force production (myosin head orientation changes) associated with LDA. While these are reasonable assumptions, it is not for certain that this is true. Structural changes need not reflect force changes. Thus, the authors need to point out that they are making a jump in their interpretation about this connection, and do a better job describing why they think this jump is justified and likely correct. In particular, a non-muscle biologist, not knowing the field, will not understand why a change in myosin head orientation means a likely increase in force production.</p><p>2) The paper needs to be recast to be more accessible to the broader readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.
