<italic>SRY</italic> is the testis-determining gene, remains ambiguous. So far, DMRT1 loss-of-function has been described in two mammalian species and induces different phenotypes: Disorders of Sex Development (46, XY DSD) in men and male infertility in mice. We thus abolished DMRT1 expression by CRISPR/Cas9 in a third species of mammal, the rabbit. First, we observed that gonads from XY <italic>DMRT1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> rabbit fetuses differentiated like ovaries, highlighting that DMRT1 is involved in testis determination. In addition to SRY, DMRT1 is required in the supporting cells to increase the expression of the <italic>SOX9</italic> gene, which heads the testicular genetic cascade. Second, we highlighted another function of DMRT1 in the germline since XX and XY <italic>DMRT1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ovaries did not undergo meiosis and folliculogenesis. XX <italic>DMRT1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> adult females were sterile, showing that DMRT1 is also crucial for female fertility. To conclude, these phenotypes indicate an evolutionary continuum between non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds and non-rodent mammals. Furthermore, our data support the potential involvement of <italic>DMRT1</italic> mutations in different human pathologies, such as 46, XY DSD as well as male and female infertility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals that reproduce sexually have organs called gonads, the ovaries and testes, which produce eggs and sperm. These organs, which are different in males and females, originate from the same cells during the development of the embryo. As a general rule, the chromosomal sex of an embryo, which gets determined at fertilization, leads to the activation and repression of specific genes. This in turn, controls whether the cells that will form the gonads will differentiate to develop testes or ovaries.</p><p>Disruption of the key genes involved in the differentiation of the gonads can lead to fertility problems, and in some cases, it can cause the gonads to develop in the ‘opposite’ direction, resulting in a sex reversal. Identifying these genes is therefore essential to know how to maintain or restore fertility.</p><p><italic>DMRT1 </italic>is a gene that drives the differentiation of gonadal cells into the testicular pathway in several species of animals with backbones, including species of fish, frogs and birds. However, its role in mammals – where testis differentiation is driven by a different gene called <italic>SRY </italic>– is not well understood. Indeed, when <italic>DMRT1 </italic>is disrupted in male humans it leads to disorders of sex development, while disrupting this gene in male mice causes infertility. To obtain more information about the roles of DMRT1 in mammalian species, Dujardin et al. disrupted the gene in a third species of mammal: the rabbit.</p><p>Dujardin et al. observed that chromosomally-male rabbits lacking DMRT1 developed ovaries instead of testes, showing that in rabbits, both SRY and DMRT1 are both required to produce testes. Additionally, this effect is similar to what is seen in humans, suggesting that rabbits may be a better model for human gonadal differentiation than mice are. Additionally, Dujardin et al. were also able to show that in female rabbits, lack of DMRT1 led to infertility, an effect that had not been previously described in other species.</p><p>The results of Dujardin et al. may lead to better models for gonadal development in humans, involving DMRT1 in the differentiation of testes. Interestingly, they also suggest the possibility that mutations in this gene may be responsible for some cases of infertility in women. Overall, these findings indicate that <italic>DMRT1 </italic>is a key fertility gene.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rabbit</kwd><kwd>sex determination</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>gonads</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE14-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pailhoux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Dujardin</surname><given-names>Emilie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARDIGERM: ANR-20-CE14-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pailhoux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100022077</institution-id><institution>INRAE, France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dujardin</surname><given-names>Emilie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The absence of DMRT1 induces a male-to-female sex reversal in XY rabbits and complete infertility in both sexes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DMRT1 (Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription factor 1) belongs to the highly conserved family of DM domain proteins, which exhibits a zinc finger DNA-binding motif that was initially identified in <italic>Drosophilia</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erdman and Burtis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raymond et al., 1998</xref>). Some of its orthologs have been described as Testis-Determining Factor (TDF) in vertebrate species such as medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>), xenope (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshimoto et al., 2010</xref>), or chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). In the last, the Z chromosome carries the <italic>DMRT1</italic> gene. In ZZ males, two copies of the <italic>DMRT1</italic> gene are required to induce testis determination. In ZW females and ZZ chickens harboring a non-functional copy, gonads differentiate as ovaries showing that sex determination is based on DMRT1 dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ioannidis et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, where the sex-determining system is XX/XY, the TDF is the <italic>SRY</italic> gene (Sex-determining Region of the Y chromosome) carried by the Y chromosome. Based on the mouse species, DMRT1 does not appear to have retained a crucial function in testis determination since targeted deletion of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> only affects post-natal testis function. In fact, DMRT1 has roles in both germ cells and supporting cells in the testis, and <italic>Dmrt1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> males showed spermatogenesis failure with spermatogonia that did not undergo meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matson et al., 2010</xref>). However, specific knock-out of <italic>Dmrt1</italic> in adult Sertoli cells led to their transdifferentiation into granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matson et al., 2011</xref>). Although DMRT1 is not required for testis determination in mice, it retained part of its function in adulthood when it is necessary to maintain Sertoli cell identity. In ovarian differentiation, FOXL2 (Forkhead family box L2) showed a similar function discrepancy between mice and goats as DMRT1 in the testis pathway. In the mouse, <italic>Foxl2</italic> is expressed in female-supporting cells early in development but does not appear necessary for fetal ovary differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Uda et al., 2004</xref>). On the contrary, it is required in adult granulosa cells to maintain female-supporting cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ottolenghi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uhlenhaut et al., 2009</xref>). In other mammalian species, such as goats, <italic>FOXL2</italic> was shown to be crucial for ovarian determination. Indeed, naturally observed in the PIS (Polled Intersex Syndrome) mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pailhoux et al., 2001</xref>) or experimentally induced by genome editing in goats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boulanger et al., 2014</xref>), FOXL2 loss-of-function led to female-to-male sex reversal with the early development of XX testes. Following <italic>FOXL2</italic> absence of expression in the XX mutant gonads (XX PIS<sup>−/−</sup> or XX <italic>FOXL2</italic><sup>−/−</sup>), <italic>DMRT1</italic> was up-regulated within days before increased <italic>SOX9</italic> expression, which then directs the differentiation of Sertoli cells and the formation of testicular cords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elzaiat et al., 2014</xref>). These observations in the goat suggested that DMRT1 could retain function in SOX9 activation and, thus, in testis determination in several mammals. In humans, a few mutations affecting <italic>DMRT1</italic> have been described in patients presenting 46, XY DSD (Disorders of Sex Development) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ledig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mello et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, a heterozygous <italic>de novo</italic> point mutation in the <italic>DMRT1</italic> gene has been identified in a 46, XY individual with complete gonadal dysgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that DMRT1 and SRY may be involved in testicular determination.</p><p>To clarify DMRT1 functions in non-rodent mammals, we have chosen the rabbit model, where we generated a DMRT1 mutant line thanks to the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Firstly, we characterized the DMRT1 expression in control gonads, showing that both XY and XX fetal gonads were expressing <italic>DMRT1</italic> before their sexual differentiation. In XY fetuses, <italic>DMRT1</italic> and <italic>SRY</italic> presented partially overlapping territory, and somatic cells expressing both of them harbored SOX9 expression and differentiated into Sertoli cells. Secondly, thanks to our CRISPR/Cas9 genetically modified rabbit model, we demonstrated that DMRT1 was required for testis differentiation since XY <italic>DMRT1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> rabbits showed early male-to-female sex reversal with differentiating ovaries and complete female genitalia. However, germ cells failed to undergo meiosis, and follicles did not form in XY and XX <italic>DMRT1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutant ovaries, leading to female infertility. Finally, we demonstrated that DMRT1 was a testis-determining factor in mammals and that it was also required for female fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>DMRT1</italic> is expressed in genital crests of both sexes and just after <italic>SRY</italic> in XY developing testes</title><p><italic>DMRT1</italic> expression pattern has already been reported by molecular analysis in the rabbit species from 14 d<italic>pc</italic> to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniel-Carlier et al., 2013</xref>).

However, the most conserved sex-differentiating factor throughout evolution is DMRT1. Indeed, it has been maintained at the head of the sex determination cascade in reptiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2017</xref>), fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>), and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, its functions could have been reduced in mammals since testis differentiates in the absence of DMRT1 (<italic>Dmrt1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raymond et al., 2000</xref>). Our results highlight an evolutionary continuum of this gene in testis determination from birds to rabbits and non-rodent mammals in general. Interestingly, even <italic>DMRT1</italic> dosage sensibility has been conserved between chicken and rabbits since heterozygous XY <italic>DMRT1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> male rabbits present secondary infertility with an arrest of spermatogenesis around 2 years of age (data not shown).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>DMRT1 position in the rabbit sex-determining cascade</title><p>As the early stages of gonadal differentiation in rabbits were not fully characterized, we first determined the expressional profiles of the major sex-determining genes. We observed that DMRT1 expression started at 12 d<italic>pc</italic>, at the early formation of genital crests, and it was first expressed in the somatic lineage of both sexes, as in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raymond et al., 1999</xref>) or in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022</xref>).

In mice, the <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression starts at E10.5 in both somatic and germinal compartments. However, we showed that germline expression was shifted by 6–8 days compared to the somatic compartment in the rabbit male and female gonads, respectively. These differences are strongly related to the timing of gonadal development in rabbits – which is longer than in mice – and therefore allows better visualization of the different processes. These sequential DMRT1 up-regulations according to cell type and sex also argue in favor of distinct <italic>DMRT1</italic> promoters as already described in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lei et al., 2009</xref>).

In rabbits, the CRISPR-Cas9 technology allowed us to generate a null mutation of the <italic>DMRT1</italic> gene, leading to an absence of detectable protein at homozygosity. Thanks to this model, we could demonstrate that DMRT1 kept its leadership in sex determination also in mammals, where SRY stays the ‘switch-on factor’ for testis determination, as previously demonstrated in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Very early in fetal life, XY fetuses expressing SRY but lacking DMRT1 (<italic>DMRT1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) presented a male-to-female sex reversal. Although SRY expression was maintained in XY homozygous mutant gonads, the activation of <italic>SOX9</italic> expression was weak in the absence of DMRT1. Accordingly, a few cells expressing SOX9 protein were detectable, but SOX9 target genes expression were not activated in XY <italic>DMRT1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> gonads. Thus, DMRT1 seems to be required for SRY action on its targets (i.e., <italic>SOX9</italic> gene activation) but also for SOX9 functions in the early fetal gonad. Interestingly, a recent study proposed that DMRT1 can act as a SOX9 pioneer factor in the post-natal testis for Sertoli cell identity maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindeman et al., 2021</xref>). In rabbits, DMRT1 is required for SOX9 and SRY functions, and we hypothesize that DMRT1 might be a pioneer factor for both. In the differentiating genital crest, DMRT1 would be required to increase chromatin accessibility on specific sex-related regions, allowing SRY to bind and activate its targets and particularly the expression of <italic>SOX9</italic>. The crucial region for SRY binding was identified in mice more than 500 kb upstream of the <italic>Sox9</italic> transcription start site and named Enhancer 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonen et al., 2018</xref>). Conservation studies identified the homolog of Enhancer 13 in many mammalian species, including humans, cows, and rabbits, and DMRT1 consensus sites were predicted in all mammals examined except mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonen et al., 2018</xref>). In non-rodent mammals, DMRT1 might be required for chromatin remodeling on the Enhancer 13 region to enable SRY binding and <italic>SOX9</italic> expression since the beginning of testis differentiation. In the mouse, which evolved more rapidly, DMRT1 would no longer be necessary for SRY action because the chromatin state of the fetal supporting cells would be more permissive. This could also explain why DMRT1 does not exert any critical function in the fetal testis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raymond et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, it is required for the action of SOX9 in the post-natal testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindeman et al., 2021</xref>), where a sex-specific epigenetic signature was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DMRT1 is required for germ cell meiosis and female fertility</title><p>In addition to its functions in testis differentiation, DMRT1 also plays a crucial role in the female gonad.

However, DMRT1 has also been observed in fetal germ cells from 20 d<italic>pc</italic> until meiosis proceeded after birth. Consequently, germ cell pre-meiotic arrest in <italic>DMRT1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> XX gonads could result from <italic>DMRT1</italic> loss-of-function in the germinal or the somatic compartment or both. In the somatic compartment, the absence of DMRT1 in XX homozygous mutants did not seem to disturb the first steps of ovarian differentiation. Nevertheless, deep-sequencing transcriptomics revealed the dysregulated expression of a few genes involved in the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. In particular, <italic>RSPO1</italic>, a positive regulator of the WNT signaling, was reduced, and DKK1, a negative regulator, was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These two events could have the effect of limiting the beta-catenin action in both somatic and germinal ovarian cells at the beginning of their differentiation. This pathway has proven to be crucial in mice to promote germ cell meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le Rolle et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, it cannot be the main event explaining the pre-meiotic failure, and the functions of DMRT1 in germ cells are more certainly involved. In mice, DMRT1 was shown to be involved in <italic>Stra8</italic> up-regulation in female germ cells and was thus related to the meiotic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krentz et al., 2011</xref>). This regulatory action also seems to be done in close collaboration with the retinoic acid pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2021</xref>). The sole action of DMRT1 on <italic>STRA8</italic> up-regulation cannot explain the phenotype observed in rabbits where the germ cell seems to be unable to leave their pluripotency stage. It has also been demonstrated in male mice that DMRT1 acts as a regulator of spermatogonia pluripotency by directly regulating different pluripotency-associated genes, including POU5F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krentz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). This path is under exploration in our model in order to try to decipher further the critical role of DMRT1 in the germ line of both sexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

While Dmrt1 is the testis-determining factor in chicken and deletion encompassing this gene lead to gonadal dysgenesis in human, the role of DMRT1 in testis development remains to be clarified. Despite an early expression of Dmrt1 in the mouse gonad and a potential function as a pioneer factor, DMRT1 is only required for the maintenance of the Sertoli cell identity in the postnatal testis. The use of a new animal model could provide new insights into the role of this factor in humans. Here the authors have generated a knockout model of DMRT1 in rabbits. They show that the XY mutant gonads differentiate as ovary indicating that DMRT1 is required for testis differentiation in rabbits. In addition, most of the germ cells remain pluripotent as evidenced by the maintenance of POU5F1 in both XY and XX mutant gonads. These are very important results potentially explaining gonadal dysgenesis associated with the DMRT1 locus in disorders of sex development in humans.</p><p>The experiments are meticulous and convincing. I find the arguments of the authors about the role of DMRT1 in germ cells in addition to its function in Sertoli cell differentiation, both comprehensible and compelling. Clearly, this is an important insight in sex determination and gametogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89284.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>It is well known that DMRT proteins and more specifically, DMRT1 plays a key role in the sex determination processes of many species. While DMRT1 has been shown to be critical for the sex determination of fish, birds, and reptiles, it seems less crucial at the sex determination stages of the mice. It is important though for adult sex maintenance in mice.</p><p>Unlike its minor role in mouse sex determination, it seems that variants in DMRT1 in humans cause 46, XY DSD and sex reversal.</p><p>The paper by Dujardin et al. is a beautiful study that provides an answer to this long-lasting discrepancy of the difference between the two common mammal species: human and mouse. It is a really nice example of how working with other mammal species, like the rabbit, could serve as a nice model for understanding mammalian sex determination.</p><p>In this study the researchers first described the expression patterns of DMRT1 in the rabbit XY and XX gonads throughout the window of sex determination.</p><p>They then used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate DMRT1 KO rabbits and analysed the phenotype in XY and XX rabbits. They show that XY rabbits present with complete XY male-to-female sex reversal, very similar to what observed in human 46, XY DSD patients (but not the mice model). They further show that in the XY sex reversed gonads, germ cells fail to enter meiosis. They next analysed XX gonads and while there is no major effect on sex determination (as expected), the germ cells in these ovaries fail to enter meiosis, highlighting the critical role that DMRT1 has in germ cells.</p><p>I think it is really important that we start to embrace other mammal models that are not the mouse as we find many instances that the mouse is not the optimal system for understanding human sex determination.</p><p>The study is well explained and presented. The data is clear, and the paper is fluent to read.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89284.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript deals with the sex-related gene, DMRT1, showing that is has a testis-promoting function in the rabbit. Loss-of-function studies the mouse and human, DMRT1 has a role in testis maintenance after birth, although forced expression in mouse can induce testis formation.</p><p>The authors used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate DMRT1-/- rabbit embryos. The gonads of these embryos developed as ovaries. Interestingly, in addition Y-linked SRY, DMRT1 is required for timely up-regulation of SOX9 during Sertoli cell differentiation in the male gonad.

The authors describe firstly that Dmrt1 has no obvious function in embryonic testis development but is critical for the maintenance of Sertoli cells in adult mice. The wording &quot;losing its function in early testis&quot; is confusing. Do the authors mean that despite the expression of Dmrt1 in early testis development, the function of Dmrt1 seems to be restricted to adults in mice? A comparison between the testis and ovary should be more cautious since GarciaAlonso et al (2022) have shown that the transcriptomics of supporting cells between humans and mice is partly different.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s what we thought, and the sentence has been changed as follow: “Although DMRT1 is not required for testis determination in mice, it retained part of its function in adulthood when it is necessary to maintain Sertoli cell identity.” (line 51 to 53)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 78</p><p>XY DMRT1-/- rabbits showed early male-to-female sex reversal.</p><p>Sex reversal indicates that there is no transient Sertoli cell differentiation that transdifferentiate into granulosa cells. This brings us to an interesting point. In the case of reprogramming, the transient Sertoli cells can produce AMH leading to the regression of the Mullerian ducts. In humans, some 9pdeleted XY patients have Mullerian duct remnants and feminized external genitalia. This finding indicates early defects in testis development.</p><p>Is there also feminized external genitalia in XY Dmrt1−/− rabbits. Can the authors comment on the phenotype of the ducts?</p></disp-quote><p>We proposed to add “and complete female genitalia” at the end of the following sentence:“Secondly, thanks to our CRISPR/Cas9 genetically modified rabbit model, we demonstrated that DMRT1 was required for testis differentiation since XY DMRT1-/- rabbits showed early male-tofemale sex reversal with differentiating ovaries and complete female genitalia.” (line 77 to 80)</p><p>Indeed, since the first stage (16 dpc) where we can predict the sex of the individual by observing its gonads during dissection, we always predict a female sex for XY DMRT1 KO fetuses. It is only genotyping that reveals an XY genotype. At birth, our rabbits are sexed by technicians from the facility and again, but now based on the external genitalia, they always phenotype these rabbits as female ones. In these XY KO rabbits, the supporting cells never differentiate into Sertoli, and ovarian differentiation occurs as early as in XX animals. Thus, these animals are fully feminized with female internal and external genitalia. Most of 9p-deleted patients are not homozygous for the loss-offunction of DMRT1, and the remaining wild-type allele could explain the discrepancy between KO rabbits and humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

DMRT1 heterozygous mutations result in XY gonad dysgenesis suggesting haploinsufficiency of DMRT1. However, to my knowledge, there is no evidence of haploinsufficiency in XX babies. Thus can we compare testis and ovarian genetics?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the term “equivalent” is ambiguous, and we changed the sentence as follows: “In ovarian differentiation, FOXL2 (Forkhead family box L2) showed a similar function discrepancy between mice and goats as DMRT1 in the testis pathway. In the mouse, Foxl2 is expressed in female supporting cells early in development but does not appear necessary for fetal ovary differentiation. On the contrary, it is required in adult granulosa cells to maintain female-supporting cell identity.” (line 53 to 56)</p><p>Regarding reviewer 2's question on haploinsufficiency in humans: the patient described in Murphy et al., 2015 is an XY individual with complete gonadal dysgenesis. But, it has been shown that the mutation carried by this patient leads to a dominant-negative protein, equivalent to a homozygous state (Murphy et al., 2022).</p><p>For FOXL2 mutation in XX females, haploinsufficiency does not affect early ovarian differentiation (no sex reversal) but induces premature ovarian failure.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer, we cannot compare testis and ovarian genetics considering two different genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 55</p><p>In mice, Foxl2 does not appear necessary for fetal ovary differentiation (Uda et al., 2004), while it is required in adult granulosa cells to maintain female-supporting cell identity (Ottolenghi et al., 2005).

Line 64</p><p>Lindeman et al (2021) have shown that DMRT1 can act as a pioneer factor to open chromatin upstream and Dmrt1 is expressed before Sry in mice (Raymond et al, 1999, Lei, Hornbaker et al, 2007). Whereas additional factors may compensate for the absence of Dmrt1, these results suggest that DMRT1 is also involved in Sox9 activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Dmrt1 is indeed expressed before Sry/Sox9 in the mouse gonad. However, no binding site for DMRT1 could be observed at Sox9 enhancer 13 in mice. This does not support a role for DMRT1 in the activation of Sox9 expression in this species. Furthermore, in Lindeman et al 2021, the authors clearly state that DMRT1 acts as a pioneering factor for SOX9 only after birth. It does not appear to have this role before. One of the explanations put forward is that the state of chromatin is different during fetal development in mice: chromatin is more permissive and does not require a factor to facilitate its opening. This hypothesis is based in particular on the description of a similar chromatin profile in the precursors of XX and XY fetal supporting cells, where many common regions display an open structure (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2019). Once sex determination and differentiation are established, a sex-specific epigenome is set up in gonadal cells. Chromatin remodeling agents are then needed to regulate gene expression. We hypothesize that in non-murine mammals such as rabbits, the state of gonadal cell chromatin would be different in the fetal period, more repressed, requiring the intervention of specific factors for its opening, such as DMRT1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Do the epithelial cells acquire some specific characteristics?</p></disp-quote><p>The formation of the tunica albuginea begins with the formation of loose connective tissue beneath the surface epithelium of the male gonad. The appearance of this tissue is concomitant with the loss of expression of DMRT1 in the cell of the coelomic epithelium. Our interpretation is that the contribution of the cells from the coelomic epithelium and their proliferation stops when the tunica begins to form because the structure of the tissue beneath the epithelium change, and the cellular interactions between the epithelium and the tissue below remain disrupted. By contrast, these interactions persist in the ovary until around birth for ovigerous nest formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The first part of the results described DMRT1 expression in rabbits. With the new single-cell transcriptomic atlas of human gonads, it would be important to describe the pattern of expression in this species. This could be described in the introduction in order to know the DMRT1 expression pattern in the human gonad before that of the rabbit.</p></disp-quote><p>A comment on the expression pattern of DMRT1 in human fetal gonads has been added in the discussion section: “In the human fetal testis, DMRT1 expression is co-detected with SRY in early supporting gonadal cells (ESCGs), which become Sertoli cells following the activation of SOX9 expression (Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022) » (line 222 to 224)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Figure 5 and Line 186</p><p>Quantification is missing such as the % of germ cells, % of meiotic germ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification is not easy to realize in rabbits because of the size and the elongated shape of the gonad. Indeed, it’s difficult to be sure that both sections (one from WT, the other from KO) are strictly in a similar region of the gonad and that the section is perfectly longitudinal or not. See also our answer to reviewer 3 (point 7) on this aspect. Actually, we are trying to make a better characterization of this XX phenotype and to find a marker of the pre-leptotene/leptotene stage susceptible to work in rabbits (SYCP3 will be the best, but we encountered huge difficulties with different antibodies and even RNAscope probe!). So actually, the most convincing indirect evidence of this pre-meiotic blockage (in addition to HE staining at 18 dpp in the new Figure 6) is the persistence of POU5F1 (pluripotency), specifically in the germinal lineage of KO XX and XY gonads. In addition to the new figure supplement 5, we can show you in Author response image 1: (i) the gonadal section at a lower magnification, where it is evident that there is a big difference between WT and KO germ cell POU5F1-stainings; and (ii) POU5F1 expression from a bulk RNA-seq realized the day after birth at 1 dpp where the difference is also transcriptionally very clear.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89284-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Could you please explain why did you chose to target Exon 3 of DMRT1 and not exons 1-2 which contain the DM domain? Was it to prevent damaging other DMRT proteins? Is there an important domain or function in Exon 2?</p></disp-quote><p>Our choice was mainly based on technical issues (rabbit genome annotation &amp; sgRNA design), but also we want to avoid targeting the DM domain due to its strong conservation with other DMRT genes. Due to the poor quality of the rabbit genome, exons 1 and 2 are not well annotated in this species. We have amplified and sequenced the region encompassing exons 1 &amp; 2 from our rabbit line, but the software used for sgRNA design does not predict good guides on this region. The two best sgRNAs were predicted on exon 3, and we used both to obtain more mutated alleles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Your scheme in Supp Figure 4 is not so clear.

Did you only have 1 good founder rabbit in your experiment? Why did you choose to work with a line that had duplication rather than deletion?</p></disp-quote><p>Very good point! In the first version of this paper, we’d try to explain the long (around 2 years) story of breeding to obtain the founder animal. Here it is:</p><p>During the genome editing process, we generate 6 mosaic founder animals (5 males and 1 female), then we cross them with wild-type animals to isolate each mutated allele in F1 offspring used afterward to establish and amplify knockout lines. Unexpectedly, we observe a very slow ratio of mutated allele transmission (5 on 129 F1 animals), and only one mutated allele has been conserved from the unique surviving adult F1 animal. It consists of an insertion of the deleted 47 bp DNA fragment, flanked by the cutting sites of the two RNA guides used with Cas9.</p><p>The main hypothesis to explain this mutation event is that in the same embryonic cell, the deletion occurs on one allele then the deleted fragment remains inserted into the other allele. Under this scheme, the embryonic cell carries a homozygous DMRT1 knockout genotype, albeit heterogeneous, with a deleted allele (del47) and the present allele (insertion of a 47 bp fragment leading to an in sense duplication). This may explain the very low frequency of transmission since all germ cells carrying a homozygous DMRT1-/- genotype will probably not be able to enter the meiotic process as suggested by our results on XX and XY DMRT1-/- ovaries. Finally, and under this hypothesis, the way we obtained this unique founder animal remains a mystery!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The in situ's in Fig 1 and 2 are very clear. Fig 1 and Fig 2, In situ hybridisation in tissue sections, it looked like DMRT1 could be expressed in some cells where SRY mRNA is absent @ E13.5dpc and 14.5 dpc. Do you think this is real, or maybe Sry is turned off now in those cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the results of in situ hybridizations, DMRT1 appears to be expressed by both coelomic epithelium and genital crest medullar cells in a pattern that is actually broader than that of SRY. Moreover, in rabbits, SRY expression seems to start in the medulla of the genital ridge rather than in the surface epithelium, as described in mice (see Figure 1 at 12 and 13 dpc). Nevertheless, more detailed analyses are needed to ensure the lineage of cells expressing SRY and/or DMRT1, such as single-cell RNAseq at these key stages of sexual determination in rabbits (from 12 to 16 dpc).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is curious that SRY expression is elevated in the DMRT1 KO (Knockout) rabbit gonads. Does this suggest feedback inhibition by DMRt1, or maybe indirect via effect on Sox9 (as I believe Sox9 feeds back to down-regulate Sry in mouse, for example).</p></disp-quote><p>The maintenance of SRY expression in the DMRT1 -/- rabbit testis seems to be linked to the absence of SOX9 expression. We believe that, as in mice, SOX9 would down-regulate SRY (even if, in rabbits, SRY expression is never completely turned off).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I suggest the targeting strategy and proof of DMRT1 knockout by sequencing etc. be brought out of the suppl. Data and shown as a figure in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>See also our answer to reviewer 2 (point 5). It has needed huge efforts to obtain these DMRT1 mutated rabbit line, and of course, it constitutes the basis of the study. But regarding the title and the main message of the article, we are not convinced that the targeting strategy should be moved into the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Unless there are limitations imposed by the journal, I also feel that Suppl Fig 5 (the immunostaining) deserves to be in the paper text too. The Fig showing loss of DMRt1 by immunostaining is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We include the figure supplement 5 in the main text. So, Figure 4E and figure supplement 5 have been combined into a new Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The RT-qPCR data should have the statistics clarified on the graphs. e.g., it is stated that, although Sox9 mRNA is clearly down, there is a slight increase compared to control on KO XX gonads. Is this statistically significant? Figure legend states that the Kruskal-Wallis test is used, and significance is shown by letters. This is unclear. It would be better to use the more usual asterisks and lines to show comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>Modification done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Reference is made to DMRT1+/- rabbits having aberrant germ cell development, pointing to a dosage effect. This is interesting. Does the somatic part of the gonad look completely normal in the het knockouts?</p></disp-quote><p>DMRT1 heterozygous male rabbits have a phenotype of secondary infertility with aging, and we are trying now to better characterize this phenotype. The problem is complex because, as we cannot carry out conditional KO, it remains difficult to decipher the consequence of DMRT1 haploinsufficiency in the Sertoli cells versus the germinal ones. Anyway, the somatic part is sufficiently normal to support spermatogenesis since heterozygous males are fertile at puberty and for some months thereafter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Can the authors indicate why meiotic markers were not used to explore the germ cell phenotype? It would be advantageous to use a meiotic germ cell marker to definitely show that the germ cells do not enter meiosis after DMRT1 loss. (Not just H/E staining or maintenance of POU). Example SYCP3, or STRA8 (as pre-meiotic marker) by in situ or immunostaining. Even though no germ cells were detected in adult KO gonads.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of pre-meiotic or meiotic markers is currently under study in DMRT1 -/- females. Transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) are also being analyzed. We are preparing a specific article on the role of DMRT1 in ovarian differentiation in rabbits. We felt it was important to reveal the phenotype observed in females in this first article, but we still need time to refine our description and understanding of the role of DMRT1 in the female.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What future studies could be conducted? In the Discussion section, it is suggested that DMRT1 could act as a pioneering factor to allow SRY action upon Sox9. How could this be further explored?</p></disp-quote><p>To explore the function of DMRT1 as a pioneering factor, it now seems necessary to characterize the epigenetic landscapes of rabbit fetal gonads expressing or not DMRT1 (comparison of control and DMRT1-/- gonads). Two complementary approaches could be privileged: the study of chromatin opening (ATAC-seq) and the analysis of the activation state of regulatory regions (CUT&amp;Tag). The study of several histone marks, such as H3K4me3 (active promoters), H3K4me1 (primed enhancers), H3K27ac (enhancers and active promoters), and H3K27me3 (enhancers and repressed promoters), would be of great interest. However, these techniques are only relevant for gonads that can be separated from the adjacent mesonephros, which is only possible from the 16 dpc stage in rabbits. To perform a relevant analysis at earlier stages, a &quot;single-nucleus&quot; approach such as ATAC-seq singlenucleus or multi-omic single-nucleus combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq could be used.</p></body></sub-article></article>
