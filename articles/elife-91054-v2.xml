position and/or attain proper shape. The Wnt signalling pathway stands out as one of the major coordinators of cell migration or cell outgrowth along the anterior-posterior body axis. The outcome of Wnt signalling is fine-tuned by various mechanisms including endocytosis. In this study, we show that SEL-5, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of mammalian AP2-associated kinase AAK1, acts together with the retromer complex as a positive regulator of EGL-20/Wnt signalling during the migration of QL neuroblast daughter cells. At the same time, SEL-5 in cooperation with the retromer complex is also required during excretory canal cell outgrowth. Importantly, SEL-5 kinase activity is not required for its role in neuronal migration or excretory cell outgrowth, and neither of these processes is dependent on DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation. We further establish that the Wnt proteins CWN-1 and CWN-2, together with the Frizzled receptor CFZ-2, positively regulate excretory cell outgrowth, while LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Frizzled together generate a stop signal inhibiting its extension.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SEL-5/AAK1</kwd><kwd>Wnt signalling</kwd><kwd>excretory cell</kwd><kwd>DPY-23/AP2M1</kwd><kwd>retromer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-17966Y</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macůrková</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007543</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura, Univerzita Karlova</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1446218/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knop</surname><given-names>Filip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004240</institution-id><institution>Akademie Věd České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lumina quaeruntur grant LQ200522301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Middelkoop</surname><given-names>Teije Corneel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The SEL-5/AAK1 kinase unexpectedly influences Wnt signalling-dependent processes in a multicellular organism without using its enzymatic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the development of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, several cells, both neuronal and non-neuronal, migrate in a well-defined and invariant manner along the anterior-posterior (A-P) body axis. Other cells do not migrate but rather extend their processes along the same axis. In both instances, the directionality of migration and growth is controlled by a set of guidance cues provided by the surrounding tissue and received by the corresponding signalling apparatus in the migrating or growing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silhankova and Korswagen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaram and Buechner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sherwood and Plastino, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutter, 2019</xref>). The gradients of Wnt proteins and a panel of their receptors are the key determinants of A-P guidance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Wnts can act either as attractants, repellents, or permissive cues for a given cell and the cell response depends on a given combination of Wnts, Frizzleds, and other components of the Wnt pathway expressed in and around that particular cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silhankova and Korswagen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Middelkoop and Korswagen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rella et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Endocytosis is an important regulatory mechanism for Wnt signalling applied in both Wnt-producing and Wnt-receiving cells. On the way out of the producing cell, Wnts are accompanied by a Wnt sorting receptor Wntless (WLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bänziger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartscherer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodman et al., 2006</xref>). Once WLS is relieved of its cargo at the plasma membrane, it is internalized by clathrin- and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2)-dependent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Port et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). Internalized WLS is subsequently recycled by a multisubunit retromer complex to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belenkaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franch-Marro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Port et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) and further to the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Disruption of the AP2 or clathrin function results in decreased Wnt secretion due to improper WLS recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Port et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). In Wnt-receiving cells, the activity of the Wnt-receptor complex, the signalosome, can be promoted by endocytosis, while at the same time, endocytosis can also attenuate Wnt signalling by regulating the membrane availability of Wnt receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albrecht et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colozza and Koo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1) belongs to the Ark/Prk or Numb-associated (NAK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smythe and Ayscough, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sorrell et al., 2016</xref>). Members of this family play an important role in regulating endocytosis in yeast, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> or mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smythe and Ayscough, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng et al., 2009</xref>). Human AAK1 has been shown to phosphorylate AP2M1, the µ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of µ2 at Thr156 by AAK1 enhances the binding affinity of AP2 to the sorting signals of endocytosed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ricotta et al., 2002</xref>). AAK1 has also been shown to phosphorylate the endocytic adaptor and negative regulator of Notch signalling Numb and affect its subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sorensen and Conner, 2008</xref>). AAK1 can also interact with a membrane-tethered activated form of the Notch receptor and promote its internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gupta-Rossi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>AAK1 knock-down resulted in elevated Wnt signalling in a mouse embryonic stem cell-based kinase and phosphatase siRNA screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Groenendyk and Michalak, 2011</xref>). A recent study in human cells confirmed this observation and offered a mechanism. By phosphorylating AP2, AAK1 promotes endocytosis of LRP6 and thus shuts down the signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agajanian et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the AAK1 orthologue SEL-5 has been genetically implicated in Notch signalling as a mutation in <italic>sel-5</italic> can suppress the constitutively active <italic>lin-12</italic>/Notch mutants. However, suppression is observed only in the <italic>lin-12</italic> allele activating the membrane-anchored Notch and not when the pathway is activated by expression of the intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fares and Greenwald, 1999</xref>). This hints that SEL-5 could regulate endocytosis in a manner similar to that of its mammalian counterpart. So far, no link has been made between SEL-5 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Wnt signalling regulation.</p><p>In this study, we set out to analyse the potential role of the SEL-5 kinase in Wnt signalling regulation and its contribution to DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We show that SEL-5 acts in collaboration with the retromer complex as a positive regulator of EGL-20/Wnt signalling during the migration of QL neuroblast descendants. We further demonstrate that although SEL-5 participates in DPY-23 phosphorylation, the observed role of SEL-5 in neuroblast migration is independent of its kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of DPY-23 is dispensable for Wnt-dependent migration of QL neuroblast descendants. SEL-5, together with the retromer, is further required during the active phase of excretory cell canal extension, again independently of its kinase activity. Finally, we show that the Wnt proteins CWN-1 and CWN-2, together with CFZ-2/Frizzled, promote excretory canal outgrowth while LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Frizzled together define the stopping point for canal extension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of SEL-5 affects migration of QL neuroblast descendants</title><p>Q cell descendants (Q.d) migration is dependent on EGL-20/Wnt signalling. While on the right side of the L1 larva QR divides and QR.d migrate in the default anterior direction, on the left side QL.d respond to the EGL-20 signal produced in several cells around the rectum by expressing the homeotic gene <italic>mab-5</italic> and migrate to the posterior.

To visualize Q.d migration, we utilized <italic>Pmec-7::gfp</italic> expressing transgene <italic>muIs32</italic> which is, apart from other cells, active in AVM and PVM touch neurons, which are QR and QL descendants, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ch’ng et al., 2003</xref>). We performed RNA interference (RNAi) against <italic>sel-5</italic> in wild type background and observed no effect on QL.d migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To increase the sensitivity of the RNAi approach, we repeated the RNAi experiment using <italic>vps-29(tm1320</italic>) mutant strain. This strain harbours a null mutation in the VPS-29 retromer subunit, displays only weakly penetrant QL.d migration defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coudreuse et al., 2006</xref>), and has previously been used as a sensitized background to uncover genes required for Q.d migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harterink et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenowicz et al., 2014</xref>).

We generated GFP knock-in strains by inserting GFP into the <italic>sel-5</italic> genomic sequence using the SEC cassette approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>). We obtained two strains, one expressing a transcriptional P<italic>sel-5::gfp</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and one, after excision of the SEC cassette, an N-terminally tagged GFP::SEL-5 under the control of its own promoter (P<italic>sel-5::gfp::sel-5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Microscopic analyses of both strains revealed that <italic>sel-5</italic> is expressed broadly, but at a low level judged by the intensity of the GFP signal. The most prominent expression was observed in the gonad from the beginning of its development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Expression was further observed in the developing oocytes, in the vulva, in epidermal cells, and most notably, in the rectal epithelial cells that are known to produce EGL-20/Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Whangbo and Kenyon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We could not detect <italic>sel-5</italic> expression in muscles, although we cannot exclude that a low level of expression, below the detection limit using the endogenous locus-tagging approach, is present. Interestingly, oocytes and epidermal seam cells expressing the GFP::SEL-5 fusion protein revealed its distinct subcellular localization.

The obvious candidate that could be affected by SEL-5-dependent endocytosis in Wnt-producing cells is the Wnt cargo receptor MIG-14/Wls. Human AAK1 can phosphorylate the AP2 subunit µ2 (AP2M1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ricotta et al., 2002</xref>) and thus increase the affinity of AP2 to cargo molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ricotta et al., 2002</xref>). It is conceivable that SEL-5 could regulate MIG-14/Wls trafficking at the level of AP2-dependent endocytosis. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> μ2 subunit of the AP2 complex, DPY-23 (also known as APM-2), has been shown to participate in the internalization of MIG-14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). We first tested whether loss of <italic>sel-5</italic> expression has any effect on the level of phosphorylation of DPY-23. A phospho-specific antibody recognizing phosphorylated threonine T160 (T156 in mammalian AP2M1) of DPY-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hollopeter et al., 2014</xref>) revealed a decrease in the level of phosphorylated endogenous DPY-23 in <italic>sel-5</italic> mutants compared to wild type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Similarly, T160 phosphorylation was reduced on overexpressed GFP-tagged DPY-23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Next, we assessed MIG-14 levels and localization in <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants using a transgene expressing a functional MIG-14::GFP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenowicz et al., 2014</xref>). However, the levels of MIG-14::GFP did not change significantly in <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> compared to the <italic>vps-29</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Levels of MIG-14::GFP in <italic>sel-5</italic> single mutants were variable but on average comparable to the wild type. We therefore concluded that the significant increase in QL.d migration defects in <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> compared to <italic>vps-29</italic> cannot be attributed to changes in MIG-14/Wls levels. Importantly, MIG-14::GFP did not re-localize to the plasma membrane in <italic>sel-5</italic> or <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants, in striking contrast to the MIG-14::GFP behaviour in animals treated with <italic>dpy-23</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we endogenously tagged EGL-20 with GFP and assessed Wnt gradient formation in control and mutant backgrounds. This approach has been previously used and revealed that extracellular EGL-20 can be detected in the form of distinct puncta that most likely represent EGL-20 bound to Frizzled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pani and Goldstein, 2018</xref>).

While the number of EGL-20 puncta in <italic>sel-5</italic> mutants was not significantly different from that in control animals, in <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants the number of puncta was substantially reduced.

We also compared the signal intensity in the EGL-20 spots among the different strains but no significant differences were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Wnt signalling thus seems to play a role in excretory canal growth, but so far, the other Wnt pathway components and their mechanism of action remained unknown. Therefore, we tested whether mutations in other Wnt pathway components could affect excretory cell growth. Among the four Wnts tested (EGL-20, LIN-44, CWN-1, CWN-2), only mutants in <italic>lin-44</italic>/Wnt exhibited an almost fully penetrant posterior excretory canal overgrowth phenotype, as observed in <italic>lin-17</italic>/Frizzled mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>).

No change in excretory canal length was displayed by <italic>cwn-1</italic>/Wnt or <italic>mig-1</italic>/Frizzled mutants. Interestingly, highly penetrant canal overgrowth was also observed in <italic>mig-14</italic>/Wls mutants, while loss of <italic>mig-5</italic>/Dishevelled or <italic>dsh-1</italic>/Dishevelled resulted in a partially penetrant overgrowth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Surprisingly, the loss of <italic>egl-20</italic> and <italic>mig-1</italic> also partially rescued the canal overgrowth in <italic>lin-17</italic>, even though neither of them displayed canal shortening on its own.

In the present study, we probed the role of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> AAK1 orthologue SEL-5 in Wnt signalling and uncovered its requirement for Wnt-dependent QL neuroblast daughter cell migration. We also revealed that SEL-5 is required during the outgrowth of the excretory canal cell prior to a Wnt-dependent stop signal. Importantly, in both instances the role of SEL-5 is independent of its kinase activity, defining an alternative mode of action for this kinase.</p><p>The role of SEL-5 has not been extensively studied in <italic>C. elegans</italic>; the only available reports uncovered the role of <italic>sel-5</italic> as a genetic suppressor of a constitutively active <italic>lin-12</italic>/Notch mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tax et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fares and Greenwald, 1999</xref>). Information about protein function was missing. SEL-5 shows the highest similarity to the mammalian Numb-associated kinase family members AAK1 and BMP2K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shaye and Greenwald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sorrell et al., 2016</xref>). Both AAK1 and BMP2K were shown to phosphorylate the μ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor at position T156 and thus regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ricotta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings uncovered some similarities between SEL-5 and AAK1 or BMP2K. Firstly, we show that the level of DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation in <italic>sel-5</italic> mutants is decreased compared to controls. Secondly, the subcellular localization of SEL-5 to punctate structures proximal to the plasma membrane in oocytes and epidermal seam cells resembles the subcellular distribution of human AAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conner and Schmid, 2002</xref>). These data support the notion that SEL-5 has a function analogous to its mammalian counterparts.</p><p>Given the established role of AAK1 in the regulation of mammalian endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kadlecova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agajanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wrobel et al., 2019</xref>), it was striking to see that loss of <italic>sel-5</italic> expression alone had no obvious developmental consequences. However, even in mammalian cells complete loss of AP2M1 T156 phosphorylation does not block endocytosis but only reduces its efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Motley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wrobel et al., 2019</xref>). We did not observe complete loss, but only a partial reduction of DPY-23 phosphorylation in <italic>sel-5</italic> mutants. This implies that SEL-5 is not the only kinase responsible for DPY-23 phosphorylation. It also suggests that endocytosis is not inhibited but could be only partially compromised. In such case, the level of ongoing endocytosis might be sufficient to support proper developmental decisions, such as the direction of Q neuroblast migration. We argued that in combination with an additional insult to the intracellular trafficking machinery, in this case the retromer complex, the suboptimal function of endocytosis would manifest itself. Indeed, <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> double mutants display two highly penetrant phenotypes, the QL.d migration defect and shortening of the excretory cell canals. Strikingly, neither of these phenotypes can be attributed to a decrease in endocytic efficiency due to a lack of DPY-23 phosphorylation. Firstly, both phenotypes can be rescued by a tissue-specific expression of a kinase-inactive SEL-5 mutant protein. Secondly, <italic>vps-29; dpy-23(mew25</italic>) mutants expressing only non-phosphorylatable DPY-23 do not phenocopy <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants. Alternative mechanisms of SEL-5 function thus have to be considered. It is possible that either SEL-5 affects endocytosis by a mechanism not dependent on DPY-23 phosphorylation or that SEL-5 regulates QL.d migration and excretory cell canal extension by endocytosis-independent mechanisms. Our findings about MIG-14/Wls behaviour, the most obvious endocytic cargo candidate for QL.d migration, argue against the first possibility; most notably the fact that MIG-14 does not re-localize to the plasma membrane in the absence of SEL-5. However, the effect of SEL-5 on a different endocytic cargo cannot be excluded. We detected significant shortening of the EGL-20 gradient in the <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants. Given that SEL-5 is required both in the EGL-20-producing cells and in the muscle for QL.d migration, it is possible that some receptors that serve as a sink for EGL-20 are incorrectly accumulated at the plasma membrane and thus partially hinder EGL-20 spreading. In case of the excretory canal extension, SEL-5 could regulate the turnover of guidance receptors at the plasma membrane of the growing tip. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the loss of Numb-associated kinase (Nak) results in the absence or shortening of higher-order dendrites and Nak has been shown to promote endocytosis of Neuroglian/L1-CAM during dendrite extension and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> excretory cell, PAT-3/β1-integrin is required for canal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedgecock et al., 1987</xref>). Integrins constantly cycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments using various trafficking routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Layseca et al., 2019</xref>) and could thus serve as a putative SEL-5 cargo.</p><p>A possible mechanism for how SEL-5 could affect endocytosis independently of DPY-23 phosphorylation follows from the finding that SEL-5 physically interacted with REPS-1 protein in a yeast-two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsushima et al., 2013</xref>). REPS-1 is an orthologue of mammalian REPS1 (RALBP1-associated Eps Domain-containing 1), an Eps homology-containing protein known to interact with RALBP1 (RalA-binding protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yamaguchi et al., 1997</xref>). RALBP1 is an effector of Ral GTPase that can interact with the μ2 subunit of AP2 and regulate endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jullien-Flores et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, human AAK1 interacted with both RALBP1 and REPS1 in several high-throughput mass spectrometry analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Golkowski et al., 2023</xref>). SEL-5 could thus regulate the AP2 complex indirectly via interaction with the REPS1-RALBP1 complex.</p><p>Searching for a possible endocytosis-independent mechanism of SEL-5 activity is complicated by the fact that while in the case of QL.d migration SEL-5 function is cell-nonautonomous, cell-autonomous expression of SEL-5 is sufficient to rescue the <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> excretory canal extension defect. This suggests that more than one mechanism might exist. One possibility common to both phenotypes comes from recent studies in mammalian cells. BMP2K has been shown to localize to the early secretory compartment and to regulate COPII coat assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cendrowski et al., 2020</xref>). SEL-5 could thus affect Wnt secretion in the case of QL.d migration or new guidance receptor delivery to the plasma membrane in the case of the excretory canals. EGL-20 gradient analyses revealed gradient shortening in <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants. However, no significant differences in the number of EGL-20 puncta were detected between wild type and <italic>sel-</italic>5 animals, but also not between <italic>vps-29</italic> and <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic>, despite the almost eightfold difference in the QL.d migration phenotype penetrance between these two mutants. This would argue against a role for SEL-5 in secretion. Shorter gradient in the double mutants could thus more likely arise from a combination of partially reduced EGL-20 secretion caused by <italic>vps-29</italic> and a partial reduction of EGL-20 spreading caused by a possible <italic>sel-5</italic>-dependent membrane retention of a receptor acting as an EGL-20 sink. A direct correlation between the amount of EGL-20, the range of the EGL-20 gradient, and the QL.d phenotype would be necessary to explain the phenotypic differences between the various mutants. More experiments will thus be required to establish how SEL-5 exerts its function. The biggest question to answer will be how it does so independently of its kinase activity.</p><p>Apart from the role of SEL-5 and the retromer complex in excretory cell canal extension, we have also uncovered a significant contribution of Wnt pathway components in defining the length of the excretory canal. The role of Wnt signalling in the outgrowth of the excretory canals has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sundaram and Buechner, 2016</xref>); however, the only evidence came from the early observation that canals overgrow in <italic>lin-17</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hedgecock et al., 1987</xref>) and that erroneous canal branching is observed in <italic>axl-1</italic>/Axin-like mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oosterveen et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that the loss of PLR-1, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in excretory canal shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2015</xref>). PLR-1 is responsible for internalization of Frizzled receptors from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moffat et al., 2014</xref>). However, a direct link between PLR-1 function in the excretory cell and Wnt signalling has not been established. Our analysis of single Wnt and Frizzled mutants revealed that while loss of <italic>cwn-2</italic> or <italic>cfz-2</italic> expression resulted in a very mild shortening of the excretory canal, loss of <italic>lin-44</italic> or <italic>lin-17</italic> led to profound canal overgrowth (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These findings suggested that two independent Wnt pathways could be employed to establish a proper excretory canal length – one that promotes canal extension and one that generates the stop signal for growth termination. Further analyses of double mutants and other Wnt signalling components revealed that the extension-promoting pathway includes <italic>cwn-1</italic> in addition to <italic>cwn-2</italic> and <italic>cfz-2</italic>, while the stop-signal pathway encompasses <italic>lin-44</italic>, <italic>lin-17</italic>, <italic>dsh-1</italic>, <italic>mig-5,</italic> and <italic>mig-14</italic>. A similar repulsive role of LIN-44/LIN-17 complex has been described in the case of a posterior axon of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABAergic DD6 motor neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maro et al., 2009</xref>) or PLM, ALN, and PLN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of <italic>lin-44</italic> or <italic>lin-17</italic> expression promoted outgrowth of the posterior neurites of these neurons, implicating that in wild type animals, LIN-44 serves as a repulsive cue. On the other hand, <italic>cwn-2</italic> and <italic>cfz-2</italic> were shown to positively regulate the posterior neurite outgrowth of RMED/V neurons with <italic>cwn-2</italic> acting as an attractive cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Song et al., 2010</xref>). The role of two other Wnt signalling components, <italic>egl-20</italic> and <italic>mig-1</italic>, is less clear. No effect (<italic>mig-1</italic>) or only a very mild overgrowth defect (<italic>egl-20</italic>) is observed in single mutants. However, both <italic>egl-20</italic> and <italic>mig-1</italic> significantly rescue the overgrowth phenotype of <italic>lin-17</italic> mutants, while at the same time, <italic>mig-1</italic> can suppress the shortening of canals in <italic>cfz-2</italic> mutants. EGL-20-producing cells are localized around the rectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Whangbo and Kenyon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harterink et al., 2011a</xref>), exactly where the excretory canals stop, while LIN-44 is expressed more posteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harterink et al., 2011a</xref>). A possible explanation could thus be that while LIN-44 provides a general posterior repulsive signal, EGL-20 fine-tunes the exact stopping position of the growing canal. The role of different Wnts and Frizzleds in excretory canal outgrowth is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model summarizing the inputs acting in the excretory cell outgrowth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three possible outcomes of the canal outgrowth depending on the genetic background.

Only players discussed in this work are depicted. First, the active outgrowth of the posterior canals is controlled by <italic>sel-5</italic>, retromer, and the Wnt pathway consisting of <italic>cwn-1</italic>, <italic>cwn-2,</italic> and <italic>cfz-2</italic>. It remains to be determined whether these players act sequentially, in parallel or as components of a single pathway. After reaching the proper length, further canal extension is inhibited by a second Wnt signalling pathway governed by <italic>lin-44</italic>, <italic>lin-17</italic>, <italic>dsh-1,</italic> and <italic>mig-5</italic>. Lastly, <italic>egl-20</italic> and <italic>mig-1</italic> might fine-tune the precise stopping position of the growing canal.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91054-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Further investigation will be required to decipher the exact way how SEL-5 and the retromer crosstalk with Wnt signalling during excretory cell outgrowth. It is clear though that more than one mechanism is likely involved. First, <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants display canal shortening similarly to <italic>cwn-1; cfz-2</italic> or <italic>cwn-2; cfz-2,</italic> suggesting a positive regulatory role. Mutants in <italic>lin-17</italic> and <italic>lin-44</italic> display canal overgrowth, yet <italic>sel-5</italic> is partially able to suppress this phenotype. This would imply a negative regulatory role for <italic>sel-5</italic> and be in agreement with the role of AAK1 in Wnt pathway regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agajanian et al., 2019</xref>). However, <italic>sel-5</italic> and <italic>vps-29</italic> are required already during the initial larval outgrowth while the LIN-44/LIN-17 signal is required later. The observed rescue might thus also be explained by delayed canal growth and not by a direct impact of <italic>sel-5</italic> and <italic>vps-29</italic> on LIN-44 or LIN-17 levels or localization. Alternatively, <italic>sel-5</italic> and <italic>vps-29</italic> may regulate LIN-44 or LIN-17 earlier but the signalling outcome does not manifest itself until later in development.</p><p>Taken together, we have uncovered cooperation between the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of the AAK1 kinase, SEL-5, and the retromer complex in regulating cell migration and cell outgrowth, and we have also outlined the engagement of Wnt pathway components in defining the length of the excretory cell canals. The surprising independence of the SEL-5 function on its kinase activity opens a new path for investigation with high relevance also for mammalian biology. AAK1 has been proposed as a potential drug target for treating various neurological disorders and preventing viral entry, where kinase activity is the target of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martinez-Gualda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xin et al., 2023</xref>). In light of our findings, the non-enzymatic activities of AAK1 should also be taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

PVM migration was scored as defective when PVM was located anteriorly to the posterior edge of the vulva. ALM polarity was scored as defective when bipolar or reversed neurites were observed. CAN neurons were visualized with <italic>kyIs4</italic> transgene and their position relative to V3 seam cell was scored. CAN positioned anterior to V3 was scored as displaced. For DiI staining, L3-L4 well-fed animals were washed from a plate with M9 buffer and incubated for 3 hr in 10 μg/mL DiI solution (D282, Thermo Fisher Scientific, dissolved to 2 mg/mL stock solution in dimethylformamide). Animals were then washed three times in M9 buffer and directly observed. Excretory cell canal lengths were scored in L4 or young adult animals carrying integrated P<italic>pgp-12::gfp</italic> transgene (<italic>sIs10089</italic>) or P<italic>pgp-12::gfp</italic> expressed from an extrachromosomal array (<italic>mamEx11 or mamEx29</italic>). Posterior canals were scored as wild type when they reached the region between the inner edge of the posterior gonadal turn and the rectum. Shortened canal phenotype was graded according to the region within the worm body the canal reached. The following landmarks were used for each category: 0 – excretory canal missing entirely or reaching the inner edge of anterior gonadal turn; 1 – canal reaching anterior spermatheca; 2 – canal reaching vulva; 3 – canal reaching posterior spermatheca; 4 – canal reaching inner edge of posterior gonadal turn; and 5 – canal reaching rectum (wild type). Canals that overgrew the rectum and reached the tail tip were scored as 6. Anterior excretory cell canals were measured and their length normalized to the measured distance between the posterior edge of the pharynx and the nose tip. For the assessment of posterior canal extension dynamics, larval excretory cell posterior canals were measured at four developmental stages (hatch, 4, 8, and 24 hr after hatching) and normalized to the animal body length. For microscopy imaging, worms were anaesthetized either with 10 mM sodium azide or 1 mM levamisol and mounted on 3% agarose pads. Images were taken on Leica DM6 upright microscope. For confocal imaging, Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope was used. The EGL-20/Wnt gradient was visualized in L2/L3 animals using a spinning disc microscopy setup, based on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-W1 scan head, 50 um pinhole disc, 488 nm laser, Teledyne Photometrics PRIME BSI camera, ×60 W NA1.2 objective, and operated with NIS Elements. For each animal, a z-stack of 31 slices, dz = 1 μm was acquired. Imaging was done at room temperature (22–23°C). Images were processed with the Fiji image processing package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For EGL-20 gradient quantification, a maximum projection of seven consecutive z-sections where the rectal epithelial cells were visible was made for each sample. A curved line of 150 μm in length and 3.9 μm in width was fitted through the ventral side of each animal using the rectum as the starting point and the selected region was straightened using the ‘Straighten’ function in Fiji. To count the number of EGL-20 puncta in these selections, images were blinded and the puncta were manually counted. Counting was repeated three times and the values for each image were averaged. These averaged values were then plotted and used for statistical evaluation. For mean pixel intensity calculations, a Gaussian blur (sigma = 3) was applied to the straightened images. Subsequently, a single segmentation threshold was determined from a representative wild type image by using the 'graythresh' inbuilt function in MATLAB (which uses the Otsu method). This threshold was multiplied by 1.7 (a factor that was determined manually) to generate a mask that segments only bright EGL-20 spots. Using the derived threshold, a binary mask was made for all images. Using this mask, the mean pixel intensity of all pixels inside the segmented EGL-20 spots was computed.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors propose a kinase-activity independent mode of action for SEL-5/AAK1, however, the evidence supporting this claim is inadequate, as it relies on under-characterized mutants for dpy-23 and sel-5. The claims will be stronger if the authors test for DPY-23 phosphorylation in the new dpy-23(mew25) mutant and further characterize whether mew25 behaves as a loss-of-function.</p><p>2. The authors need to have higher magnification/resolution images and use markers (e.g. for the plasma membrane, junctions, endosomes, golgi, etc.) to carefully analyze the localization of MIG-14::GFP in control vs. mutants.</p><p>3. Reviewers had some issues with the interpretation of data related to the sel-5 mutant phenotypes in EXC, and the genetic interactions with Wnt signaling mutants (e.g., egl-20, lin-44). Further genetic interactions (e.g., egl-20 and/or mig-1 mutations with lin-17) would strengthen this study.</p><p>4. There is no clear connection between mig-10 and Wnt signaling, and thus the inclusion of mig-10 in this report is not well supported nor necessary.</p><p>5. Some changes to statistical analyses are needed (see specific comments by reviewer 2).</p><p>6. The study lacks coherence and careful copy-editing is needed to improve the flow and quality of the text. For example, there is a clear hypothesis testing a role for SEL-5/AAK1 in DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation and Wnt signaling. However, this model appears to be refuted but the authors do not mention/explore alternative targets or functions for SEL-5/AAK1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The new dpy-23(mew25) allele requires further genetic characterization, such as the description of dominance/recessiveness, ability to complement existing dpy-23 mutants, description of any dpy-23 like phenotypes, ability to suppress/enhance other dpy-23-mediated processes, etc. Without knowing more about this allele, we cannot reliably interpret the lack of effects seen with this mutant.</p><p>2. I do not agree that, at least from the data shown, &quot;neither levels nor subcellular distribution of a functional MIG-14::GFP protein changed significantly in sel-5 vps-29 compared to vps-29 single mutant&quot;. The images shown in Figure 3C are not sufficient to reach this conclusion and I could argue that I see more MIG-14::GFP at the apical and lateral membranes in sel-5 mutants than in control. To make a strong conclusion, the authors need to have higher magnification/resolution images and use markers (e.g. for plasma membrane, junctions, endosomes, golgi, etc.) to carefully analyze the localization of MIG-14::GFP in control vs. mutants. Similarly, the conclusion that &quot;Levels of MIG-14::GFP in sel-5 single mutants were variable yet on average comparable to wild type&quot; is not supported by Figure 3D, as a statistical analysis of this result is not presented, and it is possible that the high variability makes this result non-significant.</p><p>3. I am surprised that the authors reported results from only one multi-copy extrachromosomal array for their studies of SEL-5 kinase mutants. Given the variability in expression from such arrays, typically results are reported for multiple transgenes. More importantly, given that extrachromosomal arrays are known to highly overexpress the protein of interest, and that even proteins with reduced function can rescue when highly overexpressed, the conclusion that SEL-5 kinase activity is not required for function is not supported. These experiments should be done with single-copy insertion transgenes, or by introducing the desired mutations into the endogenous sel-5 locus. In addition, as described for dpy-23(mew25), further genetic characterization of sel-5 kinase mutants is warranted: do they cause phenotypes on their own? Do they affect other sel-5-mediated processes (i.e., look for genetic interactions with lin-12/Notch mutants)? Finally, since the sel-5 coding sequence is tagged with GFP, it would be important to know whether the mutations introduced affect SEL-5 accumulation, localization, etc. Again, this would be better done with either single-copy insertion transgenes or using the endogenous GFP-tagged sel-5.</p><p>4. Although the excretory canal outgrowth phenotypes caused sel-5, retromer, and some components of the Wnt signaling, are novel, this story is underdeveloped and lacks mechanistic insight. Moreover, some significant genetic interactions are not considered in the model. Specifically:</p><p>4a. egl-20/Wnt mutants have a mild, but significant, overgrowth defect, which suggests that EGL-20 acts in parallel to LIN-44 as a &quot;stop&quot; signal (more on this below). This is not mentioned.</p><p>4b. mig-1/Fzd mutants do not display an excretory canal outgrowth phenotype, however mig-1 loss significantly suppressed the reduced outgrowth caused by loss of cfz-2/Fzd. Moreover, mig-1 did not synergize with egl-20. These results, which are not further discussed, are consistent with a model where egl-20/Wnt and mig-1/Fzd act in a pathway (in parallel to lin-44/Wnt and lin-17/Fzd) as a &quot;stop&quot; signal, and also consistent with a model where even mild disruption of the &quot;stop&quot; signal can overcome defects caused by loss of a &quot;go&quot; signal mediated by cwn-2/Wnt and cfz-2/Fzd. Further genetic interactions (e.g., egl-20 and/or mig-1 mutations with lin-17, which displays a less penetrant phenotype than lin-44) would strengthen this model.</p><p>5. Implicating EGL-20/Wnt as part of the &quot;stop&quot; signal would allow the authors to use previously-published endogenously-tagged EGL-20 reporters (Pani and Goldstein, 2018) to assess whether the non-autonomous function of sel-5 in QL.d migration and excretory canal outgrowth is related to Wnt secretion, which would provide some mechanistic insight into SEL-5 function. In this regard, I also note that there is a transgenic CWN-2::Venus reporter that could be used to visualize CWN-2/Wnt accumulation in sel-5 mutants (rescue of the cwn-2 excretory canal defect by this transgene should be tested before using).</p><p>6. Focusing on mig-10 here is confusing. I do not agree that &quot;So far, the most studied pathway regulating excretory canal outgrowth is the one involving UNC-53 […], ABI-1 […], and MIG-10&quot;, as many other pathways have been implicated in excretory canal outgrowth and guidance (i.e., Slit/Robo, FGFR, Rho/Rac signaling, the Par polarity pathway, etc.). The authors mention that thus far ligands/receptors that might regulate a UNC-53/ABI-1/MIG-10 are not known, thus perhaps they're suggesting that Wnt signaling would play this role. However, no work is presented to support this model. Thus, as it stands, there is no clear connection between mig-10 and Wnt signaling, and thus the inclusion of mig-10 in this report is not well supported nor necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

In particular, the detailed and complete analysis of excretory canal defects in Wnt pathway mutants allowed the authors to propose an intriguing model describing a novel role for Wnt signaling in canal outgrowth. I also very much appreciate the more detailed analysis of the dpy-23(mew25) allele, which I think lends stronger support to their conclusion that DPY-23/AP2 phosphorylation by SEL-5/AAK1 is not the mechanism by which sel-5 regulates Wnt signaling.</p><p>However, I do have some concerns on the interpretation of new data re: the EGL-20/Wnt gradient presented in Figure 3, Supplement 2 (In general, I will note that the figures were not labelled in the manuscript; so, it was quite difficult to know what Figure I was looking at when reading the paper). The authors use two criteria to measure the EGL-20 gradient: number of EGL-20 puncta (Figure 3, Supp. 2, C) and signal intensity (Figure 3, Supp. 2, D), and found that neither sel-5 or vps-29 mutations (they do not specify which alleles were used for this experiment, at least I could not find it in the main text, figure legend, methods, or strain table) on their own significantly decreased the number or intensity of particles seen, while the double mutant had significantly fewer particles.</p><p>However, I don't think that the number or intensity of EGL-20 puncta on their own provides an accurate description of a gradient. A gradient is not only defined by the total amount of morphogen, but also how the concentration of this morphogen is distributed over distance, and the authors do not include any distance measures in their quantifications. I would argue, based on the representative images shown, that the EGL-20 gradient is indeed quite reduced in sel-5 and vps-29 mutants, because the extent of EGL-20 puncta in these mutants seems to be much shorter than in wildtype. Maybe a good measurement to include is distance from the rectum to the furthest anterior brightest puncta? In conclusion, based on the pictures shown, I agree that sel-5 is likely not significantly affecting the total amount of EGL-20 secreted, but I do not agree that the gradient (which should include a measure of the extent of spread) is unchanged.</p><p>I also don't think that the EGL-20 gradient should go under the section titled &quot;SEL-5 does not affect MIG-14 endocytosis&quot;. Instead a new section titled &quot;SEL-5 affects the EGL-20 gradient&quot; (or &quot;does not affect&quot; depending on how the new measurements of gradient that incorporate distance turn out) should be added, and these figures should be part of the main text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I was satisfied by most changes in the revised manuscript, &quot;<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> SEL-5/AAK1 regulates cell migration and cell outgrowth independently of its kinase activity.&quot;</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. Reviewer #2, comment 2. With the added data now in figure 6, I agree with the author's model that cwn-1, cwn-2, and cfz-2 act to promote EXC outgrowth while lin-44, lin-17, dsh-1, and mig-5 act as a stop signal.</p><p>However, I felt the evidence implicating sel-5 in only one pathway was not strong. On one hand, the observation that sel-5 vps-29 mutants had the same phenotype as cwn-1 cwn-2 mutants was consistent with it acting in the cwn-1/2 pathway. This claim was reasonable. The evidence that sel-5 did not influence the lin-44/lin-17 pathway was less clear. To support their claim, the authors argued that lin-44/lin-17 activity was not required early in development because lin-44/lin-17 mutants did not show a phenotype early. I would remind them that it is possible for gene activity to be required early and yet the mutant not show a phenotype until later. One would need a conditional allele to test the timing of requirement. (I am not suggesting this experiment!) I would advise them to alter the text in two places:</p><p>Line 382 LIN-17/Frizzled receptor is required at a later stage</p><p>Line 509 LIN-17 signal is required later</p><p>I would replace these claims with &quot;loss of lin-17 does not result in a phenotype until a later stage.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps they should soften their claim that sel-5 does not regulate lin-44/lin-17. (The model is alright. It's just that -a model!)</p><p>2. Reviewer #2. Copy-editing was needed. There were a large number of syntax errors, particularly missing articles, prepositions, and punctuation.

The authors propose a kinase-activity independent mode of action for SEL-5/AAK1, however, the evidence supporting this claim is inadequate, as it relies on under-characterized mutants for dpy-23 and sel-5. The claims will be stronger if the authors test for DPY-23 phosphorylation in the new dpy-23(mew25) mutant and further characterize whether mew25 behaves as a loss-of-function.</p></disp-quote><p>The sel-5(ok149) allele was previously characterized by Fares and Greenwald (1999) as a loss-of-function allele. Our characterization of both sel-5(ok149) and sel-5(ok363) regarding the Wnt-related phenotypes is summarized in Table 1 and Figures 1B, 1D. We agree that the mew25 allele we use has not been extensively characterized before; however, mew25 and several other alleles introducing the same amino acid change were described previously by other groups (Hollopeter et al., 2014; Beacham et al., 2018; Partlow et al., 2019; Joseph et al., 2020). We have now made this clear in the text and we have included characterization of the allele (Figure 4). We show that no T160 phosphorylation is present in dpy-23(mew25) animals and we show that mew25 rescues the “jowls” phenotype of fcho-1 mutants, likely by destabilizing the closed conformation of AP2 (Hollopeter et al., 2014). Importantly, this allele is not a loss-of-function allele and does not show dpy-23 loss-of-function phenotypes. Because the T160A alleles of dpy-23 appear overtly wild-type, the mew25 allele (generated de novo in the N2 background via CRISPR) offered a unique opportunity to evaluate whether phosphorylation by SEL-5 is required for the phenotypes observed in our study.

We have replaced the original images with confocal images acquired at higher magnification and we also included a panel comparing MIG-14::GFP together with an mCherry-PH membrane marker in all mutants (Figure 3, Figure 3 —figure supplement 1), which now supports our statement that in sel-5 vps-29 double mutants (or in either of the single mutants) MIG-14::GFP does not re-localize to the plasma membrane. This indicates that endocytosis of this cargo is not compromised.

Reviewers had some issues with the interpretation of data related to the sel-5 mutant phenotypes in EXC, and the genetic interactions with Wnt signaling mutants (e.g., egl-20, lin-44).

The study lacks coherence and careful copy-editing is needed to improve the flow and quality of the text. For example, there is a clear hypothesis testing a role for SEL-5/AAK1 in DPY-23/AP2M1 phosphorylation and Wnt signaling. However, this model appears to be refuted but the authors do not mention/explore alternative targets or functions for SEL-5/AAK1.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that deciphering the mechanism of SEL-5 action would move our study to a different level. We have now explored the possibility that SEL-5 activity is required for shaping of the Wnt gradient. To this end we have produced endogenously-tagged EGL-20::GFP line and assessed whether the amount of extracellular EGL-20 differs among the studied mutants (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). However, our data do not support this possibility, leaving the mechanism of SEL-5 action still open. Recycling of membrane receptors, for example integrins, would be another possible scenario, but as we have no experimental evidence, we only briefly outline this possibility in the Discussion. We plan to explore this line in future but we feel it is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The new dpy-23(mew25) allele requires further genetic characterization, such as the description of dominance/recessiveness, ability to complement existing dpy-23 mutants, description of any dpy-23 like phenotypes, ability to suppress/enhance other dpy-23-mediated processes, etc. Without knowing more about this allele, we cannot reliably interpret the lack of effects seen with this mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the mew25 allele we use has not been extensively characterized before, however, mew25 and several other alleles introducing the same amino acid change were described previously by other groups (Hollopeter et al., 2014; Beacham et al., 2018; Partlow et al., 2019; Joseph et al., 2020). We have now made this clear in the text and we have included characterization of the allele in Figure 4. We show that no T160 phosphorylation is present in dpy-23(mew25) animals and we show that mew25 rescues the “jowls” phenotype of fcho-1 mutants, likely by destabilizing the closed conformation of AP2 (Hollopeter et al., 2014).</p><p>The following text accompanied by new Figure 4 has been added to the Results:</p><p>LINE 217 “Characterization of <italic>dpy-23(mew25)</italic> animals revealed that homozygous mutants are viable; they are not dumpy and look superficially wild type.

I do not agree that, at least from the data shown, &quot;neither levels nor subcellular distribution of a functional MIG-14::GFP protein changed significantly in sel-5 vps-29 compared to vps-29 single mutant&quot;. The images shown in Figure 3C are not sufficient to reach this conclusion and I could argue that I see more MIG-14::GFP at the apical and lateral membranes in sel-5 mutants than in control. To make a strong conclusion, the authors need to have higher magnification/resolution images and use markers (e.g. for plasma membrane, junctions, endosomes, golgi, etc.) to carefully analyze the localization of MIG-14::GFP in control vs. mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the statement about subcellular distribution was not sufficiently supported. We now provide confocal images of MIG-14::GFP expression with higher resolution (Figure 3C) and in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 we show MIG-14::GFP together with mCherry-PH in egl-20-expressing cells. These data clearly show that MIG-14::GFP does not re-localize to the plasma membrane as would be expected if endocytosis is compromised in sel-5 or sel-5 vps-29 mutants. We use dpy-23 RNAi as a positive control, where MIG-14::GFP co-localization with mCherry-PH membrane marker is visible. The statement cited above was replaced by the following text in Results:</p><p>“…levels of MIG-14::GFP did not change significantly in sel-5 vps-29 compared to vps-29 single mutant”</p><p>“Importantly, MIG-14::GFP did not re-localize to the plasma membrane in either <italic>sel-5</italic> or <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants, in striking contrast to the MIG-14::GFP behaviour in animals treated with <italic>dpy-23</italic> RNAi (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). This rules out the possibility that the Wnt-related phenotypes in <italic>sel-5 vps-29</italic> mutants arise from a defect in MIG-14 internalization.”</p><p>The following text was modified in the Discussion:</p><p>“It is possible that either SEL-5 affects endocytosis by a mechanism not dependent on DPY-23 phosphorylation or that SEL-5 regulates QL.d migration and excretory cell canal extension by endocytosis-independent mechanisms. Our findings about MIG-14/Wls behaviour, the most obvious endocytic cargo candidate for QL.d migration, argue against the first possibility; most notably the fact that MIG-14 does not re-localize to the plasma membrane in the absence of SEL-5.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the conclusion that &quot;Levels of MIG-14::GFP in sel-5 single mutants were variable yet on average comparable to wild type&quot; is not supported by Figure 3D, as a statistical analysis of this result is not presented, and it is possible that the high variability makes this result non-significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the statistical analysis to Figure 3D, which shows that there is no statistically significant difference in MIG-14 levels between sel-5 and control animals, while vps-29 and sel-5 vps-29 show statistically significant decrease of MIG-14 levels compared to both control and sel-5 animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I am surprised that the authors reported results from only one multi-copy extrachromosomal array for their studies of SEL-5 kinase mutants. Given the variability in expression from such arrays, typically results are reported for multiple transgenes. More importantly, given that extrachromosomal arrays are known to highly overexpress the protein of interest, and that even proteins with reduced function can rescue when highly overexpressed, the conclusion that SEL-5 kinase activity is not required for function is not supported. These experiments should be done with single-copy insertion transgenes, or by introducing the desired mutations into the endogenous sel-5 locus.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for pointing this out. We now include data from more independent lines carrying the mutated SEL-5 constructs (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2) and also from lines carrying the wild type SEL-5 constructs used to assess the tissue-specific action of SEL-5 (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). We further provide more information about the mutated residues to strengthen our point. The mutated residues are conserved between SEL-5 and AAK1, as shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1; when these residues were mutated in AAK1, the kinase activity was lost. Most importantly, the D178A mutation removes the critical aspartic acid of the highly conserved HRD motif, which is considered irreplaceable for catalysis. This makes residual SEL-5D178A kinase activity highly improbable. The following text was added to the Results:</p><p>“we repeated the rescue experiment presented in Figure 2A now with SEL-5 carrying either K75A or D178A point mutations. Position D178 corresponds to the D176 of human AAK1 and is part of the conserved HRD motif in the catalytic loop, K75 corresponds to K74 in AAK1 and is predicted to affect ATP binding (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). In AAK1 both mutations abolished its ability to phosphorylate AP2M1 (Conner and Schmid, 2003).“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, as described for dpy-23(mew25), further genetic characterization of sel-5 kinase mutants is warranted: do they cause phenotypes on their own? Do they affect other sel-5-mediated processes (i.e., look for genetic interactions with lin-12/Notch mutants)? Finally, since the sel-5 coding sequence is tagged with GFP, it would be important to know whether the mutations introduced affect SEL-5 accumulation, localization, etc. Again, this would be better done with either single-copy insertion transgenes or using the endogenous GFP-tagged sel-5.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for these important comments. We show at several places in the manuscript (Table 1, Figure 1B, D) that sel-5 single mutants do not display any obvious phenotypes on their own; the only phenotype we have uncovered is a mildly penetrant CAN neuron migration defect (Table 1), but we of course cannot exclude that other less apparent phenotypes might be present in the mutants. The ok149 allele was previously characterized by Fares and Greenwald in 1999 as a loss-of-function allele suppressing the lin-12(d) AC/VU defect. We did not test whether the ok363 allele is able to supress lin-12(d) as Notch signalling was not central to our research. We agree that it would be good to verify the localization of the mutated SEL-5 proteins and that single-copy insertion transgenes or endogenous locus mutations would be better for that than overexpressed protein. However, as we have now observed similar rescue with multiple independent extrachromosomal arrays (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2), we feel our results indicate that the kinase activity of sel-5 is not required for our phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Although the excretory canal outgrowth phenotypes caused sel-5, retromer, and some components of the Wnt signaling, are novel, this story is underdeveloped and lacks mechanistic insight. Moreover, some significant genetic interactions are not considered in the model. Specifically:</p><p>4a. egl-20/Wnt mutants have a mild, but significant, overgrowth defect, which suggests that EGL-20 acts in parallel to LIN-44 as a &quot;stop&quot; signal (more on this below). This is not mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of EGL-20 on canal growth is now included in both the Results and Discussion sections together with the novel findings arising from additional mutant combinations – see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b. mig-1/Fzd mutants do not display an excretory canal outgrowth phenotype, however mig-1 loss significantly suppressed the reduced outgrowth caused by loss of cfz-2/Fzd. Moreover, mig-1 did not synergize with egl-20. These results, which are not further discussed, are consistent with a model where egl-20/Wnt and mig-1/Fzd act in a pathway (in parallel to lin-44/Wnt and lin-17/Fzd) as a &quot;stop&quot; signal, and also consistent with a model where even mild disruption of the &quot;stop&quot; signal can overcome defects caused by loss of a &quot;go&quot; signal mediated by cwn-2/Wnt and cfz-2/Fzd. Further genetic interactions (e.g., egl-20 and/or mig-1 mutations with lin-17, which displays a less penetrant phenotype than lin-44) would strengthen this model.</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciated this feedback as the incorporation of additional Wnt/Frizzled combinations in our analyses brought novel information about Wnt signals involved in excretory canal extension and helped to complement our model. We included several new combinations of Wnt pathway mutants, namely lin-17; egl-20, mig-1 lin-17, cwn-1; cfz-2 and cwn-2; cfz-2 (Figure 6B). Based on the observed phenotypes of these mutants we have modified the text and adjusted our model (Figure 7B) accordingly. Text changes were made in the Abstract, Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>The last sentence in the Abstract now states the following: “We further establish that Wnt proteins CWN-1 and CWN-2 together with Frizzled receptor CFZ-2 positively regulate excretory cell outgrowth, while LIN-44/Wnt and LIN-17/Frizzled together generate a stop signal inhibiting its extension.”</p><p>The following text is now in the Results section:</p><p>“Surprisingly, the loss of egl-20 and mig-1 also partially rescued the canal overgrowth in lin-17 even though neither of them displayed canal shortening on its own, while at the same time mig-1 suppressed canal shortening in cfz-2. Most prominent canal shortening was observed in either cwn-1; cfz-2 or cwn-2; cfz-2 double mutants (Figure 6B). Apart from shortening, three instead of two posterior canal branches were detected in 11% of cwn-1; cfz-2 and 15% of cwn-2; cfz-2 double mutants (Figure 6C).”</p><p>The following text about the role of EGL-20 and MIG-1 in canal outgrowth is now included in the Discussion section:</p><p>“The role of two other Wnt signalling components, egl-20 and mig-1, is less clear. No effect (mig-1) or only very mild overgrowth defect (egl-20) is observed in single mutants. However, both egl-20 and mig-1 significantly rescue the overgrowth phenotype of lin-17 mutants, while at the same time, mig-1 can suppress the shortening of canals in cfz-2 mutants. EGL-20-producing cells are localized around the rectum (Whangbo et al., 1999; Harterink et al., 2011), exactly where the excretory canals stop, while LIN-44 is expressed more posteriorly (Herman et al., 1995; Harterink et al., 2011). A possible explanation could thus be that while LIN-44 provides a general posterior repulsive signal, EGL-20 fine-tunes the exact stopping position of the growing canal. The role of different Wnts and Frizzleds in excretory canal outgrowth is summarized in Figure 7B.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Implicating EGL-20/Wnt as part of the &quot;stop&quot; signal would allow the authors to use previously-published endogenously-tagged EGL-20 reporters (Pani and Goldstein, 2018) to assess whether the non-autonomous function of sel-5 in QL.d migration and excretory canal outgrowth is related to Wnt secretion, which would provide some mechanistic insight into SEL-5 function. In this regard, I also note that there is a transgenic CWN-2::Venus reporter that could be used to visualize CWN-2/Wnt accumulation in sel-5 mutants (rescue of the cwn-2 excretory canal defect by this transgene should be tested before using).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an effect on Wnt secretion is a plausible scenario for SEL-5 function. We have therefore generated endogenously-tagged EGL-20::GFP line and assessed EGL-20 gradient formation in control, sel-5, vps-29 and sel-5 vps-29 mutants. Our data, presented in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2, do not support a prominent role of SEL-5 in EGL-20 secretion. It would be interesting to perform the same analysis also for the other Wnts taking part in the excretory cell length regulation, especially CWN-1 and CWN-2. However, the excretory cell phenotypes of sel-5 vps-29 and Wnt mutants are more consistent with a SEL-5/VPS-29 requirement prior to the Wnt-sensitive step, which would argue against a role of SEL-5/VPS-29 in secretion. See also response to Reviewer 2 point 2.</p><p>The following text is now in the Results section:</p><p>“Our tissue-specific rescue experiments revealed that for a full rescue, simultaneous sel-5 expression is necessary from both egl-20 and hlh-1 promoters. SEL-5 could therefore regulate endocytosis along the EGL-20 transport route, thus shaping the EGL-20 gradient. To test this hypothesis, we endogenously tagged EGL-20 with GFP and assessed Wnt gradient formation in control and mutant backgrounds. This approach has been used previously and revealed that extracellular EGL-20 can be detected in the form of distinct puncta that most likely represent EGL-20 bound to Frizzled (Pani and Goldstein, 2018). We detected EGL-20 puncta in all strains tested, albeit with different frequencies (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2A-C). While the number of EGL-20 puncta in sel-5 mutants was not significantly different from the one in control animals, in sel-5 vps-29 mutants the number of puncta was substantially reduced. However, statistical evaluation did not reveal significant differences between vps-29, sel-5 vps-29 and vps-35; although a decreasing trend in puncta number was visible (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2C). In vps-35, the EGL-20 gradient was shown to be highly reduced or absent (Coudreuse et al., 2006; Harterink et al., 2011b) and was used for comparison. We also compared the signal intensity in the EGL-20 spots among the different strains but no significant differences were detected (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2D). Our data thus do not support the notion that sel-5 significantly affects EGL-20 gradient formation.”</p><p>The following text is now in the Discussion section:</p><p>“EGL-20 gradient analyses did not detect significant differences between wild type and sel-5 animals, but also not between vps-29 and sel-5 vps-29 in the number of EGL-20 puncta despite the almost 8-fold difference in the QL.d migration phenotype penetrance between these two mutants. This would argue against a SEL-5 role in secretion. However, it is still possible that even a small decrease in secretion efficiency in vps-29 could substantially decrease the frequency of reaching the EGL-20 concentration threshold required to initiate QL migration and such a decrease may not be captured by our assay. A direct correlation between the amount of EGL-20 and the QL.d phenotype would be necessary to answer this question.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Focusing on mig-10 here is confusing. I do not agree that &quot;So far, the most studied pathway regulating excretory canal outgrowth is the one involving UNC-53 […], ABI-1 […], and MIG-10&quot;, as many other pathways have been implicated in excretory canal outgrowth and guidance (i.e., Slit/Robo, FGFR, Rho/Rac signaling, the Par polarity pathway, etc.). The authors mention that thus far ligands/receptors that might regulate a UNC-53/ABI-1/MIG-10 are not known, thus perhaps they're suggesting that Wnt signaling would play this role. However, no work is presented to support this model.

In particular, the detailed and complete analysis of excretory canal defects in Wnt pathway mutants allowed the authors to propose an intriguing model describing a novel role for Wnt signaling in canal outgrowth. I also very much appreciate the more detailed analysis of the dpy-23(mew25) allele, which I think lends stronger support to their conclusion that DPY-23/AP2 phosphorylation by SEL-5/AAK1 is not the mechanism by which sel-5 regulates Wnt signaling.</p><p>However, I do have some concerns on the interpretation of new data re: the EGL-20/Wnt gradient presented in Figure 3, Supplement 2 (In general, I will note that the figures were not labelled in the manuscript; so, it was quite difficult to know what Figure I was looking at when reading the paper). The authors use two criteria to measure the EGL-20 gradient: number of EGL-20 puncta (Figure 3, Supp. 2, C) and signal intensity (Figure 3, Supp. 2, D), and found that neither sel-5 or vps-29 mutations (they do not specify which alleles were used for this experiment, at least I could not find it in the main text, figure legend, methods, or strain table) on their own significantly decreased the number or intensity of particles seen, while the double mutant had significantly fewer particles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the missing allele, it is the ok149 allele and it is now stated in the Figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, I don't think that the number or intensity of EGL-20 puncta on their own provides an accurate description of a gradient. A gradient is not only defined by the total amount of morphogen, but also how the concentration of this morphogen is distributed over distance, and the authors do not include any distance measures in their quantifications. I would argue, based on the representative images shown, that the EGL-20 gradient is indeed quite reduced in sel-5 and vps-29 mutants, because the extent of EGL-20 puncta in these mutants seems to be much shorter than in wildtype. Maybe a good measurement to include is distance from the rectum to the furthest anterior brightest puncta? In conclusion, based on the pictures shown, I agree that sel-5 is likely not significantly affecting the total amount of EGL-20 secreted, but I do not agree that the gradient (which should include a measure of the extent of spread) is unchanged.</p><p>I also don't think that the EGL-20 gradient should go under the section titled &quot;SEL-5 does not affect MIG-14 endocytosis&quot;. Instead a new section titled &quot;SEL-5 affects the EGL-20 gradient&quot; (or &quot;does not affect&quot; depending on how the new measurements of gradient that incorporate distance turn out) should be added, and these figures should be part of the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the measurements of the length of the EGL-20 gradient as suggested and indeed, the gradient is shorter in the sel-5 vps-29 double mutants. However, there is no statistically significant difference between gradient length in vps-29 and sel-5 vps-29 or vps-35 mutants despite the big difference in the migration phenotype. This is mostly because the gradient lenght in vps-29 is highly variable. It seems plausible that in vps-29 the Wnt secretion is variable and therefore, with some frequency, there is enough EGL-20 reaching to the Q neuroblast and the Wnt pathway is activated, while in the sel-5 vps-29 double mutants the variability in EGL-20 secretion adds-up with a slight decrease in EGL-20 spreading efficiency caused by sel-5 and the gradient does not reach far enough to activate the pathway. However, since at the moment we are not able to directly correlate the length of the gradient and the migration phenotype and since we do not know the mechanism explaining how SEL-5 could reduce EGL-20 spreading, we do not want to over-interpret the phenotype.</p><p>The following changes have been made:</p><p>Original Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 is now Figure 4 and it has been moved to the main text, the new data are part of the Figure 4 as panel 4E. All subsequent Figures have been re-numbered. The text is now moved to a separate section entitled “SEL-5 helps to shape the EGL-20 gradient”.</p><p>The following text changes have been made:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“SEL-5 helps to shape the EGL-20 gradient</p><p>Our tissue-specific rescue experiments revealed that for a full rescue, simultaneous sel-5 expression is necessary from both egl-20 and hlh-1 promoters. SEL-5 could therefore regulate endocytosis along the EGL-20 transport route, thus shaping the EGL-20 gradient. To test this hypothesis, we endogenously tagged EGL-20 with GFP and assessed Wnt gradient formation in control and mutant backgrounds. This approach has been previously used and revealed that extracellular EGL-20 can be detected in the form of distinct puncta that most likely represent EGL-20 bound to Frizzled (Pani and Goldstein, 2018). We detected EGL-20 puncta in all strains tested, albeit with different frequencies (Figure 4A-C). While the number of EGL-20 puncta in sel-5 mutants was not significantly different from that in control animals, in sel-5 vps-29 mutants the number of puncta was substantially reduced. However, statistical evaluation did not reveal significant differences between vps-29, sel-5 vps-29 and vps-35; although a decreasing trend in puncta number was visible (Figure 4C). In vps-35, the EGL-20 gradient was shown to be highly reduced or absent (Coudreuse et al., 2006; Harterink et al., 2011b) and was used for comparison. We also compared the signal intensity in the EGL-20 spots among the different strains but no significant differences were detected (Figure 4D). Finally, we assessed the length of the gradient by measuring how far from the rectum the EGL-20 puncta can be detected. While EGL-20 gradient formation in neither sel-5 nor vps-29 was significantly affected, the EGL-20 gradient was shorter in vps-29 sel-5 double mutants than in wild type controls (Figure 4E). Our data thus support the notion that sel-5 plays a subtle role in EGL-20 gradient formation.”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“However, the effect of SEL-5 on a different endocytic cargo cannot be excluded. We detected significant shortening of the EGL-20 gradient in the sel-5 vps-29 mutants. Given that SEL-5 is required both in the EGL-20-producing cells and in the muscle for QL.d migration, it is possible that some receptors that serve as a sink for EGL-20 are incorrectly accumulated at the plasma membrane and thus partially hinder EGL-20 spreading. In case of the excretory canal extension, SEL-5 could regulate the turnover of guidance receptors at the plasma membrane of the growing tip.”</p><p>“SEL-5 could thus affect Wnt secretion in the case of QL.d migration or new guidance receptor delivery to the plasma membrane in the case of the excretory canals. EGL-20 gradient analyses revealed gradient shortening in sel-5 vps-29 mutants. However, no significant differences in the number of EGL-20 puncta were detected between wild type and sel-5 animals, but also not between vps-29 and sel-5 vps-29, despite the almost 8-fold difference in the QL.d migration phenotype penetrance between these two mutants. This would argue against a role for SEL-5 in secretion. Shorter gradient in the double mutants could thus more likely arise from a combination of partially reduced EGL-20 secretion caused by vps-29 and a partial reduction of EGL-20 spreading caused by a possible sel-5-dependent membrane retention of a receptor acting as an EGL-20 sink. A direct correlation between the amount of EGL-20, the range of the EGL-20 gradient and the QL.d phenotype would be necessary to explain the phenotypic differences between the various mutants. More experiments will thus be required to establish how SEL-5 exerts its function.”</p><p>The Figure legend has been updated: (“E) The length of the EGL-20 gradient was assessed in the same images as in (C). The distance from the rectum to the most distant clearly recognizable EGL-20 particle was measured in blinded images. Measurement was repeated three times; the values were averaged and plotted as a single data point. For (C, D and E) Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to assess statistical significance. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied. * p-value &lt; 0.005,** p-value &lt; 0.001, error bars represent 95% confidence interval, only statistically significant differences shown in (C and E), no statistically significant differences revealed in (D)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, I was satisfied by most changes in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Copy-editing was needed.
