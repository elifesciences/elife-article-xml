and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are the only members of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily in mammals that open upon hyperpolarization, conferring them pacemaker properties that are instrumental for rhythmic firing of cardiac and neuronal cells. Activation of their voltage-sensor domains (VSD) upon hyperpolarization occurs through a downward movement of the S4 helix bearing the gating charges, which triggers a break in the alpha-helical hydrogen bonding pattern at the level of a conserved Serine residue. Previous structural and molecular simulation studies had however failed to capture pore opening that should be triggered by VSD activation, presumably because of a low VSD/pore electromechanical coupling efficiency and the limited timescales accessible to such techniques. Here, we have used advanced modeling strategies, including enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations exploiting comparisons between non-domain swapped voltage-gated ion channel structures trapped in closed and open states to trigger pore gating and characterize electromechanical coupling in HCN1. We propose that the coupling mechanism involves the reorganization of the interfaces between the VSD helices, in particular S4, and the pore-forming helices S5 and S6, subtly shifting the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in a ‘domino effect’ during activation and gating in this region. Remarkably, our simulations reveal state-dependent occupancy of lipid molecules at this emergent coupling interface, suggesting a key role of lipids in hyperpolarization-dependent gating. Our model provides a rationale for previous observations and a possible mechanism for regulation of HCN channels by the lipidic components of the membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular modeling</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated ion channel</kwd><kwd>electromechanical coupling</kwd><kwd>lipid-protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science for Life Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gustafsson foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-04905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-02433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-04305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35NS116850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chanda</surname><given-names>Baron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Austrian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J4652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burtscher</surname><given-names>Verena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The HCN1 channel gates thanks to a coupling mechanism involving the reorganization of the interfaces between the voltage-sensor domains and pore helices, subtly shifting the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions in a 'domino effect'.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperpolarized-activated and cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, also known as pacemaker channels, are non-selective cation channels located at the plasma membrane of pacemaker cells in the heart and brain. These channels are crucial to control the rhythmic activity in many cell types and further regulate cellular excitability in a wide range of electrically excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santoro et al., 1998</xref>). The ability to drive rhythmically firing action potentials stems from the unusual and characteristic channel activation under membrane hyperpolarization. Given their ubiquity in excitable organs and unique role in electrical signaling, HCN channels have been implicated in a variety of diseases (e.g. heart arrhythmias, epilepsies, and neuropathic pain) and are considered as promising targets for the development of novel drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benarroch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bleakley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiFrancesco and DiFrancesco, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiFrancesco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oyrer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanguay et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>HCN channels are members of the voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) superfamily, and as such form tetrameric assemblies around a central pore that opens and closes in response to changes in the transmembrane voltage. Each monomer is composed of six transmembrane helices divided into two domains: the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is a four-helical bundle formed by the first four helices (S1–S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2005</xref>) while the pore domain is formed by tetramerization of the final two helices (S5 and S6) around the symmetry axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>HCN and other VGICs are allosteric systems where movement of gating charges in the VSD upon changes in electric field governs opening and closing of the pore gate located &gt;10 Å away at the C-terminus of the S6 helix in a process known as electromechanical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blunck and Batulan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the polarity of the coupling in HCN channels is inverted relative to nearly all other VGICs; HCN channels are opened by the downward movement of the gating charges during hyperpolarization, whereas most other channels are closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Männikkö et al., 2002</xref>). Inverted electromechanical coupling is central to the role of HCN channels in pacemaking, but the molecular mechanisms underlying inverted coupling have remained elusive.</p><p>The first high-resolution structures of HCN1 revealed that, unlike canonical VGICs, HCN channels adopt a non-domain swapped architecture where the VSD packs against the pore domain of the same subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). This unusual fold is not unique to HCN channels but rather is characteristic of the subfamily of channels containing a C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) connected to the pore via the C-linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">James and Zagotta, 2018</xref>). Other members of this family include the depolarization-activated KCNH subfamily, such as ether-á-go-go (EAG) and human EAG-related gene (hERG), and voltage-insensitive cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A flood of new structures in addition to the functional and computational studies they fueled have revealed new atomistic details of voltage sensing and pore gating for numerous members of the CNBD family including HCN channels. HCN1 structures were obtained in resting and activated conformations of the VSD but the pore remained closed in both models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>). The model for VSD activation from these structures agrees with predictions from cysteine accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2004</xref>), patch-clamp fluorometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2019</xref>), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasimova et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, structures of HCN4 have been resolved in both the closed and open state, but in both cases, the VSD is in the resting conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>). Together, the HCN1 and HCN4 structures represent three out of the four states in a classical allosteric model of channel gating; the resting-closed, activated-closed, and resting-open conformations. The missing activated-open state is central to understanding the electromechanical coupling mechanism in the HCN family.</p><p>Unfortunately, even with a structure of the activated-open state in hand, the weak nature of the VSD-pore coupling in these channels limits our ability to make inferences about the coupling pathway. The experimentally measured coupling energy of only 3–4.5 kcal/mol indicates that activation of all four voltage sensors only increases the stability of the open pore relative to the closed pore by roughly one hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ryu and Yellen, 2012</xref>). Given this weak coupling, it is important to not only examine the static structures themselves, but also the structural ensembles and dynamics of the interactions comprising each state.</p><p>In this work, we use a stepwise approach to build an understanding of the electromechanical coupling pathway in HCN1. First, we characterize state-specific interactions by analyzing MD simulations of existing cryoEM structures under equilibrium and activating conditions. We then use a small subset of the interactions likely to stabilize the activated-open channel in enhanced sampling simulations to drive the electromechanical coupling process. Gathering the results, we propose an electromechanical coupling model that relies on a fine-tuned balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions at the voltage-sensor and pore domain interface. Notably, by characterizing the state-dependent interactions between lipids and the channel domains, we propose an important role for amphiphilic membrane components, rationalizing the effect of changes in membrane composition on the function of this channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>State-dependent interactions between VSD and pore domain in HCN1 models</title><p>In the current model for VSD activation in HCN channels, hyperpolarization triggers a downward motion of S4 coupled to a kinking of the helix at S272. This breaks S4 into two sub-helices with the lower segment becoming almost parallel to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). This non-canonical voltage sensing mechanism is supported by both experimental and computational studies combined with the cryoEM structure of the activated state stabilized by cysteine cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vemana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasimova et al., 2019</xref>). An additional structure was resolved for the functionally locked-open Y289D mutant, in which the gating charges are in a resting state and the pore is closed, but the lower S5 helix swivels away from S6 relative to the position in the wild-type channel in a manner similar to the activated state structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>). While the mechanism of VSD activation is well established, the mechanism by which this voltage sensor movement triggers pore opening remains poorly understood as the activated-open state of HCN has not been determined.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Position and contact network of W281.</title><p>The three cryoEM structures of the resting (<bold>A;</bold> PDB ID 5U6P), intermediate (<bold>B;</bold> PDB ID 6UQG), and activated (<bold>C;</bold> PDB ID 6UQF) states of hHCN1, shown in blue, yellow, and red, respectively, were investigated by equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

To help understand which state-dependent interactions stabilize each of the conformations observed in cryoEM, we carried out 1-µs-MD simulations of the resting, activated, and Y289D mutant conformations under equilibrium conditions (0 mV).</p><p>A comparison between structures of the resting, activated, and Y289D mutant structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), preliminary exploratory MD simulations, and a putative important role of the W281-N300 contact in determining the polarity of HCN1 coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramentol et al., 2020</xref>) highlighted W281 in the lower half of S4 as a potentially critical residue in gating, prompting us to further analyze its state-dependent interaction pattern. In the resting state, W281 is facing S1 and nestled in a hydrophobic cavity formed at the interface between S4, S1, and the HCN domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and remains stably bound at this position throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, blue bars). This conformation of W281 is stabilized by extensive hydrophobic interactions with S1 and the HCN domain in addition to an electrostatic contact with S1 for &gt;50% of the simulation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>In the activated state, the intracellular S1-S4-S5 region becomes much less compact and W281 is pulled out of the hydrophobic cavity, disrupting all interactions with S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A new interaction with the pore domain is formed via V296 in S5, but the overall protein contact of W281 is significantly reduced in the activated state. As a result, W281 primarily interacts with lipids (POPC) in the activated state through hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts.</p><p>The side-chain orientation and contacts formed by W281 in the Y289D mutant retain aspects of both the resting and activated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While W281 remains close to S1, the interaction network with S1 is significantly altered relative to the resting state. Furthermore, the strong interaction with the HCN domain enclosing W281 in a hydrophobic cavity in the resting state is disrupted in the mutant. These differences stem from the rotation W281 to an orientation more similar to the activated state of the VSD. Rotation of W281 enables increased contacts with lipids and the pore domain similar to the activated state but interaction with S5 occurs via N300 in addition to the V296 contact observed in the activated state.</p><p>As a result of the mixed set of W281 contacts shared with the resting and activated states, the structure of the Y289D mutant can be described as an ‘intermediate state’ conformation for VSD activation. The rotation of W281 resembles the activated state, but the interactions with S1 retain the compact nature of the S1-S4-S5 region similar to the resting state. This configuration is quite interesting as the Y289D mutant retains many characteristics of the VSD-pore interactions of the activated state despite the fact that the gating charges are in their resting position and S4 does not adopt the characteristic bend associated with voltage sensor activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamics of VSD-pore interactions upon voltage sensor activation</title><p>The state-dependent VSD-pore interactions correlated with rotation of the C-terminus of S4 at W281 outlined above hint at a possible functional role in electromechanical coupling. To gain insight into the evolution of these state-dependent interactions over the course of channel activation, we simulated the resting state under a hyperpolarizing transmembrane potential. We used three new strategies in an attempt to further accelerate VSD activation compared to our previous study in hopes of driving the channel to the activated-open state. First, we started from the cAMP-bound configuration of the CNBD, which has previously been shown to allosterically promote both pore opening and VSD activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusch et al., 2010</xref>). Next, we increased the magnitude of the membrane potential to –1 V (compared to –550 mV previously used). This should reduce the time constant for activation from 23 µs to 3 µs based on our previous kinetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasimova et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, we simulated an additional system lacking the HCN-domain (called hereafter HCND-less system), which has previously been suggested to inhibit VSD activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>). This is consistent with our results above where the HCN domain acts as a lid enclosing W281 in a hydrophobic cavity in the resting state.</p><p>In the intact system, full activation occurs in only one VSD as marked by movement of R267 past the charge transfer center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Partial activation as seen by movement of R270 past the charge transfer center occurs in one subunit while the remaining two VSDs show little to no displacement.

This is consistent with an accelerated voltage sensor activation compared to the intact system expected by relieving inhibition of activation provided by the HCN domain. However, the wider distribution of bending angles in S4 for the system lacking the HCN domain indicates that the HCN domain may also contribute to stabilizing the activated state of S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>).</p><p>During VSD activation, downward movement of the gating charges and bending of S4 is correlated with rotation of the C-terminus of S4, pointing W281 toward the lipid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). In subunits undergoing complete activation, a more complete rotation of the C-terminus of S4 results in the formation of a hydrogen bond between W281 and N300 that was observed in the Y289D mutant above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>), consistent with equilibrium simulations of the activated state of HCN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, swapping these two residues inverts the gating polarity in the related spHCN channel (W355N/N370W, spHCN numbering). The proposed basis of this inverted coupling was a similar rotation of the lower S4 helix as we observed, but driven by the introduction of a hydrophobic mismatch of the mutations rather than activation of the voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramentol et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In our simulations of VSD activation, rotation of W281 is accompanied by an increase in the hydrophobic contact area at the lower S4/S5 interface with little change to the electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and E</xref>), reminiscent of the behavior observed in equilibrium simulations of the resting and activated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the other hand, analysis of the lower S4-S1 interface showed a decrease in the hydrophobic contacts between S4 and S1 in most (seven out of eight) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and F</xref>). This suggests that separation of the S1/S4 interface is one of the first steps toward the release of W281 from the S1/S4/HCN domain hydrophobic pocket and enabling rotation of the C-terminus of S4.</p><p>The combined bending and rotation of the lower S4 accompanies the displacement of S1 away from S4 and exposes the VSD-pore interface to the lipid bilayer. As a result, an increased number of contacts between lipid tails and hydrophobic residues on S4 and S5 accompanies VSD activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The average number of POPC carbon atoms in contact with the lower S4/S5 interface is ~24 ± 7 in the resting state versus ~40 ± 7 in the activated state equilibrium simulation. This increase in lipidic contact upon activation is preserved whether the HCN domain is present or absent. Thus, lipid tails preferentially contact the VSD/pore interface in the activated state of the voltage sensor, indicating that lipid tails may play a role in electromechanical coupling in HCN1. This may help reconcile the fact that the cryoEM structure of HCN1 with an activated voltage sensor as well as the Y289D mutant in detergent remained closed despite functional evidence suggesting that these channels should remain open at 0 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite the combination of three strategies to accelerate activation, the pore gate remained shut throughout these simulations. This is unsurprising given the slow intrinsic gating of the pore and the weak electromechanical coupling in the HCN family. Even in the presence of four activated voltage sensors, the closed to open pore transition for HCN1 has a time constant of ~100 ms based on allosteric models of channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altomare et al., 2001</xref>). Consequently, the pore opening process is far outside the current range of unbiased MD simulations for HCN1. We thus set out to further analyze state-dependent interactions in an attempt to pinpoint those that may help favor pore opening, to then be able to use them in enhanced sampling simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Displacement of S5 during VSD activation alters interaction between S4-S5 linker and C-linker</title><p>As a result of the bending and rotation of S4 during VSD activation, the N-terminal end of S5 is displaced relative to the resting state conformation in a movement that was previously observed in MD simulations and cryoEM structures. Interestingly, the N-terminus of S5 is similarly displaced in the Y289D mutant cryoEM structure despite lack of VSD activation in this channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The C-linker directly connects the CNBD to the S6 activation gate and has previously been identified to play a role in electromechanical coupling based on functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2021</xref>); therefore, we suspected these activation-induced interactions may help drive channel opening.</p><p>The interaction between D290 of the S4-S5 linker and K412 of the C-linker is of particular interest given the clear state-specificity to both the active and intermediate states. The absence of this interaction in the resting state stems in part from the large distance between the positions of the backbones of these residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The tilting of S5 caused by activation or the Y289D mutation brings the D290-K412 positions in close proximity and enables stable salt bridge formation.</p><p>Interestingly, the D290-K412 distance in the original model of the activated VSD-closed pore conformation is close to the distance observed in the resting state structure. However, this distance decreases rapidly in the first few picoseconds of simulations of the activated VSD-closed pore structure and the resulting interaction remains stable for the majority of the trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We thus hypothesize this interaction is involved in coupling VSD movement to gate opening through the C-linker.</p><p>Given that this interaction was not observed in the cryoEM structure of the activated VSD, we sought to experimentally validate the D290-K412 interaction in the activated-open state of the channel. Cysteine-crossbridging has been a successful approach to probe state-dependent interactions in HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rothberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>). In this technique, pairs of residues are mutated to cysteine and then exposed to cadmium, which will form high-affinity bonds between the thiolate groups provided the distance between residues is in the range of 6–8 Å. If the suspected interaction is state-specific, it will ‘lock’ the channel in the corresponding functional state.</p><p>The HEK cells expressing D290C-K412C double mutant in the absence of cadmium conduct a relatively high basal current and activate at depolarized potentials compared to the HCN1-EM parent constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Much of this basal current can be blocked by application of external cesium chloride, indicating that the D290C-K412C mutant does not fully close even in the absence of applied cadmium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Disrupting the D290-K412 interaction is expected to destabilize the open state based on our simulations above, in contrast to the observed rightward shift in the activation curve and increase in basal activity we observe in the D290C-K412C mutation. The enhanced apparent stability of the open state in the D290C-K412C mutant may be due to spontaneous disulfide bond formation during the patch experiment or from disruption of closed-state-specific interactions of these residues.</p><p>In HEK cells patched with 100 uM cadmium chloride in the pipette, the basal conductance increases substantially to 0.77 ± 0.7 compared to 0.44 ± 0.4 in the absence of cadmium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, the voltage dependence of activation shifts by 60 mV to more positive potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This is not observed in the wild-type channel in the presence of cadmium, which only displays a minor rightward shift in the activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The combined increase in the basal current amplitude and rightward shift in the voltage-dependence of activation in the double cysteine mutant in the presence of cadmium strongly indicates that crossbridging these positions preferentially stabilizes the open state, in agreement with our hypothesis that the D290-K412 interaction promotes channel opening.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Driving electromechanical coupling in enhanced sampling simulations</title><p>In all of our simulations described above, the S6 activation gate remained tightly closed and dehydrated for the entirety of the simulation. To gain insights into gating transitions of the HCN1 pore, we turned to enhanced sampling simulations in which pore opening was encouraged by the application of biasing forces. In previous sections, we had identified several interactions that are likely involved in stabilizing the activated voltage sensor and/or open pore. The W281-N300 pair at the S4/S5 interface stabilizes the rotation of the C-terminus of S4 on activation. Interaction between D290-K412 on the S4-S5 linker and C-linker promotes the bending of S5 away from the resting conformation, loosening the packing against the closed state of S6. In addition, a structural comparison of pairs of closed and open structures of CNBD channels revealed that distances between V390 consistently increased upon pore opening in TAX-4; this distance increases from 10.6 to 17.2 Å (PDB IDs 6WEJ-6WEK), in CNGA1 from 9.6 to 16.4 Å (PDB IDs 7LFT-7LFW), in CNGA1/B1 from 9.8 to 15.1 Å (PDB IDs 7RH9-7RHH), in EAG/hERG from 10.7 to 17.3 Å (PDB IDs 5KL7L-5VA1), and in HCN4 from 10.5 to 15.0 Å (PDB IDs 7NP4-7NP3).

We introduced these ratchet-like biases to encourage the formation of interactions between N300-W281 and D290-K412 and discourage interactions between V390-V390 cross- and neighboring pairs, in 1 µs ABMD simulations starting from the HCN1 resting/closed state (two replicates) and from the HCN1 activated/closed state (two replicates).</p><p>During these simulations, we observed a splaying apart of the S6 helices, with a hinge forming around G382, and a rotation and slight deformation of the helix bringing V390 from a position facing the pore lumen to a position still lining the inner vestibule in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This event is coupled to an increase in the pore radius at the V390 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and an increased hydration of the pore intracellular gate, enabling the conduction of several K<sup>+</sup> ions (1–3 ion permeation events in each simulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The rearrangement of S6 also induced the formation of other interactions between adjacent S6 helices: in particular, a contact between H392 and adjacent Q398 formed during the ABMD simulation initiated in the activated/closed state, even though the formation of these contacts was not explicitly encouraged in the biasing simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Our data also suggest that other contacts could be specifically formed in the open channel, like between E282 from S4 and R404 from the adjacent C-linker. Thus, we suggest that the H392-Q398 contact (and possibly of the other aforementioned contacts with E282 and R404) should be formed to induce pore widening and stabilize the open conformation in HCN1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Energetic basis for electromechanical coupling</title><p>Calculations of the intra-subunit contact areas between S6 (from residue 386–401) and S5 (lower segment) showed a slight reinforcement of the hydrophobic contact area in the open model and ABMD simulations of HCN1, indicating that closure/opening may be related to changes of interfaces between pore-forming helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). By contrast, the adjacent S6-S6 hydrophobic interfaces are substantially weakened, suggesting that the enlargement of the pore radius requires an increased distance between S6 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In addition, the formation of specific interactions between polar/charged residues at the S4/S5/S6 interface accompany pore opening, most notably between R297 (S5) and E282 (S4) and between R297 (S5) and H392 (S6), which is coupled to a loss of contact of interactions between R297 and lipid headgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

Indeed, lipids tended to bind in two separate sites (sites A and B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>), located on opposite sides of the S4/S5/S6 interface. In both of these sites, contacts with polar or charged residues were increased in the activated state relative to the resting one and involved a larger number of lipids. Site B specifically engaged VSD residues, including S4 gating charges. Site A, located on the opposite side of the VSD/pore interface, on the other hand, engaged in addition residues on S5 (R297) and on S6 (H392). During pore opening in the ABMD simulations initiated in the activated state, the interactions between the innermost S4/S5/S6 region and lipid headgroups remained largely identical to those pinpointed in the activated state. The only large reduction in interaction concerned R297, which interacted strongly with POPC headgroups in the resting state, substantially less in the activated/closed state and almost lost all contacts in the activated/open state. Interestingly, H392, pinpointed as crucial for pore gating above, is located in the middle of the sequence corresponding to the inner constriction on S6 and is highly conserved in the HCN family. Its position at the lipid interface allows it to be flexible. Thus, this residue is capable of making contacts both with R297 on S5, and with a POPC headgroup from the lower bilayer leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), sometimes engaging in a ternary interaction with both binding partners. In fact, both the H392-R297 contact and the contact between H392 and lipid headgroups are reinforced in the activated state, while the contact between H392 and lipids is again broken in the open state, confirming that these contacts are likely involved in activation and opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Interactions between the lower S4/S5/S6 region of HCN1 and the lipid headgroups are state-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Contact area between lower S4/S5/S6 protein residues and lipid headgroups averaged over the four subunits and over the simulation time, in the resting (blue), activated (red), and adiabatic bias molecular dynamics (ABMD) simulations (A1/A2 in purple and orchid) starting from the activated state.

Overall, these observations imply that activation and following opening of HCN1 are also driven by a combination of forces: on the one hand, hydrophobic forces reinforce the intra-subunit S4/S5/S6 interface, while on the other hand, the positioning of lipid headgroups in contact with hydrophilic residues located at this interface also guides the positioning of lipid tails that contribute to the overall hydrophobic region.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The slow intrinsic gating and weak coupling between the VSD and pore presents a substantial challenge for characterizing the electromechanical coupling pathway in HCN channels with computational methods. While voltage sensor activation can be dramatically accelerated with an electric field, pore opening is only indirectly influenced through allosteric interaction via the electromechanical coupling pathway. Due to the weak coupling energy in HCN channels, the ability of the voltage sensors to expedite gating is much more limited than in strongly coupled VGICs such as Shaker. We have circumvented these limitations using state-specific contacts derived from equilibrium simulations on the existing models of HCN1 to drive the electromechanical coupling process using enhanced sampling. Integrating the results from these simulations enables us to propose a model for electromechanical coupling in HCN channels that builds upon and further refines current models of channel gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hydrophobic domino-effect model of HCN1 gating upon activation.</title><p>Hyperpolarization triggers the downward and breaking movement of S4 at S272 and initiates a cascade of rearrangements of the hydrophobic interfaces between and within the voltage-sensor domains (VSD) and pore. First, W281 is pulled out of a S1/HCND hydrophobic cavity leading the lower S4 helix to rotate and form of new contacts with N300 on S5 (step 1). This is accompanied by an increase in the hydrophobic interface between the lower S4, S5, and the surrounding lipid tails. These interactions and the formation of the D290-K412 contact between the S4-S5 linker and the C-linker result in a slight bending of S5 away from S6 as hydrophobic contacts between S5 and S6 form. Lipid contacts at this interface are also increased (step 2). This results in hinging of S6 and a rotation of V390 away from the pore axis, opening of a conductive hydrophilic pathway along the pore axis. The open conformation is stabilized by interactions between R297 (S5) and E282 (S4), between R297 (S5) and H392 (S6), and between H392 and Q398, D401, and R404 from the adjacent subunit (step 3).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80303-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>From the resting state of HCN1, hyperpolarization drives downward movement of the gating charges and helix-breakage at S272 and initiates a cascade of rearrangements of the hydrophobic interfaces between and within the VSD and pore. This hydrophobic ‘domino effect’ starts when W281 is pulled out of a hydrophobic cavity formed by S1 and the HCN domain, enabling rotation of the lower S4 helix, driving formation of new VSD-pore contacts between W281 (S4) and V296 and N300 (S5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; step 1). This two-step-activation mechanism induces an increase in the hydrophobic interface between the lower S4, S5, and the surrounding lipid tails, thus reinforcing coupling between the VSD and pore as S4 activates. The increased S4/S5 coupling as S4 is displaced from the resting state and the formation of the D290-K412 contact between the S4-S5 linker and the C-linker results in a slight bending of S5 away from S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; step 2) and enables S6 to rotate radially away from the pore axis by hinging at the level of G382 to maintain and even strengthen hydrophobic S5/S6 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; step 3). Rotation of S6 results in an expansion of the pore via the reorientation of V390 away from the pore axis and into a pore-lining position permitting conduction through the open pore. The combined VSD activation and pore opening also allows a reorganization of the lipid molecules in this region, possibly hinting at the fact that this could represent a crucial lipid modulation binding region.</p><p>A two-step mechanism for VSD activation was recently identified in spHCN using VCF and gating currents to track voltage sensor movement on the E356A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). This mutant uncouples the primary gating charge movement from pore opening and reveals a secondary movement of the voltage sensor that correlates with channel opening. This secondary movement may correspond to either the bending or rotation of the lower S4 helix. However, our simulation of the structure of the Y289D uncoupling mutant would suggest that rotation of S4 alone can drive pore opening as the W281-N300 contact is formed but no bend is observed in S4, consistent with the model proposed by the Larsson lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramentol et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, this model for an altered S4/S5 interface upon rotation of the lower S4 also explains how voltage sensor movement can still be coupled to pore gating in channels lacking a covalent linkage between the S4 and S5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn and Zagotta, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on their work with such split channels and extensive mutagenesis, Flynn and Zagotta suggested that the lower S4-S5 interface plays a critical role in stabilizing the closed state of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn and Zagotta, 2018</xref>). Activation of the VSD relieves this inhibitory effect and enables the more favorable open state of S6. Our simulations reveal that pore opening involves a tradeoff between a strengthening of the S5/S6 interface at the expense of a weakening of the S6-S6 interface. This is consistent with previous mutagenesis of a leucine zipper motif between S5 and S6, which demonstrated that disruption of this motif reduces the ability of the VSD to drive pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wemhöner et al., 2012</xref>). While stabilization of the S5/S6 interface upon opening is seemingly at odds with the model of Flynn and Zagotta, this difference can be reconciled by examining the mechanism of S6 gating. Voltage sensor activation displaces the lower S4/S5 interface away from the closed conformation of S6, enabling dilation of the S6 helices. Thus, the resting conformation of S5 sterically hinders this outward and rotating movement of S6, in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flynn and Zagotta, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Past studies on the role of the C-terminus in voltage gating of the channel have yielded mixed results. Truncation studies show the C-linker and CNBD are not necessary for channel activation, but mutagenesis studies have highlighted numerous interactions between the S4-S5 linker and C-terminus critical for electromechanical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Decher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwan et al., 2012</xref>).

The degree of rotation is low enough that V390 still lines the inner vestibule in the open state, consistent with the observation that this position influences the apparent affinity of open pore blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). Pore opening is coupled to deformation of the S6 helix and the formation of a π helix in several subunits. Interestingly, hERG is the only channel of the CNBD family for which the transition to π helix occurs in S6. Other CNBD family members, such as CNG channels, TAX-4, and HCN4, open via a more canonical right-handed twist of S6 at glycine 399 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xue et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2022</xref>). HCN1 may thus feature an opening mechanism that combines features of the CNBD family and those specific to hERG opening. Notably, in the closest homolog of resolved open structure, HCN4, the equivalent of V390 (I511), is rotated slightly but does not induce formation of a π-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although it is possible that the difference observed between the HCN4 cryoEM structure and our simulations of HCN1 represents differences between isoforms, we suggest that this difference may also stem from the different functional states these models represent. The HCN4 structure was solved in the resting VSD conformation, thus corresponding to the resting-open state or the ‘instantaneous’ open state of HCN channels. The instantaneous open state is pharmacologically distinguishable from the activated-open state suggesting structural differences in the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Proenza et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The prevalence of state-dependent lipid interactions favoring the activated VSD and open pore highlights a potential role in electromechanical coupling. Saponaro et al. also report state-dependent lipid binding at the S4/S5/S6 interface in their closed and open structures of HCN4, though they observe lipid density only in the resting-closed state and not in the resting-open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>). A similar lipid density was observed in the resting-closed structure of the hyperpolarization-activated plant channel KAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2020</xref>). Strikingly, a recent study reported recording from the related bacterial channel SthK in bilayers of controlled lipid composition and proposed a mechanism for the regulation of this channel by PA lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidpeter et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, cryoEM structures of this channel in different states where individual lipid molecules were resolved and showed lipid binding to a site containing residues corresponding to R297 and D401 engaged in a salt bridge interaction in the closed state of SthK (HCN1 numbering). This lipid is absent in the open state, and the aforementioned salt bridge is also broken, leading the authors to propose that PA acts in an activatory manner via an unlocking mechanism by binding in the closed state. Mutagenesis of the equivalent positions in HCN2 confirmed that this mechanism is likely conserved in HCN. Consistent with this model, our HCN1 opening simulations reveal reduced contacts between R297 and D401 and lipid headgroups in the activated/closed and in the activated/open state compared to the resting/closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Note, however, that our simulations, conducted in a simple model bilayer of POPC, do not permit to infer the role anionic lipids may play in regulating ion channel gating. Examining the state-dependence of lipid binding at the VSD-pore interface in more complex environments will be crucial for improving our understanding of lipid regulation of HCN channel function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein models</title><p>CryoEM structures of the resting (5U6P), intermediate (mutant Y289D, 6UQG), and the activated (6UQF) states of HCN1 were used as initial snapshots for MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>).

The bath solution contained 130 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 NaOH. The pipette resistance was in the range of 1–2 MΩ, using a pipette solution consisting of 130 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Mg-ATP, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 KOH. For the cysteine-crosslinking experiment, we added 100 µM cadmium to the pipette solution. To allow for equilibration of the cytosol with the pipette solution, we waited at least 2 min after breaking into the cells.</p><p>HCN1-EM-expressing cells were clamped to a holding potential of –30 mV. Substitution of residues D290 and K412 with cysteins resulted in a shift of the half-maximal activation to depolarized potentials. The cells were therefore clamped to a holding potential of +60 mV, a potential at which the channels were in the resting state. To assess the voltage-dependence of activation, we used a two-pulse protocol in which the channels were preconditioned to voltages in the range of +60 mV (HCN1-D290C-K412C) to –140 mV with –20 mV increments, before tail currents at a test pulse of –140 mV, a potential of maximal channel activation, were recorded. The inter-sweep time was set to 30 s to ensure complete deactivation before the next pre-condition pulse was applied. Tail currents recorded herein are transient currents, where the initial current resembles an ensemble current of channels activated during the pre-conditioning pulse, and which increases during the test pulse until the maximal open probability is reached. Thus, the initial current of the tail current plotted as a function of voltage can be used to obtain channel activation. The activation curve was normalized and fitted with a single Boltzmann function: y = (A1 – A0)/(1 + exp ((V – V0.5)/k)) + A0, where A0 and A1 are the minimum and maximum tail current, V0.5 is the potential of half maximal channel activation, V is the membrane potential, and k is the slope factor. In HCN1-D290C-K412C-expressing cells, we observed a high basal activity. To assess whether the basal activity was a result of leak current or due to increased channel activity, we performed cesium-blocking experiments, in which we perfused the cells with 1 mM cesium-containing extracellular solution. Cesium is a potassium channel blocker and inhibits HCN1-mediated currents too. Thus, the remaining current seen during cesium application can be used to assess the leak current, which occurs because of poor seal resistance or through cesium-resistant channels. Data are given as mean ± SEM for the indicated number of experiments (n).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80303-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The files containing the raw data for the modeling/computational part of the study can be found at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/record/7920679#.ZFyJW-zRY-S">https://zenodo.org/record/7920679#.ZFyJW-zRY-S</ext-link> The scripts used to analyze the MD simulations can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elbahnsi/ELIFE-Interplay-between-VSD-pore-and-membrane-lipids-in-electromechanical-coupling-in-HCN-channels">https://github.com/elbahnsi/ELIFE-Interplay-between-VSD-pore-and-membrane-lipids-in-electromechanical-coupling-in-HCN-channels</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:074ed71e3c30c0997e8063c137b93867f0b30f0e;origin=https://github.com/elbahnsi/ELIFE-Interplay-between-VSD-pore-and-membrane-lipids-in-electromechanical-coupling-in-HCN-channels;visit=swh:1:snp:1b3d398cea3fae094efcdab96b3bff7278875c4f;anchor=swh:1:rev:50e5505b8d4300fa9163155b46d0b0fa8dbd7440">swh:1:rev:50e5505b8d4300fa9163155b46d0b0fa8dbd7440</ext-link>).

responsible for activation of a Hyperpolarised-activated and Cyclic Nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel. HCN channels are the only mammalian channels to open under hyperpolarisation, being important for their roles in cardiac and neuronal cells. The authors use enhanced-sampling atomistic simulations to enforce sampling between open and closed states of the channel. The simulations suggest state-dependent interactions involving pore and voltage sensor helices, as well as with lipids, leading the authors to propose a domino-like mechanism of activation. These findings will be of considerable interest to the ion channel community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80303.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Toby W</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04ttjf776</institution-id><institution>RMIT University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.20.492765">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.20.492765v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were supportive of the work and appreciated the mechanistic insights. The main concerns needing to be addressed are listed below, with full details available in the reviews themselves.</p><p>1. The decision to model the open pore of HCN1 using homology with hERG has been questioned. Because the simulations depend critically on this open-state model, it requires validation. It has been suggested that a better choice would have been the available HCN4 open state cryoEM structure. It has also been stated that hERG could be problematic because it does not have a gating hinge in common with HCN and has other sequence differences (such as V390) that may impact the structure of the HCN1 model. The authors should try the HCN4 pore domain to see how such a homology model would compare to the one used.</p><p>2. Provide experimental evidence in the form of existing or new experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of the current open-state HCN1 model that has been used to set the interaction distances to guide simulations. In particular, data is requested that can confirm the relevance of those interaction distances. Also, for D290 – K412, the validation is missing a control (effect of Cd2+ on wildtype).</p><p>3. Provide any available mutagenesis or other data that supports the importance of residues proposed to interact with lipids.</p><p>4. Provide analysis or additional simulation that can address concerns about the reproducibility of simulation results, given only 1 simulation that enforces the chosen simulation distances has been performed. Also, please provide statistical tests to demonstrate an increase vs decrease in key interactions.</p><p>5. Better explain and visualise the proposed mechanism referred to as a &quot;domino effect&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I note that the low-resolution blurry pdf figures provided for review made the reading of details very difficult.</p><p>I must say the figures have not done a good job of explaining the so-called &quot;domino&quot; effect, and perhaps data can be presented alongside a cartoon to explain this, with the domino nature clearly explained, just as the &quot;domino effect&quot; has been explained clearly in pentameric ligand-gated channels, for example.</p><p>Additional comment/question regarding the D290-K412 salt bridge cysteine cross-bridging: Is it possible that this approach might capture rare conformations, where those cysteines may briefly come to within 8 Å and then bind for a long time, despite not being relevant to the wildtype functional state? Irreversible binding (on the experimental timescale) may trap unphysical conformations, reminiscent of what has been previously argued in relation to biotin-avidin experiments examining VSD movements (e.g. Jogini and Roux Biophys J 2007 93:3070), for example. It is not clear to me that the cross-link proves that a wildtype salt bridge is important for the activated state, and why in the main review I ask about possible other experiments to back it up.</p><p>Figure 3c shows some data for D290-K412. I note that supporting timeseries and violin plots like Figure 3C would be useful for all relevant distances, including N300-W281, V390-I302 and others noted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well-written manuscript on a hot topic. The study would attract many readers. But the figures are extremely unclear, the colors are not helpful, and the text in the figures is too small. There are also some other concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. It is not clear why W281 was indicated as a very interesting residue. Is there something different about this residue compared to other residues in the channel? It seems to come out of the blue that this residue is especially interesting to study. Or figure 2 is maybe the true reason of the focus?</p><p>2. Figure 1. W281 interactions with 277-286: are these interactions intersubunit or intrasubunit? If intrasubunit, is it really interesting if neighboring sidechains on an α helix are interacting? Do they stabilize some conformation?</p><p>3. Pg. 6. &quot;the Y289D mutant retains many characteristics of the VSD-pore interactions of the activated state&quot;. At this point you have only stated that W281 only interacts with lipids in the activated state, so what VSD-pore interactions are you referring to here?</p><p>4. &quot;The wider distribution of bending angles in S4 for the system lacking the HCN domain indicates that the HCN domain may also contribute to stabilizing the activated state of S4 (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B and 2F).&quot; This is not clear in Figure 2 supp 1B or 2F.</p><p>5. Do you have any experimental data to support your proposed stabilization of the open state by the W281-N300 interaction? Or could it be validated in the MD by mutating them?</p><p>6. Figure 2 Suppl 2. Do you have any statistical test for the increase vs decrease of the interactions? Not clear to me of any consistent changes in some cases.</p><p>7. Pg. 15. &quot;However, this distance decreases rapidly in the first few picoseconds of simulations&quot; What simulation? Starting from what state?</p><p>8. Figure 3 Suppl 1. The channels should really be more closed by the C-C mutation if D-K stabilizes the open state, i.e. the voltage dependence should be shifted to more negative voltages and channels should be less open. Right now, the cys-cys mutation does the opposite, shifts the voltage dependence to more depolarized voltages and the channels are less closed (more leak currents). So, it is not really clear that a D-K interaction really stabilizes the open state. Could it be that cyc-cys +Cd2+ stabilizes the open state (because these residues are close in space), but D-K does not stabilize the open state even if they are nearby each other?</p><p>9. Figure 4 Suppl 3. I cannot see the proposed increases and decreases in S6-S5 and S6-S6 interactions, respectively. Is there some statistics or number to bolster these claims? Should not the ABMD curve go from resting towards the open state during the simulations? This is not always the case?</p><p>10. Figure 5A. I cannot see the proposed increase in lipid contacts on S5 and S6? Can you quantify something? Why not use the ABMD state instead of the activated state, since the activated state is not open?</p><p>11. The Domino effect is not very well explained. What is happening in the different steps during the domino effect, i.e. what step is first and why does this step cause the second step, etc…? Figure 6 is not clearly showing in a figure what you think is happening. Also, some residues and symbols are shown without any explanations: what do the arrows under &quot;int&quot; represent, and what are F and E?</p><p>12. The role of lipids in hyperpolarization-dependent gating is not well documented or described. How is this supposed to happen and how can it be tested? Not clear what H392-R297 and their lipid interaction are doing?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Interplay between VSD, pore and membrane lipids in electromechanical coupling in HCN channels&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>We do note, however, that the revised manuscript was seen by the past reviewers and they strongly recommend making a couple of changes summarised below.</p><p>Recommended changes:</p><p>1. The authors refer to the effect of a lipid on the salt bridge R297 and D401, recently identified in HCN2, as a general feature of all HCN (Schmidpeter et al. 2022. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The main concerns needing to be addressed are listed below, with full details available in the reviews themselves.</p><p>1. The decision to model the open pore of HCN1 using homology with hERG has been questioned. Because the simulations depend critically on this open-state model, it requires validation. It has been suggested that a better choice would have been the available HCN4 open state cryoEM structure. It has also been stated that hERG could be problematic because it does not have a gating hinge in common with HCN and has other sequence differences (such as V390) that may impact the structure of the HCN1 model. The authors should try the HCN4 pore domain to see how such a homology model would compare to the one used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We concur that the choice of target model largely guides the outcomes of the biased simulations, and have reconsidered our choices in the light of the points raised, in particular by reviewer 3.</p><p>To reduce the impact of the template choice, we have decided to remove all the results that were based on homology modeling, and have decided instead to run several replicas of biased simulations where a distance that consistently changes upon opening in CNBD channels of known closed and open structures is used as a collective variable. Indeed, there are subtle differences between the CNG open, hERG open and HCN4 open state structures, but they all have in common a widening of the pore at the position equivalent to V390.</p><p>This has thus led us to run ABMD simulations biasing, on top of the D290-K412 and W281N300 distance pairs which were used in the original preprint, distances between V390 of neighboring and opposite subunits (Figure 4A). We thus added a ratchet bias that encourages V390 pairs to be pushed away from one another. This choice is based on the fact that residues at positions equivalent to V390 in other CNBD channels consistently show distance increases associated with dilation of inner pore gates (in TAX-4, this distance increases from 10.6 to 17.2 Å (PDB IDs 6WEJ-6WEK), in CNGA1 from 9.6 to 16.4 Å (PDB IDs 7LFT-7LFW), in CNGA1/B1 from 9.8 to 15.1 Å (PDB IDs 7RH9-7RHH), in EAG/hERG from 10.7 to 17.3 Å (PDB IDs 5KL7L5VA1) and in HCN4 from 10.5 to 15.0 Å (PDB IDs 7NP4-7NP3)). reminiscent of what happens in hERG is also at play here (Figure 4 S1).</p><p>We also noticed that the simulations initiated in the resting state did not fully activate (VSDs remind partially deactivated, likely because of the lack of collective variables explicitly encouraging VSD activation) and we thus focused the rest of the analysis of the electromechanical coupling mechanism on the simulations initiated in the activated state (Figure 4C-F, Figure 4 S2, Figure 5).</p><p>Some details of the coupling mechanism and the lipid-protein interactions change with this new set of simulations, but the coarse features of the domino effect previously described hold with these new CVs. We have revised the aforementioned figures, and their description in the text, as well as the methods section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Provide experimental evidence in the form of existing or new experimental data to demonstrate the accuracy of the current open-state HCN1 model that has been used to set the interaction distances to guide simulations. In particular, data is requested that can confirm the relevance of those interaction distances. Also, for D290 – K412, the validation is missing a control (effect of Cd2+ on wildtype).</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we agree with the reviewers that support for the V390-I302 interaction was lacking and instead used a distance compatible with all observed open states in the CNBD family. The W281-N300 interaction in the open state is supported by mutagenesis of these positions in spHCN by the Larsson group (Ramentol et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021) as reviewer 3 has pointed out. Our experiments in Figure 3 and Figure 3-supplement 1 as the works of Gary Yellen support the D290-K412 interaction upon opening. We also added the requested control experiment to show that intracellular cadmium causes minimal effects to gating in the HCN1 wildtype construct. We have updated our text to more clearly highlight the past works in motivating us to use these interactions in our ABMD simulations.</p><p>As for validating our open state model from ABMD, we have followed the suggestions of reviewer 2 and compared our open state models with the cross bridging mutations on the S4-S5 linker and C-linker of spHCN from the Yellen group (Kwan et al. 2012). Our model agrees well with the functional effects observed in that study, with the residues on the C-linker nearest to the probed site on the S4-S5 linker in our model corresponding to positions shown to favor the open state upon cadmium bridging. We have added new videos (Videos 1-6) to map these 23 probed interactions onto our two open state models obtained from replicate ABMD runs.</p><p>Additionally, the increased S5-S6 interfacial contact upon pore opening that we observe in ABMD and propose as a central component of electromechanical coupling is supported by mutagenesis of the leucine zipper motif between S5 and S6 (Wemhöner, et al. 2012). Disruption of this leucine zipper motif with alanine mutants weakens VSD-pore coupling, supporting our domino effect model where the increased hydrophobic interactions between S5 and S6 compensate for the weakened S6-S6 interface. We have added this reference into our updated Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Provide any available mutagenesis or other data that supports the importance of residues proposed to interact with lipids.</p></disp-quote><p>It is notoriously difficult to obtain experimental evidence of the implication of specific residues in lipid/protein interactions.</p><p>At the time we submitted our preprint, it was well established that HCN channel function is potentiated by the signaling lipids PIP2 and PA (Zolles et al. Neuron 52, 1027–1036 (2006) ; Fogle et al. J. Neurosci. 27, 2802–2814 (2007) ; Pian et al. J. Gen. Physiol. 128, 593–604 (2006)) and that direct lipid binding can be visualized in cryoEM structures (Saponaro et al. Mol. Cell 81, 2929–2943.e6 (2021) ; Lee and MacKinnon, Cell 179, 1582–1589.e7 (2019)). However, the functional impact of these binding events remain to be fully understood.</p><p>The most direct evidence for functionally important lipid-protein interactions requires being able to carry out mutagenesis experiments while controlling the lipid environment in electrophysiology recordings, which has so far never been reported for HCN channels. While our paper was under revisions, however, an important study was published by the Nimigean lab (Schmidpeter et al. 2022. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 29, 1092–1100), which reported the successful recordings from the simulations were all conducted in POPC, and establishing a role for other (anionic) lipids, awaits further work.</p><p>These considerations are now mentioned in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Provide analysis or additional simulation that can address concerns about the reproducibility of simulation results, given only 1 simulation that enforces the chosen simulation distances has been performed. Also, please provide statistical tests to demonstrate an increase vs decrease in key interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. Indeed, we agree that our statistical analysis was not satisfactory. As mentioned in the response to essential revisions point 1, we have now carried out replicates of our ABMD simulations and the analyses we report are either based on four replicates (opening and conduction) or on two replicates (analysis of the coupling mechanism), revealing consistency of the proposed mechanism across replicates.</p><p>In addition, to address the statistical test request, we have chosen to report directly probability distributions where appropriate, and include an estimate of the standard deviation for our bar charts reporting interactions or contacts between residues or residues and lipids and the interaction surface areas. Performing statistical tests on MD simulations data is non-trivial because the simulation frames are correlated along time and establishing firmly what decorrelation time is needed to obtain independent samples is far from straightforward. We thus reason that showing the data in a way where the reader can form their own opinion about the overlap in distributions is the most honest representation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Better explain and visualise the proposed mechanism referred to as a &quot;domino effect&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for the request. We have revised the figure to describe better the different steps of the “domino-like” mechanism and the corresponding text in the manuscript. We believe this was indeed an essential revision in terms of conveying our mechanistic insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I note that the low-resolution blurry pdf figures provided for review made the reading of details very difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern and provide revised figures at higher resolution in the resubmitted paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I must say the figures have not done a good job of explaining the so-called &quot;domino&quot; effect, and perhaps data can be presented alongside a cartoon to explain this, with the domino nature clearly explained, just as the &quot;domino effect&quot; has been explained clearly in pentameric ligand-gated channels, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>Noted. Please see the response to essential revisions point 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comment/question regarding the D290-K412 salt bridge cysteine cross-bridging: Is it possible that this approach might capture rare conformations, where those cysteines may briefly come to within 8 Å and then bind for a long time, despite not being relevant to the wildtype functional state? Irreversible binding (on the experimental timescale) may trap unphysical conformations, reminiscent of what has been previously argued in relation to biotin-avidin experiments examining VSD movements (e.g. Jogini and Roux Biophys J 2007 93:3070), for example. It is not clear to me that the cross-link proves that a wildtype salt bridge is important for the activated state, and why in the main review I ask about possible other experiments to back it up.</p></disp-quote><p>Cadmium crosslinking has been widely used throughout the ion channel field to probe the functional effects of putative interacting pairs. This has been especially true for the HCN field where work from the Yellen group has probed the structural changes in the VSD, C-linker, and gate using this approach. Furthermore, the activated state of the HCN1 VSD was obtained by the McKinnon group using cryoEM with mercury cross linking of S4 to S2 to stabilize the activated state in the absence of an electric field. The activated state structure obtained with this approach agreed well with our previous simulations of HCN1 VSD activation under an electric field.</p><p>Though it is still possible that this approach captures rare conformations, we feel two main lines of support the D290-K412 interaction as physiologically relevant. First, the salt bridge forms spontaneously in the simulations of the activated state (shown more clearly in our updated figure 3C) and was observed in the Y289D mutant structure. Next, the Yellen group has shown that cross bridging many sites in this region in spHCN stabilizes the open state. We have added videos comparing his results to our open state models and added a section to the discussion to highlight this comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3c shows some data for D290-K412. I note that supporting timeseries and violin plots like Figure 3C would be useful for all relevant distances, including N300-W281, V390-I302 and others noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reported probability distributions for key interactions at the S4/S5 interface (W281N300 in Figure 1 S1) and important for pore opening (H392-Q398 and R404-E282 in Figure 4 S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a well-written manuscript on a hot topic.

Figure 3 Suppl 1. The channels should really be more closed by the C-C mutation if D-K stabilizes the open state, i.e. the voltage dependence should be shifted to more negative voltages and channels should be less open. Right now, the cys-cys mutation does the opposite, shifts the voltage dependence to more depolarized voltages and the channels are less closed (more leak currents). So, it is not really clear that a D-K interaction really stabilizes the open state. Could it be that cyc-cys +Cd2+ stabilizes the open state (because these residues are close in space), but D-K does not stabilize the open state even if they are nearby each other?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the rightward shift and increased basal activity of the D290C-K412C mutant relative to wild-type mutant was unexpected given that this interaction should stabilize the open state. However, there are several possible explanations for this effect. First, some D290CK412C may spontaneously form disulfide bonds during the recording due to the absence of reducing agents in the internal pipette solution. This would be consistent with the further rightward shift and increased basal activity of the D290C-K412C mutant in the presence of cadmium. We waited 2+ minutes after breaking into the cell to initiate recordings, which lasted for several minutes so some degree of disulfide bond formation would not be unexpected. Additionally, D290 and K412 may be involved in closed-state-specific interactions that are disrupted by the cysteine mutations. We have updated our Results section to include discussion of these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 4 Suppl 3.
