networks. However, its evolutionary origin has remained elusive. Outside the insects Toll is not known for a patterning function, but rather for a role in pathogen defense. Here, we show that in the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>, whose lineage split from <italic>Drosophila's</italic> more than 350 million years ago, Toll is only required to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network. A theoretical model reveals that this network has self-regulatory properties and that shallow Toll signaling gradients are sufficient to initiate axis formation. Such gradients can account for the experimentally observed twinning of insect embryos upon egg fragmentation and might have evolved from a state of uniform Toll activity associated with protecting insect eggs against pathogens.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05502.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05502.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05502.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How an animal develops from a fertilized egg has fascinated scientists for decades. As such, much effort has gone into answering the related question: what makes the belly (or underside) of an animal develop differently from its back?</p><p>Like almost all other biological processes, the development of an embryo is controlled by interactions between different molecules within cells and tissues. Some of these molecules promote the activity of others; some have the opposite effect; and together these molecules and their interactions form ‘signaling networks’. One such network, which involves a protein called BMP, is needed to establish the belly-to-back axis of nearly all animals. However, insects are a unique exception. Most insects (including flies, beetles and wasps) use a different signaling network to control their development from their belly to their back, one that involves a protein called Toll instead. This is unexpected because, in other animals, Toll proteins are best known for their role in the immune system; and it remains unclear how Toll signaling came to be involved in insect development.</p><p>Now, Sachs, Chen et al. have studied an insect—called the milkweed bug—that is unlike most insects in that it does not have a larval stage (i.e., a maggot or a caterpillar) in its life-cycle. This characteristic makes the milkweed bug more similar to the ancestor of all insects, and thus makes it an excellent model to study how the Toll protein took over from BMP in insect development.</p><p>First, Sachs, Chen et al. experimentally reduced BMP signaling in milkweed bug embryos. This caused the embryos to develop features all around their bodies that are normally only associated with the animal's underside. In other insects, the development of these so-called ‘ventral’ features is typically controlled by Toll signaling; but in the milkweed bug this activity instead depends on a protein called Sog. Indeed, when Sachs, Chen et al. experimentally reduced both BMP and Toll signaling, the effect was the same as having reduced only BMP signaling, implying that Toll is not needed. Instead, Toll increased the level of the Sog protein up to a particular threshold. Above this threshold, Sog and BMP control each other to set out the animal's body plan. As insects evolved, it seems likely that Toll transitioned from being a trigger of BMP signaling to an important controller of insect development in its own right. But why was Toll put in the egg in the first place? It is possible that Toll was required to protect the eggs of early insects from attack by bacteria and fungi. Future work will now test this assumption and aim to explain how and why the Toll protein changed its role—from immunity to development—during evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05502.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05502.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Tribolium</kwd><kwd>Oncopeltus</kwd><kwd>Nasonia</kwd><kwd>axis formation</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory networks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>O. fasciatus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yen-Ta</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>Jeremy A</given-names></name><name><surname>Panfilio</surname><given-names>Kristen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lässig</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>Siegfried</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministerium für Innovation, Wissenschaft und Forschung des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRW International Graduate School of Development Health and Disease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yen-Ta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During the evolution of insect lineages, a signaling pathway dedicated to pathogen defense was co-opted for a new role in embryonic patterning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the Toll pathway has essential functions both for innate immunity and for dorsoventral (DV) axis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein and Stevens, 2014</xref>). While Toll's immune function is broadly conserved in animals ranging from hydra to humans, its role in axis formation appears to be an evolutionary novelty of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzenburg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilmore and Wolenski, 2012</xref>). Other animals do not employ Toll but rather use BMP signaling to establish their DV axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Robertis, 2008</xref>). BMP signaling also plays a crucial, but spatially restricted role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> DV patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that Toll signaling was recruited into an ancestral BMP-based patterning network during evolution of the insect lineage.</p><p>So far molecular studies of DV patterning in insects have been largely restricted to the most speciose supraorder, Holometabola, the insects with complete metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lynch and Roth, 2011</xref>). However, already within the Holometabola, a clear evolutionary trend was observed: the more basally branching lineages show an increased reliance on BMP signaling while the importance of Toll signaling is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, both the polarity and pattern of the DV axis depend on a stable long range gradient of Toll signaling that promotes the graded nuclear uptake of the NF-κB transcription factor Dorsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reeves and Stathopoulos, 2009</xref>). NF-κB/Dorsal acts in a concentration-dependent manner to activate or repress genes required for DV cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The ventral cell fates of the mesoderm, mesectoderm and neuroectoderm directly depend on NF-κB/Dorsal target genes. The dorsal cell fates (non-neurogenic ectoderm and extraembryonic amnioserosa) are determined in a more indirect way by Toll signaling restricting and polarizing an opposing BMP signaling gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). The gene regulatory network (GNR) controlled by NF-κB/Dorsal has been extensively characterized. It encompasses 60–70 target genes which fall into six classes according to their enhancer structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). The sensitivity of these enhancers to different NF-κB/Dorsal concentrations is fine-tuned by ubiquitously distributed activators and repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia and Stathopoulos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozdemir et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05502.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The evolution of Toll's role in dorsoventral (DV) patterning in insects.</title><p>In holometabolous insects Toll signaling is activated by ventral eggshell cues and forms an activity gradient (red) that is essential at the very least for specifying the ventral-most cells on the DV axis, giving rise to the mesoderm (brown), by activating the gene <italic>twist</italic> (<italic>twi</italic>) (black arrow). In the fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll signaling not only determines the mesoderm, but also the neuroectoderm (yellow) and restricts BMP signaling to the dorsal side through several parallel mechanisms, including the activation of the BMP inhibitor <italic>short gastrulation</italic> (<italic>sog</italic>) (black arrow) and repression of the major BMP ligand <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) (black T-bar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reeves and Stathopoulos, 2009</xref>). On the dorsal side a BMP gradient (blue) is established (gray arrow and T-bar indicate BMP ligand production and inhibition, respectively) that specifies non-neurogenic ectoderm (blue) and extraembryonic tissue (green) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). Toll signaling is dynamic in <italic>Tribolium</italic> and polarizes BMP signaling only by activating sog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>). BMP signaling in turn has an increased role in ectodermal patterning compared to flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast to both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> Toll signaling in the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic> appears to be restricted to a narrow ventral region where it is only transiently active. Here, Toll signaling is required to induce mesodermal and mesectodermal fates. But the size of the mesodermal region as well as the fate and position of all other regions along the DV axis are determined by a BMP signaling gradient emanating from the dorsal side by an unknown (Toll-independent) mechanism (black T-bar indicates repression of <italic>twi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Özüak et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2014b</xref>). Thus, in the holometabolous insects BMP signaling gets increasingly more important towards basally branching groups, while Toll's role is diminished, but remains essential for ventral-most cell fates. Here we provide evidence that the bug <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, representing the Hemiptera within the sister group of Holometabola (Paraneoptera), uses Toll signaling only as spatial cue (dashed black arrow) to polarize a dynamic BMP signaling network that establishes a gradient responsible for patterning the cell fates along the DV axis. The key regulatory element of this network is the transcriptional repression of <italic>sog</italic> by BMP signaling. A reaction-diffusion model which incorporates this regulatory element shows that the formation of stable BMP gradients requires only weakly polarized Toll signaling (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05502.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05502.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05502-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>All major components of the BMP signaling network are controlled by NF-κB/Dorsal: one of the BMP ligands, the BMP2/4 homolog <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>), and the extracellular protease <italic>tolloid</italic> (<italic>tld</italic>) are repressed by NF-κB/Dorsal and thus confined to the dorsal side of the embryo while an extracellular BMP inhibitor, the <italic>chordin</italic> homolog <italic>short gastrulation</italic> (<italic>sog</italic>), and a transcriptional repressor of BMP target genes (<italic>brinker</italic>, <italic>brk</italic>) are activated by NF-κB/Dorsal at the ventral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jazwinska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rushlow and Shvartsman, 2012</xref>). The ventral-to-dorsal transport of Sog and Sog-BMP complexes and their dorsal cleavage by Tld leads to a BMP signaling gradient with peak levels at the dorsal side. Thus, Toll signaling via NF-κB/Dorsal not only provides precise spatial information for the ventral half of the axis, but indirectly also determines the patterning of the dorsal half. An independent maternal input at the dorsal side of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos has been discussed, but it apparently plays only a minor role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araujo and Bier, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Toll signaling in the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> is highly dynamic due to positive and negative feedback of Toll pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>). These dynamics lead to a temporally shifting NF-κB/Dorsal gradient which refines and disappears before the major DV patterning genes have established stable expression domains. This suggests that NF-κB/Dorsal concentration thresholds play a less direct role in specifying these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, NF-κB/Dorsal does not act as a repressor of BMP signaling components or as an activator of <italic>brk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, the establishment of the BMP gradient entirely relies on ventral (NF-κB/Dorsal dependent) activation of <italic>sog</italic>. The BMP gradient in turn is required for all the polarity of the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, in <italic>Tribolium</italic> the direct role of Toll signaling is largely restricted to mesoderm and mesectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, in the wasp <italic>Nasonia</italic>, representing the basal-most branch (Hymenoptera) of the Holometabola, Toll signaling appears to be active only in a narrow domain along the ventral midline, where it is required to induce ventral-most cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>). However, the borders of the ventrally expressed genes are not defined by thresholds of Toll signaling, but rather by repressive BMP signaling. Thus, in <italic>Nasonia</italic> BMP signaling specifies gene expression domains along the entire DV axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In this respect the DV system in <italic>Nasonia</italic> is similar to the ancestral type of DV axis formation in bilaterian animals. However, a closer look at the mechanisms of gradient formation reveals that the <italic>Nasonia</italic> system is highly derived even when compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Functional studies show that the BMP gradient of <italic>Nasonia</italic> is established from a maternal source along the dorsal midline independent from ventral Toll signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>Nasoni</italic>a genome lacks a <italic>sog</italic> homolog and no ventrally expressed BMP inhibitor was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Özüak et al., 2014a</xref>). The establishment of BMP signaling gradients by an opposing inhibitor gradient of Chordin/Sog is however, one of the most conserved aspects of DV axis formation in Bilateria and is even preserved in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Robertis, 2008</xref>). Moreover, given the fact that <italic>Nasonia</italic> also uses Toll for mesoderm/mesectoderm induction, it establishes its DV axis in a bipolar manner employing independent signaling sources along the ventral and dorsal midline of the egg. Bipolar DV axis formation has so far not been described in any other system.</p><p>Despite all the variability found so far in Holometabola there are two common themes. (1) In more basal lineages BMP signaling is responsible for functions that are performed by Toll signaling in more derived lineages. (2) The ventral-most regions of the DV axis, giving rise to the mesoderm and mesectoderm, remain strictly dependent on Toll signaling. By studying a representative of insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Hemimetabola) we asked whether this situation is characteristic for all insects or whether a further reduction of the DV patterning function of Toll can be observed, allowing us to analyze how it originated.</p><p>To this end we investigated DV patterning in the milkweed bug, <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>, representing the order Hemiptera, within the sister group (Paraneoptera) to the Holometabola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Kaufman, 2009</xref>). We provide evidence that in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> Toll is indeed no longer essential for mesoderm formation since repression of BMP signaling suffices to induce mesoderm. Like in other systems inhibition of BMP signaling is accomplished by <italic>sog.</italic> However, the transcriptional regulation of <italic>sog</italic> in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> is more dynamic than in the other well-studied systems. It combines uniform Toll-independent activation with ventral enhancement by Toll and repression by BMP. We build a theoretical model based on the experimental findings and show that the BMP/sog pathway in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> exhibits self-organized patterning (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). Specifically, the interplay of BMP-dependent <italic>sog</italic> repression and Sog-dependent BMP transport generates a Turing instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turing, 1952</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we produced embryos simultaneously lacking Toll and BMP signaling. To our surprise the <italic>Toll1 dpp</italic> double KD embryos showed uniform <italic>twi</italic> and <italic>sog</italic> expression along the embryonic circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L,N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the same as the <italic>dpp</italic> single KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>). However, in contrast to the single KD of <italic>dpp</italic>, the double KD embryos also show an expansion and/or shift of the <italic>sog</italic>, <italic>twi</italic> and (anterior) <italic>sim</italic> domains towards the anterior pole (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref>). This is likely due to the additional role of Toll signaling in anterior patterning and allows for an unambiguous distinction between double and single KD embryos (additional confirmation by RT-PCR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results suggest that DV patterning genes that require Toll signaling for expression in other insects can be activated in the absence of Toll signaling in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>. As these genes are repressed by elevated BMP activity their state of expression seems to be mainly controlled by different levels of BMP signaling. This leads to the crucial question: What then is Toll's role within the DV patterning system of <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> if Toll is neither strictly required to activate ventral genes nor to prevent their repression?</p><p>To address this question we carefully studied the dynamics of <italic>sog</italic> expression in wt and <italic>Toll1</italic> KD embryos. Interestingly, <italic>sog</italic> transcription is activated ubiquitously in early blastoderm embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R</xref>). Only later is <italic>sog</italic> expression enhanced at the ventral side, while weak <italic>sog</italic> expression is still seen dorsally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T,V</xref>). Finally, during mid-blastoderm (25–28 hpf) the typical <italic>sog</italic> expression domain is established, with high levels in the ventral 40% and no detectable expression in the dorsal 60% of the germ rudiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5">Figures 5C, 2C</xref>). Early <italic>Toll1</italic> KD embryos show uniform expression of <italic>sog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>), which disappears during later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, Toll is not required to initiate <italic>sog</italic> expression, but rather to enhance its expression ventrally. A weakly asymmetric Toll gradient might suffice to fulfill this function.</p><p>To get a first impression of the shape of the Toll signaling gradient in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, we analyzed the expression of <italic>cactus</italic> (<italic>cact</italic>) genes encoding the insect I-κB homologs which bind to NF-κB/Dorsal and prevent nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 1996</xref>). The transcriptional activation of <italic>I-κB</italic> genes by Toll signaling appears to be an ancestral negative feedback loop essential for attenuating the innate immune response triggered by Toll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>). During <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> DV patterning <italic>cact</italic> is an early target gene of Toll signaling expressed in regions of high nuclear NF-κB/Dorsal concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>). The same appears to apply to <italic>Nasonia</italic> where <italic>cact</italic> expression is restricted to a narrow stripe straddling the ventral midline indicating a highly refined pattern of Toll activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>).

In the course of his experiments, Sander produced dorsal and ventral egg fragments during early development (preblastoderm) using a guillotine which completely separated the two egg halves. Complete germ band embryos developed within each half (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). The model proposed here can reproduce such regulative behavior. A split along the DV axis prior to the initiation of patterning prevents diffusion from the ventral to the dorsal half. Thus, BMP acting as a long-range inhibitor of <italic>sog</italic> expression cannot travel from the ventral to the dorsal half to suppress <italic>sog</italic>. Since the NF-κB/Dorsal gradient extends to the dorsal half, <italic>sog</italic> can be activated dorsally and initiates a second round of patterning. Consequently, <italic>sog</italic> domains and BMP gradients are produced independently in each half despite the NF-κB/Dorsal gradient itself not having been altered (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). The sizes of the <italic>sog</italic> and BMP domains are adjusted to the dimensions of the egg halves implying that the patterning process shows almost perfect scaling. Furthermore, the predicted orientation of the embryos with ventral sides pointing to the dorsal egg pole (after axis inversion through anatrepsis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panfilio, 2008</xref>]) corresponds to the most frequently observed experimental outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sander, 1971</xref>). Thus, our model represents a minimal BMP/Sog (Chordin) system that exhibits self-organized DV patterning and explains a striking result from classical insect embryology. The only requirement for the NF-κB/Dorsal gradient is that it extends into the dorsal half of the embryo. The expression of <italic>cact</italic> suggests that this condition is fulfilled in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>. Unfortunately, the mechanical properties of <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> eggs prevents egg fragmentation to directly investigate the potential for twinning.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes three key properties of DV patterning in <italic>Oncopeltus.</italic> (1) BMP signaling represses the transcription of its extracellular inhibitor <italic>sog</italic>, a feature so far not observed in other insects, but characteristic for spiders and vertebrates. (2) BMP signaling patterns the entire DV axis by acting repressively on ventral cell fates. This is similar to other bilaterian animals but within insects has so far only been seen in the hymenopteran <italic>Nasonia</italic>, a representative of the most basally branching holometabolous insect order. (3) Toll is neither a long-range morphogen, as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium,</italic> nor a local inducer of particular cell fates (mesoderm and mesectoderm), as in <italic>Nasonia.</italic> In <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, Toll apparently only acts via its control of BMP signaling. In the following, we discuss these three points and their implications for the evolution of DV patterning in insects.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BMP represses <italic>sog</italic> in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic></title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic>, the expression of <italic>sog</italic> is dependent on Toll signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liberman and Stathopoulos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>sog</italic> can be neither activated in absence of Toll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stathopoulos and Levine, 2004</xref>) nor can it be repressed by ectopic BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jazwinska et al., 1999</xref>). However, a binding site for transcription factors acting downstream of BMP signaling (Schnurri-Mad-Medea sites) has recently been identified within the proximal enhancer of <italic>Drosophila sog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozdemir et al., 2014</xref>). Its functional significance is not known, but it might represent an evolutionary relict of the regulatory logic we have observed in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> in which inhibitory BMP signaling is essential for defining the <italic>sog</italic> expression domain. A negative feedback of BMP on sog/chordin expression is familiar from many animal phyla. It has even been found in sea anemones, predating the emergence of the bilaterian body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genikhovich et al., 2015</xref>). For both hemichordates and basal chordates, evidence was provided that BMP suppresses <italic>chordin</italic>, directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lowe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). This applies also to spiders, which however have evolved a special strategy of DV axis formation that is radically different from most other animal phyla. In spiders the migration of the BMP expressing cumulus cells towards a symmetric ring of <italic>chordin</italic> expression breaks DV symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama-Oda and Oda, 2006</xref>). Thus, spiders polarize the DV axis not by localizing inhibitor expression, but rather by localizing BMP.</p><p>Among the well-studied DV patterning systems, <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> can be best compared to vertebrates. In the zebrafish and the frog the negative regulation of <italic>chordin</italic> by BMP signaling is an important feature to explain normal patterning and axis duplication (twinning) after transplantations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oelgeschläger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Robertis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langdon and Mullins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). However, the networks involved in size regulation of the embryonic axis are more complex and require many additional components such as ADMP (antidorsalizing morphogenetic protein), a BMP-type ligand co-expressed with Chordin<italic>,</italic> and Sizzled, an antagonist of Tld that is co-expressed with BMP. ADMP and Sizzled have been implicated in scaling both experimentally and by modeling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reversade and De Robertis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>). No homologs of these genes were found in the <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> genome and transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ewen-Campen et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vargas Jentzsch et al., 2015</xref>), and appropriate scaling occurred in our theoretical simulations of twinning, without the need to invoke such additional modulators.</p><p>Thus, the <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> system is surprisingly simple and may represent a minimal network able to support self-organized patterning. Our theoretical model emerged from modifications of equations that have been used to describe the formation of peak levels of BMP signaling along the dorsal midline in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>). The BMP signaling peak in <italic>Drosophila</italic> forms within a domain of uniform <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>tld</italic> expression and depends on both the diffusion of Sog-BMP complexes towards the dorsal side (from the ventral source region of <italic>sog</italic>) and on the degradation of Sog by Tld to release active BMP ligands dorsally. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> system is static, that is, the regions of ventral <italic>sog</italic> expression and the abutting regions of <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>tld</italic> are fixed by the NF-κB/Dorsal gradient. The early dynamics of the system are restricted to reaction diffusion processes. In <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, on the other hand, the transcriptional feedback of BMP signaling on <italic>sog</italic> expression creates a situation in which the size of the <italic>sog</italic> expression domain itself is an outcome of the system dynamics and becomes largely independent from NF-κB/Dorsal.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> the transport of BMP by Sog leads to dorsal BMP signaling levels that are higher than the signaling levels in the absence of Sog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorfman and Shilo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>). This seems not to be the case in <italic>Oncopeltus,</italic> as the uniformly high BMP levels seen in <italic>sog</italic> or <italic>tsg</italic> KD embryos match the levels found on the dorsal side of control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the BMP profile during normal development is flat, with a narrow and steep transition between uniform BMP signaling dorsally and the absence of BMP signaling ventrally. In our simulations the <italic>sog</italic> and BMP profiles are also flat, indicating that the negative feedback of BMP signaling on <italic>sog</italic> expression might prohibit the formation of sharp peak levels of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8, 9</xref>). Similarly, in vertebrates Chordin-mediated BMP transport does not markedly enhance BMP signaling levels, as <italic>chordin</italic> KD does not lead to lateralization, but rather to ventralization of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schulte-Merker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oelgeschläger et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>An unusual feature of the <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> system is the strong anti-BMP function of Tsg. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tsg has a mild pro-BMP function that is independent of Sog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang and Ferguson, 2005</xref>). In <italic>Tribolium</italic>, Tsg is essential for all BMP activity in a Sog-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2010</xref>). The same holds true for <italic>Nasonia,</italic> which lacks Sog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>), suggesting that a Sog-independent pro-BMP function of Tsg might be ancestral for insects. To our surprise we observed the opposite in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>, where the strong anti-BMP function of <italic>tsg</italic> is responsible for the similarity of the <italic>sog</italic> and <italic>tsg</italic> KD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2, 3</xref>). Thus, Sog can exert its inhibitory effect on BMP only in the presence of Tsg. It will be interesting to find out whether this strong anti-BMP function of Tsg has a particular significance in a system where <italic>sog</italic> is repressed by BMP signaling.</p><p>We assume that patterning in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> is initiated when NF-κB/Dorsal-dependent enhancement of <italic>sog</italic> expression at the ventral side exceeds a certain threshold. This conclusion is based on the analysis of embryos with incomplete KD of <italic>sog</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5">Figures 2K, 5J</xref>). Such embryos frequently show an asymmetric pMAD distribution although they lack ventral gene (<italic>twi</italic>, <italic>sim</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, ventral BMP signaling has to decrease below a certain threshold to enable normal DV pattern formation. This may provide the system with robustness against fluctuating BMP signaling levels. In our theoretical analysis, the homogeneous steady state of Sog and BMP undergoes a Turing instability when NF-κB/Dorsal-dependent activation of <italic>sog</italic> reaches a threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Then, rapid diffusion of BMP-Sog complexes and derepression of <italic>sog</italic> upon removal of BMP from the ventral side lead to the formation of a stripe with high expression of <italic>sog</italic>. The position of the stripe is determined by the initial NF-κB/Dorsal polarity cue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BMP patterns the entire DV axis in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic></title><p>In all insects studied so far the specification of mesodermal and mesectodermal cell fates requires Toll signaling. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic>, the shape of the NF-κB/Dorsal gradient directly or indirectly determines the width of the mesodermal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Nasonia</italic> all ventrally expressed genes (e.g., <italic>twi</italic>) are first turned on in a narrow stripe straddling the ventral midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>). This region also shows high levels of <italic>cact</italic> expression indicating high activity of Toll signaling. Subsequently, <italic>cact</italic> expression disappears, however, the expression of ventral genes expands. The size of their final domains is determined by repressive BMP signaling from the dorsal side, since KD of BMP leads to progressive expansion of ventral gene expression resulting in a massive, albeit nonuniform expansion of the mesoderm. Thus, in <italic>Nasonia</italic> BMP effects all subdivisions of the DV axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>). However, the expansion of ventral genes remains dependent on their prior activation by Toll, as <italic>Toll bmp</italic> double KD embryos lack the expression of ventral genes like <italic>twi</italic>.</p><p>In <italic>Oncopeltus dpp</italic> KD embryos, <italic>twi</italic> is completely derepressed, that is, its expression is uniform around the embryonic circumference and the developing embryos are fully mesodermalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2E, 4F</xref>). This phenotype does not result from a progressive expansion of a narrow domain as in <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Most importantly, the same phenotype is observed in <italic>Toll dpp</italic> double KD embryos, with the exception that <italic>twi</italic> expression in addition expands anteriorly due to an AP function of Toll signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). These data suggest that Toll signaling in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> is no longer strictly required to activate ventral genes. As a consequence, all cell fate decisions along the DV axis of <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> ultimately depend on different levels of BMP signaling.</p><p>As pointed out previously, the early pattern of BMP signaling in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> seems to be very simple with a plateau of high signaling at the dorsal side and a broad domain lacking BMP signaling ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, the early DV fate map of <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> has apparently only few subdivisions. Although we have thus far not identified genes expressed specifically on the dorsal side, we expect such genes to have broad expression domains encompassing 30–50% of the embryonic circumference. Likewise, the ventral <italic>twi</italic> and early <italic>sim</italic> domains are broad (data not shown). <italic>sim</italic> refines to lateral stripes bordering <italic>twi</italic> during later blastoderm stages. None of the columnar genes (<italic>vnd</italic>, <italic>ind</italic>, <italic>msh</italic>) show stripe-like expression in lateral regions of the blastoderm as in holometabolous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">von Ohlen and Doe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wheeler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchta et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore expect that the early BMP gradient provides little patterning information on either the dorsal or ventral side, and that further refinement occurs progressively during and after gastrulation. This refinement also includes large-scale morphogenetic movements. For example, the narrow <italic>twi</italic> domain of germ band embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) results from massive convergent extension during anatrepsis (posterior invagination of the embryo and the amnion into the yolk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panfilio, 2008</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>In <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> Toll function is restricted to polarizing BMP signaling</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the Toll gradient acts differently in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> compared to the known holometabolous insects: (i) BMP is epistatic to Toll, (ii) ventrally expressed genes can be readily suppressed by increased BMP signaling, (iii) the repression of <italic>sog</italic> by BMP makes the distribution of BMP signaling largely independent from that of Toll signaling. Although we have not demonstrated the latter point experimentally, modeling shows that adding the repression of <italic>sog</italic> by BMP to the well known reaction diffusion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eldar et al., 2002</xref>) leads to a decoupling of input (Toll signaling) and output (BMP signaling) patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9 fig11">Figures 9, 11</xref>). Toll remains essential at the ventral side to initiate patterning, and therefore, it would be highly interesting to monitor Toll activity by looking at the NF-κB/Dorsal distribution.</p><p>In absence of functional antibodies we used the expression of the early Toll target gene <italic>cact</italic> as a proxy for Toll signaling. In all known holometabolous insects <italic>cact</italic> is activated by the NF-κB/Dorsal gradient.

However, due to maternal loading of <italic>cact,</italic> its zygotic expression apparently has little functional relevance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roth et al., 1991</xref>).

Finally, in <italic>Nasonia</italic>, <italic>cact</italic> expression is restricted to a narrow stripe straddling the ventral midline where the expression of all other Toll signaling-dependent ventral genes is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Özüak et al., 2014b</xref>). Although the NF-κB/Dorsal distribution is not known from <italic>Nasonia</italic>, a cluster of NF-κB/Dorsal binding sites in the vicinity of the <italic>cact</italic> transcript suggests a direct regulatory input by Toll signaling. By analogy we assume that the broad, weakly graded expression of <italic>cact</italic> in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> reflects a flat Toll signaling gradient which extends from the ventral to the dorsal half of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The upstream cascade, which leads to Toll activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein and Stevens, 2014</xref>) appears to be largely conserved in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> (data not shown). Preliminary data suggest that the asymmetry of Toll signaling originates from asymmetric eggshell cues that are established during oogenesis. By activating Toll signaling in a broad gradient, these eggshell cues would provide global polarity to the embryo, which is essential for establishing bilateral symmetry. Such a strong geometric influence does not exclude, but rather enables, certain forms of self-organized patterning. Classical insect embryology had described many instances of partial or complete twinning after experimental interference with patterning along the DV axis of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sander, 1976</xref>). These experiments were not restricted to hemimetabolous insects, but included examples from beetles as well as butterflies.</p><p>The most famous set of experiments was conducted by Sander with <italic>Eusceli</italic>s, a leaf hopper which (like <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>) belongs to the Hemiptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sander, 1971</xref>). Sander produced not only left and right, but also dorsal and ventral egg fragments and was able to recover apparently complete germ rudiments from all fragments. These findings could not previously be explained on the basis of the fairly deterministic mechanism of DV axis formation known from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The mechanism we have discovered in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> can, in principle, account for this type of axis duplication (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). As long as Toll activity is globally provided so that <italic>sog</italic> can also be activated in the dorsal half of the egg, a new round of patterning can be initiated dorsally. A prerequisite for pattern re-initiation is a diffusion barrier, which prevents the transport of (inhibitory) BMP molecules from the ventral to the dorsal side. The guillotine-like mechanism with which Sander separated the egg fragments provided such a barrier.</p><p>In summary, the data presented here not only provide a potential explanation for experiments from classical insect embryology, they also suggest a scenario of how the elaborate morphogen function of Toll signaling found in <italic>Drosophila</italic> could have originated and evolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ancestrally, Toll signaling might have only provided a polarizing function for a self-organizing BMP system responsible for patterning the entire DV axis. Within certain lineages (e.g., flies, beetles and wasps) Toll signaling became more important in directly specifying cell fates along the axis, gradually replacing ancestral BMP functions.</p><p>Our data might also help to explain the transition from the ancestral immune function of Toll found in most metazoan lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilmore and Wolenski, 2012</xref>) to its unique role in DV patterning restricted to insects. Recent findings show that insect eggs are immune competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest that this also applied to ancestral insects and that furnishing their eggs with a Toll-mediated pathogen defense system was crucial for early insects to adopt a terrestrial life style. The activation of Toll signaling by eggshell cues might have been fairly uniform throughout the embryo. Subsequently, only a mild polarization of Toll signaling together with weak transcriptional inputs on <italic>sog</italic> were sufficient to initiate the co-option of Toll signaling for DV patterning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene annotation and analysis</title><p>Putative <italic>O. fasciatus</italic> homologs of Toll and BMP signaling components were found by a local blast against a maternal and embryonic transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ewen-Campen et al., 2011</xref>) using the NCBI blast+ toolkit and BioEdit software, or by degenerate PCR followed by RACE PCR using the SMARTER RACE kit (Clontech, France) to extend the sequence information.

Consider a small ‘seed’ of elevated Sog concentration in a specific location (for instance as the result of the polarity cue provided by NF-κB/Dorsal). The Sog molecules bind BMP and the complexes diffuse away quickly, leading to a depletion of BMP. Since BMP represses Sog, this leads to a local increase in Sog production, causing the small ‘seed’ to grow. The steady-state consists of areas where BMP has been depleted (and where levels of Sog are high), bordering areas with high levels of BMP (and low levels of Sog). In the former, <italic>sog</italic> is not repressed due to the absence of BMP, and BMP is absent due to complex formation with Sog and diffusive transport. In the latter, high levels of BMP repress <italic>sog</italic> expression. The resulting non-equilibrium steady state will be examined in detail elsewhere.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Comparison with other models</title><p>We consider only one BMP ligand and neglect the fact that BMPs are secreted as homodimers or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>), although we have experimental evidence for a second BMP ligand in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in agreement with other recent theoretical models for BMP gradient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Umulis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peluso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inomata et al., 2013</xref>) and reflects the notion that additional ligands might contribute to increased robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>), but have no essential impact on the mechanisms of pattern formation. The binding of the BMPs to their receptors is not part of our model although we are aware of receptor-mediated degradation affecting the mean free path of the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizutani et al., 2005</xref>). The model also neglects the binding of Tsg to Sog-BMP complexes and does not explicitly mention Tolloid (Tld), the enzyme that cleaves Sog. This can be justified by the fact that in blastoderm embryos <italic>tsg</italic> transcripts are not detectable (by ISH) suggesting very weak uniform expression and that <italic>tld</italic> is evenly expressed around the embryonic circumference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

(2002)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meinhardt and Roth, 2002</xref>) with the crucial difference that <italic>sog</italic> expression itself is controlled by BMP signaling. The NF-κB/Dorsal gradient in our model plays a similar role as the source density in the Gierer-Meinhardt model, which was used to explain regulative behavior in hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>). In fact the mechanism of pattern formation bears some similarity with the local activation-lateral inhibition mechanism proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gierer and Meinhardt (1972)</xref>: BMP inhibits Sog production through transcriptional repression. However, this is the sole regulatory interaction in our model. Local self-activation arises from the fast transport of BMP within Sog-BMP complexes, which moves the repressor for <italic>sog</italic> from regions of high <italic>sog</italic> expression (increasing <italic>sog</italic> expression in those regions) to regions of low <italic>sog</italic> expression (decreasing <italic>sog</italic> expression there).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Reaction-diffusion model</title><p>To describe the repression of <italic>sog</italic> by BMP we use a Michaelis–Menten model; the rate of <italic>sog</italic> expression is proportional to 1/(1 + <italic>b</italic>/<italic>b</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) where <italic>b</italic> is the concentration of BMP and <italic>b</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> is the concentration of BMP reducing the expression of <italic>sog</italic> by a factor of two. The constant of proportionality depends on the NF-κB/Dorsal concentration <italic>d</italic>, which enhances <italic>sog</italic> expression. In the absence of BMP, the <italic>sog</italic> expression rate (<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> + <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> <italic>d</italic>/<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> )/(1 + <italic>d</italic>/<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) extrapolates between <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> at <italic>d</italic> = 0 and <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> at high levels of <italic>d</italic>. <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> denotes the concentration where the intermediate transcription rate (<italic>η</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> + <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>)/2 is reached.

We will show below that pattern formation crucially depends on (i) a sufficiently high diffusion rate of the Sog-BMP complex and (ii) repression of <italic>sog</italic> expression by BMP. The homogeneous state (uniform concentrations of BMP, Sog, and the Sog-BMP complex) can be stable at low levels of NF-κB/Dorsal, but becomes unstable (via the mechanism above) once a certain critical NF-κB/Dorsal level is reached. Once a stripe has formed, however, it can persist even in the absence of NF-κB/Dorsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We now explore the dynamics of pattern formation in this model starting from different concentrations of the transcription factor NF-κB/Dorsal (shown in gray), resulting in steady-state concentrations of Sog and BMP shown blue and red, respectively. Starting from small levels of NF-κB/Dorsal, a steady state with uniformly low level of Sog arises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, left). A threshold amount of NF-κB/Dorsal is required initially to form a stripe of high Sog concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, center). As a result, small fluctuations in the NF-κB/Dorsal concentration thus do not lead to the formation of a stripe. The size of this stripe does not change if the initial amount of NF-κB/Dorsal is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, right). This NF-κB/Dorsal-induced instability of the homogeneous state is also behind the twinning phenomenon (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>): if the level of NF-κB/Dorsal exceeds the critical threshold everywhere in the system, a stripe of Sog centered on the maximum of NF-κB/Dorsal forms. Elsewhere, <italic>sog</italic> is repressed by BMP and transported away from the high-Sog stripe via the Sog-BMP complex. If the system is divided into two separate halves, this transport is interrupted, but the NF-κB/Dorsal level is still above the critical threshold everywhere. Now there are two maxima of NF-κB/Dorsal (one in each of the two halves), and a stripe of Sog forms at each of them.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Stability analysis</title><p>We perform a linear stability analysis to determine when a spatially homogeneous steady-state solution is instable against small sinusoidal spatial oscillations.

We use the same parameters as in the one-dimensional case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Starting from an initial distribution of NF-κB/Dorsal along the ventral side of the cylinder, a stripe of Sog forms along the cylinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). All concentrations turn out to be independent of <italic>y</italic>. We find this also holds in the steady state if the initial distribution of NF-κB/Dorsal varies in the <italic>y-</italic>direction. This becomes more apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, where the initial distribution of NF-κB/Dorsal from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> is shown in a contour plot, alongside the steady-state concentration of Sog. Thus, our model produces stripes of constant width (<italic>sog</italic> expression), which are centered on the ventral midline defined by NF-κB/Dorsal. This is a remarkable feature as it had been difficult to produce striped patterns centered on the midline with local activation-lateral inhibition or substrate depletion mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meinhardt, 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This article is dedicated to the memory of the late Klaus Sander (1929-2015), who discovered anteriorposterior morphogen gradients in insects and the regulative patterning along the DV axis.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Sachs et al., study DV patterning in the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>. They use RNAi methods and mathematical modeling to study interactions between the Toll and BMP signaling pathways. From their RNAi data, the authors conclude that (1) BMP signaling is active throughout the DV axis and must be repressed ventrally through expression of <italic>sog</italic> to allow ventral patterning; and (2) Toll is not required to support any cell types but is required for symmetry breaking.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is an interesting study addressing an important question in developmental biology, namely how do DV patterning mechanisms in different animals relate and what was the ancestral system like. The authors make a convincing argument for looking at the milkweed bug.</p><p>However, it was also agreed by all that more information is needed, especially in view of the recent CB paper from the PI lab on <italic>Nasonia,</italic> which already makes the point regarding the decreasing role of the Toll pathway. Several additional data are therefore essential:</p><p>1) More information on the expression patterns of the different players in the BMP pathway is essential: Where is <italic>dpp</italic> expressed? It is implied that <italic>dpp</italic> is no longer under Toll-dependent regulation in the milkweed bug (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> diagram), however no in situ data is included. The authors also suggest that multiple BMP ligands may be supporting activation of this signaling pathway. Their expression should be shown and discussed. Could they be repressed by Dorsal?</p><p>2) What is the expression pattern of Tolloid? Similar arguments to point 1.</p><p>3) The ability to trace the expression of the Zen homologue as an indicator of maximal BMP signaling in different backgrounds could be very informative.</p><p>4) More information on the pattern of the Toll gradient shape would be important.</p><p>5) Additional support for the <italic>Toll1-dpp-</italic>RNAi results should be provided. (one may worry that the <italic>Toll1</italic> RNAi support weak activation that becomes apparent in the absence of BMP signaling; What does <italic>Toll1-dl1-dpp</italic> RNAi look like? How about <italic>Toll1-tld</italic> RNAi?).</p><p>In addition, it would be interesting to directly define the shape of the Dorsal gradient (e.g. by indirect immunofluorescence if antibodies are available or could be produced in a reasonable length of time) as this shape is an important output of the modeling. In <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>, the first diagram suggests that the height and width of the Dorsal gradient increases in time. What is the evidence to support this in the milkweed bug? In <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>, the second diagram shows that in the middle of the “twinned” embryo, a peak of BMP signaling abuts a domain of high <italic>sog</italic> expression. How is this possible?</p><p>The authors should also discuss how <italic>sog</italic> can be expressed in a small ventral domain in dl1-RNAi mutants. There must be some “polarity cue” and yet development does not proceed normally. So the levels of Dorsal are important to some degree? Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have provided evidence that genes expressed in lateral regions (e.g. brinker) are ubiquitously expressed in <italic>dl dpp</italic> double mutants. Is <italic>sog</italic> expressed ubiquitously within <italic>dl dpp</italic> double <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Sachs et al., the authors present an analysis of DV patterning in the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic>. They use RNAi methods and mathematical modeling to study interactions between the Toll and BMP signaling pathways. From their RNAi data, the authors conclude that (1) BMP signaling is active throughout the DV axis and must be repressed ventrally through expression of <italic>sog</italic> to allow ventral patterning; and (2) Toll is not required to support any cell types but is required for symmetry breaking.

How is this possible?</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Sachs et al. examines the roles of the Toll and BMP pathways in DV patterning of the Hemimetabolous insect <italic>Oncopelus</italic>. With the universal role of BMP DV patterning in multicellular organisms, and the restricted role of the Toll pathway in DV patterning of Holometabolous insects like <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the question was what is the relation of the Toll and BMP pathways in DV patterning of <italic>Oncopelus</italic>. They show that BMP signaling is required to repress expression of early ventral and lateral genes (<italic>twi</italic> and <italic>sog</italic>) in the dorsal region. At early embryogenesis Sog displays a low and uniform expression. The role of Toll signaling is only to break this symmetry and lead to an increase (even a moderate one) in Sog levels at the ventral side. In a double RNAi mutant for Toll and <italic>dpp</italic>, ventral fates take over the entire embryo, indicating that in this species this is the default, and the role of Toll is only to repress BMP signaling in the ventral region by elevating the level of Sog. Because of the cross regulatory interactions between <italic>dpp</italic> and Sog, this leads to a stable BMP activation pattern and expression of the cardinal genes in restricted domains. Computational analysis indicates that this regulatory circuitry is robust to fluctuations, and requires only a minimal bias by the Toll pathway.</p><p>In general, the detailed dissection of developmental pathways in organisms that are removed from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is successfully used by the Roth lab, and especially the deviations from what we know in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, provide a fresh view not only on the evolution of these pathways, but also on their regulatory logic. This work is a case in point.</p><p>Several experiments were missing and would provide a broader view of the topic:</p><p>1) What is the expression profile of <italic>dpp</italic> in <italic>Oncopelus</italic> embryos at different stages? This is important because it would provide the context to interpret the results in Sog RNAi embryos. Is the global activation of the BMP pathway a result of BMP diffusion from the dorsal region, or a reflection of a uniform expression of <italic>dpp</italic>? If <italic>dpp</italic> expression is restricted to the dorsal region, is the repression of expression in the ventral region dependent on Toll signaling, similar to the induction of Sog?</p><p>2) What is the expression pattern of Tolloid? Similar arguments to point 1.</p><p>3) What is the nuclear distribution pattern of Dorsal1 and Dorsal2 in wt embryos, and in embryos in which <italic>dpp</italic> signaling has been eliminated? I know that this analysis would require a significant work of raising antibodies, but perhaps it could be circumvented by injection of a plasmid expressing tagged or GFP-linked Dorsal1. It would be important to see the pattern of the Toll activation gradient, and to assess if it extends sufficiently into the dorsal side, to account for the proposed bias in that region in the that is relevant to the Sander experiment (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). It would also be important to demonstrate that the Toll gradient is the primary symmetry-breaking event, and is not affected by the loss of the downstream BMP pathway.</p><p>Several points should be clarified further in the text, without a requirement for additional experiments:</p><p>Sog levels were not erased but only reduced in the Sog RNAi embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). While the residual Sog is now uniformly expressed, there still appears to be some difference between the level of pMad in the dorsal vs. ventral parts of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,H</xref>). This would not agree with the model, but perhaps the embryos shown are not representative, or maybe there is still some bias in the expression of Sog which resolves only to a very shallow pMad pattern because of the limited levels of Sog?</p><p>The central point of the paper is the switch from a uniform distribution of Sog, to the restricted expression of Sog in the ventral and ventro-lateral domains, and the complementary pattern of BMP activation, triggered by the ventral bias of Toll signaling. The ability to convert even a small bias (as in the middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) to a bistable robust BMP pattern, clearly relies on transport of the Sog-BMP complex and its cleavage in the dorsal region by Tolloid. In this respect the logic of modulating BMP signaling is similar to what was described in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It is not clear however whether this process is also responsible (as it is in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) for generating a graded pattern WITHIN the domain of BMP signaling. As far as I could tell, the pMad levels in embryos that are depleted for Sog were comparable to wt, suggesting that in the absence of inhibition by Sog, the levels of <italic>dpp</italic> are sufficient to elicit maximal signaling and no further concentration of the ligand is required. Also, the late patterns of pMad show sharp borders and fairly uniform expression within the dorsal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). I would like to see some more discussion of this issue, regarding the question whether a graded BMP activation pattern is or is not generated within the dorsal region.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05502.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Sachs et al., study DV patterning in the milkweed bug</italic> Oncopeltus fasciatus<italic>.

Several additional data are therefore essential</italic>:</p><p>The reviewers have noted that a decreasing role of Toll signaling accompanied by an expanded function of BMP was already described in our recent CB paper on <italic>Nasonia</italic>. Indeed, we had found evidence for a diminished role of Toll signaling even in earlier work on the beetle <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>). To show that our new findings for <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> provide an important step in an evolutionary progression we have expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and included <italic>Tribolium</italic> as well as <italic>Nasonia</italic>. We also added more material to the Introduction and Discussion to explain the difference between <italic>Nasonia</italic> and <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>. In brief: <italic>Nasonia</italic> represents a highly derived system as it is the only insect known so far which establishes the DV pattern in a bipolar manner. The BMP gradient appears to emerge from a maternal source along the dorsal midline independently from Toll and without transport through a ventrally expressed inhibitor. Sog is missing from the genome. In this respect <italic>Nasonia’s</italic> DV patterning system is more derived than that of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Nasonia Toll</italic> on the other hand remains responsible for ventral fates providing highly refined patterning information along the ventral midline. The <italic>Toll dpp</italic> double knockdown in <italic>Nasonia</italic> lacks mesoderm, in contrast to the double knockdown in <italic>Oncopeltus</italic>. Taken together while BMP is the dominant morphogen in <italic>Nasonia</italic> both the formation of the BMP gradient and the continued requirement of Toll signaling for the mesoderm/mesectoderm formation are in strong contrast to the DV patterning system of <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> that clearly represents an ancestral state with similarities to spiders and vertebrates.</p><p><italic>1) More information on the expression patterns of the different players in the BMP pathway is essential: Where is</italic> dpp <italic>expressed? It is implied that</italic> dpp <italic>is no longer under Toll-dependent regulation in the milkweed bug (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>diagram), however no in situ data is included. The authors also suggest that multiple BMP ligands may be supporting activation of this signaling pathway. Their expression should be shown and discussed. Could they be repressed by Dorsal?</italic></p><p>The expression of the components of the BMP system including <italic>dpp</italic>, a second BMP ligand (<italic>gbb</italic>), <italic>tolloid</italic> and <italic>twisted gastrulation</italic> (<italic>tsg</italic>) are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. All of these components are either uniformly expressed or have extremely low expression levels, so that they cannot be detected at early blastoderm stages when their activity is required for BMP gradient formation. We know that the probes work since they detect the conserved local expression in late stages. Very low levels are apparently sufficient to support patterning. A similar situation was observed in <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Nasonia</italic> where early <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>tsg</italic> are weakly and evenly expressed at the stages when the BMP gradient forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Zee et al., 2006</xref>; Fonseca et al., 2010; Özüak et al., 2014). Thus, regulatory inputs of Toll signaling on these components are alreadylacking in <italic>Tribolium</italic> and <italic>Nasonia</italic> and might have evolved only in the lineage leading to <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) What is the expression pattern of Tolloid? Similar arguments to point 1</italic>.</p><p>See response to point 1.</p><p><italic>3) The ability to trace the expression of the Zen homologue as an indicator of maximal BMP signaling in different backgrounds could be very informative</italic>.</p><p>Low levels of <italic>Oncopeltus zen</italic> expression are found along the entire circumference of early blastoderm embryos and resolves into a complex pattern that spans the egg circumference at the differentiated blastoderm stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panfilio et al., 2006</xref>). This is one example of many genes dorsally expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other holometabolous insects, which we tried to use as marker genes and found that they are absent, evenly expressed, or have altered expression domains during blastoderm stages. The failure of the candidate gene approach highlights one of the difficulties connected to working with a hemimetabolous insect. Many aspects of DV patterning are apparently not conserved. In the future we plan unbiased genomic approaches (RNA-seq) combined with RNAi KD to identify new marker genes.</p><p><italic>4) More information on the pattern of the Toll gradient shape would be important</italic>.</p><p>The closest approximation of the Toll activation gradient is the nuclear Dorsal gradient since it has not been possible in insects to directly detect activated Toll receptors or the distribution of the Toll ligand Spätzle. We agree that it would be crucial to show the nuclear Dorsal gradient and have raised antibodies against <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> Dorsal1 already at the beginning of our study. However, the antibodies are only useful for western blots and have not worked for whole mount stainings. The fixation methods for early <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> blastoderm embryos are excellent for ISH, but do not reliably preserve protein epitopes. The pMAD stainings provided a lucky exception. We have also tried transient expression essays with GFP constructs. But this was not successful so far. In the future we plan to establish transgenesis and, using the genome which is close to completion, we want to perform genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</p><p>Given the lack of Dorsal staining we have added cactus in situs. This had been our proxy for Toll activity in <italic>Nasonia</italic> where we also lack anti-Dorsal antibodies. In all insects studied so far including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sandmann et al 2007</xref>) cactus is an early target gene of Toll signaling and this seems to be an ancestral regulatory circuitry since it has also been observed as an essential element in the innate immune system. <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> possesses several cactus paralogs. Strong knockdown of early expressed paralogs lead to a failure of normal blastoderm formation. However, weak knockdown shows mild ventralization, indicating that at least two of the paralogs are involved in DV patterning. One of them shows early ventral expression which encompasses approximately 60-70% of the egg circumference (the domain is wider than that of <italic>sog</italic>). This indicates that early Toll signaling extends into the dorsal half of the embryo, a prerequisite for explaining the Sander experiment. These considerations are now addressed in the manuscript with the additional <italic>cact</italic> data (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Additional support for the</italic> Toll1-dpp-<italic>RNAi results should be provided. (one may worry that the Toll1 RNAi support weak activation that becomes apparent in the absence of BMP signaling; What does</italic> Toll1-dl1-dpp <italic>RNAi look like? How about Toll1-tld RNAi?)</italic><underline>.</underline></p><p>For the epistasis analysis we have chosen the two genes which give the most complete and most penetrant knockdowns: <italic>Toll1</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic>. All other Toll signalling or BMP signalling components give more variable knockdown results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This applies in particular to <italic>dorsal1</italic> as there are two <italic>dorsal</italic> genes (<italic>dl1</italic> and <italic>dl2</italic>) which as single KD lead only to partial dorsalization. Most importantly we are sure that we are dealing with double KD embryos as we observed a phenotypic feature of the <italic>Toll</italic> KD in the background of the <italic>Toll</italic>-<italic>dpp</italic> KD: the anterior shift of <italic>twi</italic>, <italic>sim</italic> and <italic>sog</italic> domains. We have now more explicitly described the function of Toll signalling in AP patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We are confident that other double KD combinations like <italic>Toll</italic>-<italic>tld</italic> or <italic>dl1</italic>-<italic>pp</italic> could not provide clearer results.</p><p>In this context it is important to note that elevated BMP levels also provide strong evidence for a fundamental difference in ventral gene regulation between <italic>Oncopeltus</italic> and the known Holometabolous insects. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic>, <italic>twi</italic> and <italic>sog</italic> cannot be repressed by elevating BMP levels.
