Such a process occurs during the formation of the carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment that assembles around many copies of the enzymes ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase to facilitate carbon fixation in cyanobacteria. Our simulations identify two classes of assembly pathways leading to encapsulation of many-molecule cargoes. In one, shell assembly proceeds concomitantly with cargo condensation. In the other, the cargo first forms a dense globule; then, shell proteins assemble around and bud from the condensed cargo complex. Although the model is simplified, the simulations predict intermediates and closure mechanisms not accessible in experiments, and show how assembly can be tuned between these two pathways by modulating protein interactions. In addition to elucidating assembly pathways and critical control parameters for microcompartment assembly, our results may guide the reengineering of viruses as nanoreactors that self-assemble around their reactants.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14078.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14078.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14078.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacterial microcompartments are protein shells that are found inside bacteria and enclose enzymes and other chemicals required for certain biological reactions. For example, the carboxysome is a type of microcompartment that enables the bacteria to convert the products of photosynthesis into sugars. During the formation of a microcompartment, the outer protein shell assembles around hundreds of enzymes and chemicals. This formation process is tightly controlled and involves multiple interactions between the shell proteins and the cargo – the enzymes and other reaction ingredients – they will enclose. Understanding how to control which enzymes are encapsulated within microcompartments could help researchers to re-engineer the microcompartments so that they contain drugs or other useful products.</p><p>Recent studies have used microscopy to visualize how microcompartments are assembled. However, most of the intermediate structures that form during assembly are too small and short-lived to be seen. It has therefore not been possible to explore in detail how shell proteins collect the necessary cargo and then assemble into an ordered shell with the cargo on the inside. Experiments alone are probably not enough to understand the process, especially since microcompartment assembly can currently only be studied within live cells or cellular extract. Within these complex environments it is difficult to determine the effect of any individual factor on the overall assembly process.</p><p>Perlmutter, Mohajerani and Hagan have now taken a different approach by developing computational and theoretical models to explore how microcompartments assemble. Computer simulations showed that microcompartments could assemble by two pathways. In one pathway, the protein shell and cargo coalesce at the same time. In the other pathway, the cargo molecules first assemble into a large disordered complex, with the shell proteins attached on the outside. The shell proteins then assemble, carving out a piece of the cargo complex. The simulations showed that many factors affect how the shell assembles, such as the strengths of the interactions between the shell proteins and the cargo. They also identified a factor that controls how much cargo ends up inside the assembled shell.</p><p>Perlmutter, Mohajerani and Hagan found that, in addition to revealing how microcompartments may assemble within their natural setting, the simulations provided guidance on how to re-engineer microcompartments to assemble around other components. This would enable researchers to create customizable compartments that self-assemble within bacteria or other host organisms, for example to carry out carbon fixation or make biofuels.</p><p>A future challenge will be to investigate other aspects of microcompartment assembly, such as the factors that control the size of these compartments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14078.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14078.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>self-assembly</kwd><kwd>bacterial microcompartment</kwd><kwd>carboxysome</kwd><kwd>viral capsid</kwd><kwd>simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmutter</surname><given-names>Jason D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohajerani</surname><given-names>Farzaneh</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagan</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1420382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hagan</surname><given-names>Michael F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational and theoretical models reveal mechanisms by which protein compartments assemble around enzymes and reagents to facilitate reactions in bacteria, allowing the identification of strategies for reengineering such compartments as customizable nanoreactors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Encapsulation is a hallmark of biology. A cell must co-localize high concentrations of enzymes and reactants to perform the reactions that sustain life, and it must safely store genetic material to ensure long-term viability. While lipid-based organelles primarily fulfill these functions in eukaryotes, self-assembling protein shells take the lead in simpler organisms. For example, viruses surround their genomes with a protein capsid, while bacteria use large icosahedral shells known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) to sequester the enzymes and reactions responsible for particular metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerfeld et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shively et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bobik et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erbilgin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Price and Badger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shively et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shively et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerfeld and Erbilgin, 2015</xref>). Within diverse bacteria, BMC functions have been linked to bacterial growth, carbon fixation, symbiosis, or pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerfeld and Erbilgin, 2015</xref>). Other protein-based compartments are found in bacteria and archea (<italic>e.g.</italic> encapsulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>) and gas vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfeifer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>)) and even eukaryotes (<italic>e.g.</italic> vault particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kickhoefer et al., 1998</xref>)), while some viruses may assemble around lipidic globules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindenbach and Rice, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faustino et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, understanding the factors that control microcompartment assembly and encapsulation is a central question in modern cell biology. From the perspectives of synthetic biology and nanoscience, there is great interest in reengineering BMCs or viruses as nanoreactors that spontaneously encapsulate enzymes and reagents in vitro (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas and Young, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rurup et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patterson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rurup et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wörsdörfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Comas-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>), or as customizable organelles that assemble around a programmable set of core enzymes in vivo, introducing capabilities such as carbon fixation or biofuel production into bacteria or other organisms (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerfeld and Erbilgin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonacci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choudhary et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lassila et al., 2014</xref>). However, the principles controlling such co-assembly processes have yet to be established, and it is not clear how to design systems to maximize encapsulation.</p><p>In this article we take a step toward this goal, by developing theoretical and computational models that describe the dynamical encapsulation of hundreds of cargo molecules by self-assembling icosahedral shells. Although our models are general, we are motivated by recent experiments on a type of BMC known as the carboxysome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerfeld et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iancu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Carboxysomes are large (40–400 nm), roughly icosahedral shells that encapsulate a dense complex of the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and other proteins to facilitate the Calvin-Bensen-Bassham cycle in autotrophic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Price and Badger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shively et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shively et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iancu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerfeld et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, striking microscopy experiments visualized <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>carboxysome shells assembling on and budding from procarboxysomes (the condensed complex of RuBisCO and other proteins found in the interior of carboxysomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

However, the mechanisms of budding and pinch-off to close the shell remain incompletely understood because of the small size and transient nature of assembly intermediates. Moreover, experiments suggest that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>carboxysomes (another form of carboxysome) assemble by a different mechanism, in which shell assembly encapsulates an initially diffuse pool of RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iancu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2015</xref>). The factors determining which of these assembly pathways occurs are unknown.</p><p>BMC assembly is driven by a complex interplay of interactions among the proteins forming the external shell and the interior cargo. It is difficult, with experiments alone, to parse these interactions for those mechanisms and factors that critically influence assembly pathways, especially due to the lack of an in vitro assembly system. Models which can correlate individual factors to their effect on assembly are therefore an important complement to experiments.</p><p>Previous experimental and theoretical studies of encapsulation by icosahedral shells, e.g. the assembly of viral capsids around their nucleic acid genomes (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu and Shklovskii, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kivenson and Hagan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elrad and Hagan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perlmutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mahalik and Muthukumar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Linse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hagan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devkota et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodavka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dykeman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zlotnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadena-Nava et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comas-Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garmann et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malyutin and Dragnea, 2013</xref>), have demonstrated that the structure of the cargo can strongly influence assembly pathways and products. However, BMCs assemble around a cargo which is topologically different from a nucleic acid — a fluid complex comprising many, noncovalently linked molecules. We demonstrate here that changing the cargo topology leads to new assembly pathways and different critical control parameters.</p><p>We present phase diagrams and analysis of dynamical simulation trajectories showing how the thermodynamics, assembly pathways, and emergent structures depend on the interactions among shell proteins and cargo molecules. Within distinct parameter ranges, we observe two classes of assembly pathways, which resemble those suggested for respectively <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>carboxysomes. We find that tunability of cargo loading is a key functional difference between the two classes of pathways. Shells assembled around a diffuse cargo can be varied from empty (containing almost no cargo) to completely full, whereas assembly around a condensed, procarboxysome-like complex invariably produces full shells. While we find that the encapsulated cargo becomes ordered due to confinement, complete crystalline order in the globule before encapsulation inhibits budding. We discuss these results in the context of recent observations on carboxysome assembly, and their implications for engineering BMCs, viruses or drug delivery vehicles that assemble around a fluid cargo (<italic>e.g.</italic> Refs.

Since icosahedral symmetry can accommodate at most 60 identical subunits, formation of large icosahedral structures requires subunits to assemble into different local environments. The subunits can be grouped into pentamers and hexamers, with 12 pentamers at the icosahedron vertices and the remaining subunits in hexamers. Viruses typically assemble from small oligomers of the capsid protein, which we refer to as the basic assembly unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagan, 2014</xref>). Recent AFM experiments demonstrated that hexamers are the basic assembly unit during the assembly of BMC shell facets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sutter et al., 2016</xref>), and the carboxysome major shell proteins crystallize as pentamers and hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Motivated by these observations, our model considers two basic assembly units, one a pentamer and the other a hexamer, with interactions designed so that the lowest energy structure corresponds to a truncated icosahedron with 12 pentamers and 20 hexamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While BMCs generally have more hexamers, our model is intended to explore the general principles of assembly around a fluid cargo rather than model a specific system.

Insertion of the final subunit breaks the neck and completes shell detachment.

This disparity demonstrates the key role that the cargo plays in promoting shell association, during all stages of assembly. Cargo molecules initially promote shell nucleation by stabilizing interactions among small, sub-nucleated clusters. Then, the presence of a condensed globule provides a large cross-section for adsorption of additional subunits, significantly enhancing the flux of subunits to the partial capsid, thus increasing its growth rate. The condensed cargo particularly facilitates insertion of the last few subunits, which are significantly hindered by steric interactions, as noted previously for simulations of empty virus capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows how the products of assembly around cargo with weak interactions depends on parameters.

As for assembly around a globule, overly strong interactions lead to overnucleation and malformed shells. However, the predominant mode of malformation is now shell collapse. Because the cargo is below its dew point, the locally condensed globule leads to a negative pressure on the shell subunits, which can flatten the shell and thus prevent closure of a symmetric shell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Thermodynamic model</title><p>The simple free energy model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations (1–2)</xref>) reproduces the threshold parameter values required for shell assembly with no adjustable parameters (color map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Our simulations show that assembly can proceed by two classes of pathways: (i) a multi-step process in which the cargo forms a dense globule, followed by adsorption, assembly, and budding of shell proteins, or (ii) single-step assembly, with simultaneous aggregation of cargo molecules and shell assembly. This result demonstrates that the minimal interactions included in our model are sufficient to drive both classes of assembly pathways, suggesting that they are a generic feature of assembly around a fluid cargo. Moreover, while we cannot rule out the existence of active mechanisms in biological examples such as carboxysomes, our model demonstrates that the same interactions which drive assembly of shells can also drive budding from and closure around an amorphous globule of cargo.</p><p>Our results suggest bounds on the relative strengths of interactions that drive BMC assembly in cells. The decisive control parameter determining the assembly pathway is the cohesive energy between cargo molecules, which could arise through direct cargo-cargo interactions or be mediated by auxiliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>). Relatively weak cargo interactions lead to single-step assembly pathways, while stronger interactions favor formation of the cargo-shell globule. However, the strength of cargo-shell and shell-shell interactions also play a role. Strong shell-shell interactions cause assembly to proceed rapidly during globule formation, limiting the size of the globule. Moreover, if a large globule is already present (<italic>e.g.</italic> due to time-dependent protein concentrations within a cell), strong interactions tend to drive malformed assemblies. We find that an important functional difference between the two classes of assembly pathways is control over the amount of packaged cargo. While the multi-step assembly pathways always generate a shell filled with cargo molecules, shells assembling around a diffuse cargo can be tuned from nearly empty to completely full by controlling the strength of cargo-shell interactions.</p><p>These results have implications for reengineering BMCs to encapsulate new core enzymes. Recent works demonstrated that protein cargos can be targeted to BMCs via encapsulation peptides that mediate cargo-shell interactions. However, packaged amounts were much lower than for native core enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choudhary et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lassila et al., 2014</xref>). Our simulations show that both cargo-shell and cargo-cargo interactions (direct or mediated) must be controlled to assemble full shells.</p><p>We also find that a general equilibrium theory describes the ranges of parameter values for which assembly occurs. However, the dynamical simulations demonstrate that, at finite timescales, there is a rich variety of assembly morphologies. Formation of ordered, full shells requires a delicate balance of cargo-cargo, cargo-shell, and shell-shell interactions, all of which must be on the order <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mtext>B</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This constraint is consistent with previous studies on viruses and other assembly systems, which found that formation of ordered states requires multiple, cooperative weak interactions between subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whitelam and Jack, 2015</xref>). Outside of optimal parameter regimes, the simulations predict alternative outcomes, ranging from no assembly to various alternative trapped intermediates, with the morphology depending on which interaction is strongest. We find that assembly is least robust to parameter variations when the cargo crystallizes before shell assembly. The assembling shell is unable to deform or penetrate the cargo complex, leading to defect-riddled, non-budded complexes. Within the limits of our simplified model, this observation suggests that procarboxysome complexes are at least partially fluid prior to successful shell assembly. Moreover, we find that observations of ordered cargo within assembled shells may be explained by packing constraints.</p><p>An important limitation of the present study is that the model interactions are specific to the shell geometry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (containing 20 hexamers) because alternating edges on hexagonal subunits have attractive interactions only with pentagonal subunits. In reality BMCs contain many more hexamers (formed from multiple protein sequences) and thus must include a greater range of hexamer-hexamer interactions. Extension of the model to allow for this possibility would allow consideration of two important questions: (1) The mechanism controlling insertion of the 12 pentagons required for a closed shell topology. (2) The relationship between assembly pathway and BMC size polydispersity. In particular, experiments suggest that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf150"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-carboxysomes are more polydisperse than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf151"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Price and Badger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shively et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shively et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iancu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerfeld et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). We speculate that in the case of assembly around vapor-phase cargo, the size of the assembling shell will be primarily dictated by the preferred shell protein curvature and thus relatively uniform. However, during assembly around a condensed globule, the shell protein interactions could be strained to accommodate a globule which is larger or smaller than the preferred curvature, causing the shell size to depend on a complex balance of intermolecular interaction strengths and variables such as the local RuBisCO concentration.</p><p>Our model is minimal, intended to elucidate general principles of assembly around a fluid cargo, and thus may apply to diverse systems including prokaryotic microcompartments, viruses, and engineered delivery vehicles. The predicted trends for how assembly mechanisms and morphologies vary with control parameters can be experimentally tested by microscopy experiments. Such testing will be most straightforward in vitro (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas and Young, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rurup et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patterson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rurup et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wörsdörfer et al., 2012</xref>), where subunit-subunit interactions can be tuned by varying solution conditions and the stoichiometries of shell and cargo species can be readily varied. While there is currently no BMC assembly system starting from purified components, our findings can be tested in vivo by mutations which alter known protein binding interfaces, or by altering expression levels of RuBisCO or carboxysome proteins.</p><p>We anticipate that our model can serve as a qualitative guide for understanding how such multicomponent complexes assemble in natural systems, or to reengineer them for new applications. More broadly, our results demonstrate that the properties of encapsulated cargo, such as its topology, geometry and interaction strengths, strongly influence assembly pathways and morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Computational model</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Shell subunits</title><p>We have adapted a model for virus assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perlmutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perlmutter and Hagan, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wales, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fejer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruiz-Herrero and Hagan, 2015</xref>) to describe assembly of an icosahedral shell around a fluid cargo.

Unless specified otherwise, each simulation contained enough subunits to form four complete shells (48 pentamers and 80 hexamers) and 611 cargo particles (a shell typically encapsulates 120–130 cargo particles) in a cubic box with side length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf157"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>40</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext>u</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The simulation time step was <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf158"><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> in dimensionless time units, and dynamics was performed for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf159"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mn>8</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> timesteps unless mentioned otherwise.</p><p>We performed two sets of simulations, using different initial conditions. In the first, simulations were initialized by introducing cargo particles and shell subunits simultaneously with random positions and orientations (except avoiding high-energy overlaps). The second set of initial conditions was motivated by the possibility that the cargo globule could form before shell subunits reach sufficient concentrations within the cell to undergo assembly. To model this situation, we pre-equilibrated the cargo by performing a long simulation with only cargo particles present. Shell subunits were then introduced with random positions and orientations (excluding high-energy overlaps). For <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>CC</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the assembly simulations thus began with a cargo globule already present.

To assess statistical error and to estimate the distribution of different assembly outcomes, we performed 10 independent trials for one value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf162"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>SS</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at each value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf163"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>SC</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf164"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>CC</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. We also performed additional simulations at parameter sets for which 5 trials did not result in a majority outcome, or when necessary to obtain better statistics on the number of encapsidated cargo particles. Based on these results, performing additional simulations at other parameter values would not qualitatively change our results. (It would increase the statistical accuracy of estimated boundaries between different outcomes; however, these boundaries correspond to crossovers rather than sharp transitions.)</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Thermodynamics of assembly around a fluid cargo</title><p>To complement the finite-time simulations, we have developed a general thermodynamic description of assembly around a fluid cargo.

The globule containing unassembled shell subunits thus resembles a spherical microemulsion droplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Safran, 1994</xref>).

assembly, developed by Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wales, 2005</xref>) and Johnston <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>), which we have adapted to describe interactions with cargo molecules.</p><p>Each subunit contains ‘Attractors’ on its perimeter that mediate subunit-subunit attraction (as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruiz-Herrero and Hagan, 2015</xref>]). Attractor interactions are specific – complementary pairs of Attractors have short-range interactions (modeled by a Morse potential), whereas non-complementary pairs have no interactions. For simplicity, complementarity is defined based only on the low-energy structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>); i.e., there is no attraction between pairs of pentagons. Complementary pairs of attractors are: for the hexagon-hexagon interaction, A4-A4, A5-A6, and for the hexagon-pentagon interaction A1-A4, A2-A8, A3-A7. The strength of attractive interactions is parameterized by the well-depth <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf182"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>SS</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Because vertex attractors (A1, A4) have multiple partners in an assembled structure, whereas edge attractors have only one, the well-depth for A1-A4 and A4-A4 interactions is set to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf183"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>SS</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, while all other attractor interactions use <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf184"><mml:msub><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mtext>SS</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. The ‘Top’ height, or distance out of the attractor plane, sets the Top-Top distance between interacting subunits, which determines the preferred subunit-subunit angle. We use a height of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf185"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext>b</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf186"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext>b</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> the distance between a vertex attractor and the center of the pentagon.

id="s22"><title>Motivation for choice of interaction potentials</title><p>The choices we have made for potential functions (Morse or Lennard-Jones) between different classes of pseudoatoms are based on the need for tunability of the interaction length scale and the extent to which guidance on parameterization is available from the existing literature. In particular, the Morse potential enables controlling the interaction length scale independently from the particle excluded volume size, whereas the interaction length scale and excluded volume size are tuned by a single parameter in the Lennard-Jones potential. Our shell-shell interaction potential is based on previous models for viral capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wales, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruiz-Herrero and Hagan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perlmutter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perlmutter and Hagan, 2015b</xref>), and the choice of a Morse potential for attractor-attractor interactions and a Lennard-Jones potential for Top-Top interactions follows these previous works. The attractor interactions are modeled using a Morse potential because the length scale of their interaction strongly affects the subunit orientational specificity. We chose to model the cargo-cargo interaction using a Lennard-Jones potential because the phase behavior for this model has been extensively studied in the literature, thus limiting the need for model parameterization. However, we note that it could be of interest to study how the probability of shell detachment depends on the length scale of the cargo-cargo interaction; we speculate that a longer-range interaction would increase the probability of detachment by making it easier for shell subunits to penetrate into the globule. Finally, the shell-cargo interactions could have used either choice of potential; we elected to use a Morse potential due to its greater flexibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s23" sec-type="appendix"><title>1.2 Maximum cargo loading</title><p>To give context to the densities of packaged cargo particles that we observe in simulations, we estimate the maximum possible cargo loading here.

The theory provides a description of phase behavior in terms of simple physical parameters, and enables evaluating the extent to which our finite-time dynamical simulations have approached equilibrium. We assume that the equilibrium distribution is dominated by three classes of system configurations: free cargo and shell subunits, a disordered globule of cargo molecules with unassembled shell subunits on its surface, and assembled shells filled with cargo molecules. Extension to consider partially assembled intermediates and partially filled shells is straightforward but would complicate the presentation; moreover, at conditions leading to productive assembly, concentrations of partially assembled intermediates are negligible at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Safran, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gelbart et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>We consider shells composed of species <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf252"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn id="XM263">1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn id="XM264">2</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow id="XM265"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">…</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf253"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mtext>shell</mml:mtext></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> subunits of species <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf254"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in a complete shell, which encapsulates <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf255"><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> cargo molecules (the index 0 refers to cargo molecules henceforth).

This is relevant for the formation of the carboxysome microcompartment in bacteria. The work is very impressive from a theoretical standpoint and the tendency is to accept the paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, following the main comment of Reviewer 1, re-enforced by Reviewer 3, there was debate about the suitability of the work for the biological audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. The overall feeling is that it is, but we suggest that the relevance to biology will be further emphasized. In producing the final draft of the manuscript the authors should also address the following issues:</p><p>1) Resolve the confusion about the assembly outcome (see comment of Reviewer 1).</p><p>2) Refer to Reviewer 1's point regarding the monodispersity differences between α- and β-carboxysomes.</p><p>3) Examine the effect of changing the diameter of the cargo on the results (Reviewers 1 and 2).</p><p>4) Explain why the cargo is allowed to equilibrate prior the addition of the shell, in contrast with the biological scenario (Reviewer 1).</p><p>5) Consider changing the names of the energy terms (Reviewer 1).</p><p>6) Explain why a Morse potential is used for the shell-shell and shell-cargo interactions while a Lennard-Jones potential is used for cargo-cargo interactions (Reviewer 1).</p><p>7) Consider adding the effect of non-isotropic interactions among the cargo molecules (Reviewer 1).</p><p>8) Cite the Sutter et al. article.</p><p>9) Address the point about making the model geometry more permissive (Reviewer 1).</p><p>10) Address the issue about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (Reviewer 1).</p><p>11) Consider adding the analogy to the wetting behavior of binary, immiscible, liquid droplets but not at the expense of making the paper less clear to biologists (Reviewer 3).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are capsid-like structures that function as organelles in bacteria. They are composed of both shell proteins and specific cargo proteins that self-assemble into the ~100 nm structures found in bacterial cells. Recent experimental evidence suggests that different BMCs may assemble through different mechanisms. Here, Perlmutter provide a compelling theoretical evidence of such mechanisms. The authors demonstrate that this minimal set of interactions is sufficient to drive efficient encapsulation, and they explore the phase diagrams with respect to these parameters. Two distinct paths to well-formed full shells are identified which are consistent with current hypotheses for α- and β-carboxysome assembly, respectively. The balance of energetics they identify could provide a useful conceptual framework for future work on in vitro reconstitution of existing BMCs and the engineering of synthetic ones. The manuscript is well written, and the work appears to be competently executed and analyzed.</p><p>My main concern is about the suitability of this paper for <italic>eLife</italic> and its readership. With its emphasis on statistical mechanical methods and interpretations it seems like this would be a better fit in something like the Biophysical Journal or J. Phys. Chem. B. Moreover, the work is likely to benefit from the exposure in one of these specific journals, as opposed to the more biological readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have another general concern about the categorization of assembly outcomes, which I found confusing. For instance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> 'unnucleated' is shown as a mass of cargo and shell pieces whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> 'unnucleated' is a collection of separated pieces. It is also not clear to me what exactly 'vapor assembly' means because the section &quot;Vapor Assembly&quot; describes the pathway through which α-carboxysomes are thought to assemble. Are those complete shells filled through this way counted as 'complete' or 'vapor assembly' and what determines the cutoff, the amount of cargo? There also seems to be inconsistent use of symbols where X indicates 'Stalled' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> but 'Malformed' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The Results needs a clear and organized description of each of the states as well as consistent usage of images and symbols. A table might be a good idea.</p><p>Finally, I wonder if the authors have considered the monodispersity differences between α- and β-carboxysomes. If I recall correctly, β-carboxysomes tend to be more heterogeneous between related species and even within the same cell, suggesting some fundamental difference. Does the current model provide any insight into this?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Mike Hagan and his collaborators have carried out what to my mind are the best computer studies of viral assembly by using minimal models that capture the essential physics of the assembly process. Here they carry out a computational; study that addresses a related problem, the assembly of carboxysomes. The model and computational methods they employ are similar to those they have utilized in previous studies but with an additional degree of complexity. In all of their previous work, I believe, they have used models for the protein shell that is appropriate to a T =1 capsid, which can be made up of rigid capsomers of a single type, either triangles or pentamers. Here they employ a model that is appropriate to a T = 3 shell that is made up of rigid pentamers and hexamers. While the interactions between subunits and between subunits and cargo are modeled in a similar fashion in all of these simulations, the introduction of two different subunits considerably complicates the computations. To my untutored understanding of the nuts and bolts of computer modeling, this seems to me to be a tour de force.</p><p>The work breaks new ground as well in considering the effects of the phase behavior of the cargo on the assembly path. While the results are very interesting, there are no surprises. The way in which the assembly pathway depends on the strengths of the interactions is what one would have been expected after being informed by the previous computational studies and in vitro assembly studies of viral assembly. They are by no means trivial, however and especially useful because there are no in vitro studies of carboxysome assembly. I think that this is an excellent paper.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper Perlmutter et al. present an interesting computational study of a self-assembly process whereby many small (spherical) cargo particles are encapsulated by icosahedral shells composed of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons, analogous to the T=3 protein shells of viral capsids. Using Brownian dynamics simulations the authors analyze the assembly (&quot;phase&quot;) behavior of a mixture enabling the formation of up to four complete carboxysome-like particles (CLP). The simulations are accompanied by an equilibrium thermodynamic theoretical analysis. Three interaction parameters dictate the assembly behavior of the system ϵ(LJ), ϵ(sub), ϵ(Ads) representing the (magnitudes) of the interaction energies between neighboring cargo units, capsid subunits, and subunit-cargo pairs, respectively. As expected, large ϵ(LJ) leads to solidification of the cargo particles, preventing CLP formation. Similarly large ϵsub (not simulated) would lead to the formation of empty capsids. The interesting regime is when all energies are comparable, not too small and not too large (compared to kT), in which case two scenarios are possible: (i) co-assembly of the cargo and shell and (ii) aggregation of the cargo particles, followed by &quot;carving&quot; their aggregates to form a complete CLPs (provided subunit interactions are strong enough) – as illustrated in the relevant cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and convincingly summarized in the Discussion.</p><p>Reading the Introduction and the Discussion I conclude that the simulations and their analysis are of considerable biological relevance and interest. However, not being a biologist myself, I cannot judge to what extent. On the other hand, as far as the simulations are concerned, my impression is that they are highly non-trivial and of high quality, of the same high standards as the simulations of viral assembly that Hagan et al. have pioneered. The complementing thermodynamic analysis adds a significant theoretical aspect to this work.</p><p>Reading the manuscript it also reminded me the (indeed, incomplete) analogy to the wetting behavior of binary, immiscible, liquid droplets. For such droplets of A and B molecules, depending on the interaction strengths ϵ(AA), ϵ(BB), ϵ(AB) complete segregation takes place when (ϵ(AA)+ ϵ(BB))/2&gt;ϵ(AB), and ϵ(AA)&gt; ϵ(AB), ϵ(BB)&gt; ϵ(AB), and envelopment of A by B takes place when (ϵ(AA)+ ϵ(BB))/2&gt;ϵ(AB) &gt; ϵ(BB), etc. The analogy is incomplete because of the special symmetry of the subunit-subunit and the anisotropic subunit-cargo interactions, but some similarity exists and may worth being pointed out. There are few other points which could help the reader (and may already be present in the manuscript but I missed).For instance: we are told that there are 611 cargo particles of a given diameter and we know the inner volume of the capsids. It would be of interest to know what is the maximal number of close-packed spheres can be accommodated within the capsid's volume, and what is the actual density observed. One of the figures shows layering of the cargo particles – at what density relative to the maximal density in the capsid (or in fcc solid) this happens? Other numbers of interest – again, perhaps mentioned – are the critical density and interaction energy of the cargo spheres. Maybe a list of all the &quot;limiting values&quot; of this kind should be mentioned at the beginning of the Results section.</p><p>I wonder whether all 78 references are really needed. My guess is that the list can be more economical.</p><p>But – to summarize. I find this paper interesting, original and of high scientific quality and recommend its publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14078.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>1) Resolve the confusion about the assembly outcome (see comment of Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>2) Refer to Reviewer 1's point regarding the monodispersity differences between α- and β-carboxysomes.</italic> </p><p> <italic>3) Examine the effect of changing the diameter of the cargo on the results (Reviewers 1 and 2).</italic> </p><p> <italic>4) Explain why the cargo is allowed to equilibrate prior the addition of the shell, in contrast with the biological scenario (Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>5) Consider changing the names of the energy terms (Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>6) Explain why a Morse potential is used for the shell-shell and shell-cargo interactions while a Lennard-Jones potential is used for cargo-cargo interactions (Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>7) Consider adding the effect of non-isotropic interactions among the cargo molecules (Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>8) Cite the Sutter et al. article.</italic> </p><p> <italic>9) Address the point about making the model geometry more permissive (Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>10) Address the issue about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (Reviewer 1).</italic> </p><p> <italic>11) Consider adding the analogy to the wetting behavior of binary, immiscible, liquid droplets but not at the expense of making the paper less clear to biologists (Reviewer 3).</italic> </p><p> <italic>12) Address the typos and minor points raised by reviewers 2 and 3.</italic></p><p>We have revised our attached manuscript as suggested by the reviewers. We appreciate both the positive evaluations of our manuscript and the many thoughtful suggestions for its improvement by Prof. Knobler, Prof. Ben-Shaul and the anonymous reviewer. We believe that addressing these comments has significantly improved our presentation. It was clear from the reviewer comments that, given the complex variety of structures that can assemble in the system, we needed to do a better job of clearly presenting our assembly outcomes. We have reformatted our figures to address this. Secondly, there were a number of suggestions for interesting additional simulations (indeed many of these were already on our list of things to do). We have performed these simulations to the extent possible within the two months resubmission time table, leading to several new figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are capsid-like structures that function as organelles in bacteria.

Moreover, we are particularly interested in having a conversation with the biology community about the questions that our paper addresses, and <italic>eLife</italic> is an excellent platform for this.</p><p>We have revised the text in several ways to clarify the biological relevance of our study. In the introduction we now point out that, in a system as complex as BMCs, quantitative models are an essential complement to experiments. This is especially true given the lack of a complete in vitro assembly system. In the results we now explain the relationship between the biological scenario of BMC assembly and the simulation protocols we have used. We have also used an additional protocol (see below) which may connect better to the cellular situation. In the Discussion we point out aspects of our results which set bounds on the relative strengths of interactions that can drive BMC assembly in cells. We also point out limitations of the current model which should be addressed in the future to more completely describe the biological situation, such as the question of size polydispersity.</p><p><italic>I have another general concern about the categorization of assembly outcomes, which I found confusing.

We have now implemented a new, hopefully clearer, set of category names, we use a unique symbol for each different category across all figures, and we have added a table giving a short description for each category. We have also changed the category name that was formerly ‘vapor assembly’ to avoid confusion with the other assembly pathway.</p><p> <italic>Finally, I wonder if the authors have considered the monodispersity differences between α- and β-carboxysomes.

Does the current model provide any insight into this?</italic> </p><p>We do think that the different assembly pathways between α- and β- carboxysomes play a role in the size-dispersity of carboxysomes. In the case of assembly around vapor-phase cargo, the size of the assembling carboxysome will be primarily dictated by the preferred carboxysome shell protein curvature. However, during assembly around a pre-formed globule, the shell protein interactions could be strained to accommodate a globule which is larger or smaller than the preferred curvature. The latter affect depends on the protein mechanics and orientational specificity of their interactions. For the present study, in order to focus on the simplest possible case, we designed model interactions which are size-specific and thus suppress polymorphism. Polymorphism is still possible in our model, but likely requires larger strain to the interactions than would be the case for more promiscuous interactions. We are currently investigating the best way to extend the model to allow for greater polymorphism. This requires significant exploration and model space however, and is thus beyond the scope of our current manuscript. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion mentioning the potential link between assembly pathway and size-polydispersity, and the caveat that the specificity of our current model design limits polydispersity.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this paper Perlmutter et al. present an interesting computational study of a self-assembly process whereby many small (spherical) cargo particles are encapsulated by icosahedral shells composed of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons, analogous to the T=3 protein shells of viral capsids.

However, we do fear that this Discussion might be distracting to some biologists who are less familiar with these ideas. As a compromise, we have decided to point out the similarity between a globule with unassembled shell subunits on its surface and surfactants stabilizing a spherical microemulsion droplet, where the asymmetry of the surfactant molecules plays a key role in driving them to the interface.
