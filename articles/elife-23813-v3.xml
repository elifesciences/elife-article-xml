MFN2 mutations cause axonal neuropathy, with associated lipodystrophy only occasionally noted, however homozygosity for the p.Arg707Trp mutation was recently associated with upper body adipose overgrowth. We describe similar massive adipose overgrowth with suppressed leptin expression in four further patients with biallelic MFN2 mutations and at least one p.Arg707Trp allele. Overgrown tissue was composed of normal-sized, UCP1-negative unilocular adipocytes, with mitochondrial network fragmentation, disorganised cristae, and increased autophagosomes. There was strong transcriptional evidence of mitochondrial stress signalling, increased protein synthesis, and suppression of signatures of cell death in affected tissue, whereas mitochondrial morphology and gene expression were normal in skin fibroblasts. These findings suggest that specific MFN2 mutations cause tissue-selective mitochondrial dysfunction with increased adipocyte proliferation and survival, confirm a novel form of excess adiposity with paradoxical suppression of leptin expression, and suggest potential targeted therapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23813.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23813.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23813.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Obesity and the diseases associated with it are among the biggest healthcare problems in developed countries. The word obesity means, simply, the accumulation of too much fat tissue in the body, but this ignores growing evidence that fat tissue is highly complex. Fat tissue is important for “mopping up” and storing excess calories safely, but also sends messages to the brain and other organs to report how full the body’s energy stores are. Understanding how fat tissues perform these roles will aid the development of strategies to treat or prevent obesity.</p><p>A hormone called leptin acts as a signal of the status of the body’s fat stores. High levels of leptin in the blood tell the brain that the body has plenty of fat stored. On the other hand, if the levels of leptin in the blood become very low it tells the brain to prioritize finding food and shut down any nonessential processes. This helps to prevent the body from starving. It is not clear how the production of leptin is controlled, in part because fat tissues in different parts of the body behave very differently.</p><p>Individuals who have a particular rare genetic mutation accumulate large amounts of fat tissue in their upper bodies and gradually lose fat tissue in their arms and legs. Despite accumulating a lot of fat tissue in the upper body, these individuals have extremely low levels of leptin in their blood. To investigate this genetic condition, Rocha et al. studied two children with the mutation and their healthy parents.</p><p>The experiments show that this mutation alters a protein called mitofusin 2, which is found in cell compartments called mitochondria. Mitofusin 2 helps the mitochondria to bind to each other and to other parts of the cell, which is important for the mitochondria to generate the energy needed for vital cell processes. The mitochondria in the fat cells of the children are less closely linked to each other and have an unusual appearance compared to the mitochondria in the parents’ fat cells. Further experiments showed that some genes, including the one that produces leptin, are less active in the children compared to their parents – while other genes that are involved in starvation or stress responses are more active.</p><p>This work suggests that mitochondria play an important role in regulating the production of leptin. Furthermore, it suggests that leptin or drugs that switch off stress-related genes may have the potential to be used to treat individuals with this particular mutation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

metabolic homeostasis, and either global excess (obesity) or pathologic deficiency (lipodystrophy) lead to metabolic disease. Anatomically distinct adipose depots vary in embryological origins, gene expression profiles and patterns of hormonal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>), but many questions about the determinants of adipose depot differences, and their importance for metabolic regulation, remain unanswered. In studies of human metabolic disease, attention focussed for many years on visceral white adipose tissue, and on femorogluteal subcutaneous white adipose tissue, however interest has recently increased sharply in upper body subcutaneous adipose tissue, especially in interscapular and supraclavicular regions, where both obligate and facultative thermogenic adipocytes have been shown to exist under some circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz and Enerbäck, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since the mid 19th century a devastating but rare disease characterised by a selective, massive and sometimes life-threatening increase in upper body adipose tissue has been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodie, 1846</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbst, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Madelung, 1888</xref>). This disease is called either multiple symmetrical lipomatosis (MSL) or Madelung’s disease. Although the degree of adipose overgrowth seen may be spectacular, it varies in distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbst, 2012</xref>) and the underlying pathogenesis, which is currently poorly understood, is likely to be heterogeneous. Previous studies have suggested hyperplasia of adipocytes which manifest impaired catecholamine-induced lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enzi et al., 1977</xref>), and later structural studies of pathologically increased adipose tissue have suggested that it is composed of adipocytes with some morphological and metabolic features of dysfunctional brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enzi et al., 2015</xref>). However MSL is not precisely defined, and phenotypic heterogeneity is apparent. People with MSL frequently exhibit variable additional features including peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and/or alcoholic liver disease, dyslipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbst, 2012</xref>). In some patients upper body adipose overgrowth contrasts with concomitant lipodystrophy in the femorogluteal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbst, 2012</xref>). Physiological studies have described elevated resting energy expenditure, altered lipolytic rates and perturbed adipokine levels, however these findings have tended to vary, consistent with pathogenic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbst, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sporadic MSL has been strongly linked to chronic alcohol excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enzi et al., 2015</xref>), and in rare cases is seen in the mitochondrial myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF) syndrome, accounted for in most cases by the mitochondrial tRNA(Lys) A8344G mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2003</xref>). These observations led to the suggestion that mitochondrial dysfunction may be an important pathogenic factor in MSL. In 2015, a homozygous missense mutation, p.Arg707Trp, was identified in MFN2, or mitofusin 2, in three patients with MSL and neuropathy from two families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2015</xref>). Mitofusin 2 is a nucleus-encoded mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial interactions with the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naon et al., 2016</xref>), and other aspects of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zorzano et al., 2015</xref>). Arg707 lies in the carboxy-terminal coiled coil domain HR2 of mitofusin 2 that is believed to be critical for homotypic and heterotypic interactions of mitofusin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>) with counterparts on other organelles, leading to the suggestion that the p.Arg707Trp mutation may compromise outer mitochondrial membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>MFN2 p.Arg707Trp is the only reported cause of Mendelian MSL to date, however the nature of the associated adipose pathology, and the mechanism linking this mutation to MSL is unknown. We now describe four further patients with MSL associated with biallelic MFN2 mutations, in all cases including at least one p.Arg707Trp allele, investigate key aspects of their intermediary metabolism, and examine the microscopic and transcriptomic derangements in affected adipose tissue. We thereby provide a monogenic example of primary, apparently tissue-selective mitochondrial dysfunction leading to insulin resistance, and describe a form of leptin deficiency in the face of severe upper body obesity. Our findings yield novel insights into the role of mitofusin 2 in adipocyte energy metabolism and proliferation in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>, and suggest targeted treatments for MSL that warrant further assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Case histories</title><p>Four patients of European ancestry from three families were studied. The first patient (P1) presented to medical attention at 5 years old with increasing upper body adiposity. Despite repeated attempts to reduce food intake this progressed throughout childhood in tandem with loss of lower body adipose tissue. She also developed axonal peripheral neuropathy and secondary foot contractures, requiring corrective surgery at the age of 17 years. By the age of 18 years, her body mass index (BMI) was 33 kg/m<sup>2</sup> due to massive upper body adiposity, which contrasted with near absence of femorogluteal, leg and distal arm adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). She also had primary amenorrhea with clinical, biochemical and imaging-based evidence of partial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism including retarded bone age, delayed development of secondary sexual characteristics, and a small uterus, all in the context of relatively low luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23813.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis associated with biallelic mutations in MFN2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Profile of P1, showing upper body adipose overgrowth and loss of adipose tissue and muscle from legs (left) and T1-weighted coronal MRI image of P1, highlighting excess upper body fat (right).

Exome sequencing in the family trio was undertaken and directly interrogated to look for mutations in MFN2, given the known association of MFN2 with axonal neuropathy, and its recently reported association with MSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2015</xref>). This revealed compound heterozygous mutations (p.Arg707Trp and p.Arg343del) in <italic>MFN2</italic> (MIM*608507) in P1, whereas her parents were single heterozygotes.</p><p>Patients P2 and P3 were more mildly affected. These patients, a 17-year-old female (P2) and a 16-year-old male (P3), were siblings from a multiply consanguineous family of Irish ancestry. Only the two affected siblings and their unaffected parents were available for genetic study, however multiple family members across three generations of the family were reported to have developed progressive overgrowth of adipose tissue in the upper back and chest, head and neck, from early in their second decades. Two older relatives required long term tracheostomies due to airway occlusion by overgrown neck adipose tissue, with MRI in one demonstrating diffuse fatty infiltration of the tongue and a lipomatous mass in the supraclavicular fossa. A paternal uncle was reported to have died peri-operatively after airway problems related to adipose overgrowth in his fourth decade, while three further relatives were reported to show a similar pattern of head and neck adipose overgrowth. One of these had been demonstrated to have severe sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In keeping with the familial pattern of overgrowth, P2 and P3 developed striae, or stretch marks, over their upper back, together with adipose overgrowth and concomitant loss of fat from the limbs around the age of 13 years old. Examination of P2 at 16 years old showed mild loss of adipose tissue in the forearms, with abnormal adipose tissue accumulation around the neck, upper back, and upper arms. P3, examined at the age of 15 years old was more mildly affected, but showed dorsal striae, mild adipose tissue loss from the forearms, a prominent dorsal fat pad or ‘buffalo hump’ and increased adipose tissue in the anterior neck. Neither sibling showed any other clinical abnormalities, with age-appropriate progression through puberty, and normal nerve conduction studies.</p><p>Given parental consanguinity for all affected family members, an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance was hypothesized. Exome sequencing was undertaken for P2, P3 and their parents, and the p.Arg707Trp mutation in <italic>MFN2</italic> was identified in homozygous form in both P2 and P3, and in heterozygous form in both parents.</p><p>The final patient, P4, was evaluated at 17 and 37 years old. She first reported increased head and neck adiposity with increased muscularity of her extremities around 13 years old. This progressed over ensuing years, with striking accumulation of upper back and anterior neck adipose tissue associated with severely increased appetite and frequent food craving behaviours. Other symptoms included male pattern hair growth, an irregular menstrual cycle, and acanthosis nigricans, all suggestive of insulin resistance, as well as leg cramps after exercise, and burning and tingling sensations in hands and feet. On evaluation at 17 years old she was overweight with highly dysmorphic accumulation of truncal, head and neck adiposity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), extending to the pubic region. This contrasted with a paucity of adipose tissue on the limbs, which were muscular with prominent superficial veins. Adipose tissue removed surgically for cosmetic purposes was noted to be highly vascular and lobulated. She was subsequently lost to follow up until 37 years old. At that stage her dominant problems were distressing upper body adipose accumulation with back pain exacerbated by scoliosis, with leg cramps as well as burning and tingling in hands and feet. Menstrual bleeds were irregular, but she had had one successful pregnancy. Abnormally increased appetite persisted, but was less striking than during adolescence.</p><p>Sanger sequencing of <italic>MFN2</italic> was undertaken in P4 and her unaffected father, although her mother (not knowingly related to her father) was unavailable. P4 was found to be homozygous for the MFN2 p.Arg707Trp mutation, while her father was heterozygous.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mitofusin 2 mutations</title><p>Arg707 is exquisitely conserved among MFN2 orthologues, and lies in the second heptad repeat (HR2) coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The p.Arg707Trp variant is found with an allele frequency of 0.055% in Europeans in the ExAC dataset. Literature review revealed a further patient with MSL and the p.Arg707Trp mutation co-inherited with a second, different loss-of-function allele featuring deletion of exons 7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carr et al., 2015</xref>). Three further siblings were identified with p.Arg707Trp together with the p.Gly109Arg mutation.

Sequence homology searching using HHPred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Söding, 2005</xref>) identified mitofusins as the closest mammalian homologues of the bacterial dynamin-like protein (BDLP), whose structure has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Low et al., 2009</xref>). Homology modeling suggests that mitofusins retain all key structural domains of BDLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and so mitofusin 2 may exist, like BDLP, in two conformations, one GDP-bound, lipid-free and compacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and one GTP-bound, extended and membrane-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The extended conformation is expected to <italic>cis</italic>-dimerise upon GTP-binding, with dimers further <italic>cis</italic>-oligomerising on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Low and Löwe, 2010</xref>). In-frame deletion of Arg343 destroys the helix next to the hinge between the GTPase and stalk domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and is predicted to disrupt the tip of the stalk and seriously impair transition between closed and extended conformations.</p><p>Membrane fusion depends on trans-dimerization of mitofusins on different membranes. This requires a distinct GTPase-independent extended conformation featuring an anti-parallel dimer between their extended C-terminal domains HR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franco et al., 2016</xref>). The X-ray structure of a MFN1 HR2 fragment in a homodimer is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>) and the structure of the corresponding MFN2 homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and MFN1/MFN2 heterodimer (not shown) can readily be modelled. The HR2 domain is involved in different interfaces in GDP-bound monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), in GTP-bound <italic>cis</italic>-oligomers (in which there are two different interfaces between dimers and between dimer of dimers [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>]), in GTPase-independent <italic>trans</italic>-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and in MFN2/MFN1 <italic>trans</italic> heterodimers. Arg707 contributes differently to the stability of these conformations: whereas it makes an ion pair with Asp742 in the trans antiparallel homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) or with Glu728 of MFN1 in the heterodimer, it appears on the surface in all other conformations and is not directly involved in intra- or intermolecular helix packing. Its mutation will thus almost certainly destabilise trans-dimerisation by destroying the ion pair, but will influence other conformations to much lesser degrees.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adipose tissue dysfunction</title><p>Given the anatomically obvious increase in upper body adipose tissue in all four patients studied, the function of that adipose tissue was next assessed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Fasting blood tests showed P1 and P4 but not P2 and P3 to have elevated plasma triglycerides, while P1 and P4 also had severe hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Initial oral glucose tolerance testing revealed normal glucose tolerance with elevated insulin levels in all four patients, consistent with moderate to severe insulin resistance, with fasting hyperglycaemia seen in P1 and P4 at 20 and 37 years respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). P1 and P4 also showed failure of the normal suppression of plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) in the face of increased plasma insulin. This was assessed by OGTT at two ages in P1, in whom impaired NEFA suppression contrasted both with healthy controls and with obese adolescents with overt type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hershkop et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In P4 it was assessed by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance testing using a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sumner et al., 2004</xref>), and basal NEFA of 786 µmol/L showed maximal suppression of only 18%, occurring 27 min after the glucose challenge. These findings suggest impaired suppression of lipolysis by insulin in the overgrown adipose tissue and/or the depleted lower limb adipose depots of P1 and P4. Blood lactate concentration was elevated at baseline and on two occasions in P1, rising further after an oral glucose load, suggesting impairment of mitochondrial function in an insulin-responsive tissue, although whether adipose tissue, muscle or both were responsible for this could not be discerned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

Serum leptin was undetectable in P1 and P4 on initial evaluation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) despite increased upper body adiposity, as evidenced by body mass indices of 33 and 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and whole body adipose content determined by DXA of 31% and 27.4% respectively. Serum leptin remained undetectable in P4 at 37 years old. In P2 and P3 circulating leptin concentrations were also low, but overlapped with levels seen in healthy controls, possibly reflecting the relatively early stage of evolution of the pathological adipose overgrowth. In all patients serum adiponectin levels were suppressed to levels usually only seen in generalised lipodystrophy or extreme, non receptoropathy insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Semple et al., 2006</xref>). Leptin secretion from adipose explants taken from the neck and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue of P1 was moreover undetectable, and leptin mRNA expression in the same sample was commensurately suppressed (data not shown). Surgical biopsies of overgrown interscapular subcutaneous adipose tissue were independently obtained from P2 and P3, and from five age-matched otherwise healthy female controls undergoing elective surgery for idiopathic scoliosis. Leptin mRNA expression, and adiponectin mRNA and protein expression were severely suppressed in P2 and P3 compared to controls, while mitofusin 2 protein levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). In view of the reduced suppression of lipolysis seen in P1, perilipin 1 and 2 expression were determined, with levels of perilipin 1 found to be reduced, whereas perilipin 2 expression was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>In all three patients from whom subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were obtained, histological examination revealed the expanded adipose tissue to feature exclusively unilocular adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). UCP1 immunostaining was negative (data not shown). There was no difference in adipocyte size among patients and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and in keeping with low perilipin expression in affected adipose tissue detected by immunoblotting, immunostaining for perilipin was also reduced, with marked heterogeneity seen in patient but not control adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the nearly normal appearance of affected adipose tissue by light microscopy, electron microscopy of adipose tissue from P2 and P3 revealed highly abnormal adipocyte and preadipocyte ultrastructure. Control adipocytes exhibited scattered ovoid mitochondria with narrow cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), while adipocytes from P2 and P3 showed thickening of the cytoplasmic rim and proliferation of round, enlarged mitochondria, with fragmented cristae on cross sectional imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), reminiscent of those reported in different cell types and tissues in the context of Mfn2 deficiency (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>]). Membrane-bound structures enclosed in double membranes were seen in many cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,D</xref>), potentially consistent with mitophagy, although no examples of morphologically distinct mitochondria enclosed in such membranes were seen. In occasional cells apparent extrusion of membrane-enclosed damaged mitochondria was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In both P2 and P3, 3–4 preadipocytes were seen among approximately 30 adipocytes studied by electron microscopy, while no preadipocytes were seen in control samples. Preadipocytes were associated with capillaries, showed characteristic small lipid droplets and glycogen granules, but also showed evidence of proliferation of fragmented mitochondria, many with deranged cristae, as seen in mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>mRNA extracted from affected adipose tissue from three patients was subjected to transcriptomic analysis, using RNAseq in the case of P2, P3 and five matched controls, and a microarray-based approach in a different laboratory in the case of P1, from whom subcutaneous adipose samples were independently studied from both neck and abdomen and compared to abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue from ten female controls. Primary analysis was undertaken of P2 and P3 compared to controls, with the more limited data from the comparison of P1 with controls subsequently aligned. Affected adipose tissue was transcriptionally distinct from control adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and unsupervised pathway analysis identified the most highly significant perturbation of gene expression to be related to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mitochondrial signal was accounted for by downregulation of 66 of 68 transcripts derived from mitochondria-encoded genes, contrasting with upregulation of 83 of 91 nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Despite this upregulation, however, immunoblotting for a panel of nucleus-encoded oxidative phosphorylation proteins showed universally strongly reduced levels, with citrate synthase, a marker of mitochondrial mass, also sharply reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Adipose mitochondrial DNA was modestly reduced in P2 and P3, but was not assayed in P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings suggest that the increased numbers of morphologically abnormal mitochondria seen on electron microscopy in P2 and P3 are severely hypofunctional, and that the increased transcript levels of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes represents a compensatory response that is insufficient to normalise function. Indeed, transcript levels of <italic>PGC1A</italic>, <italic>PGC1B</italic>, and <italic>NFE2L2</italic>, encoding transcription factors driving mitochondrial biogenesis were upregulated 3.2-fold, 1.8-fold, and 3.8-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23813.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ultrastructural appearances of interscapular subcutaneous adipose tissue in individuals with the homozygous MFN2 p.Arg707Trp mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of interscapular subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from a control volunteer, showing a thin cytoplasmic rim, and, in the panel below, ovoid mitochondria with thin cristae.

Understanding of its pathogenesis is likely to yield insights into poorly understood aspects of adipose tissue function that are critical to pandemic diseases, including the determinants of the differing metabolic behaviours of different adipose depots. Study of MSL has been hampered, however, by its clinical heterogeneity, and lack of knowledge of its cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herbst, 2012</xref>). The recent report of homozygosity for the MFN2 p.Arg707Trp mutation in three individuals with MSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2015</xref>) suggested the first germline Mendelian cause of the disorder, presenting a critical opportunity to further understanding of the underlying pathogenesis, however the pathology of the overgrown adipose tissue and the systemic metabolic consequences were not specifically studied. We now describe four more affected patients, confirming the genetic association, demonstrate that increased adipose mass is accounted for by hyperplasia of UCP1-negative, unilocular adipocytes, and provide evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in affected adipose tissue. We also show that depot-selective adipose hyperplasia is discordant with suppressed leptin levels and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis in severely affected patients, while insulin resistance is seen in all. These findings offer a new window into the extraordinary depot-selective adipose overgrowth of MSL, and offer new opportunities for novel therapy, and to gain insights into fundamental aspects of adipocyte behaviour crucial to pandemic disease.</p><p>Bioenergetic efficiency and ATP-generating capacity of mitochondria are heavily influenced by the dynamic architecture of the mitochondrial network (eg. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liesa and Shirihai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mishra and Chan, 2016</xref>]). This is regulated by specialised proteins including mitofusin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schrepfer and Scorrano, 2016</xref>), which is important not only in mitochondrial fusion, but also in mitochondrial-ER tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naon et al., 2016</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>), mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>) and regulation of the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pablo Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>). Global knockout of Mfn2 in mice is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>), but knockout specific to cardiac or skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sebastián et al., 2016</xref>), to dopaminergic neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pham et al., 2012</xref>), to the renal proximal tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gall et al., 2015</xref>), or to POMC neurones of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneeberger et al., 2013</xref>) is tolerated. Nevertheless in each case cell or organ dysfunction is seen. Together with evidence that <italic>MFN2</italic> expression is lowered in key metabolic tissues in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneeberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zorzano, 2009</xref>), this has led to keen interest in mitofusin 2 as a contributor to the pathogenesis of pandemic obesity-related diseases. No adipose-specific knockout has been described.</p><p>Despite this largely murine evidence for important roles of MFN2 in several tissues, MFN2 loss-of-function mutations in humans have until recently been implicated solely in axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Züchner et al., 2004</xref>), which is only weakly recapitulated in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Detmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strickland et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings, together with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al. (2015)</xref>, now highlight a second tissue-selective phenotype in humans, namely severe upper body adipose overgrowth or ‘Multiple Symmetrical Lipomatosis’ (MSL). All cases of MFN2-related MSL have featured biallelic mutations including at least one MFN2 p.Arg707Trp allele, and many, but not all, patients have shown early-onset neuropathy in addition. Our structural analysis suggests that the mutation may have differential effects on different conformations of MFN2, particularly trans-dimerisation and thus membrane fusion. It may be important that MFN2 homodimers will be most affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) as both surfaces at the interface have a mutation, while in heterodimers only one surface is mutated. The second mutation we report in P1, who is severely affected, is predicted significantly to impair or to abrogate MFN2 function by destroying the helical support of the hinge between the GTPase and stalk domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the association of the MFN2 p.Arg707Trp mutation specifically with MSL is striking, existing human genetic data do not exclude the possibility that other HR2 domain mutations may also lead to the phenotype when both MFN2 alleles are affected.</p><p>The overgrown adipose tissue is unable to execute its key metabolic functions normally, as evidenced by insulin resistance, and reduced suppression of circulating free fatty acid concentrations after a glucose load. One caveat to this assertion is that it is possible that the ‘lipodystrophic’ or triglyceride-depleted lower limb adipose depots might also be contributing to the perturbed suppression of lipolysis and insulin resistance. Most strikingly, despite dramatic upper body adipose overgrowth in MFN2–related MSL, adipose tissue expression of the archetypal adipocyte hormones leptin and adiponectin was extremely low, with P1, P4 and one of the older, more severely affected patients previously described having undetectable plasma leptin despite high fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that the differences observed in leptin concentrations among the patients we describe reflects the evolution of the disease, with all adipose depots affected either by overgrowth (upper body) or dystrophy (lower body) in P1 and P4, while in P2 and P3 some normal adipocytes remain. We suggest that advanced MFN2-related MSL represents a fourth form of severe leptin deficiency in humans, adding to congenital LEP mutations, lack of adipocytes in generalised LD, and ‘empty’ adipocytes in extreme leanness or starvation. We note that this phenotype may not be present in all MSL cases, as others have reported normal leptin levels in MSL cases of undefined cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haap et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Suppressed leptin expression could be explained if the pathologically expanding cell lineage had naturally low levels of leptin expression, as reported for brown adipocytes, or alternatively may reflect perturbation of a cellular mechanism sensing mitochondrial function and cellular energy state and transducing it into leptin gene expression. Although we demonstrate that increased adipose mass is accounted for by hyperplasia of cells with morphologic and transcriptional characteristics of UCP1-negative, unilocular white adipocytes, we cannot rule out the possibility that these cells are dysfunctional, ‘whitened’ thermogenic adipocytes, and indeed mitochondrial depletion has previously been shown to be involved in ‘whitening’ of beige adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altshuler-Keylin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Evidence of impaired mitochondrial function in MFN2-related MSL is seen in strikingly elevated blood lactate concentrations in P1, P4 and previously described patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2015</xref>), reduced expression of citrate synthase and respiratory chain components, and highly abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure in affected adipose depots. The reduction in mitochondria-encoded transcripts, contrasting with increased nucleus-encoded mitochondrial transcripts and mitochondrial biogenesis factors suggests that compensatory transcriptional programmes are activated to try to restore cellular mitochondrial function. In contrast, gene expression, and mitochondrial morphology and fusion of primary dermal fibroblasts is normal, confirming mitochondrial dysfunction in MFN2-related MSL to be tissue-selective, and suggesting that MFN2 Arg707Trp remains able to mediate mitochondrial fusion in some contexts.</p><p>Affected adipose tissue shows strong and consistent evidence of activation of mitochondrial stress responses, with notably strong upregulation of genes known to be positively regulated by ATF4 and CHOP (e.g. TRB3, ATF5, PSAT1, CHAC1, HSPA5 (BiP), SLC7A5, SLC7A11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2013</xref>) or mTORC1 signaling. ATF4 and CHOP activities and expression are upregulated by PERK, which mediates a key arm of the ER unfolded protein response, and has also been shown to interact directly with MFN2 at ER-mitochondrial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Naon and Scorrano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pablo Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>), while ATF5 has recently been suggested to be the mammalian counterpart of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> mitochondrial unfolded protein sensor ATFS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiorese et al., 2016</xref>). mTORC1 may be activated either downstream or upstream from the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appenzeller-Herzog and Hall, 2012</xref>), driving protein synthesis, especially of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morita et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Increased cell proliferation or survival in the face of mitochondrial dysfunction is not unprecedented: The phenomenon of mitohormesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yun and Finkel, 2014</xref>), whereby mild mitochondrial dysfunction exerts pro-survival effects on cells and organisms, is well established in model systems. MSL is also associated with other forms of genetic or acquired mitochondrial insult, including a common mitochondrial lysyl tRNA mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2003</xref>), HIV infection treated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giralt et al., 2011</xref>), and excess alcohol intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enzi et al., 2015</xref>). This raises the possibility that in MFN2-related MSL mitochondrial dysfunction falls in a narrow window of severity that drives mitohormetic upper body preadipocyte differentiation and/or reduced adipocyte clearance. Whether lower body adipocytes are relatively less unaffected, and thus depleted of triglyceride stores as a ‘bystander’ effect of pathologically expanding upper body adiposity, or whether they are more severely affected and thus die in the face of the same genetic insult, remains to be determined.</p><p>Arguing against a critical role for a general reduction in mitochondrial function as the critical driver of MSL, the overwhelming majority of known forms of monogenic mitochondrial dysfunction, of varying severity, are not associated with it, suggesting an alternative, or additional, specific effect of the MFN2 mutations observed. This is plausible as MFN2 deficiency has been shown in cellular contexts to suppress apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pablo Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2007</xref>), and in ischemic hearts and kidneys to reduce ischaemic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pablo Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>) damage and cell death. MFN2-related MSL could thus reflect a dyscoordinated cellular stress response to severe mitochondrial dysfunction, with MFN2 mutations preventing cell death, allowing survival and proliferation of functionally impaired cells.</p><p>Finally, our findings have potentially important implications for therapy. Hypogonadism and hyperphagia related to absolute leptin deficiency in P1 may respond to subcutaneous leptin therapy, reducing the burden imposed on overgrown adipose tissue by chronic positive energy balance, while the effect of inhibiting the upregulated anabolic pathways detected transcriptomically, such as mTOR signalling, using clinically available inhibitors, is worthy of consideration. This is in keeping with the promise shown by sirolimus in murine mitochondrial disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Volunteer recruitment</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their parents if under 18 years old.

An alternative hypothesis is that adipose tissues that seem depleted (leg and arm) are the origin of the excess FFA, but structural studies of those tissues have not been made.

We don’t believe there to be important aspects that we have not touched upon in the Introduction. Nevertheless in an attempt to focus better we have edited both by slimming down the general preamble and by adding selected further observations. Two reviews referenced in the text (Herbst, 2012 and Enzi et al., 2015) and published in the last 5 years summarise much of the past literature – we have referred to both of these extensively. Importantly, the past literature is very varied (as highlighted by Herbst, 2012), especially in relation to key aspects of the phenotype we report including leptin deficiency and perturbations in lipolysis. We suspect that this relates to heterogeneity in underlying pathogenetic mechanisms – we have tried to make this point more clearly in the revised manuscript. We shall not reproduce the whole introductory section here.</p><p><italic>B) We would like to see more detailed discussion of the current findings in light of what was already known, emphasizing what is novel and what was already established before.</italic> </p><p>Again, as noted above, studies of MSL over many decades have been scattered and predominantly descriptive, focussing on clinical phenomenology. Moreover the condition is somewhat heterogeneous, complicating interpretation of the limited number of cellular and other studies that have been undertaken. We have cited such evidence that exists, including recent good reviews, but have spent more time putting this work into the context of the large bodies of detailed mechanistic studies of mitofusin 2 <italic>in vivo</italic> and in cell models, and wider studies of mitochondrial function and adipocytes. We believe that among the most important aspects of this study is the directing of the sophisticated field of mitofusin biology towards this human entity which has not been explained or anticipated by any prior cellular or mouse studies. We are conscious that the discussion is long in order to accommodate the many important bodies of work of relevance to our findings, but we are reluctant not to make comment on these. We have slightly rearranged discussion and have added an introductory paragraph to make clear what is new, however if the reviewers and editor take a different view of what is required, we should be happy to edit further according to their guidance.</p><p><italic>C) We are keen to deepen the mechanistic explanation of the consequences of the causing mutations, ideally through responses on the following issues raised by the reviewers:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The FFA response in the most affect case is counterintuitive. How can the tissue expand to such proportions if lipolysis is not controlled (down-regulated by insulin)? Unopposed lipolysis would rapidly deplete adipocytes of their triacylglycerol content in the affected depots and one would need to either postulate a very active uptake mechanism of FFA with an even more active re-esterification of fatty acids balancing the constant outward flux of FFA. An alternative hypothesis is that adipose tissues that seem depleted (leg and arm) are the origin of the excess FFA, but structural studies of those tissues have not been made. The RNASeq data could be used to interrogate uptake pathways and storage pathways. A fatty acid profile of the tissue would be of interest. Although rather unlikely as an explanation, it could reveal unusual input of fatty acids, such as from</italic> de novo <italic>lipogenesis.</italic> </p><p>Whilst we agree that truly “unopposed lipolysis” would be expected to deplete TAG content in affected adipocytes, this is not how we interpret the observations reported and is not what we meant to suggest. We have tempered our description of lipolytic suppression to reflect our interpretation of the observations and the potential involvement of the lower limb adipose depots more accurately. The data we have derives from 2 OGTTs in proband 1, 1 OGTT in each of Probands 2 and 3, and now a frequently sampled IVGTT in (new) proband 4. Proband 1’s data showed reproducible and striking impairment of NEFA suppression during the OGTT, a pattern that was recapitulated, also rather strikingly, in the IVGTT of Proband 4. Fasting NEFA levels were unremarkable (though the reference range is wide). We maintain that this is a very interesting and potentially important observation, however the difference we describe relates only to the perturbation studied (elevated glucose and insulin) and does not equate to “unopposed lipolysis”. We also note that suppression of lipolysis is often reported to be at least slightly delayed in common forms of obesity, so the apparent discordance between increased adiposity and an increase in a surrogate marker of lipolysis under these conditions is not unprecedented – we conclude that it is possible to counterbalance this degree of lipolytic dysregulation.</p><p>As suggested we did review the gene expression data we have using a variety of approaches ranging from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), KEGG Pathway Analysis, and interrogation of manually curated pertinent gene sets. In short, while there was broad upregulation of many anabolic pathways (e.g. lipid and protein synthesis), the profile of fatty acid transporters and genes involved in FFA esterification and intracellular binding was indeterminate, with no concerted direction of change in expression. This evidence does not definitively rule out high FFA influx, not least as these pathways are subject to many posttranscriptional regulatory steps. We are committed to making all gene expression data and analytic scripts publicly available so that readers can review this type of issue themselves.</p><p>The reviewer’s suggestion that the ‘lipodystrophic’ or ‘depleted’ adipose depots might be the source of altered lipolytic regulation is an interesting idea which we have also considered – however, without access to biopsy material from femorogluteal adipose tissue before it is depleted, and with no opportunity so far to undertake depot-selective flux studies, we cannot address this experimentally at present. Nevertheless, we have revised the text to mention this possibility explicitly.</p><p>Finally, we do not unfortunately have residual adipose tissue available with which to undertake fatty acid profiling at this stage.</p><p><italic>2) Ideally, affected and unaffected adipose tissue from the same individual should have been studied, but it is appreciated this could have been logistically difficult. It would be helpful if the mitochondria of the cultured skin fibroblasts could be studied by EM to see if the aberrant structures are identified. If relevant tissue is available, we would like to see these experiments done as part of the revision.</italic> </p><p>We strongly agree that it would be highly informative to compare adipose tissue from the legs, where lipodystrophy develops, with adipose tissue from an overgrown upper body depot. The central problem with achieving this is that a tissue that is not present (as in patients 1 and 4) cannot be biopsied, and if a “blind” biopsy were taken of subcutaneous tissue from the gluteofemoral region, gene expression would likely be dominated by whatever residue of interstitial cell types remained. Gene expression of adipose tissue from the neck and abdomen of P1 was undertaken using Affy microarray, as already noted, however adipose depots were still present and overgrown to different degrees at both sites, and the gene expression proved to be highly correlated, with analysis of either dataset compared to healthy control, adipose tissue yielding essentially superimposable results:<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23813.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Affymetrix Array-determined gene expression in subcutaneous abdominal adipose biopsy (Y axis) compared to adipose tissue derived from the neck (X axis) of P1.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23813.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23813.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23813-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p>Biopsy from P2 and P3, who still have some adipose tissue in the legs, would have been very attractive, but consent was not given for this.</p><p>We have, however, had the opportunity to examine dermal fibroblasts from P1, 2, and 3 ultrastructurally using transmission electron microscopy, as requested, and have shown mitochondria in the cells to have normal morphology. Representative images have now been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, and are now commented on in results as follows:</p><p>“Furthermore, immunocytochemistry showed appropriate localisation of MFN2 expression to the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which in patient cells appeared morphologically indistinguishable from control cells both at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and after treatment with the small molecule mitochondrial fission inhibitor mdivi-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy of dermal fibroblasts from P1-3 revealed normal mitochondrial ultrastructure, with no evidence of the striking fragmentation and dysmorphism seen in adipose biopsies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Diffusion of photoactivated GFP within the network was also normal when assessed in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), although this diffusion was impaired in wild type cells by hydrogen peroxide treatment to fragment the network (data not shown). Mitochondrial membrane potential was unchanged in patient cells, as assessed by a mitochondrial membrane potential sensor JC-1 ratio assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).”</p><p>We further note the observation that TEM of the liver from new patient 4 was undertaken at the NIH as part of her workup and the mitochondria were specifically commented on as showing normal morphology. At the time of writing we have not yet been able to secure the primary images, however they were reported by an experienced pathologist specifically in the light of the high lactate level exhibited by the patient.</p><p><italic>3) More explicit description of how the data supports the inference of mitochondrial dysfunction; gene expression by itself is not sufficient to claim mitochondrial functional defect</italic> </p><p>In the original manuscript we presented several different lines of evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction (including elevated lactate, abnormal mitochondrial protein expression, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology as well as corresponding transcriptomic profile), and we summarised these explicitly in a dedicated paragraph of the discussion. We have now attempted to give this summary further prominence in a new introductory paragraph to the Discussion, while retaining most of the prior paragraph as below:</p><p>“Evidence of impaired mitochondrial function in MFN2-related MSL is seen in strikingly elevated blood lactate concentrations in P1, P4 and previously described patients (Sawyer et al., 2015), reduced expression of citrate synthase and respiratory chain components, and highly abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure in affected adipose depots. The reduction in mitochondria-encoded transcripts, contrasting with increased nucleus-encoded mitochondrial transcripts and mitochondrial biogenesis factors suggests that compensatory transcriptional programmes are activated to try to restore cellular mitochondrial function. In contrast, gene expression and mitochondrial morphology and fusion of primary dermal fibroblasts is normal, confirming mitochondrial dysfunction in MFN2-related MSL to be tissue-selective, and suggesting that MFN2 Arg707Trp remains able to mediate mitochondrial fusion in some contexts.”</p><p><italic>4) It would be interesting if the investigators could comment more on the fat depots that seem depleted. Are they depleted because there is a 'steal' phenomenon by the aberrantly expanded tissue (in line with the mosaic overgrowth due to PIKC3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or is a question of global effects on adipose tissues where certain tissue are affected and not other (such as in Dunnigan Kobberling) by as yet unexplained mechanisms?</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is a fascinating aspect of the phenotype, however the dramatic differences between areas of adipose overgrowth compared with lower limb ‘lipodystrophy’ observed most strikingly in proband 1 and now in (new) proband 4 cannot be explained at this stage given considerations above. The terminology “affected” and “unaffected” should not be applied to different adipose depots in MFN2-related MSL until this is clarified; it is possible that femorogluteal fat is more affected than upper body fat, so that adipocytes die due to mitochondrial dysfunction, causing lipodystrophy, while the same insult is more tolerated in the upper body, where a sublethal mitochondrial insult is translated into a hyperplasic response, in accordance with the notion of mitohormesis.</p><p>We note that depot-selective variation in adipose tissue is seen in several types of partial lipodystrophy, most prominently in the commonest monogenic form, LMNA-associated FPLD2. In this condition neck and facial fat are selectively preserved, while in PPARG-associated FPLD3 where abdominal fat seems to be preserved in many cases. In these instances, although the clinical syndromes have been known for nearly 20 years, mechanistic understanding also remains elusive. Further understanding of the issue in MFN2-related MSL will likely require identification of additional patients willing to undertake detailed physiological studies involving stable isotope flux analyses in ‘overgrown’ and if possible ‘lipodystrophic’ regions, and or biopsy of paired upper body and femorogluteal adipose tissue while this still exists (likely in children).</p></body></sub-article></article>
