Key amongst these is its enigmatic role in safeguarding DNA replication forks. Using DNA replication reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we show Rad53 phosphorylation of Sld3/7 or Dbf4-dependent kinase blocks replication initiation whilst phosphorylation of Mrc1 or Mcm10 slows elongation. Mrc1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient to slow replication forks in complete reactions; Mcm10 phosphorylation can also slow replication forks, but only in the absence of unphosphorylated Mrc1. Mrc1 stimulates the unwinding rate of the replicative helicase, CMG, and Rad53 phosphorylation of Mrc1 prevents this. We show that a phosphorylation-mimicking Mrc1 mutant cannot stimulate replication in vitro and partially rescues the sensitivity of a <italic>rad53</italic> null mutant to genotoxic stress in vivo. Our results show that Rad53 protects replication forks in part by antagonising Mrc1 stimulation of CMG unwinding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dna replication</kwd><kwd>dna checkpoint</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106252/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>219527/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1259–2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McClure</surname><given-names>Allison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>669424-CHROMOREP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diffley</surname><given-names>John FX</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA replication fork rate in budding yeast is regulated in response to DNA damage by phosphorylation of two proteins, Mrc1 and Mcm10, by the Rad53 protein kinase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In response to DNA replication stress such as low nucleotide levels or DNA damage, a cascade of events is orchestrated by the DNA replication checkpoint to ensure genome protection. DNA replication stress is detected by proteins that activate the apical protein kinase Mec1 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (ATR in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pardo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saldivar et al., 2017</xref>). Mec1 then activates the effector protein kinase Rad53 through two mediator proteins, Rad9 and Mrc1. Active Rad53 coordinates a broad response to promote cell survival by regulating damage-dependent transcription, cell cycle, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels, and replication origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krishnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paulovich and Hartwell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Santocanale and Diffley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Travesa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, Rad53 plays an essential role in stabilising stalled replication forks, allowing them to restart replication, and promoting replication through damaged templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tercero and Diffley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tercero et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Wild-type cells progress very slowly through S phase in response to the DNA damaging agent MMS, but much faster in <italic>rad53</italic> or <italic>mec1</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paulovich and Hartwell, 1995</xref>). The slow S phase progression in wild-type cells is mainly due to checkpoint-dependent inhibition of origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tercero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). Rad53 inhibits origin firing through multiple, redundant phosphorylation events of two essential firing factors, Sld3 and Dbf4; non-phosphorylatable mutants of Sld3 and Dbf4, when combined, show the same fast progression through S phase as <italic>rad53</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). However, unlike <italic>rad53</italic> mutants, the non-phosphorylatable <italic>sld3, dbf4</italic> double mutant does not show enhanced sensitivity to replication stress consistent with the idea that regulation of fork stability, rather than origin firing by Rad53 is crucial for cell viability. The Rad53 targets involved in regulating replication fork stability are currently unclear, but several studies have implicated the Mec1-Rad53 checkpoint in replication fork slow-down in response to replication stress suggesting there may be a link between replication fork rate and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar and Huberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mutreja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seiler et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Mrc1 and its human counterpart, Claspin, were initially characterised as mediators of the replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcasabas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000</xref>). Mrc1 and a second mediator, Rad9, act redundantly in activating Rad53 after replication stress and the <italic>mrc1<sup>17AQ</sup></italic> mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by Mec1, does not mediate Rad53 activation. In addition to its role in Rad53 activation, Mrc1 has a genetically separable role in regulating replisome progression in the absence of DNA damage. <italic>mrc1∆</italic> cells progress slowly through S phase whilst <italic>mrc1<sup>17AQ</sup></italic> cells show normal S phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osborn and Elledge, 2003</xref>), and, conversely, cells with C-terminal truncations of Mrc1 that can still activate the checkpoint with near normal kinetics show slow S phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naylor et al., 2009</xref>). Mrc1, along with two associated proteins Csm3 and Tof1 (Tipin/Timeless in human cells), has also been shown to stimulate replication fork rates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>). Mrc1 associates with replication forks in S phase and has contacts with multiple replisome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bando et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baretić et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gambus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Komata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lou et al., 2008</xref>), but how Mrc1 regulates fork progression is unclear. Here, we show that the ability of Mrc1 to stimulate replication is inhibited by Rad53 phosphorylation, implicating Mrc1 as both a mediator and a target of the checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rad53 inhibition of origin firing in vitro via Dbf4 and Sld3</title><p>To understand in molecular detail how Rad53 regulates DNA replication, we have exploited the reconstitution of DNA replication with purified budding yeast proteins. In these experiments, the MCM double hexamers were assembled onto a 10.6 kb plasmid DNA template, then phosphorylated with Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), and finally firing factors, DNA polymerases, and accessory factors were added to initiate DNA replication. We followed replication progression by separating the products on alkaline agarose gels to visualise incorporation of radiolabelled dCTP. Rad53 inhibits late origin firing in vivo by phosphorylating two substrates: Dbf4 and Sld3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). To determine if their phosphorylation directly inhibits their ability to promote replication, we pre-phosphorylated each individually with Rad53 and added them to replication reactions. To do this, we used Rad53 and the kinase-dead Rad53 mutant (K227A, D339A) purified after expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Rad53 expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> is hyper-phosphorylated as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>), whilst the kinase dead mutant is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, pre-incubation of DDK with ATP caused a small shift in Dbf4 mobility in SDS-PAGE even in the absence of Rad53, presumably reflecting autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Francis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kihara et al., 2000</xref>). However, there was a further shift of Dbf4 in the presence of wild-type Rad53, which was not seen with the kinase dead Rad53. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that DDK pre-phosphorylated with Rad53 was unable to promote replication (lane 3), while pre-incubation of DDK with ATP alone (lane 2) or with ATP and the kinase-dead Rad53 mutant (lane 4) had no effect on replication. Whilst this work was in progress, Abd Wahab and Remus also found that Rad53 could directly inhibit DDK action at origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd Wahab and Remus, 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rad53 inhibition of origin firing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DDK was incubated with Rad53 or Rad53<sup>KD</sup> (K227A, K339A) for 15 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with coomassie.

Similar to DDK, pre-incubation of Sld3/7 with Rad53 and ATP resulted in reduced mobility of Sld3 in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and inhibition of replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This Rad53 inhibition of Sld3/7 was dependent on its kinase activity because the kinase-defective mutant did not inhibit replication (lane 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and because pre-incubation without ATP did not inhibit replication (lane 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, preincubation of Sld3/7 and Rad53 separately did not inhibit replication (lane 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This also shows that Rad53 does not inhibit replication initiation when added together with the firing factors: presumably, replication initiates before Rad53 has time to phosphorylate and inhibit Sld3 and DDK. Taken together, these results show that phosphorylation of DDK or Sld3/7 can block initiation, consistent with previous results in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rad53 inhibition of replication elongation via Mrc1 and Mcm10</title><p>Next, we wanted to determine whether Rad53 could affect replication elongation.

Their inactivation by Rad53, therefore, could provide an explanation for the reduction in fork rate caused by Rad53. Indeed, both Mrc1 and Csm3 (but not Tof1) exhibited reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE after incubation with Rad53 but not Rad53<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that Rad53 can phosphorylate these proteins.

Mrc1 has many contacts with Polε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lou et al., 2008</xref>), and Mrc1 stimulates DNA replication when Polε is synthesising the leading strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>). Mrc1 could, therefore, directly stimulate DNA synthesis by Polε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). We tested this idea by using a truncation of the catalytic domain of Polε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), which supports CMG formation but does not synthesise DNA. In these reactions, Polɑ is the only DNA polymerase, and Mrc1 still stimulates replication rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, Mrc1 can stimulate DNA replication when Polδ is synthesising the leading strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yeeles et al., 2017</xref>). Further, Rad53 inhibits Mrc1 stimulation of replication rate in all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Therefore, Mrc1 can stimulate DNA synthesis regardless of which DNA polymerase is synthesising the leading strand.

Using the appearance of an underwound form of circular plasmid (form U*) as a measure of CMG helicase activity, Devbhandari and Remus have recently shown that more U* product is generated in reactions containing M/C/T than in reactions lacking M/C/T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Devbhandari and Remus, 2020</xref>). This could indicate that M/C/T stimulates the rate of unwinding by CMG, or that M/C/T increases the ultimate extent of unwinding, or both. To distinguish these possibilities, we developed a new and quantitative assay to measure CMG activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Unwinding of double stranded DNA renders it resistant to cleavage by restriction endonucleases. The fraction of double- and single-stranded DNA can then be determined using qPCR with primers flanking restriction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zierhut and Diffley, 2008</xref>). We constructed a linear DNA template with an origin of replication near one end and cassettes containing four tandem MseI restriction enzyme sites at 200 bp, 500 bp, 1000 bp, 1500 bp, and 2000 bp from the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). After loading the MCMs specifically at the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), firing factors were added to form and activate CMG. Then, MseI restriction enzyme was added at indicated times for 3 min to cleave double-stranded DNA. The amount of unwound DNA is then measure by qPCR with primers flanking each of the cassettes. Using this assay, we found that ssDNA accumulated with time at each of the MseI sites, with a delay for distant sites from the origin reflecting time before CMG reached these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We extracted from this data a rate of CMG helicase activity of ~79 bp/min (95% confidence interval, 71–88 bp/min). When we included Mrc1 in the reactions, ssDNA accumulated faster reflecting a CMG helicase rate of ~135 bp/min (95% confidence interval, 118–151 bp/min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This data shows that Mrc1 can directly increase the rate of CMG helicase unwinding. When we incubated Mrc1 with Rad53 prior to addition to the helicase reaction, ssDNA accumulated at a rate similar to the -Mrc1 reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), indicating that Rad53 inhibits Mrc1’s ability to stimulate the CMG helicase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Identification of Rad53 phosphorylation sites in Mrc1</title><p>To understand how Rad53 regulates replication in vitro and in vivo, we undertook a mutational analysis of Mrc1 phosphorylation sites.

Furthermore, the mobility of the Mrc1 truncation mutant was not reduced in SDS-PAGE after incubation with Rad53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that the C-terminal region of Mrc1 is important for its function in regulating fork rate, and key Rad53 phosphorylation sites regulating this function may lie in this region.</p><p>Rad53 phosphorylation sites cannot be reliably predicted by primary amino acid sequence, so we took three unbiased approaches to identify the sites in Mrc1 that can be phosphorylated by Rad53 in vitro. First, we expressed and purified five overlapping protein fragments of Mrc1 and incubated each in vitro with Rad53 and γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the fragment containing the last 228 amino acids of Mrc1, which includes the region required for fork rate stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), was the best substrate for Rad53 in vitro. Second, we incubated Rad53 and γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP with a peptide array on which the entire Mrc1 protein sequence was ‘printed’ as overlapping 20-mer peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Many of the peptides that were phosphorylated by Rad53 in this experiment also mapped to the C-terminus of Mrc1. Lastly, we used mass spectrometry to identify amino acids specifically phosphorylated by Rad53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with the peptide array and fragment analysis, many of the phosphorylated residues were in the C-terminus of Mrc1.</p><p>We used this information to generate a non-phosphorylatable Mrc1 mutant in which serine and threonine residues were changed to alanine: such a mutant should promote faster replication after incubation with Rad53 than wild-type Mrc1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, we were able to generate mutants (Mrc1<sup>14A</sup> and Mrc1<sup>19A</sup>) that indeed exhibited faster replication than wild-type Mrc1 after Rad53 phosphorylation (compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). Unfortunately, these mutants — especially Mrc1<sup>19A</sup> — did not stimulate replication to the rate of unphosphorylated wild-type Mrc1 (compare lanes 1, 4, and 6). This is likely due, in part, to the fact that these mutants exhibited defects in promoting faster replication in the absence of Rad53 indicating that they are not completely functional (compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). Moreover, even Mrc1<sup>19A</sup> was still inhibited slightly by incubation with Rad53 (compare lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that additional sites not mutated in this construct can still be phosphorylated by Rad53 and inhibit Mrc1 function. Cells expressing <italic>MRC1<sup>19A</sup></italic> as the sole copy of <italic>MRC1</italic> were not sensitive to the replication stress agent hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Replication products were visualised after alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an anti-BrdU antibody. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref> shows that the <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> mutant cells had shorter replication intermediates in HU and these intermediates were extended at a ~25% slower rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>) than <italic>MRC1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. The overall replication rate in <italic>MRC1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells was slower than fork rates previously determined in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hodgson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekedat et al., 2010</xref>) probably because these cells were grown in galactose-containing medium at a reduced temperature (25°C). These results indicate that the <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> mutant promotes slower fork rates than wild type <italic>MRC1</italic> in vivo as well as in vitro.</p><p>If one of the functions of Rad53 is to slow replication after replication stress, then the <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> mutant might make <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells more resistant to replication stress. Indeed, <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup> rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells showed some improvement in survival, compared to <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells when chronically exposed to low concentrations of either HU (2 mM) or MMS (0.006%), although they did not promote additional survival to higher concentrations (8 mM HU and 0.01% MMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similar results were obtained with two freshly germinated spores of each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) arguing that the suppression seen was not a result of suppressor mutations, which accumulate readily in <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gómez-González et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> also promoted increased survival in <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells to acute exposure to higher concentration of MMS (0.02%) relative to <italic>MRC1</italic> wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data show that <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> can partially rescue the sensitivity of <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells in response to chronic and acute replication stress, suggesting that slowing replication forks may be part of Rad53’s role in protecting replication forks during the replication checkpoint.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mrc1<sup>8D</sup> partially rescues <italic>rad53Δ</italic> sensitivity to replication stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells that contained <italic>sml1Δ</italic> as well as <italic>MRC1-3xFLAG</italic> (yAWM337), <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup>-3xFLAG</italic> (yAWM292), <italic>MRC1-3xFLAG</italic> and <italic>rad53Δ</italic> (yAWM338), or <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup>-3xFLAG</italic> and <italic>rad53Δ</italic> (yAWM293) were spotted as 1:10 serial dilutions onto YPD plates supplemented with the indicated drugs.

Phosphorylation of Mrc1 by Rad53 prevents Mrc1-dependent stimulation of CMG unwinding, leading to a reduced replication fork rate. We suggest that linking these two roles could allow Rad53 to slow replication speed specifically at a stressed or damaged fork, and, therefore, act efficiently at stochastic fork stalling events without initiating a global checkpoint response. But under more severe replication stress, where more Rad53 is active, Rad53 could phosphorylate Mrc1 at all forks to slow replication globally.</p><p>Using a novel assay to measure DNA unwinding activity, we found that unwinding by CMG is not very synchronous, as evidenced by shallow unwinding curves. Moreover, sites as close as 1 kb from the origin were not completely unwound after 50 min. In the presence of Mrc1, unwinding was faster and the curves were steeper, suggesting more synchronous unwinding leading to even the site 2 kb from the origin approaching 100% unwinding by 30 min. In single-molecule experiments, CMG frequently paused and backtracked while unwinding DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnham et al., 2019</xref>). The ability to backtrack is thought to release CMG from a non-productive DNA duplex-engaged state in which duplex DNA enters the central CMG channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kose et al., 2020</xref>). Stochastic entry into this state may underlie the asynchronous unwinding curves in our assay, and Mrc1 could stimulate unwinding either by preventing CMG entry into the duplex-engaged state or by promoting its reversal. Regardless, it is interesting to consider that, by inhibiting Mrc1 and allowing CMG to either backtrack or engage the duplex, Rad53 may also contribute to replication fork repair or restart.</p><p>A recent structure of CMG bound to M/C/T suggests the C-terminus of Mrc1, containing the majority of its Rad53 phosphorylation sites, may contact Cdc45 and Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baretić et al., 2020</xref>). Other work has suggested an interaction with the non-catalytic domain of Polε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lou et al., 2008</xref>). It would be interesting to understand how these interactions may drive Mrc1’s stimulation of CMG activity and how phosphorylation modulates them. The Mrc1<sup>8D</sup> mutant showed normal checkpoint activation supporting the idea that it remains bound to replication forks. However, we note that Rad53 can target more than these eight sites and full phosphorylation may affect more functions and protein-protein interactions than those disrupted in the Mrc1<sup>8D</sup> mutant.</p><p>Previous work using chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that CMG components moved further away from DNA replication in <italic>mrc1∆</italic> cells treated with HU, suggesting that Mrc1 has some role in restraining CMG at stalled forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katou et al., 2003</xref>). Superficially, this appears inconsistent with our results: loss of functional Mrc1 might be predicted to lead to slower CMG unwinding, and, therefore, less distance between CMG and DNA replication. However, our results, along with other previous work, suggest an explanation for this. In <italic>mrc1∆</italic> cells, Rad53 activation is significantly delayed in HU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Osborn and Elledge, 2003</xref>). We suggest that during this delay, unphosphorylated Mcm10 continues to drive CMG progression, unwinding further from the stalled DNA synthesis; in wild-type cells on the other hand, rapid Rad53 activation would inactivate both Mrc1 and Mcm10 leading to more rapid slowing of CMG.</p><p><italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> only weakly suppressed the sensitivity of <italic>rad53Δ</italic> cells to replication stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In these cells, Mcm10 cannot be phosphorylated because Rad53 is absent; consequently, replication fork rate should still be faster than in <italic>RAD53</italic> wild-type cells where both Mrc1 and Mcm10 would be phosphorylated. Thus, it remains unclear how important fork slowing is in Rad53’s role in maintaining replication fork stability. Why the cell utilises two targets to regulate fork progression is unclear, and further work is required to understand this.</p><p>Studies in mammalian cells have shown that replication forks are slowed down globally in response to replication checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mutreja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seiler et al., 2007</xref>). It would be interesting to explore whether Claspin, the mammalian homolog of Mrc1, or Mcm10 might be involved in this process during replication stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Replication reactions</title><p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for summary of protein purification strategies.

The paper elegantly utilizes the power of biochemical reconstitution of complete DNA replication with purified proteins and its regulation by checkpoint kinases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rad53 checkpoint kinase regulation of DNA replication fork rate via Mrc1 phosphorylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Oscar M Aparicio (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We all felt that this is a very strong paper that confirms the effect of Rad53 kinase on Sld3 and Dbf4 activities in initiation of DNA replication, but goes further and identifies Mrc1 and Mcm10 as substrates for the kinase in regulating replication fork progression and CMG activity. The results are clear and support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers made a number of suggestions, but only a subset of these are listed below and we ask that you consider adding the requested data.</p><p>(1) Page 10 and Figure 5E.

We think this is unlikely because pre-incubation of Mrc1 with Rad53<sup>KD</sup> (Figure 2D) does not slow replication. However, we have now included new data (new Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A) showing that neither wild type Rad53 nor Rad53<sup>KD</sup> co-immunoprecipitate appreciably with Mrc1. Under the same buffer conditions — identical to the buffer conditions in the replication reactions — Csm3/Tof1 co-immunoprecipitate nearly stoichiometrically. We think that, together, these results indicate that Rad53 inhibition of Mrc1 is likely via phosphorylation and not binding. We have added this point in the section “Rad53 inhibition of replication elongation via Mrc1 and Mcm10” on page 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How selective is the effect of Rad53 on the Mrc1-dependent replisome slowdown in the biochemical assays?

Nonetheless, we think this is an interesting point, especially given the fact that DDK has been implicated in Mrc1 regulation in fission yeast. We, therefore, tested whether the two main replicative kinases, DDK and CDK, can phosphorylate and inhibit Mrc1. In a new Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B we show that neither DDK nor CDK were able to inhibit Mrc1 in replication elongation. We have added this point to section “Rad53 inhibition of replication elongation via Mrc1 and Mcm10” on page 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In addition to the viability assays shown in Figure 6, it would be useful if the authors could provide an assay that monitors replication fork progression in vivo to ensure that the Mrc1-8D protein restrains fork progression even in the absence of Rad53.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, but not a trivial request. We include new data that we believe at least partially addresses this issue. We previously showed that we could do ‘pulse-chase’ experiments in vivo using yeast strains that express the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dmdNK) and the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1) which together allow efficient BrdU incorporation and rapid chasing of BrdU from nucleotide pools (Segurado and Diffley, 2008; Vernis et al. 2003). In these experiments, cells are released from α factor into HU in medium containing BrdU. This results in a smear of short, labelled replication intermediates from early firing origins on alkaline agarose gels detected by ‘western’ blotting with anti-BrdU antibody. We can then estimate fork rates from the extension of this labelled smear to larger sizes after HU is washed out and BrdU is replaced with thymidine. We have done this in <italic>RAD53<sup>+</sup></italic> cells carrying wild-type <italic>MRC1</italic> or <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup>.</italic> The replication intermediates of <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> cells were shorter and were extended at a slower rate consistent with the idea that <italic>MRC1<sup>8D</sup></italic> promotes slower replication forks in vivo (new Figure 6D,E). We have added this to the “Mrc1<sup>8D</sup> slows fork rate in vitro and in vivo and partially rescues <italic>rad53</italic> mutant sensitivity” section on page 11. Unfortunately, this approach requires synchronisation with HU, and therefore cannot be used with <italic>rad53</italic> mutants because of the extensive fork collapse and continued origin firing in HU (see, for example, Figure 5B in Segurado and Diffley, 2008). Rad53 becomes rapidly dephosphorylated after release from HU, so the latter part of the curve in the new Figure 6E represents forks moving in the absence of active Rad53. Although we recognise this does not exactly address the reviewer’s question, it is probably the best we can do at the moment, and it shows that the 8D mutant does indeed have slower forks in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Three of the eight sites in Mrc1<sup>8D</sup> (S911, S918, and S920) have been detected by proteomics from cells treated with MMS (Lanz et al., 2021) showing they are indeed phosphorylated in response to replication stress.
