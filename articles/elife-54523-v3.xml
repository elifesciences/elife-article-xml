Senescence is a complex phenomenon that may produce different biological outcomes. There is evidence correlating senescence to aging, since it contributes to the reduction of tissue functions, cell renewal, and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He and Sharpless, 2017</xref>). Senescence also has a contrasting effect on cancer: in some conditions, it represents a protective anticancer mechanism leading to the arrest of transformed/damaged cells; in other settings, senescent cells may promote cancer growth. In recent years, new findings have shown a role for senescence during embryonic development and in tissue recovery after wound injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>). A cell that becomes senescent loses its original function and acquires new activities. This is mainly accomplished by the secretion of several molecules, for which the term <italic>senescence-associated secretory phenotype</italic> (SASP) has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). SASP contains growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other bioactive molecules. It represents a danger signal and sensitizes normal neighboring cells to senesce (paracrine activity) and reinforces the senescence process through autocrine signaling. SASP factors induce tissue remodeling and immune cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). Autocrine and paracrine activity of SASP is well documented, while less is known about possible SASP long-distance effect. Recently, some studies evidenced that SASP may induce long-distance bystander effects both on normal and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodkina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzales-Puertos et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>On this premise, we hypothesized that senescent cells close to circulatory flow may release SASP components into bloodstream and hence pro-inflammatory and pro-aging factors may reach organs and tissues that are quite distant from the site of SASP production. We focused our attention on IGFBP proteins that are released by several senescent cell types, such as endothelial and epithelial cells, fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzales-Puertos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Severino et al., 2013</xref>). IGFBP proteins modulate the function of IGF-I and IGF-II, which are growth factors involved in the regulation of the growth, survival, and differentiation of several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mohan and Baylink, 2002</xref>). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that SASP produced by replicative senescent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) contained the protein IGFBP-4, a member of IGFBP family, which appeared to play a key role in senescence-paracrine signaling, since its inactivation greatly reduced the pro-senescence activities present in SASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Severino et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, healthy MSCs underwent senescence when incubated with SASPs produced by replicative senescent MSCs; this SASP property is lost when IGFBP-4 is blocked with neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the addition of recombinant IGFBP-4 to MSC cultures triggers senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Severino et al., 2013</xref>). In the current study, we analyzed how genotoxic stressors may promote the release of IGFBP-4 and the molecular pathways associated with the induction of senescence by this protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IGFBP-4 is a general stress mediator and is released following different genotoxic injuries</title><p>Induction of chronic senescence occurs after periods of progressive stress, such as that associated with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Deursen, 2014</xref>). In a previous research, we evidenced that the replicative (chronic) senescence of MSCs is associated with IGFBP-4 release. Here we showed that IGFBP-4 is also secreted following induction of acute senescence, defined as acute increase in specific stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Deursen, 2014</xref>). MSCs treated with doxorubicin, peroxide hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and low- and high-dose X rays became senescent and released IGFBP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b,c</xref>). This and our previous results evidenced that different stressors, either in acute or chronic conditions, promote the release of IGFBP-4 in the senescent cell secretome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Severino et al., 2013</xref>). We then performed a follow-up analysis to evaluate the timing of the IGFBP-4 release after stress induction. In H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells, we detected an increase in IGFBP-4 secretion 24 hr poststress; this was further augmented at 48 hr, and then it slightly declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This suggests that IGFBP-4 is released during the same time period of the senescence onset and further indicates that it may have a role in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vivo experiments suggest a possible role for IGFBP-4 as a stress signal</title><p>We evaluated whether genotoxic injury may promote an IGFBP-4 release in vivo, having demonstrated in vitro that senescence induced by stressful insults is associated with IGFBP-4 secretion. We selected low dose irradiation as genotoxic stressor since there are several findings showing that X and gamma rays at low dose can induce cellular senescence in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessio et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Squillaro et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, studies on the biological effects of low dose radiations are of great interest for human health. We irradiated five mice (C57BL/6 strain) with a low dose of X ray (100 mGy) and collected sera 6, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hr postirradiation. At all of the analyzed time points, we observed a statistically significant increase (p&lt;0.05) of IGFBP-4 compared with five untreated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We collected several organs 48 and 144 hr postirradiation and evidenced the presence of senescent cells in lung, heart and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We also isolated MSCs from mice following irradiation and observed increase senescence compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). MSC senescence, we detected with acid beta galactosidase assay, was confirmed by evaluating the expression of several proteins associated with this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Moreover, we observed a decline in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) along with a decrease of clonogenic potential (360 ± 36 clones per 1000 plated cells in control vs 290 ± 23 clones in irradiated mice). This preliminary experiment showed us that a genotoxic insult may induce cellular senescence along with an increase of IGFBP-4 in serum. We then questioned if an increased level of circulating IGFBP-4 may be responsible of pro-aging effect. We intraperitoneally injected mice with 1 μg IGFBP-4 twice a week for two months. This treatment produced an increase of IGFBP-4 serum levels. We then evaluated whether this increase in IGFBP-4 might be associated with the senescence phenomena. We found a significant increase of senescent cells in the lungs, heart, and kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). We also isolated MSCs from the IGFBP-4-treated animals and the control animals. MSCs from the IGFBP-4 group showed a significant increase in senescence compared with the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), and this was related to impaired proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) and reduced stemness, as demonstrated by the CFU assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Senescence was confirmed by detecting the expression of some proteins associated with this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genotoxic stress and IGFBP-4.</title><p>Panel a - Western blot analysis of IGFBP-4 in the sera of mice treated with 100 mGy X ray.

Following endogenous or exogenous stress, can IGFBP-4 reinforce senescence by the autocrine mechanism and/or may IGFBP-4 promote senescence in healthy cells surrounding a senescent cell by a paracrine signaling?</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PGE2-Gαs-PKA signaling is involved in IGFBP-4 secretion</title><p>An increase in the production and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a typical feature of senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Passos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). ROS promote the production/release of prostaglandins, which are involved in several pathological functions, such as inflammation and organ dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaneko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Senescence and SASP production are strictly associated with these two phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rea et al., 2018</xref>). Based on this premise, we evaluated the level of PGE2, the most ubiquitous prostaglandin, in the medium of MSC cultures following the induction of senescence-inducing stress. We found a significant increase in the PGE2 level in the medium of MSC cultures soon after incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). We then questioned whether PGE2 production may be associated with IGFBP-4 secretion. We treated the MSCs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of 200 μM Parecoxib, an anti-Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) drug, which inhibits PGE2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padi et al., 2004</xref>). In this condition, the cells entered senescence, but we did not detect an increase in IGFBP-4 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b,c</xref>). Cells treated with 10 nM PGE2 showed an increase of IGFBP-4 secretion 48 hr following the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), but we did not observe evidence of an increase in senescence. Collectively, these results may suggest that PGE2 promotes the release of IGFBP-4 and that this protein is dispensable for the onset of senescence on stress injured cells (primary senescence); rather, it can promote the senescence on non-injured cells (secondary senescence) by a paracrine mechanism. Indeed, in a previous finding, we incubated healthy MSCs with recombinant IGFBP-4 and observed senescence onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Severino et al., 2013</xref>). We evaluated which PGE2 signaling pathway is involved in the secretion of IGFBP-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorsam and Gutkind, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). There are four different receptors for PGE2: EP1-4 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sugimoto and Narumiya, 2007</xref>]. RT-PCR analysis showed that, in MSCs, EP2 had the highest expression, while EP3 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We focused our interest on the EP2 receptor and its downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We induced senescence by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and determines if IGBP4 secretion decreased after EP2 or Gαs silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>). EP2 or Gαs downregulation strongly decreased the IGFBP-4 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The activated EP2 receptor determines the release of Gβγ subunits, which stimulate AKT through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). EP2 can also promote the activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK pathway through the SRC protein. We curtailed the enzymatic activity of either SRC or MEK1/2 or PI3K by specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d,e,f</xref>). This did not modify the IGFBP-4 release after the incubation of MSCs with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We then reduced the PKA activity by Bisindolylmaleimide IX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>) and found that the senescence-related IGFBP-4 secretion was significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Insulin-like growth factors 1 (IGF-I) and 2 (IGF-II) are members of the insulin family of growth-promoting peptides. IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin are among the most ubiquitous and abundant factors released in blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter, 2014</xref>). IGFBP-4 and the other members of the IGFBP family modulate the activity of IGF-I and IGF-II by functioning as blood carrier proteins and regulating their interaction with insulin-like growth factor receptors 1 (IGF-IR) and 2 (IGF-IIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris and Westwood, 2012</xref>). IGF-I interacts almost exclusively with IGF-IR, whereas IGF-II can bind either IGF-IR or IGF-IIR, with a higher affinity for the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris and Westwood, 2012</xref>). IGF-I and IGF-II are secreted by MSCs and then can be targets of IGFBP-4. We evaluated if IGF-I or IGF-II and their cognate receptors might take part in senescence and what the role of IGFBP-4 could be. In order to clarify this issue, we washed MSC cultures with PBS to eliminate secreted IGFs and then added to the culture medium recombinant IGF-I or IGF-II, either in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibodies against IGF-IR and IGF-IIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h,i</xref>). The supplemental IGF-I in the culture medium did not modify the percentage of senescent MSCs, while the presence of IGF-II induced senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This occurred through IGF-IIR, since blocking IGF-IIR with neutralizing antibodies abolished the IGF-II effect. The block of IGF-IR further potentiated the pro-senescence effect of IGF-II, probably by shifting all of the available IGF-II on IGF-IIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The copresence of IGF-II and IGFBP-4 in the culture medium induced a higher level of senescence compared to the conditions in which the medium was supplemented with only one of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We confirmed that the cells treated with IGF-II, whether or not in the presence of IGFBP-4, entered senescence by evaluating several markers associated with this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> through n). Cell cycle analysis showed a significant reduction of proliferating cells in the presence of IGF-II and/or IGFBP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These results agree with the reduction of Ki-67-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,h</xref>). During senescence, a significant modification of chromatin status with an increase of the heterochromatin foci may occur. Indeed, in MSCs incubated with IGF-II and/or IGFBP-4, we detected an accumulation of the HP1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i,j</xref>) and a reduction of H1.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f,g</xref>). On the contrary, we did not detect any modification of macro-H2A.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i,k</xref>). Senescence induced by IGF-II/IGFBP-4 is not due to genotoxic insult. Actually, we did not evidence the turn on of DNA repair system (ATM activation) and increase in DNA damage foci (phosphorylation of H2AX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l,m,n</xref>).

How could IGF-II induce senescence in the presence of IGFBP-4? There are several findings showing that IGFBPs modulate the action of IGFs, both by preventing their degradation and allowing their controlled interaction with cognate receptors. Proteolysis of IGFPBs by proteases decreases their affinity for the IGFs that are released and can interact with IGF receptors. On cell surface is present an IGFBP-4 specific protease (PAPP-A) that has a role in regulating the IGFBP-4/IGF interaction.

Several findings showed that some IGFBPs may be involved in the senescence process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baege et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Severino et al., 2013</xref>). Some researches addressed the role of IGFBP-4 in senescence, but only a few of them tried to dissect how this factor may be related to cell genotoxic stress. Moreover, while there are studies on autocrine/paracrine SASP effects, a limited number of findings investigated possible long-distance effect of SASP components, such as IGFBP proteins. We evaluated whether genotoxic injury may promote an IGFBP-4 release in vivo, having demonstrated in vitro that senescence induced by stressful insults is associated with IGFBP-4 secretion. This factor appears dispensable for the onset of senescence on stress-injured cells, while it alone, or in combination with other SASP factors, can promote senescence on non-injured cells. We irradiated mice with a low dose of X ray and collected sera 6, 24, 48, 72, and 144 hr postirradiation. We observed a statistically significant increase of IGFBP-4 compared with untreated animals. We then questioned what the effect of a prolonged increase of circulating IGFBP-4 could be? We intraperitoneally injected the mice with IGFBP-4 twice a week for two months and then evaluated whether this increase in IGFBP-4 might be associated with the senescence phenomena. We found a significant increase of senescent cells in the lungs, heart, and kidneys. We also isolated MSCs from the IGFBP-4-treated animals and the control animals. MSCs from the IGFBP-4 group showed a significant increase in senescence compared with the controls, and this was related to a reduced stemness, as demonstrated by the CFU assay.</p><p>Altogether, these data may suggest that IGFBP-4 could act as a genotoxic stress mediator that, entering into the blood flow after its secretion by senescent cells, could promote further senescence phenomena in non-injured cells.</p><p>The limit of our study is due to technical constraints. Only a few studies investigated the secretome in vivo. Some findings analyzed the proteomes of body fluids in healthy and disease conditions but it was not possible to identify the relative contribution of a specific tissue to the body fluid proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chenau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). In our study it is also not possible to relate the increase of circulating IGFBP-4 to a given cell type. Nevertheless, the in vitro investigations showing that following low dose irradiation cells became senescent and secrete IGFBP-4 give credit to the hypothesis that modification of IGFBP-4 serum levels following genotoxic stress may be associated to induction of senescence phenomena.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of our study is the evaluation of IGFBP-4 in the sera of patients following CT scan. The increase of circulating IGFP-4 after low dose irradiation further confirms that this protein could be related to cellular stress. This result could contribute to better evaluate possible negative outputs associated with medical use of radiations, including the procedures that employ low dose of radiation, such as CT, scintigraphy, SPECT, (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography). Indeed, radiation exposure for medical imaging has significantly increased in the last years and our study could further support a note of caution about their improper use.</p><p>Having demonstrated a role IGFBP-4 in senescence we focused our attention on the signaling pathways associated with IGFBP-4 release and its pro-senescence activity. Genotoxic injuries are associated with ROS production, which in turn, promotes the production/release of prostaglandins. These molecules are mediators of inflammation and organ dysfunction, two phenomena strictly associated with cellular senescence. Indeed, we found a significant increase in the PGE2 level in the media of MSCs after genotoxic stress treatment. PGE2 interacting with its receptor, EP2, promotes IGFBP-4 secretion. PGE2/EP2 induces the release of IGFBP-4 through the Gαs/PKA pathway. Our data are in good agreement with other findings showing that PGE2 may induce cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dagouassat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). We then tried to dissect the IGFBP-4 signaling pathway that is associated with senescence. Many findings evidenced that IGFBP proteins work mainly by binding either IGF-I or IGF-II and modulating their action. In this scenario, we evaluated the function of IGF-I and IGF-II in the senescence of MSCs and the role that could be exerted by IGFBP-4. The addition of IGF-I to the MSC cultures did not affect the senescence process, while IGF-II supplementation induced senescence that occurred through IGF-IIR. The block of IGF-IR further increased the IGF-II-induced senescence, probably by shifting all of the available IGF-II on IGF-IIR. Of interest, the addition of both IGF-II and IGFBP-4 to the culture medium produced a higher level of senescence compared to conditions in which the medium was supplemented with only one of them. This increase is related to IGFBP-4 activity in delaying IGF-II degradation and allowing its controlled interaction with cognate receptors. IGFBP-4 protects IGF-II from degradation, but at the same time, blocks its interaction with cell surface receptors. Indeed, the IGFBP-4 affinity for IGFs is greater (an order of magnitude) than that of the receptors. The binding of IGF-II to its receptor can be obtained by the proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-4, which is induced by the PAPP-A protease that is present on the cell surface. According to current models, PAPP-A cleaves IGFBP-4 only when IGFs are bound to IGFBP-4. IGFs are then released close to the cell membrane, thus, facilitating receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conover, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mohan and Baylink, 2002</xref>). We then demonstrated that senescence induced in MSC cultures, following IGF-II/IGF-IIR interaction, depends on the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. Specifically, the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> proteins associated with IGF-IIR trigger the activation of PLC-β and of its downstream effectors: PKC-βI, PKC-βII. These proteins activated the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling that culminated with the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2. There are several reports showing that ERK1/2-related pathways may either promote or impair senescence; it depends on the cellular context, since these proteins are part of signaling hubs into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zou et al., 2019</xref>). The phosphorylated ERK1/2 can activate a variety of substrates, including transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). It could be of great interest to evaluate if IGF-II/IGF-IIR, through RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, could activate some transcription factors involved in the regulation of master regulator genes associated with senescence, such as those belonging to the P53-P21 and RB-P16 pathways. Indeed, there are some findings showing that the transcription factor ELK1, a target of ERK1/2, could play a role in senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christoffersen et al., 2010</xref>). Of note, Boros and coworkers performed a comprehensive CHIP-chip analysis to identify the ELK1 target gene network. They identified many ELK1-binding regions, representing 1112 potential promoters. In that list, we found that the promoters of TP53 and RB2/P130 are potential targets of ELK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boros et al., 2009</xref>). This observation is of great interest, since in a previous study, we demonstrated that P53 and RB2/P130 are the main regulators of senescence in human MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessio et al., 2017a</xref>). Another interesting aspect we analyzed was the potential role of IGF-II/IGF-IIR internalization through the endocytosis pathway. Some authors suggested that the binding of IGF-II to IGF-IIR is a way to reduce the IGF-II signaling that occurs mainly through IGF-II/IGF-IR. According to this hypothesis, IGF-II/IGF-IIR undergoes endocytosis and then degradation into lysosomes. Indeed, our data suggested that IGF-II signaling may take place via IGF-IIR and that the endocytosis process of IGF-II/IGF-IIR is part of the receptor recycling process and not only a degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braulke et al., 1990</xref>). Indeed, blocking endocytosis abrogated the IGF-II pro-senescence effect.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Senescence has been extensively studied in vitro, but we still require an in-depth molecular description of the in vivo properties of senescent cells. This study will allow a better understanding of the aging process and, eventually, the development of effective senolytic drugs that could eliminate senescent cells that, with their SASP, promote diseases of aging. There are some problems in performing such an investigation. One problem is related to the identification of reliable markers to identify in vivo senescent cells. The other regards the role and function of SASP. It is unclear if SASP may act only in a paracrine/autocrine manner or if SASP molecules systemically promote age-associated diseases by entering the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Deursen, 2019</xref>). Our finding may suggest that some SASP components, such as IGFBP-4, may enter circulation and promote senescence in cell compartments that are far from the site of genotoxic injury.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human MSC cultures</title><p>Bone marrow aspirate samples were obtained from healthy donors (age 10–18 years) after informed consent.

For each drug, we evaluated the inhibitory effect at the concentration we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Effect of IGFBP-4, IGF-I, IGF-II on MSC senescence</title><p>35 ng/ml IGFBP-4 (code 350-05B), 25 ng/ml IGF-I (code 100–1), and 25 ng/ml IGF-II (code 100–12) were added either separately or in combination to the MSC (P3) cultures. All of the factors were obtained from PeproTech (UK). The cells were incubated for 48 hr at 37°C, and then we carried out several assays as reported in the results. In some experiments, the effects of IGFBP-4, IGF-I, and IGF-II on MSC senescence were evaluated in presence neutralizing antibodies against IGF-IR or IGF-IIR or PAPP-A.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>IGF-II half-life</title><p>We evaluated the half-life of IGF-II in the culture medium containing FBS. We incubated 250 ng of IGF-II in 1 ml of alpha-Mem with 10% FBS in the presence or absence of 350 ng of IGFBP-4 for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, and 18 hr. After the incubation, samples were filtered on Microcon 10-kD (Merck Italy) to eliminate the bovine serum albumin and other high molecular weight proteins. Then the samples were treated as described in the paragraph for CM preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>IGF-II signalling pathways</title><p>IGF-II signal transduction may occur through different pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We determined which of these could be associated with senescence. In particular, the MSC cultures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with each of the following drugs, separately: 100 nM Pertussis toxin (PTX, BMLG101-0050 Enzo Biochem, NY, USA) for the Gαi kinase, 1 μM YM-254890 (YM, 10–1590 Focus Biomolecules, PA, USA) to block Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, 50 μM D609 (sc201403, Santa Cruz Biotechology, CA, USA) to inhibit PLCβ, 10 μM BAPTA-AM (BPT) (15551 Cayman, MI, USA) and 10 mM 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrostaurosporine (STP, ab143861, Abcam, UK) for PKCα kinase inhibition, 5 nM PKCβi (Santa Cruz Biotech, TX, USA) for PKCβ inhibition, and 100 mM chlorpromazine (CPZ, sc-357313, Santa Cruz) to block endocytosis. Subsequently, we added 25 ng/ml IGF-II, and the samples were further incubated for 24 hr, and the senescence assays were performed. For each drug, we evaluated the inhibitory effect at the concentration we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 inbred male mice of 3 weeks of age were purchased from Charles River (MA, USA).

The recombinant protein was intraperitoneally administered in 200 uL of PBS. The control mice were injected with 200 ul of PBS. At the end of the treatment, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their organs were collected for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Mouse MSC isolation and CFU assay</title><p>We harvested MSCs from the bone marrow of the femurs and tibias of mice. The cells from one animal were plated onto two 100 mm dishes with alpha-MEM containing 15% FBS. After 48 hr, we discarded the nonadherent cells and then incubated the remaining cells for 7 to 10 days in a proliferating medium in order to reach confluence (P0). The cells were then trypsinized and were seeded for the acid beta galactosidase assay. An aliquot of cells at P1 were used for the CFU assay. In brief, 1,000 cells were plated in 60 mm plates and were incubated for 15 days without a medium change. The plates were collected, fixed, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The stained colonies were identified under a light microscope and were counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Histological analysis</title><p>The heart, lungs, and kidneys were harvested from mice treated with exogenous IGFBP-4 and from the corresponding controls. The organs were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 1 hr at RT and were stained with acid beta-galactosidase staining solution.</p><p>Subsequently, the organs were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rinaldi et al., 2016</xref>). Five μm cross-sections were stained with Fast Red solution for the nucleus. Stained tissue sections were analysed and acquired by using a Leica IM1000 System (Germany). The percentage of senescent cells was calculated by the number of blue, β-galactosidase-positive cells out of at least 500 cells in different microscope fields. All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Analysis of IGFBP-4 in the sera of patients following CT scan</title><p>We enrolled 10 patients that received abdominal CT scan with Siemens Somatom Definition Flash instrument. The maximum computer tomography dose index (CTDI) was 30 mGy. Inclusion criteria were: males between 18–65 years. Exclusion criteria: diabetes, obesity, severe cardiovascular diseases, cancer. We selected only male patients to reduce variability, since there are findings showing that IGF-associated pathways can be influenced by estrogen fluctuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Isotton et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, exclusion criteria are also selected to reduce variability, since the excluded conditions could alter IGFBP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renehan et al., 2004</xref>). Patient sera were collected before CT scan and 48 hr later. Patients signed an informed consent document describing briefly the aim of the research. On these sera we determined the level of IGFBP-4 by western blot analysis. This research had the Regione Campania Ethical Committee authorization (Prot. N. 379/C.E.

The authors supposed that IGFBP-4 released by cultivated cells exposed to different stresses is associated with cellular senescence, and evaluated whether genotoxic injury may promote an IGFBP-4 release in vivo by analyzing the level of IGFBP-4 circulating in the blood of animals exposed to radiation. In addition, they showed that the level of this protein, which is associated with cellular stress and hypothetically may be responsible of proaging effect, increased in the sera of human subjects that received Computer Tomography. Such a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments is sorely needed in aging research, and the publication of such works will undoubtedly contribute to the further development of the field.</p><p>Besides, the authors revealed the signaling pathways associated with IGFBP-4 release and its pro-senescence activity, which expands the existing knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of aging and SASP.</p><p>However, there are some shortcomings in the work that needs to be corrected, as well as issues that need clarification and, possibly, additional research:</p><p>1) Despite the fact that the authors convincingly showed by using in vitro and in vivo models that stressful insults are associated with increased IGFBP-4 secretion, whether IGFBP-4 elevation is associated with the cellular senescence in the experiments illustrated by Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1, and Figure 3, in my opinion, remains unclear. The authors implicitly point to the induction of senescence using the galactosidase assay. Cellular senescence is a multifactorial process. The galactosidase test alone is not sufficient evidence of the induction of senescence. Additional molecular tests (expression of p21, p16, phospho-p53 and phospho-pRb) and functional assays (growth curves, monitoring of morphological changes, ROS level), similar to that which are presented in Figure 5 for IGF-related experiments, are needed. It seems especially important to prove reliably the senescence of cells (BM MSCs) obtained from the irradiated and IGFBP-treated animals in Figure 1.</p><p>2) In the context of pro-senescent effect of IGFBP-4, it would be extremely interesting to compare the level of IGFBP-4 in the medium of senescent cells and in the sera of animals exposed to irradiation or IGFBP-4, as well as in the sera of irradiated patients, using the ng/mL units obtained by ELISA.</p><p>3) Several comments on Figure 5. In my opinion, the results on the cell cycle analysis are obscure. First of all, the peaks in the histogram of the control cells are too broad (Figure 5C) in comparison to the IGF- or IGFBP-treated cells, that impedes their fitting and introduces uncertainty in determining the percentage of the S-phase cells in control samples. Anyway, the best way to compare the proliferative capacity of the control and experimental cultures is to measure the growth curves, these measurements would strengthen the author conclusions.</p><p>To sum up, basing on the results presented in this study, several mutually exclusive conclusions can be offered. In my opinion, increased IGFBP-4 secretion may be considered: (i) as a factor which is alone sufficient for cell senescence induction and/or spreading, (ii) as a factor which, in combination with other SASP factors, can promote cell senescence, (iii) as a stress mediator which is not related to the induction/spreading of senescence. It is highly recommended that authors choose and prove their point of view on IGFBP-4 pro-senescence activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Interesting article from Galderisi et al., with the increase of IGFBP-4 in response to a genotoxic stress which could have relevance for aging. The authors assess whether the genotoxic stress may initiate the secretion in vivo in mice and humans of IGFBP-4. In mice they found an increase in senescent cells in the lung, kidneys and heart. They provide evidence on the signaling pathways elucidated by IGFBP-4. Moreover, the pathways leading to the IGFBP-4 is also described. This a comprehensive, technically sound experimental study on the role and the molecular effects of IGFBP-4 for cell senescence.</p><p>1) During the whole article the authors want to relate their findings to aging, however their experiments and results are not related to aging by any means as they only study the process of cell senescence, but this may occur at any age. They did not demonstrate that the effect of IGFBP-4 is increased or related to aging in mice or humans. The basic mechanisms elucidated by them is related to the mechanism of action of IGFBP-4 on cell senescence but not aging. The title should be modified in consequence.</p><p>2) &quot;Acute senescence&quot; as the author call their early (short term) genotoxic cell effects is not defined. It is not clear what does it mean in their experimental context. This is a normal physiological phenomenon which can heave a high positive action as these cells once terminated their action the immune cells may eliminate them. The chronic senescence may also have positive effects as an anti-cancer role and not meaning only negative effects. So the supposition that all these processes are &quot;bad&quot; should be nuanced.</p><p>3) The description of the PGE2 role and the IGFBP-secretion effects alone or together on the senescence is somehow confusing on subsection “PGE2-Gαs-PKA signaling is involved in IGFBP-4 secretion”.</p><p>4) The comment on the use of the imaging techniques in medicine qualifying them as &quot;indiscriminate&quot; is inappropriate in this context as the authors have no proof to make such a statement after this study which was not aimed to verify that. Moreover, the increase of IGFBP-4 after CT within 48 hours does not mean that the cell senescence increased and even less that it contributes to aging.</p><p>5) The age range of the patients for CT is very broad and the reason is not stated. They state that cancer was excluded however in many cases abdominal CT is made because a cancer is suspected.</p><p>6) This is speculative to state in the Discussion section that &quot;prostaglandins are mediators of aging&quot;. There is no proof that prostaglandins are per se pro-aging molecules.</p><p>7) In the Discussion section there are many repetitions word by word of what has been written in the result section. These repetitions should be revised.</p><p>8) Together the article is too long.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54523.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The study aims to elucidate the relationship between genotoxic stress, IGFBP-4 protein secretion and aging.

Anyway, we already evidenced that MSCs became senescent when treated with stress inducers, such as those shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and in Figure 3. Please, see our publications:</p><p>1: Capasso et al., 2015.</p><p>2: Alessio et al.,2015.</p><p>In addition, we followed your suggestion and performed further experiments that are shown in the figure 1D,E,I and J. We modified the text as it follows:</p><p>We also isolated MSCs from mice following irradiation and observed increase senescence compared with the controls (Figure 1C). MSC senescence, we detected with acid β galactosidase assay, was confirmed by evaluating the expression of several proteins associated with this phenomenon (Figure 1E). Moreover, we observed a decline in cell proliferation (Figure 1D) along with a decrease of clonogenic potential (360 ± 36 clones per 1,000 plated cells in control vs 290 ± 23 clones in irradiated mice) (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the context of pro-senescent effect of IGFBP-4, it would be extremely interesting to compare the level of IGFBP-4 in the medium of senescent cells and in the sera of animals exposed to irradiation or IGFBP-4, as well as in the sera of irradiated patients, using the ng/mL units obtained by ELISA.</p></disp-quote><p>The increase in IGFBP-4 level in medium of MSCs following stress is indicative of what could happen in vivo following genotoxic stress. Indeed, we found an increase of circulating IGFBP-4 after irradiation both in mice and human subjects. Nevertheless, the in vitro culture is a “closed” system in which the released IGFBP-4 proteins undergo both spontaneous and proteolytic degradation. The level of circulating IGFBP-4 proteins depends not only on protein release and degradation but also on their clearance and transport into interstitial liquids (Baxter, 2014). Moreover, besides MSCs, other cell types release IGFBP-4. In this context, we believe that in vitro and in vivo comparison of IGFBP-4 concentration is poor informative. It is much more interesting the evaluation of changes in IGFBP-4 level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Several comments on Figure 5. In my opinion, the results on the cell cycle analysis are obscure. First of all, the peaks in the histogram of the control cells are too broad (Figure 5C) in comparison to the IGF- or IGFBP-treated cells, that impedes their fitting and introduces uncertainty in determining the percentage of the S-phase cells in control samples. Anyway, the best way to compare the proliferative capacity of the control and experimental cultures is to measure the growth curves, these measurements would strengthen the author conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The cell cycle graph we showed in Results Figure 5C is representative of several experiments (please, seesupplementary file 1 for statistical analysis). You are right, the graph that we showed is not the best one, we changed it with another representative experiment. But please, keep in mind that the percentage of cells in the different cell cycle phases was calculated not only from data of the representative experiments but from all of them. Moreover, the reduction of proliferation following treatment of cells with IGF-II or IGFBP-4 or IGF-II + IGFBP-4 is confirmed by reduction of Ki67 staining (Figure 5H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To sum up, basing on the results presented in this study, several mutually exclusive conclusions can be offered. In my opinion, increased IGFBP-4 secretion may be considered: (i) as a factor which is alone sufficient for cell senescence induction and/or spreading, (ii) as a factor which, in combination with other SASP factors, can promote cell senescence, (iii) as a stress mediator which is not related to the induction/spreading of senescence.

Cells treated with peroxide hydrogen in presence of a PGE2 inhibitor undergo senescence but do not release IGFBP4.</p><p>These results may suggest that PGE2 promotes the release of IGFBP-4 and that this protein is dispensable for the onset of primary senescence (stress induced); rather, it can promote the secondary senescence process by a paracrine mechanism. Indeed, in a previous finding, we incubated healthy MSCs with recombinant IGFBP-4 and observed senescence onset.</p><p>This statement was in subsection “PGE2-Gαs-PKA signaling is involved in IGFBP-4 secretion”.</p><p>We further clarify our point of view by adding a sentence in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Interesting article from Galderisi et al., with the increase of IGFBP-4 in response to a genotoxic stress which could have relevance for aging.

Anyway, we would like to draw your attention on some recommendations of UNSCEAR (The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation). In Germany, from 1996 to 2012, the annual effective dose per person from CT analyses has more than doubled (Schegerer et al., 2017). A recent study carried out on almost 1,000,000 adults in healthcare markets across the United States showed that a consistent number of patients received up to 50 mGy/year, a considerable value, given the reference levels for emergency provided by the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) is among 20-50 mGy/years (UNSCEAR 2010). This is outside our research but we kept in mind this study when we decided to work on patients undergoing CT scan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The age range of the patients for CT is very broad and the reason is not stated. They state that cancer was excluded however in many cases abdominal CT is made because a cancer is suspected.</p></disp-quote><p>You are right, as stated before, we changed the manuscript title. In the Discussion section we wrote:</p><p>Altogether, these data may suggest that IGFBP-4 could act as a genotoxic stress mediator that, entering into the blood flow after its secretion by senescent cells, could promote further senescence phenomena in non-injured cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) This is speculative to state the Discussion section that &quot;prostaglandins are mediators of aging&quot;. There is no proof that prostaglandins are per se pro-aging molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>We are performing an in-depth study on the CT effects on human health. We aim to evaluate possible negative outputs associated with medical use of radiations. We will estimate if pro-senescence factors (IGFBP-4 and other IGFBPs) impair cellular function of tissues and organs in a patient group after CT Scan. We are enrolling a cohort of 300 patients and the data we presented in this paper refers to the first patients’ group. For this reason, the age range is broad. Anyway, according to many studies, this parameter will not affect the expected outcome or will bias results. On this premise, we did not give any detail on it. You are right, patients undergoing CT scan may have cancer or other diseases. We collected and will collect samples from a huge cohort of patients, then we will wait for diagnosis and will discard samples from patients that present some exclusion criteria, such as cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the Discussion section there are many repetitions word by word of what has been written in the Results section. These repetitions should be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>You are right, we changed the sentence in the Discussion section: “These molecules are mediators of inflammation and organ dysfunction, two phenomena strictly associated with cellular senescence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Together the article is too long.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to reduce the paper and eliminated two paragraphs in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
