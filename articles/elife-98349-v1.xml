Apical tuft dendrites in cortical layer 1, which are unique in their connectivity and biophysical properties, may be a key site of learning-induced plasticity. We used both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy to longitudinally track tuft-wide calcium spikes in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in barrel cortex as mice learned a tactile behavior. Mice were trained to discriminate two orthogonal directions of whisker stimulation. Reinforcement learning, but not repeated stimulus exposure, enhanced tuft selectivity for both directions equally, even though only one was associated with reward. Selective tufts emerged from initially unresponsive or low-selectivity populations. Animal movement and choice did not account for changes in stimulus selectivity. Enhanced selectivity persisted even after rewards were removed and animals ceased performing the task. We conclude that learning produces long-lasting realignment of apical dendrite tuft responses to behaviorally relevant dimensions of a task.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apical dendrite</kwd><kwd>layer 1</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>225210/Z/22/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>Randy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000691</institution-id><institution>Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APR6\1007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>Randy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS069679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>Randy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS094659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>Randy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kavli Institute for Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benezra</surname><given-names>Sam E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS094296</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF1 NS108213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 NS104649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 671 MH114276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

For example, as animals learn the behavioral relevance of stimuli in a sensory discrimination task, neural representations of those stimuli are enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henschke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beitel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goltstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fritz et al., 2003</xref>), potentially improving the salience of information relayed to downstream areas. Studies in primary somatosensory (S1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref> and visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2020</xref> have revealed that top-down signals from distant cortical regions can modify sensory representations during learning, although the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying this plasticity remain unclear.</p><p>Cortical layer 1, comprised mainly of apical tuft dendrites of layer 5 (L5) and layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, may be a key site driving the enhancement of sensory representations during learning. Apical tufts are anatomically well positioned for learning, receiving top-down signals from numerous cortical and thalamic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang and Bruno, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cauller et al., 1998</xref>). While L5 distal tufts are electrically remote and far from the soma, they are in close proximity to the highly electrogenic calcium spike initiation zone at the main bifurcation of the apical dendrite, and form a separate biophysical and processing compartment from the proximal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amitai et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yuste et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schiller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandler et al., 2016</xref>). Top-down signals arriving at the tuft can trigger tuft-wide dendritic calcium spikes in L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manita et al., 2015</xref>), which can modulate synaptic plasticity across the entire dendritic tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roelfsema and Holtmaat, 2018</xref> and potently drive somatic burst firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Larkum and Zhu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Larkum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schwindt and Crill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Larkum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Manita et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this observation, L5 apical dendrite activity is highly correlated with somatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francioni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, by strongly influencing somatic activity, L5 apical dendritic calcium spikes can play an important role in modulating cortical output. Several neuromodulators can augment the excitability of the apical tuft and increase the likelihood of eliciting calcium spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Labarrera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brombas et al., 2014</xref>), which could be a substrate for control of plasticity by behavioral state. Consistent with these ideas, we recently demonstrated that during behavioral training with positive reinforcements, apical tufts in sensory cortex acquire associations that extend beyond their normal sensory modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>). In mouse models of dementia and Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luebke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsai et al., 2004</xref>), tuft dendrites exhibit degeneration which may contribute to the cognitive and memory deficits.</p><p>L5 pyramidal neurons are the major source of output from cortex, targeting numerous subcortical structures that affect behavior. The activity of apical dendrites is known to correlate with stimulus intensity, and manipulating L5 apical dendrites and their inputs impacts performance of sensory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Apical dendritic calcium spikes of pyramidal cells could be a crucial cellular mechanism in learning-related plasticity and behavioral modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roelfsema and Holtmaat, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doron et al., 2020</xref>). However, sensory representations of apical tufts, as well as possible changes across learning, have received little attention.</p><p>To address this question, we used two-photon microscopy and a high-speed volumetric imaging technique called Swept Confocally-Aligned Planar Excitation (SCAPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouchard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hillman et al., 2018</xref>) to longitudinally track the activity of GCaMP6f-expressing L5 apical tufts in barrel cortex during a sensory discrimination task. We found that apical tufts underwent extensive dynamic changes in selectivity for task-relevant stimuli as performance improved, even though only one of the stimuli was unrewarded. These changes in responses persisted even after animals disengaged from the task, demonstrating that learning induced long-lasting changes in tuft sensory representations. Animals that were exposed to the same stimulation protocol without any reinforcement did not develop enhanced representations. Our results show for the first time that reinforcement learning expands apical tuft sensory representations along behaviorally relevant dimensions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direction discrimination behavior</title><p>We devised an awake head-fixed mouse conditioning paradigm that enables controlled investigation of reinforcement effects across learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). In addition to discriminating tactile objects, rodents are known to sense wind direction using their whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yu et al., 2016b</xref>) and can be trained to discriminate different directions of whisker deflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernhard et al., 2020</xref>). With this in mind, we directed brief (100 ms) air puffs at the whiskers in either of two directions: rostrocaudal (backward) or ventrodorsal (upward). One of the directions was paired with a water reward delivered 500 ms after the air puff and thus constituted a conditioned stimulus (CS+). No reward was given for the other direction (CS-).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mice rapidly learn to discriminate stimulus direction in head-fixed paradigm.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A water droplet is paired with air puffs in one direction (CS+) but not the other (CS-).

Stimuli elicited a brief passive whisker deflection followed by active whisking over the subsequent ~1.5 s (analyzed below, Figure 6). Any anticipatory licks prior to reward delivery were counted as a response. Typically, on the first session, mice exhibited few anticipatory licks to either stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, top, grey shading). By session 2 or 3, mice had learned an association between whisker deflection and reward, but could not discriminate the CS+ and CS- (middle). Within a week (by sessions 7â9), every mouse we tested learned to reliably lick to the CS+ while withholding licks to the CS-, performing substantially above chance after a single week of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>).

Mice remained water-restricted on the post-conditioning day and continued licking for reward toward the beginning of the session (see below). We virally delivered the gene for Cre-dependent GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in the barrel cortex of Rbp4-Cre mice, which labels a heterogeneous population of pyramidal neurons comprising approximately 50% of layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>).

Individual segmented tufts were substantial in their spatial extent (&gt;100 Âµm), reflecting tuft-wide voltage-gated calcium spikes rather than branch-specific N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated spikes. All calcium analyses hereafter refer to tuft-wide calcium spikes. Average responses to an event include failures. In many tufts, the CS+ and CS- reliably evoked an influx of calcium that robustly activated the tuft (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Successful calcium events across tufts averaged 28% ÎF/F, consistent with previous studies of layer 5 apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>).

We investigated whether calcium responses to the CS+ increased in the tuft population as animals learned its association with reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Average responses of tufts to the CS+ and CS- were similar during the pre-conditioning session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; p=0.20, signed rank test, n=440 pre tufts and 418 post tufts), indicating that there was no inherent bias in the population toward a particular stimulus in naÃ¯ve animals. Surprisingly, even after learning, responses to the CS+ and CS- were similar on the last- and post-conditioning sessions (p=0.62, 0.64, respectively, signed rank test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>), revealing that no bias develops for the CS+ among dendritic tufts. Only a minority of tufts exhibited statistically significant (see Methods) average responses to air puff stimuli (CS+ responsive: 26 Â± 8%; CS- responsive: 25 Â± 8%; mean Â± SD across all sessions). When we excluded responses that were not statistically significant, we again found no difference between the average response amplitudes to the CS+ and CS- on the pre, last-rewarded, and post sessions (p=0.65, 0.31, and 0.69, respectively, rank sum test; data not shown). Similarly, the probability of transients in response to CS+ versus CS- (see Methods) did not differ during pre-conditioning or post-conditioning sessions (p=0.66 and p=0.44, respectively, data not shown). Therefore, reinforcement learning in our paradigm does not bias tuft representations toward the rewarded stimulus.</p><p>While a bias for the CS+ did not develop after learning, we wondered whether overall tuft responses to both conditioned stimuli increased as animals learned the task. Linear regression analysis revealed that conditioning session number was a poor predictor of both CS+ and CS- amplitudes (All tufts R<sup>2</sup>, CS+: 0.0064, CS-: 0.0035, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>; Significantly responding tufts R<sup>2</sup>, CS+: 0.014, CS-: 0.014, data not shown).

To test whether enhanced selectivity depended on reinforcement, we imaged a separate group of similarly water-restricted mice that were repeatedly exposed to the same stimuli for the same number of days but without any reward. These mice only received water in their home cage following each imaging session, but never during stimulus presentation. Repeated exposure mice exhibited a stable distribution of response selectivity over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>; a separate cohort of 7 mice; 317, 313, and 321 tufts on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 9, respectively). These results suggest that reinforcement learning, and not simply repeated stimulus exposure, drives apical tufts to become more selective for either the CS+ or CS-.</p><p>To directly quantify the response selectivity of tufts, we computed a selectivity index (SI; see Methods) ranging from â1 (exclusively CS- responsive) to 1 (exclusively CS+ responsive) for each tuft. Initially in both the conditioned and repeated exposure mice, the SI distribution was centered around zero, indicating that most tufts in naÃ¯ve animals did not strongly prefer either stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>, left panels). Consistent with our other analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), the mean SI remained close to zero for each of the three sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1d</xref>; â0.049,â0.001, and 0.003 for pre-conditioning, last rewarded, and post-conditioning days, respectively; one-way ANOVA p=0.37), confirming that learning produced no overall bias toward one particular stimulus among the population. During learning, the SI distribution of conditioned but not repeated exposure mice shifted markedly, whereby a much greater proportion of neurons were highly selective for either the CS+ or CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>, middle and right panels, |SI| pre versus last-rewarded: p&lt;10<sup>â6</sup>, |SI| pre versus post: p&lt;10<sup>â5</sup>; Wilcoxon rank sum test). These effects can even be observed within individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, different tufts within the same animal exhibited opposite changes in selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Learning significantly increased tuft selectivity in individual conditioned mice, but not repeated exposure mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). The degree of enhancement in tuft selectivity was closely correlated with conditioned animalsâ ability to discriminate stimuli across sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>; Pearsonâs r=0.60, p&lt;10<sup>â5</sup>).</p><p>Whereas selectivity magnitude (|SI|) only considers the amplitude of tuft responses to CS+ and CS-, their discriminability also depends on their variability. For example, a large difference in CS+ and CS- responses would not be discriminable if the variability of those responses were very high; a small difference might be discriminable if the variability were low. We therefore additionally calculated a d-prime metric of neural discriminability that normalizes differences in response magnitudes to each stimulus by their variability (see Methods). Similar to selectivity magnitude, we found that neural discriminability was correlated with behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). In conditioned animals, neural discriminability of CS+ and CS- responses of tufts increased significantly across learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, blue; first-rewarded versus last-rewarded: p&lt;10<sup>â3</sup>, pre versus post: p&lt;10<sup>â4</sup>; Wilcoxon rank sum test). By contrast, neural discriminability of tuft responses in the repeated exposure mice decreased slightly with progressive exposure to the stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, gray; Day 1 versus Final: p&lt;0.01). Finally, we asked whether the ability to decode stimulus identity on a trial-by-trial basis increased after learning. To test this, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to decode stimulus identity from tuft population activity (see Methods). We found that decoder performance increased significantly when comparing Pre and First sessions to Post and Last sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2a</xref>; sign-rank test, p=0.002), whereas decoder performance did not improve over time in the repeated exposure mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2b</xref>; sign-rank test, p=0.22). Taken together, these results show that enhanced stimulus representations can emerge in apical tufts, but require reinforcement.</p><p>The above analyses rely on the accurate measurement of calcium spikes from individual tufts. While two-photon microscopy acquires images with high resolution and speed, the imaging field is restricted to a single focal plane. This method can only measure calcium signals from a thin cross-section of the three-dimensionally complex apical structures. Indeed, many of the spatial components extracted from our two-photon data were comprised of dendritic branches that cross the imaging plane at different locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a</xref>), which makes it difficult to determine whether the segmentation software accurately extracted signals from one tuft or erroneously merged multiple tufts. For the same reasons, a single apical tuft could be falsely classified as two different tufts. Such errors could mislead our interpretation of selectivity in the population, especially given that a single apical tuft can exhibit non-homogenous branch-specific events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that our interpretation was not due to segmentation errors, we repeated the conditioning experiment using a high-speed volumetric imaging approach called SCAPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouchard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hillman et al., 2018</xref>), which allowed us to monitor calcium across entire apical tufts (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). These three-dimensional datasets (300Ã1050 Ã 234 Î¼m field of view) encompassed large portions of the apical tree which included branches converging on their bifurcation points in layer 2, enabling us to identify whole apical trees unambiguously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). CaImAn effectively demixed overlapping trees in these three-dimensional volumes. Using SCAPE microscopy, we imaged tuft activity of two additional mice conditioned with the same behavioral paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Comparison of tuft responses to the CS+ and CS- on the pre, last-rewarded, and post sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>; 241 pre, 215 last-rewarded, 150 post tufts in 2 mice) revealed again that task learning induced significant increases in tuft selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>; pre versus last-rewarded: p&lt;10<sup>â5</sup>, pre versus post: p&lt;10<sup>â4</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test of |SI|). On average, the SI magnitudes were similar between tufts imaged using two-photon microscopy and SCAPE (mean Â± s.e.m. |SI| for two-photon versus SCAPE; pre: 0.41Â±0.01 vs 0.40Â±0.02; last-rewarded: 0.54Â±0.02 vs 0.54Â±0.02; post: 0.51Â±0.02 vs 0.53Â±0.03). These data demonstrate that the effects in our two-photon dataset are not caused by errors in segmentation, but rather reflect changes at the level of individual dendritic tufts. Our results, based on two different imaging approaches, clearly demonstrate that reinforcement increases stimulus selectivity at the level of the entire apical tuft.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-98349-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Example SCAPE microscopy movie during behavioral session.</title><p>Top, maximum intensity projection (MIP) across the dorsal-ventral dimension showing horizontal extent of dendritic activity.

Conceivably, tufts that were initially unselective in naive animals could also maintain their response to one stimulus while losing their response to the other (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, middle).

Stimulus-unresponsive tufts, while on average less active than responsive ones (median calcium events per minute: 2.65 vs 3.66 for stimulus-unresponsive and responsive tufts, respectively; p&lt;10<sup>â40</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), were not silent, with many undergoing tuft-wide calcium influx several times per minute. Silent tufts that are never active during the session may not have been detected in our imaging, but we were able to detect tufts that discharged as few as 3 voltage-gated calcium spikes over a 30-min behavioral session. Interestingly, in both the conditioned and repeated exposure mice, approximately 40% of initially unresponsive tufts developed a response to at least one stimulus by the last session, becoming either selective or unselective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). However, in conditioned animals, the proportion of initially unresponsive tufts that became selective was significantly larger than in repeated exposure mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; p=0.04, 2-sample t-test comparing mice). Furthermore, while the proportion of selective and unselective tufts in this category was similar for conditioned animals, unselective tufts were more common in repeated exposure mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>; p=0.03, paired t-test).</p><p>Next, we analyzed tufts that were initially responsive and either selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>; conditioned: 56/603, repeated exposure: 43/457) or unselective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; conditioned: 89/603, repeated exposure: 80/457). In these smaller categories, we found no significant differences in the outcome of selectivity between the two groups of animals. Together, these results indicate that, while both stimulus exposure and reinforcement can alter tuft tuning, the presence of reward increases the likelihood that initially unresponsive tufts develop selectivity for either the CS+ or CS- (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><p>While a greater proportion of tufts from the conditioned animals were selective during the final session (20.2% vs 10.3% of tufts from conditioned and repeated exposure mice, respectively), we wondered whether conditioning also impacted the degree of selectivity. Note that some tufts had very small yet statistically different CS+ and CS- response amplitudes and were thus classified as selective despite a small SI. First, we compared the SI of initially unresponsive tufts on the final imaging session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Supporting our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, the SI distribution was shifted toward the tails in conditioned, but not repeated exposure mice, indicating that reward enhances selectivity for either the CS+ or CS- in this subset (|SI| conditioned versus repeated exposure: p&lt;10<sup>â5</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test, n=199 and 110 tufts, respectively).</p><p>Next, we compared the |SI| of all tufts that were categorized as selective during the last imaging session in conditioned and repeated exposure mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>).

For instance, movements like whisking are correlated with layer 5 somatic action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Derdikman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Kock and Sakmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>) and might have impacted calcium activity in the apical tuft. To investigate whether whisking could account for the changes in tuft selectivity, we imaged the whiskers with a high-speed camera and computed whisking amplitude (see Methods) while mice underwent conditioning and two-photon imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, we considered whether animals changed their whisker movements in response to conditioned stimuli over the course of learning. We computed the peak of the mean stimulus-aligned whisking amplitude for the CS+ and CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) for each session in five mice. Although conditioning alters licking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and e</xref>), the magnitudes of whisker movements following both stimuli were stable across sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; CS+: p=0.44; CS-: p=0.45; linear regression). We also computed the standard deviation (SD) of stimulus-evoked whisker amplitude across trials for all sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). While the whisking amplitude became slightly more reliable (decreased SD) across sessions (p&lt;10<sup>â4</sup>), the change in reliability across sessions was similar for CS+ and CS- (p=0.53). Therefore, whisking is similar on both trial types throughout learning.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Whisking is only weakly correlated with tuft activity and cannot account for changes in selectivity during learning.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whisking amplitude aligned to calcium activity of three example tufts in one session.

Whisking amplitude was similar between spontaneous ITI whisking bouts and evoked whisking responses to stimuli (n=115 and 617 events, respectively; p=0.53, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In contrast to air puff stimuli, ITI whisking bouts were not associated with a robust calcium response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the relationship of whisking and sensory stimuli to tuft calcium spikes, we performed a linear regression analysis (see Methods) on 322 tufts using calcium influx as the response variable and either stimulus or whisking amplitude as a single predictor variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Air puff stimuli more reliably predicted calcium influx than whisking amplitude for each of virtually all tufts (p&lt;10<sup>â12</sup>, sign rank test). These results are consistent with other studies that found either only weak or no correlation between whisking and L5 tuft calcium spikes in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we found no relationship between the whisking response and the median SI magnitude on a given session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, whisking to CS+ p = 0.22, CS- p=0.78). Therefore, changes in whisker movement cannot account for the changes in selectivity during learning that we observed.</p><p>Finally, the possibility remains that other task-related signals relaying information about reward expectation and behavioral choice could impact apical tuft activity and drive increases in selectivity. To test this, we compared tuft responses to the CS- in false alarm trials (FA; mouse incorrectly licked for reward) and correct rejection trials (CR; mouse correctly withheld licks) to determine if their activity was modulated by behavioral choice. Notice that these two trial types have the same sensory input but involve different choices.

A future experiment in which the stimulus strengths are substantially reduced would drastically increase the error rates, enabling a comparison between Hit and Miss trials.) Tufts were classified as behaviorally modulated if the FA response was significantly different from the CR response, and were not behaviorally modulated if CR and FA responses were statistically indistinguishable (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>).

Licking, like whisking, was a relatively poor predictor of tuft calcium influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Because some behaviorally modulated tufts may not have been statistically detectable, we used multivariate linear regression to disentangle stimulus responses from licking and whisking, which may have been confounded with choice.

While the entire post-conditioning session was unrewarded, mice initially expected rewards and licked for many CS+ trials in the first half of the session.

Using both novel volumetric whole-tuft imaging and conventional planar microscopy, we discovered that L5 apical tufts acquire enhanced representations of multiple stimuli during learning. Rather than simply retuning tufts toward the rewarded stimulus, learning enhanced selectivity for both stimuli, suggesting that tufts are aligning themselves to the behaviorally relevant stimulus dimensions. This effect is particularly striking given that, by design, the two stimuli are in orthogonal not opposing directions. These enhanced sensory representations persist even after mice cease performing the task. In contrast, representations are slightly degraded by mere repeated exposure to stimuli outside of a task. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), we found that movement in and of itself has little direct impact on tuft spikes, indicating that increased selectivity of apicals reflects alterations in sensory coding as animals learn. This sensitization of tufts to behaviorally relevant sensory dimensions may be a general feature of all sensory cortical areas.</p><p>Tuft spikes enhance plasticity of synaptic inputs that occur over behavioral (seconds-long) timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roelfsema and Holtmaat, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>). These new behaviorally relevant tuft representations may therefore prime subsequent plasticity of synapses across the entire pyramidal neuron. Additionally, tuft events potently modulate somatic burst firing and enhance how somata respond to their basal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Larkum, 2013</xref>). As learning and plasticity increase apical selectivity for a behaviorally relevant axis, tuft events will unavoidably amplify somatic burst output along the same axis. This could enable action potential output of L5 cells in primary sensory cortex to directly drive behavioral responses via projections to movement related areas, such as the corticostriatal, corticopontine, and corticotrigeminal pathways. Thus, tuft spikes have the potential to modify somatic output, both in the present and in the future.</p><p>An open question is whether enhanced stimulus representations in apical tufts are required for learning this task. One way to address this question would be to silence tuft activity during and after learning by optogenetically activating NDNF-positive interneurons in layer 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abs et al., 2018</xref>). This approach is not ideal as NDNF interneurons also inhibit other cells such as layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, PV interneurons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cohen-Kashi Malina et al., 2021</xref> and possibly the axons of layer 5 pyramidal cells, which are known to densely innervate layer 1. Because this manipulation is not specific to layer 5 apicals, the results would be difficult to interpret. Focal illumination of inhibitory opsins in tufts has also been used to assess tuft function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>), but balancing tuft against soma silencing remains challenging and complicates interpretation. Better tools for selective targeting of apicals would be extremely useful for addressing such issues.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Enhanced representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli</title><p>Enhancing the representation of relevant stimulus dimensions rather than a singularly important stimulus, such as a rewarded event, has multiple benefits for behavior. In our paradigm, both the CS+ and CS- are predictive of whether or not a reward will occur in the future. Explicitly encoding both stimuli could allow sensory cortical areas to directly elicit actions. In the context of this task, CS+ preferring tufts in barrel cortex may trigger anticipatory licking while CS- preferring tufts could suppress licking. L5 cells in sensory cortex via their output to striatum, pons, brain stem, and spinal cord would thereby be able to directly and rapidly drive action without further cortical processing, such as by frontal areas including motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park et al., 2020</xref>). Such rapid sensory-motor transformations by primary sensory areas may be critical for natural time-constrained behavior.</p><p>Furthermore, learning produced a representation in which the degree of selectivity for the two stimuli was continuous and uniformly distributed. Exclusively CS+ or CS- selective apicals never dominated the population. Continuous degrees of selectivity across the population, rather than discrete representations, may allow the system to be more robust to the variability caused by active movements that alter sensory input. A continuous distribution may also facilitate future adjustments of neural representations as subjects continue to learn a task or encounter new tasks. The uniformity we observed may reflect that neurons are high-dimensional, being sensitive to mixtures of variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), only one of which might be altered here by learning. The uniform distribution of selectivity corresponds to a full range of pessimism to optimism concerning stimulus predictions of upcoming rewards. Recent work shows that behavioral performance benefits from reinforcement learning that incorporates the distribution of reward probabilities rather than just the average expected reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dabney et al., 2020</xref>). L5 corticostriatal synapses could theoretically afford a plastic substrate for acquiring the necessary distribution of reward probabilities.</p><p>Surprisingly, past studies in which mice were trained to associate one or more stimuli with a reward typically show that cortical representations are stronger for the rewarded stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henschke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goltstein et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to these studies of layer 2/3 somatic activity, our experiments revealed that the overall tuft calcium response to the CS+ and CS- at the population level did not change significantly after animals learned the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Instead, representations for both stimuli were enhanced by individual tufts developing selectivity for either the CS+ or the CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This divergence in phenomena may result from several important differences between our work and the aforementioned studies.</p><p>First, enhanced selectivity for both rewarded and unrewarded stimuli could be a phenomenon that is unique to the apical dendritic tufts. In addition to local inputs, the apical tufts of pyramidal cells in S1 receive long-range top-down input from several sources, including motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>), secondary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cauller et al., 1998</xref>), and secondary thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang and Bruno, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rubio-Garrido et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>). Frontal areas, such as prefrontal cortex, indeed have enhanced representations of the CS+ and CS- after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, input to the somata is dominated by the local cortical area and primary thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>). While somato-dendritic coupling can be strong in L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>), it is asymmetric; at least 40% of somatic transients attenuate in a distance-dependent manner along the apical trunk and distal tufts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francioni et al., 2019</xref>). The non-overlapping anatomical inputs and asymmetric coupling together could produce different learning-related effects on apical tuft and somatic stimulus representations.</p><p>Second, learning-related changes may manifest differently in layer 2/3, the usual focus of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henschke et al., 2020</xref>), and layer 5 pyramidal cells, the tufts of which we studied. With the exception of a small population of corticostriatal cells, most excitatory cells in layer 2/3 project to other cortical areas to affect further cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petersen and Crochet, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, many L5 cells project to subcortical structures including the thalamus, superior colliculus, and brainstem, which may directly trigger behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">LlinÃ¡s et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krauzlis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parvizi and Damasio, 2001</xref>). In discrimination paradigms, both stimuli are relevant to behavior. In our task, the CS+ prompted licking to obtain a reward, and the CS- suppressed licking that would have no benefit. Thus, an enhanced representation of both stimuli in layer 5 would be advantageous for animals to perform the task efficiently. Recently, it was shown that apical dendrite activation of subcortical-targeting pyramidal tract L5 cells, but not intratelencephalic L5 cells that are more like L2/3 cells in their connectivity, determines the detection of tactile stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Takahashi et al., 2020</xref>). The Rbp4-Cre mice we used in this study labels a heterogenous population of layer 5 pyramidal cells, comprising both pyramidal tract and intratelencephalic neurons. In the future, it would be interesting to examine whether learning has different effects on the sensory representations of these two populations. Moreover, direct comparisons of the layers would be particularly informative.</p><p>Finally, it is possible that learning-related changes in sensory representations manifest differently between a somatosensory modality and a visual modality, the latter being the focus of previous studies. To our knowledge, we are the first to show changes of sensory representations in somatosensory cortex within a discrimination paradigm. Facial stimuli are generally more salient than arbitrary visual stimuli for any species, and mice are known to be highly responsive to their tactile sense more so than vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Petty and Bruno, 2024</xref>). This strong salience of whisker-mediated touch may make it particularly advantageous to develop sensory representations of a larger variety of relevant tactile stimuli, in this case, both the CS+ and CS-.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Candidate plasticity mechanisms</title><p>Enhanced selectivity could be due to changes in local synaptic connectivity, long-range inputs, or both. Learning may strengthen and weaken synapses onto barrel cortex neurons from ascending thalamocortical input or from neighboring cells. Such local plasticity could enhance CS+ or CS- responsiveness. Alternatively or additionally, other cortical regions encoding task context could via long-range inputs reconfigure barrel cortex to respond more strongly to these stimuli. The present results do not completely distinguish between these two scenarios because long-range inputs may still encode the context while the mouse is in the behavioral apparatus. However, we found that enhanced representations persist after mice are no longer engaged in the task and receiving rewards. This result suggests that enhanced representations may be a product of local plasticity in sensory cortex that alters receptive fields.</p><p>Even in the absence of reward, repeated exposure to stimuli can drive plasticity in sensory cortex and alter response tuning. For instance, repeated exposure to oriented gratings can alter the orientation tuning of cells in primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yao and Dan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dragoi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dragoi et al., 2000</xref>), and overstimulation of whiskers induces plasticity at dendritic spines and alters whisker representations in somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feldman and Brecht, 2005</xref>). Our results demonstrate that at the population level enhanced representations developed only when stimuli were behaviorally relevant. Our longitudinal analysis revealed that while the response dynamics of some tufts changed after repeated stimuli presentations, overall selectivity of the population did not increase when rewards were omitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This raises the question: What are the mechanisms that drive enhanced selectivity under rewarded conditions? In one possible scenario, reward delivery causes the release of neuromodulators that augment the activity of apical tufts. Cortical layer 1 is innervated by cholinergic afferents from the nucleus basalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mechawar et al., 2000</xref>) and adrenergic afferents from the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freedman et al., 1975</xref>), the main source of acetylcholine and norepinephrine, respectively. Salient events such as reward and arousal lead to the release of these neuromodulators in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chubykin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thiele and Bellgrove, 2018</xref>), which could increase the excitability of apical dendrites by recruiting disinhibitory circuits or directly influencing dendritic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Labarrera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brombas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chubykin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>). In this model, the release of reward-driven neuromodulators promotes plasticity and an enhanced representation of temporally aligned sensory inputs. This phenomenon was demonstrated in auditory cortex, where tones paired with stimulation of the nucleus basalis shifted the tuning of neurons toward the frequency of the paired stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Froemke et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Why are representations of the CS- equally enhanced when there is no associated reward? One explanation is that, as mice learn that the CS- indicates absence of reward, the CS- effectively signals punishment and acquires negative value. Acetylcholine is released in response to aversive stimuli, and can activate disinhibitory microcircuits that reduce inhibition onto pyramidal cells and may be essential for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gasselin et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that both the CS+ and CS- representations are enhanced by neuromodulatory mechanisms tied to reward and punishment, respectively. An open question is whether the outcome is due to reinforcement learning or the behavioral state brought on by the reinforcers rather than their valence. Sensory cortical plasticity may not be tied to reinforcer valence. Our paradigm creates an environment where mice benefit from being attentive and engaged in order to maximize reward while minimizing effort. Previous work has shown that active engagement in a visual discrimination task was associated with significantly higher selectivity in layer 2/3 cells in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Poort et al., 2015</xref>). Task engagement may lead to a sustained increase in neuromodulator release throughout the conditioning session, priming the apical dendrites for plasticity and the development of selective responses for task-relevant stimuli as they learn.</p><p>What determines whether a particular tuft eventually becomes selective for the CS+ or CS-? Our longitudinal analysis revealed that many tufts that were initially unresponsive to either stimulus developed a highly selective response to either the CS+ or the CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In these tufts, stimulus preference after learning might be seeded by initially weak, directionally selective inputs on to the neuron that already exist prior to conditioning and that are potentiated by the learning process. We also found tufts that initially exhibited robust responses to both stimuli and either lost or significantly reduced their response to one stimulus after learning. The reduction of an apical response to a particular stimulus could be driven by local disynaptic inhibition between L5 pyramidal cells mediated by the apical-targeting Martinotti cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Naka and Adesnik, 2016</xref>). Through this mechanism, L5 neurons that are selective for a particular stimulus could inhibit responses to that stimulus in neighboring L5 apical tufts. Experiments that assess the tuning of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto apical dendrites as a function of learning could test such mechanisms.</p><p>In addition to demonstrating increased tuft selectivity with learning, we replicated a surprising phenomenon in a previous instrumental behavior in which a population of apical tufts exhibit activity around the time of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>). This reward-related activity was observed in four out of the seven conditioned animals only during CS+ trials and was most prominent during intermediate conditioning sessions, when most animals were still performing at chance levels, and disappeared completely by the final conditioning session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Other than this transient effect, unconditioned stimuli did not appear to elicit calcium responses, consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>). The disappearance of this reward-related peak might be attributable to the reward becoming predictable in later stages of learning. In previous classical conditioning experiments, dopaminergic cells exhibit responses to rewards early in learning due to the novelty of an unexpected stimulus. These responses are lost after extended training, as animals learn the association between the CS and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ljungberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). While dopaminergic terminals are sparse in primary sensory areas, they are not entirely absent, nor are dopaminergic receptors. Furthermore, the excitability of the apical tuft is sensitive to noradrenaline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Labarrera et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus exhibit a similar phenomenon to dopaminergic neurons, where responses shift from temporal alignment with the reward to a predictive conditioned stimulus after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>). Such mechanisms could explain why reward-related activity is restricted to early-to-intermediate learning in our paradigm.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Global versus local dendritic spikes</title><p>Apical dendrites exhibit not only global spikes that elicit calcium influx across the entire tuft, which we exclusively analyzed here, but also local events known as NMDA spikes, which typically engage short (&lt;30 Î¼m) segments of individual dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). These local, NMDA receptor-dependent events can promote prolonged plasticity within individual dendritic branches in the absence of backpropagating actions potentials, a feature that is unique to the apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandler et al., 2016</xref>). In motor cortex, branch-specific NMDA spikes are crucial for establishing the long-lasting plasticity necessary for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>), and depolarization provided by multiple local NMDA spikes is thought to be essential for the generation of a global calcium spike triggered by distal synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>). We focused this study on global tuft-wide calcium events, rather than local events. Local events are more difficult to unambiguously identify in planar imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>), and their existence in vivo is still an open question for L5 apicals in barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, they may play important roles in plasticity processes that eventually lead to the emergence of global tuft spike selectivity for stimuli. Volumetric microscopy studies, the feasibility of which we showed here, are needed to further investigate the existence of local events in such behaviors as well as examine possible relationships between local and global tuft events during reinforcement learning. However, it would be essential to verify that seemingly spatially overlapping local and global events derive from the same dendritic tree, which requires greater resolution than was practical for the present study.</p><p>To analyze activity of individual tufts, we segmented these structures based on spatiotemporal covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>). This method does not discount the possibility of errors where one tuft is split erroneously into two trees, or where two highly correlated tufts are merged. With this in mind, we used volumetric imaging SCAPE microscopy, which allowed us to visualize the apicals in three dimensions and unambiguously screen for such artifacts. The results from SCAPE are quantitatively similar to those from two-photon microscopy, and confirm that our observation of enhanced selectivity with learning is not an artifact of planar imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Stability of learned tuft representations</title><p>In contrast to previous studies of discrimination learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henschke et al., 2020</xref>), we included an unrewarded post-conditioning session to examine whether learning-related effects persisted through extinction. Our results show that post-conditioning selectivity of the apical population remains significantly higher than pre-conditioning, even after animals stop licking in response to the CS+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, the effects of learning are much more pronounced in animals that relied exclusively on their whiskers to perform the task. In animals that apparently used other sensory modalities, we observed a modest increase from the pre to last-rewarded session, which seemed to be largely absent by the post-conditioning session. Considering that these animals were additionally exploiting other sensory areas to perform, selectivity may have been more widely distributed and thus diluted in barrel cortex, diminishing the effect and its stability. How long selectivity persists in the neuronal population after conditioning and which factors influence stability are interesting open questions for future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have shown for the first time that reinforcement learning enhances representations along behaviorally relevant dimensions in apical tufts. Our results suggest that dendritic calcium spikes are an important cellular mechanism underlying the changes in sensory encoding that occur with learning, and provide an avenue for further investigation of cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying plasticity induced by perceptual experience and reinforcement. This cellular compartment may be key to understanding pathology in some cognitive, memory, and learning disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or <break/>reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rbp4-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GENSAT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rbp4-Cre_KL100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV1-CAG-flex-GCaMP6f</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UPenn Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks, Inc.</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v2022b</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CaImAn</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn">https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v1.8.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_021533">SCR_021533</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Arduino IDE</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arduino.cc/">https://www.arduino.cc/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v1.8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All experiments complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University (protocol AC-AABP0555). Sixteen C57BL/6 mice ranging in age from 77 to 316 days old (mean of 123 days at the time of imaging) were used in these experiments. Six were male, and 10 female. Our results were observed in both male and female individuals, and no sex difference was detected.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Surgery</title><p>Animals were administered dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) via intramuscular injection 1â4 hr prior to surgery to reduce edema. Anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane in oxygen and maintained at 1%. Mice were head-fixed in a stereotax, and a subcutaneous injection of bupivacaine (0.5%, 0.1 mL) was administered under the scalp. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the back. The scalp was cut, and the skull was covered with a thin layer of Vetbond. A circular craniotomy (3 mm diameter) centered at 1.5 mm posterior and 3.5 mm lateral to bregma was made using a dental drill. The dura was kept moist using artificial cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>For both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy, Rbp4-Cre_KL100 mice were injected with 100 nL of virus (initial titer ~2 Ã 10<sup>13</sup> cfu/mL, diluted 1:4 in artificial cerebrospinal fluid) encoding GCaMP6f in a Cre recombinase-specific manner (AAV1-CAG-flex-GCaMP6f, UPenn Vector Core). The virus was injected in layer 5B of the barrel cortex (1.0 mm deep to the pia) using a pulled pipette (20â30 Î¼m ID) fastened on a Nanoject III, which was mounted on a manipulator angled at ~30Â° from vertical. The virus was delivered via four injections of 100 nL each, spaced at least 400 Î¼m apart. The depth was chosen to maximize labeling of thick-tufted pyramidal neurons. In pilot experiments, we found that placing injections 1.0 mm deep resulted primarily in thick-tufted labeling whereas at more superficial depths (e.g. 0.8 mm deep) we obtained mainly thin-tufted tufts, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oberlaender et al., 2012</xref>. The dura was then removed, and a thin cover glass was implanted and sealed using superglue. A custom metal head plate was implanted on the skull using dental cement. Twenty-four hours after surgery, carprofen (5 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously. Imaging and behavioral training commenced 3 weeks after surgery. Animals were only excluded from the study if the cranial window quality was poor, which precluded imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavior</title><p>Animals in both rewarded âconditioningâ and unrewarded ârepeated exposureâ groups were water restricted for 2 days prior to starting imaging and habituated to head fixation for ~10 min on each of these 2 days. They were subsequently given ~1 mL of water per day for 9 days either by pairing water rewards with a specific stimulus (conditioning group), or in their cage following the imaging session (repeated exposure group). Mice were head restrained in a custom-made behavioral apparatus by positioning the body in a 3D-printed chamber and fastening the head plate to metal posts flanking the chamber. Air puff stimuli (10 psi measured before a control solenoid, 100ms) were delivered from two nozzles (cut P200 pipette tips) positioned toward the distal tips of the whiskers, in either the rostrocaudal or ventrodorsal direction. Nozzles were oriented to prevent air jets from stimulating other parts of the face. One of these directions (CS+) was paired with a water reward (10 Î¼L), delivered through a lick port 0.5 s after the stimulus onset. The particular direction (rostrocaudal vs ventrodorsal) used as the CS+ was randomized and counterbalanced across mice. Approximately 180 stimuli were presented over the course of a 30 min imaging session (8â12 s intertrial interval). The probability of CS+ or CS- delivery was 50%. In preliminary experiments, we found that an auditory mask helped prevent mice from exploiting auditory cues to discriminate the two stimuli: a third air nozzle was positioned close to the mouse and was active throughout the session.</p><p>During the first session (pre-conditioning), stimuli were delivered in the absence of reward to assess neural and behavioral responses in naÃ¯ve animals. In the following 7â9 days, the CS+ was paired with reward. Licks for rewards were detected with a capacitance-based touch sensor (Sparkfun). A trial response was registered when one or more licks were elicited within a 0.5 s response window following the stimulus and before reward delivery. To determine whether behavioral performance was above chance, we computed 95% confidence intervals using the âbinofitâ function in MATLAB. During the final session (post-conditioning), stimuli were delivered in the absence of reward. Animals in the unrewarded group received the same two stimuli across 9 days without reward pairing. Behavioral experiments were performed with the Arduino-based OpenMaze open-source behavioral system, whose designs are fully described at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.openmaze.org/">https://www.openmaze.org/</ext-link>. Whisking was monitored at 125 fps with a camera (Sony PS3eye) and automatically tracked using published software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clack et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Intrinsic signal optical imaging and two-photon imaging</title><p>Intrinsic signal optical imaging and two-photon imaging were performed on a Sutter movable objective microscope. The locations of whisker barrels in S1 were identified using intrinsic signal optical imaging. Single whiskers in isoflurane-anesthetized mice were stimulated at 5 Hz using a piezoelectric bimorph while recording the reflectance of 700 nm long-pass incandescent light with a Rolera CCD camera (QImaging) through a low-magnification objective (Zeiss 5X/0.16NA). Movies were collected using software custom-written in Labview (National Instruments). Regions of reflectance change were referenced to an image acquired under green illumination.</p><p>Two-photon imaging was conducted on the same microscope under the control of the ScanImage software package (V. Iyer, Janelia Farms). All calcium imaging data was collected by two-photon microscopy except for those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Scanning during awake conditions was performed at 30 fps using a Chameleon Ultra II laser (Coherent) tuned to 920 nm, precompensated for group velocity dispersion and focused through a 20x/1.0NA water immersion lens (Zeiss). Aquasonic clear ultrasound gel was used for the immersion medium. Emitted light was collected with an HQ535/50 filter (Chroma) and GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics). Apical tufts in layer 1 were imaged at depths of 40â80 Î¼m from the pial surface (1.5 x digital zoom in ScanImage which yielded a 433x433 Î¼m field of view, 512x512 pixels).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SCAPE imaging</title><p>High-speed volumetric imaging was performed using a custom SCAPE microscope as previously described, including for dendritic tufts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouchard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hillman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Voleti et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, the cortex was illuminated with an oblique light sheet through a Olympus XLUMPLFLN 20XW 1.0 NA water immersion objective with a 2 mm working distance. Fluorescence excited by this sheet (extending in the <italic>y-z</italic>â² direction) was collected by the same objective lens. A galvanometer mirror in the system was positioned to both cause the oblique light sheet to scan from side to side across the sample (in the <italic>x</italic> direction) but also to de-scan returning fluorescence light. This optical path results in an intermediate, de-scanned oblique image plane that is stationary yet always co-aligned with the plane in the sample that is being illuminated by the scanning light sheet. Image rotation optics and a fast sCMOS camera (Andor Zyla 4.2+) were then focused to capture these <italic>y-z</italic>â² images (750x200 pixels) at &gt;1000 frames per second as the sheet was repeatedly scanned across the cortex in the <italic>x</italic> direction. All other system parts, including the objective and sample stage, were stationary during high-speed 3D image acquisition. Data were reformed into a 3D volume by stacking successive <italic>y-z</italic>â² planes according to the scanning mirrorâs <italic>x</italic> position and de-skewing to correct for the oblique sheet angle. This rotation of the image volume is responsible for its rectangular appearance despite the cameraâs square frames. The resulting volumes were large enough to encompass many GCaMP6f-labeled tufts in barrel cortex.</p><p>In this study, the stationary objective lens in SCAPE was configured on a manual rotation mount and set to 20Â°â30Â° away from the standard upright configuration, so the optical axis was perpendicular to the cranial window to achieve optimal performance without tilting the head of the animal. A 488 nm laser (Coherent OBIS) was used for excitation (&lt;10 mW at the sample) with a 500 nm long-pass filter in the emission path. To achieve optimal spatiotemporal resolution and volume rate, the sample was imaged with an <italic>x</italic>-direction scanning step of 3 Î¼m over a 300Ã1050 Ã 234 Î¼m field of view (<italic>x-y-z</italic>, 3.0Ã1.40 Ã 1.17 Î¼m per voxel, 100x750 x 200 voxels) at 10 volumes per second (VPS). Our imaging involves no special practical considerations or limitations of field of view or resolution, beyond the usual imaging goal of maximizing FOV while maintaining sufficient resolution to discern structures of interest (dendrites).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis</title><p>Two-photon movies were motion corrected using the NormCorre package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017</xref> in MATLAB or during segmentation using CaImAn. Spatial and temporal components for individual tufts imaged by two-photon and SCAPE were segmented using CaImAn v1.8.3, which employs large-scale sparse non-negative matrix factorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>). CaImAn inherently corrects for background signal. All further analyses used custom-written routines implemented in MATLAB. Spatial components with tuft structural characteristics were identified and analyzed, while neuropil components were discarded.</p><p>To quantify a tuftâs response to stimuli, the mean stimulus-aligned ÎF/F was computed across all CS+ or CS- trials and corrected by the mean ÎF/F of the second before the trial. Probability of transients was obtained by taking each trialâs ÎF/F in the first 1.5 seconds following either the CS+ or CS- and fitting these data with a univariate mixture of two Normal distributions: (1 - <italic>p</italic>)N(<italic>Âµ<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>Ï<sub>1</sub></italic>)+<italic>p</italic>N(<italic>Âµ<sub>2</sub></italic>, <italic>Ï<sub>2</sub></italic>). The smaller Normal reflects the distribution of failures, and the larger Normal the distribution of transient amplitudes following the stimulus. The parameter <italic>p</italic> captures the probability of transients.</p><p>From these data, a selectivity index (SI) was defined as (F<sub>CS+</sub> â F<sub>CS-</sub>) / (F<sub>CS+</sub> + F<sub>CS-</sub>), in which F<sub>CS+</sub> and F<sub>CS-</sub> are the mean stimulus-aligned amplitudes (ÎF/F) to the CS+ and CS- within the first 1.5 s, respectively. This yielded values that range from â1 (exclusively CS- responsive) to 1 (exclusively CS+ responsive). Neural discriminability was defined as dâ = |F<sub>CS+</sub> â F<sub>CS-</sub>| / â((Ï<sup>2</sup><sub>CS+</sub> + Ï<sup>2</sup><sub>CS-</sub>)/2) where Ï<sup>2</sup><sub>CS+</sub> is the variance of the response amplitudes in F<sub>CS+</sub> and Ï<sup>2</sup><sub>CS-</sub> is the variance of the response amplitudes in F<sub>CS-</sub>.</p><p>For longitudinal analysis, tufts were categorized as stimulus responsive if they met two criteria: (1) Across all trials, the mean ÎF/F 1.5 s before and 1.5 s after the stimulus were significantly different according to the Wilcoxon rank sum test, for either the CS+ or CS-, and (2) the average response amplitude for that stimulus was greater than 0.04 ÎF/F. Tufts with a significant response to only one stimulus were categorized as highly selective and their |SI| was set to 1. To classify tufts as behaviorally modulated, the mean ÎF/F of the first 1.5 s after the stimulus was computed for false alarm and correct rejection trials and compared with a rank sum test. Only sessions with at least 12 false alarm trials were used for this analysis. If the two distributions were significantly different, the tuft was classified as behaviorally modulated.</p><p>Custom MATLAB software was used to compute the median whisker angle, and whisking amplitude was computed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petty et al., 2021</xref>). The median angle was bandpass filtered from 4 to 30 Hz and passed through a Hilbert transform to calculate phase. We defined the upper and lower envelopes of the unfiltered median whisking angle as the points in the whisk cycle where phase equaled 0 (most protracted) or Ï (most retracted), respectively. Whisking amplitude was defined as the difference between these two envelopes. Periods of whisking were defined as times where whisking amplitude exceeded 20% of maximum for at least 250ms. Periods of time where amplitude exceeded this threshold for less than 250 ms were considered ambiguous and excluded from analysis of whisking versus quiescence. The whisking-triggered average for each tuft was computed by aligning the calcium signal to the start times of whisking periods during inter-trial intervals (2â8 s after stimulus delivery).</p><p>For the linear regression analysis, we excerpted the calcium timeseries 2 s before and 6 s after each stimulus onset. The whisking amplitude signal was frame aligned to the calcium signal according to the lag of the calcium-whisking cross-correlation peak for each tuft. Whisking amplitude was then normalized to the max, yielding values that ranged from 0 to 1. The stimulus predictor variable was a binary vector with an 800 ms âonâ period (24 frames) centered at the stimulus time. The timing of the stimulus variable was then aligned to the calcium signal according to the latency of peak of the mean ÎF/F of the first 1.5 s relative to the stimulus. The lick predictor variable was a binary vector with âonâ periods denoting lick bouts. Lick bouts were defined as periods of time where the mouse elicited at least 2 licks, with a maximum gap of 200ms, and therefore had variable lengths.</p><p>For support vector machine (SVM) analysis, the mean ÎF/F was computed for a pre-stimulus epoch (1 s immediately preceding the stimulus, used as a negative control) and a post-stimulus epoch (0.1â1.1 s after the stimulus) for each trial. Binary SVMs were trained separately for each epoch using the MATLAB function fitcsvm. For each iteration, 75% of trials were randomly chosen to train the SVM, and decoder performance was tested on the remaining 25% of trials. Decoder performance for each session was averaged across 10 iterations.</p><p>All statistical tests were two-sided. T-tests were used for Normally distributed data. Otherwise non-parametric tests were applied.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>A patent related to the SCAPE microscopy technique used in Figure 4 was issued on December 31st 2013, and the author has licensed the technology</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University (protocol number AC AABP0555).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98349-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data from this study are available for download on Dryad: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v6wwpzh5t">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v6wwpzh5t</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benezra</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>KB</given-names></name><name><surname>Campos</surname><given-names>CP</given-names></name><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>EMC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Data from: Learning enhances behaviorally relevant representations in apical dendrites</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.v6wwpzh5t</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Venkatakaushik Voleti for help with the design, construction, and alignment of the SCAPE microscope; Dan Kato, Georgia Pierce, and Jung Park for help with pilot experiments; Eftychios Pnevmatikakis and Johannes Friedrich for advice on dendrite segmentation; and Larry Abbott, Stefano Fusi, Ashok Litwin-Kumar, Chris Rodgers, Georgia Pierce, Gordon Petty, and Dan Kato for comments on the manuscript.

Many studies have attempted to answer this question at the neuronal population level - with varying degrees of success - but few, if any, have studied the change in activity of the apical dendrites of layer 5 cortical neurons. Neurons in the layer 5 of the sensory cortex appear to play a key role in sensorimotor transformations, showing important decision and reward-related signals, and being the main source of cortical and subcortical projections from the cortex. In particular, pyramidal track (PT) neurons project directly to subcortical regions related to motor activity, such as the striatum and brainstem, and could initiate rapid motor action in response to given sensory inputs. Additionally, layer 5 cortical neurons have large apical dendrites that extend to layer 1 where different neuromodulatory and long-range inputs converge, providing motor and contextual information that could be used to modulate layer 5 neurons output and/or to establish the synaptic plasticity required for learning a new association.</p><p>In this study, the authors aimed to test whether the learning of a new sensorimotor transformation could be supported by a change in the evoked response of the apical dendrites of layer 5 neurons in the mouse whisker primary somatosensory cortex. To do this, they performed longitudinal functional calcium imaging of the apical dendrites of layer 5 neurons while mice learned to discriminate between two multiwhiskers stimuli. The authors used a simple conditioning task in which one whisker stimulus (upward or backward air puff, CS+) is associated with reward after a short delay, while the other whisker stimulus (CS-) is not. They found that task learning (measured by the probability of anticipatory licking just after the CS+) was not associated with a significant change of the average population response evoked by the CS+ or the CS-, nor change in the average population selectivity. However, when considering individual dendritic tufts, they found interesting changes in selectivity, with approximately equal numbers of dendrites becoming more selective for CS+ and dendrites becoming more selective for CS-.</p><p>One of the major challenges when assessing changes in neural representation during the learning of such Go/NoGo tasks is that the movements and rewards themselves may elicit strong neural responses that may be a confounding factor, that is, inexperienced mice do not lick in response to the CS+, while trained mice do. In this study, the authors addressed this issue in three ways: first, they carefully monitor the orofacial movements of mice and show that task learning is not associated with changes in evoked whisker movements. Second, they show that whisking or licking evokes very little activity in the dendritic tufts compared to whisker stimuli (CS+ and CS-). Finally, the authors introduced into the design of their task a post-conditioning session after the last conditioning session during which the CS+ and the CS- are presented but no reward is delivered. During this post-session, the mice gradually stopped licking in response to the CS+. A better design might have been to perform the pre-conditioning and post-conditioning sessions in non-water-restricted, unmotivated mice to completely exclude any lick response, but the fact that the change in selectivity persists after the mice stopped licking in the last blocks of the post-conditioning session (in mice relying only on their whiskers to perform the task) is convincing.</p><p>The clever task design and careful data analysis provide compelling evidence that learning this whisker discrimination task does not result in a massive change in sensory representation in the apical dendritic tufts of layer 5 neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex on average. Nevertheless, individual dendritic tufts do increase their selectivity for one or the other sensory stimulus, likely enhancing the ability of S1 neurons to accurately discriminate the two stimuli and trigger the appropriate motor response (to lick or not to lick).</p><p>One limitation of the present study is the lack of evidence for the necessity of the primary somatosensory cortex in the learning and execution of the task. As the authors have strongly emphasized in their previous publications, the primary somatosensory cortex may not be necessary for the learning and execution of simple whisker detection tasks, especially when the stimulus is very salient. Although this new task requires the discrimination between two whisker stimuli, the simplicity and salience of the whisker stimuli used could make this task cortex independent. Especially when considering that some mice seem to not rely entirely on their whiskers to execute the task.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is an important result that shows for the first-time changes in the selectivity to sensory stimuli at the level of individual apical dendritic tufts in correlation with the learning of a discrimination task. This study sheds new light on the cortical cellular substrates of reward-based learning, and opens interesting perspectives for future research in this area. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether the change in selectivity of dendritic calcium spikes is causally involved in the learning the task or whether it simply correlates with learning, as a consequence of changes in synaptic inputs caused by reward. The dendritic calcium spikes may be involved in the establishment of synaptic plasticity required for learning and impact the output of layer 5 pyramidal neurons to trigger the appropriate motor response. It would be important also to study the changes in selectivity in the apical dendrite of the identified projection neurons.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed all my questions.

This feature (1) was not present in repeated exposures (without reinforcement), (2) was not explained by animal's behaviour (choice, licking and whisking) and (3) was long-lasting, being present even when the mice disengaged from the task.</p><p>Importantly, increased selectivity was correlated with learning (% correct choices), and neural discriminability between stimuli increased with learning.</p><p>In conclusion, the authors show that tuft dendrites from layer 5B of the barrel cortex increase the representation of conditioned (CS+) and unconditioned stimuli (CS-) applied to the whiskers, during reinforcement learning.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The results presented are very consistent throughout the entire study, and therefore very convincing:</p><p>(1) The results observed are very similar using two different imaging techniques (using 2-photon -planar imaging- and SCAPE - volumetric imaging). Fig. 3 and Fig.4 respectively.</p><p>(2) The results are similar using &quot;different groups&quot; of tuft dendrites for the analysis (e.g. initially unresponsive and responsive pre- and post-learning). Fig. 5.</p><p>(3) The results are similar from a specific set of trials (with the same sensory input, but different choices). Fig.7.</p><p>(4) Additionally, the selectivity of tuft dendrites from layer 5B of the barrel cortex was higher in the mice that exclusively used the whisker to respond to the stimuli (CS+ and CS-).</p><p>The results presented are controlled against a group of mice that received the same stimuli presentation, except the reinforcement (reward).</p><p>Additionally, the behaviour outputs, such as choice, whisking and licking could not account for the results observed.</p><p>Although there are no causal experiments, the correlation between selectivity and learning (% of correct choices), as well as the increased neural discriminability with learning, but not in repeated exposure, are very convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The biggest weakness is the absence of causality experiments. Although inhibiting specifically tuft dendritic activity in layer 1 from layer 5 pyramidal neurons is very challenging, tuft dendritic activity in layer 1 could be silenced through optogenetic experiments as in Abs et al. 2018. By manipulating NDNF-positive neurons the authors could specifically modify tuft dendritic activity in the barrel cortex during CS presentations, and test if silencing tuft dendritic activity in layer 1 would lead to the lack of selectivity and an impairment of reinforcement learning. Additionally, this experiment will test if the selectivity observed during reinforcement learning is due to changes in the local network, namely changes in local synaptic connectivity, or solely due to changes in the long-range inputs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98349.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Benezra</surname><given-names>Sam E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Columbia University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Kripa B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Columbia University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Perez Campos</surname><given-names>Citlali</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Columbia University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hillman</surname><given-names>Elizabeth MC</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Columbia University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>Randy M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>What neurophysiological changes support the learning of new sensorimotor transformations is a key question in neuroscience. Many studies have attempted to answer this question at the neuronal population level - with varying degrees of success - but few, if any, have studied the change in activity of the apical dendrites of layer 5 cortical neurons. Neurons in layer 5 of the sensory cortex appear to play a key role in sensorimotor transformations, showing important decision and reward-related signals, and being the main source of cortical and subcortical projections from the cortex. In particular, pyramidal track (PT) neurons project directly to subcortical regions related to motor activity, such as the striatum and brainstem, and could initiate rapid motor action in response to given sensory inputs. Additionally, layer 5 cortical neurons have large apical dendrites that extend to layer 1 where different neuromodulatory and long-range inputs converge, providing motor and contextual information that could be used to modulate layer 5 neurons output and/or to establish the synaptic plasticity required for learning a new association.</p><p>In this study, the authors aimed to test whether the learning of a new sensorimotor transformation could be supported by a change in the evoked response of the apical dendrites of layer 5 neurons in the mouse whisker primary somatosensory cortex. To do this, they performed longitudinal functional calcium imaging of the apical dendrites of layer 5 neurons while mice learned to discriminate between two multi-whisker stimuli. The authors used a simple conditioning task in which one whisker stimulus (upward or backward air pu , CS+) is associated with a reward after a short delay, while the other whisker stimulus (CS-) is not. They found that task learning (measured by the probability of anticipatory licking just after the CS+) was not associated with a significant change in the average population response evoked by the CS+ or the CS-, nor a change in the average population selectivity. However, when considering individual dendritic tufts, they found interesting changes in selectivity, with approximately equal numbers of dendrites becoming more selective for CS+ and dendrites becoming more selective for CS-.</p><p>One of the major challenges when assessing changes in neural representation during the learning of such Go/NoGo tasks is that the movements and rewards themselves may elicit strong neural responses that may be a confounding factor, that is, inexperienced mice do not lick in response to the CS+, while trained mice do. In this study, the authors addressed this issue in three ways: first, they carefully monitored the orofacial movements of mice and showed that task learning is not associated with changes in evoked whisker movements. Second, they show that whisking or licking evokes very little activity in the dendritic tufts compared to whisker stimuli (CS+ and CS-). Finally, the authors introduced into the design of their task a post-conditioning session after the last conditioning session during which the CS+ and the CS- are presented but no reward is delivered. During this post-session, the mice gradually stopped licking in response to the CS+. A better design might have been to perform the pre-conditioning and post-conditioning sessions in nonwater-restricted, unmotivated mice to completely exclude any lick response, but the fact that the change in selectivity persists after the mice stopped licking in the last blocks of the post-conditioning session (in mice relying only on their whiskers to perform the task) is convincing.</p><p>The clever task design and careful data analysis provide compelling evidence that learning this whisker discrimination task does not result in a massive change in sensory representation in the apical dendritic tufts of layer 5 neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex on average. Nevertheless, individual dendritic tufts do increase their selectivity for one or the other sensory stimulus, likely enhancing the ability of S1 neurons to accurately discriminate the two stimuli and trigger the appropriate motor response (to lick or not to lick).</p><p>One limitation of the present study is the lack of evidence for the necessity of the primary somatosensory cortex in the learning and execution of the task. As the authors have strongly emphasized in their previous publications, the primary somatosensory cortex may not be necessary for the learning and execution of simple whisker detection tasks, especially when the stimulus is very salient. Although this new task requires the discrimination between two whisker stimuli, the simplicity and salience of the whisker stimuli used could make this task cortex-independent. Especially when considering that some mice seem to not rely entirely on their whiskers to execute the task.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is an important result that shows for the first time changes in the selectivity to sensory stimuli at the level of individual apical dendritic tufts in correlation with the learning of a discrimination task. This study sheds new light on the cortical cellular substrates of reward-based learning and opens interesting perspectives for future research in this area. In future studies, it will be important to determine whether the change in selectivity of dendritic calcium spikes is causally involved in the learning of the task or whether it simply correlates with learning, as a consequence of changes in synaptic inputs caused by reward. The dendritic calcium spikes may be involved in the establishment of synaptic plasticity required for learning and impact the output of layer 5 pyramidal neurons to trigger the appropriate motor response. It would be important also to study the changes in selectivity in the apical dendrite of the identified projection neurons.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors did not find an increased representation of CS+ throughout reinforcement learning in the tuft dendrites of Rbp4-positive neurons from layer 5B of the barrel cortex, as previously reported for soma from layer 2/3 of the visual cortex.</p><p>Alternatively, the authors observed an increased selectivity to both stimuli (CS+ and CS-) during reinforcement learning. This feature:</p><p>(1) was not present in repeated exposures (without reinforcement),</p><p>(2) was not explained by the animal's behaviour (choice, licking, and whisking), and</p><p>(3) was long-lasting, being present even when the mice disengaged from the task.</p><p>Importantly, increased selectivity was correlated with learning (% correct choices), and neural discriminability between stimuli increased with learning.</p><p>In conclusion, the authors show that tuft dendrites from layer 5B of the barrel cortex increase the representation of conditioned (CS+) and unconditioned stimuli (CS-) applied to the whiskers, during reinforcement learning.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The results presented are very consistent throughout the entire study, and therefore very convincing:</p><p>(1) The results observed are very similar using two different imaging techniques (2-photon planar imaging- and SCAPE-volumetric imaging). Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively.</p><p>(2) The results are similar using &quot;different groups&quot; of tuft dendrites for the analysis (e.g. initially unresponsive and responsive pre- and post-learning). Figure 5.</p><p>(3) The results are similar from a specific set of trials (with the same sensory input, but di erent choices). Figure 7.</p><p>(4) Additionally, the selectivity of tuft dendrites from layer 5B of the barrel cortex was higher in the mice that exclusively used the whisker to respond to the stimuli (CS+ and CS-). The results presented are controlled against a group of mice that received the same stimuli presentation, except for the reinforcement (reward).</p><p>Additionally, the behaviour outputs, such as choice, whisking, and licking could not account for the results observed.</p><p>Although there are no causal experiments, the correlation between selectivity and learning (percentage of correct choices), as well as the increased neural discriminability with learning, but not in repeated exposure, are very convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The biggest weakness is the absence of causality experiments. Although inhibiting specifically tuft dendritic activity in layer 1 from layer 5 pyramidal neurons is very challenging, tuft dendritic activity in layer 1 could be silenced through optogenetic experiments as in Abs et al. 2018. By manipulating NDNF-positive neurons the authors could specifically modify tuft dendritic activity in the barrel cortex during CS presentations, and test if silencing tuft dendritic activity in layer 1 would lead to the lack of selectivity and an impairment of reinforcement learning. Additionally, this experiment will test if the selectivity observed during reinforcement learning is due to changes in the local network, namely changes in local synaptic connectivity, or solely due to changes in the long-range inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such causal manipulations are a logical next step. Such manipulations are unfortunately not specific to layer 5 apicals, so the results would be difficult to interpret. We now discuss the challenge of such manipulations in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, the study is solid and the article is well and clearly written. I have no suggestion for other experiments that would fall within the scope of this article. I would like only to suggest some additional analyses and clarifications in the writing.</p><p>Additional analyses:</p><p>Obviously, the main confounding factor in this type of data comes from the acquired motor response which follows - with a short latency - the sensory stimulus. This is particularly problematic for functional calcium imaging which has very low temporal resolution. The authors have addressed this question to some extent by showing that motor-evoked activity does not account for the change in selectivity acquired with learning and through the use of a post-conditioning session during which no reward was delivered. Figures 8C-D show that mice gradually stop licking in response to CS+ in this session and that the distribution of the selectivity index remains similar in these last blocks. Perhaps a more convincing analysis would be to simply select Miss and Correct rejection trials in which mice did not lick in response to the CS+ and CS-, respectively. Ideally, if the number of trials is sufficient, one could even select trials devoid of any evoked movement (no licking and no whisking).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it would be interesting to compare Miss and Correct rejection trials to further rule out effects of a motor response, but there were never enough Miss trials to conduct such an analysis. Even in very early learning, there are few Miss trials (see Figure 1, session 2). We found that in early learning, animals would lick in most trials. Then, over the course of conditioning, they would learn to withhold licks during CS- presentation. Thus, we were able to examine Hits, Correct rejections, and False alarms (Figure 7), but not Miss trials. We have added text suggesting a future experiment in which the stimulus strengths are substantially reduced to drastically increase the error rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fact that changes in selectivity occur in both directions overall is really interesting. However, in the way the data are presented currently, one may wonder about mice/field of view vs single cell effect. i.e., do di erent dendritic tufts in the same field of view show opposite changes in selectivity? If we were to replot Figure 3A for a single mouse, would we obtain the same picture?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this very good suggestion and have added scatter plots and selectivity index histograms for individual conditioned animals in Supplementary figure 2. These data demonstrate that different dendritic tufts in the same field of view exhibit opposite changes in selectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors point out that they observed no change in the mean response or selectivity during learning, but did find changes in selectivity at the level of individual dendritic tufts. This suggests that, at the population level, the ability to discriminate between the two stimuli should improve. A possible complementary analysis would be to show that the ability to decode stimulus identity from dendritic tuft population activity increases with learning.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the substantial change in individual tuft selectivity and that the tuft events occur are not rare, the population result is guaranteed. If individual tufts increase selectivity, the population will also increase its selectivity on a trial-by-trial basis. We have nevertheless included a new supplementary figure with a population analysis using SVMs to demonstrate this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarification:</p><p>The authors should make it clear from the beginning that mice are still water-restricted during the post-conditioning session and actually do keep licking for many CS+ trials. Therefore, this session is not devoid of motor response.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did mice in the repeated exposure condition receive any reward during the recording sessions?
