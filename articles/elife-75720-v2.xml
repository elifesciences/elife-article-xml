2 (SARS-CoV-2). It decorates the virus surface and undergoes large motions of its receptor binding domains (RBDs) to enter the host cell. Here, we observe Down, one-Up, one-Open, and two-Up-like structures in enhanced molecular dynamics simulations, and characterize the transition pathways via inter-domain interactions. Transient salt-bridges between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>C</sub> and the interaction with glycan at N343<sub>B</sub> support RBD<sub>A</sub> motions from Down to one-Up. Reduced interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub> in one-Up induce RBD<sub>B</sub> motions toward two-Up. The simulations overall agree with cryo-electron microscopy structure distributions and FRET experiments and provide hidden functional structures, namely, intermediates along Down-to-one-Up transition with druggable cryptic pockets as well as one-Open with a maximum exposed RBD. The inherent flexibility of S-protein thus provides essential information for antiviral drug rational design or vaccine development.</p></abstract><kwd-group

(SARS-CoV-2) has caused over 430 million infections and 5.9 million deaths, as of February 2022 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html</ext-link>). It represents an urgent need for an effective medical intervention strategy to avoid further social and economic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). Different types of vaccines, for example, those from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna using the mRNA of spike (S) protein, are currently available, and there are several FDA approved drug candidates under consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Venkadapathi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2022</xref>). At the same time, more infectious mutants such as B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.427/B.1.429 (Epsilon), and more recently Omicron have appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCallum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2022</xref>), and some evade from the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gobeil et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the virus’s ability to infect a wide range of vertebrates, which could act as a reservoir, points out the future risk despite the vaccination progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prince et al., 2021</xref>). A deeper understanding of the virus molecular structure and infection mechanism is crucial to stop the virus transmission including mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus, has a large genome of approximately 30 kb encoding 29 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finkel et al., 2021</xref>). A transmembrane homotrimeric class I fusion glycoprotein decorating the virus, known as S-protein, plays a critical role in the viral cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). In an immediate response to the pandemic, more than 300 S-protein structures determined with cryo-electron microscopy (EM) and X-ray crystallography have been reported and rapidly advanced in our understanding of the S-protein/receptor binding mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wrobel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). The N-terminal subunit (S1), which is composed of the N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor binding domain (RBD), and two other subdomains (SD1 and SD2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walls et al., 2020</xref>), initially binds to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). This binding is followed by priming of the C-terminal subunit (S2) and its large conformational changes leading to the membrane fusion for the cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). S-protein is covered by 66 N-glycans, 22 per protomer, to evade from the host cell immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grant et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). To block the initial binding with ACE2, vaccines for stimulating the immune system or antibodies/small-molecule drugs for neutralizing the virus is the primary target for medical interventions. Numerous cryo-EM structures have revealed that RBDs can take Down or several Up forms including one-Up, two-Up, and three-Up conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wrobel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juraszek et al., 2021</xref>). Up forms are accessible to the ACE2 receptor in the cell entry, while the Down is inaccessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Note that most of the cryo-EM structures representing Up forms were determined together with other proteins, such as antibodies or a fragment of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A recent single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiment suggested that the RBD Down-to-Up transition occurs even without any ligand of S-protein, and at least one transient intermediate exists during the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). These experiments suggest the potential flexibility of S-protein conformation and the possible involvement of multiple intermediates along transition pathways. The exploration of a wide conformational space of S-protein is necessary for characterizing the transition pathways, which give us better chances to find cryptic drug/antibody binding sites otherwise elusive.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spike (S) protein performed in this study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Name</th><th align="left" valign="top">Model</th><th align="left" valign="top">Method</th><th align="left" valign="top">Simulations length</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">gREST_Down</td><td align="left" valign="top">Spike Down w/ glycans</td><td align="left" valign="top">gREST_SSCR</td><td align="left" valign="top">500 ns × 16 replicas</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">gREST_Up</td><td align="left" valign="top">Spike Up w/ glycans</td><td align="left" valign="top">gREST_SSCR</td><td align="left" valign="top">300 ns × 16 replicas</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">gREST_Down w/o glycan</td><td align="left" valign="top">Spike Down w/o glycans</td><td align="left" valign="top">gREST_SSCR</td><td align="left" valign="top">150 ns × 16 replicas</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Monomer_Down</td><td align="left" valign="top">RBD/SD1 monomer Down</td><td align="left" valign="top">cMD</td><td align="left" valign="top">300 ns × 1 run</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Monomer_Up</td><td align="left" valign="top">RBD/SD1 monomer Up</td><td align="left" valign="top">cMD</td><td align="left" valign="top">300 ns × 2 runs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">cMD_Down<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1">*</xref></sup></td><td align="left" valign="top">Spike Down w/ glycans</td><td align="left" valign="top">cMD</td><td align="left" valign="top">1000 ns × 1 run</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">cMD_Up<sup>*</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top">Spike Up w/ glycans</td><td align="left" valign="top">cMD</td><td align="left" valign="top">1000 ns × 1 run</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>cMD_Down and cMD_Up are the same simulations as shown in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparisons of spike (S) protein structures in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Twenty-seven coarse-grained beads representations of four representative cryo-EM structures: Down (PDB ID: 6ZGE), 1Up (6XKL), 2Up (7K8U), and 3Up (6XCN).

However, the timescale of the Down-to-Up transition in S-protein is far slower than that is attainable in the current MD simulations, leaving the inherent flexibility and transition pathways largely unknown. Therefore, several enhanced sampling methods including targeted MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>), steering MD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gur et al., 2020</xref>), nudged elastic band/umbrella sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Simmerling et al., 2020</xref>), two-dimensional umbrella sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2021</xref>), adaptive sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zimmerman et al., 2021</xref>), and weighted ensemble methods have been applied to investigate the RBD transition from Down to one-Up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>).

Eight pairs of positively and negatively charged residues at RBD interface in each chain were selected as solute in gREST_SSCR and their Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interactions were scaled using solute temperatures in 16 copies of the original systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). After modeling missing residues, two simulations were started from a Down cryo-EM structure (PDBID: 6VXX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walls et al., 2020</xref>) in the presence (gREST_Down) and absence of glycan (gREST_Down w/o glycan), and one from an one-Up structure (PDBID: 6VYB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walls et al., 2020</xref>) (gREST_Up). MD simulations for longer than 15 µs, in total, were carried out for the solvated S-protein including about 655,000 atoms. Analyses of SD1/RBD hinge angle and the Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) of each RBD upon fitting S2 provide simple measures of the RBD Down-to-Up transitions: the RMSD and hinge angle in Up take the values of about 20 Å and 150°, respectively, while the hinge angle in Down is about 116°. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> indicates that RBD motions are drastically enhanced in all three simulations.

Considering the trimeric nature of S-protein and its complex motions, the comparison with experimental structures is not trivial. For this purpose, we introduce (1) the nine-beads representation per protomer as used in the studies by Henderson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gobeil et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henderson et al., 2020a</xref>) (the 27-beads model of S-protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>), (2) the rotation scheme to make the most significant RBD motion always happen in Chain<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>), and (3) the principal component analysis (PCA) on the 27-beads model upon fitting all the beads to reduce the essential dimensions in the conformational space. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, the first principal component (PC1) represents a symmetric Down-to-Up motion involving all three RBDs, while the second component (PC2) reveals an asymmetric motion of RBDs where only RBD<sub>A</sub> undergoes the Down-to-Up motion. The two lowest PCs cover about 85% of the conformational variations observed in the cryo-EM structures. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, the cryo-EM structures with distinct RBD conformations, Down, one-Up, two-Up, and three-Up, are found in different ensembles on the PC1-PC2 space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>Next, we project the results of our previous 1 µs conventional MD (cMD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>) (cMD_Down and cMD_Up in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and the three gREST_SSCR simulations at 310 K on the same space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The gREST_SSCR distributions at the temperature were obtained using multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shirts and Chodera, 2008</xref>) by utilizing all the replicas’ trajectories. The structure distributions in cMD_Down and cMD_Up overlap with the corresponding Down and one-Up cryo-EM structures, while there is a big gap between the distributions on the PC1-PC2 space. Instead, gREST_SSCR could fill the gap effectively: gREST_Down samples from Down to one-Up, while gREST_Up covers one-Up and two-Up ensembles. Using the simulated distributions, we can investigate the inherent flexibility of S-protein, the transition pathways, and the intermediate structures. gREST_Down w/o glycan gives a wider conformational space than gREST_Down, suggesting that glycans on the surface of S-protein play key roles in the conformational stability.</p><p>To focus on the Down-to-Up motions in S-protein, we define the hinge and twist angles using the Cα atoms in RBD and SD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

In contrast, RBM SASA increases in 1U and 1U<sub>O</sub> compared to Down<sub>Sym</sub>, wherein 1U<sub>O</sub> exhibits the utmost increase, suggesting its potential contribution to the receptor and antibody binding. The SASA increases only slightly, even decreases locally around residue C480, in 2U<sub>L</sub> due to the interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub>. This finding suggests that one-Up is the primary target of the receptor and antibody binding. Focusing on mutational residues of concern (K417, L452, E484, and N501 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>), K417 and N501 are accessible only in one-Up conformations. The mutations of these residues could directly affect the binding with the receptor and antibody. On the other hand, E484 is accessible in both Down and Up, inferring a widespread effect of E484 mutations. L452 is not accessible in any conformations and hence is expected to rarely affect the binding with either receptor or antibody in wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Valdes-Balbin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Accessibility of receptor binding motif (RBM).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Per-residue solvent accessible surface area (SASA) values of the RBM (residues 410–510) in Down conformation (top) and their changes in Up conformations (bottom three).

The epitope regions of Up conformations are generally less shielded by glycans compared to Down (at most 99% de-shielded, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Notably, the epitope SASAs of Class I and II antibodies in 1U and 1U<sub>O</sub> are significantly large. The C105 (Class I) and C002 (Class II) antibodies in cryo-EM structures are well aligned to 1U and 1U<sub>O</sub> without steric crash (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> for detail). These results suggest that Class I and II antibodies preferentially bind to these two conformations. The corresponding SASA values are small in 2U<sub>L</sub> due to the interaction between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub>, leading the Class I antibody difficult to align without steric crash. Note that there are differences between 2U<sub>L</sub> and the full two-Up cryo-EM structures. The observation on SASA values in 2U<sub>L</sub> is applicable to the state just before reaching the full two-Up structures. In any Up conformations, the epitope SASAs of Class III antibody is comparable to that of Down, while the region is less shielded by glycans. The S309 (Class III) antibody in cryo-EM structures is still well aligned to 1U and 2U<sub>L</sub>, rationalizing that the Class III antibodies recognize ‘glycoepitopes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pinto et al., 2020</xref>). Note that the epitope region of the Class IV antibody is slightly exposed only in 1U<sub>O</sub>. Further opening of RBD may allow the binding of the Class IV antibody, such as CR3022, as suggested in the previous computational study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zimmerman et al., 2021</xref>). All these results suggest the preferential binding of different antibodies depending on the RBD conformation. Notably, the Up structures from MD simulations are reasonably aligned to those of cryo-EM structures with antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). This observation supports an idea of conformer selection regime for antibody bindings. As the S-protein RBD is inherently flexible, potential conformations for antibody bindings are likely programmed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Simulated structure ensembles align with smFRET experimental results</title><p>Using smFRET, Lu et al. examined the conformational dynamics of S-protein in the presence or absence of its receptor, hACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). They characterized four structural ensembles including two types of Down (major and minor), at least one intermediate and one-Up conformations, suggesting the inherent flexibility of the RBD region regardless of the receptor binding. However, to date, there is no structural information that describes the observed intermediate states in the smFRET experiment. In addition, despite the abundance of cryo-EM structures, they are unable to solely explain smFRET results as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4d</xref>. To unravel such inaccessible structural information of the intermediate states, we first classify each trajectory at 310 K using k-means clustering and re-clustering guided by the hinge and twist angles distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref> ). The 13 micro-clusters were identified from gREST_Down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) including two clusters representing the symmetric Down (Down_sym: D1<sub>Sym</sub> and D2<sub>Sym</sub>), two clusters of asymmetric Down with differences in RBDs twist angle distribution (Down<sub>Asym</sub>: D1<sub>Asym</sub> and D2<sub>Asym</sub>), three clusters with a slight increase in the RBD hinge angle around 120°, (Int1: I1a, I1b, and I1c), three clusters with one RBD hinge angle around 130° (Int2: I2a, I2b, and I2c), two clusters with hinge angle around 140° (Int3: I3a and I3b), and one cluster with an Up-like conformation (1U<sub>L</sub>). Similarly, from gREST_Up, the 13 clusters were identified including 10 clusters representing one-Up conformation (1U: 1Ua-1Uj), two clusters with two-Up-like conformations (2U<sub>L</sub>: 2Ua<sub>L</sub> and 2Ub<sub>L</sub>) and one-Up open cluster (1U<sub>O</sub>). Then we compute the distance between residues 425–431 in RBD<sub>A</sub> and 554–561 in SD1<sub>A</sub> to correlate the simulated structure ensembles with the smFRET intensity reported by Lu et al., 2020. By combining the distance distributions from gREST_Down and gREST_Up, we obtain five main conformational ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>): Down symmetric (Down<sub>Sym</sub>), Down like (Down<sub>Like</sub>: Down<sub>Asym</sub> and Int1), two intermediates (Int2 and Int3), and Up (1Up). The smFRET distance alone cannot distinguish various Up conformations including 1U, 1U<sub>O</sub>, and 2U<sub>L</sub> and thus we refer to them as 1Up. Down<sub>Sym</sub> and Down<sub>Like</sub> give distributions in the range of 30–35 Å, while 1Up shows around a median distance of 47 Å. The distributions of Int2 and Int3 have median distances of around 38 and 40 Å, respectively. Note that Int3 has a large distance distribution that overlaps with Int2 and both intermediates might be indistinguishable in the smFRET experiment. Collectively our simulations show the formation of four main conformations Down<sub>Sym</sub>, Down<sub>Like</sub>, Intermediate (Int2 and Int3), and 1Up that correspond to the smFRET intensity of 0.8, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 in the absence of hACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Each ensemble is also characterized with hinge angle distributions that align in order of smFRET distances: Down<sub>Sym</sub>: Hinge &lt; 120°, Down<sub>Like</sub>: Hinge &lt; 130°, Int2: 120° &lt; Hinge &lt; 140°, Int3: Hinge ~140°, 1Up: 140° &lt; Hinge &lt; 160°.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Transition pathways and transient interactions stabilizing the intermediate structures</title><p>We next focus on molecular mechanisms underlying the Down-to-1Up transitions in terms of the correlated motions of the hinge and twist angles in the three RBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Note that such correlated motions are hardly obtained using targeted MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>) or the MD simulations enhanced with pre-defined reaction coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotzakis et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> indicates that the transition pathway from Down-to-1Up conformation occurs via four main states including two intermediates. First, the transition is initiated from flexible Down structures (Down<sub>Sym</sub> and Down<sub>Like</sub>), where three RBDs show high flexibilities reflected by a wide range of twist angle between 10° and 90° while RBD<sub>A</sub> maintains a hinge angle &lt;125°. The increase in RBD<sub>A</sub> hinge angle to 130° in I2a is accompanied by the reduction in other RBDs’ flexibility. It is reflected by smaller changes in twist and hinge angles for the chains B and C. Later, two main pathways are identified through I3a or I3b (hinge 140°), however, comparisons of all five free-energy maps as well as the projection on PC1-PC2 free-energy surface suggest that 13b is an off-target intermediate. In I3a, both hinge and twist angles are increased in RBD<sub>A</sub>, accompanied by a slight reduction in RBD<sub>C</sub> hinge angle. Both I2a and I3a represent stable basins along the free-energy landscapes (FELs) along the PC1-PC2 and hinge-twist angles, emphasizing their role in mediating the transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">11</xref>). Lastly, 1U<sub>L</sub> conformation is formed with hinge angle &gt;150° with a concomitant increase in its twist angle. In general, Hinge<sub>A</sub> and Twist<sub>A</sub> are highly correlated (cc: 0.94) with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5c</xref>), while Hinge<sub>A</sub> and Hinge<sub>B</sub> show no correlations (cc: 0.02). The correlations between Hinge<sub>A</sub> and Hinge<sub>C</sub>/Twist<sub>C</sub> exist to some extent (cc: –0.68 and 0.30).</p><p>To further analyze the changes throughout the transition pathway, the analysis of contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>) and hydrogen bond (HB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>) were carried out for each cluster observed in gREST_Down and gREST_Up as we did in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, several key contacts and HBs are highlighted to see drastic changes of the interactions in the Down-to-1Up transition. The glycans at N343<sub>B</sub> and N234<sub>B</sub> switch the interactions with RBD<sub>A</sub> along the transition from Down to one-Up-like. In the intermediates, the glycan at N343<sub>B</sub> changes its contact partners by inserting underneath RBD<sub>A</sub>. Concurrently, the formation of salt-bridge interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>C</sub>, for instance, R408<sub>A</sub>-D405<sub>C</sub> and R408<sub>A</sub>-D406<sub>C</sub>, lift up RBD<sub>A</sub> from its Down to intermediate structures. Finally, N234<sub>B</sub> inserts into the newly formed cavity in 1U<sub>L</sub> between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub>, forming new contacts with D428<sub>A</sub> and T430<sub>A</sub>. The glycan at N165<sub>B</sub> is in contact with RBD<sub>A</sub> throughout the transition, likely acting as a main barrier.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Protein-protein and protein-glycan interactions critical for Down-to-Up transition.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Probability of finding the hydrogen bond (green) and contact (purple) pairs between protein residues or protein-glycans that markedly change along the transition pathway (Down<sub>Sym</sub>, I2a, I3a, and 1U<sub>L</sub>).

The latest challenges involve the use of a million of distributed computer resources, Folding@home, to realize MD simulation of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for 0.1 s, in total. An alternative approach is to incorporate experimental observation to effectively sample different states. Brotzakis and co-workers recently applied the cryo-EM metainference method to determine the opening pathway and intermediates based on the experimental density map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotzakis et al., 2021</xref>). Yet another approach is to use enhanced sampling methods. Sztain and co-workers performed the weighted ensemble simulations, collecting 130 µs trajectories, to characterize the opening pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>). Pang et al. employed two-dimensional umbrella sampling to characterize the transition pathway and the role of glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pang et al., 2021</xref>). The gREST_SSCR simulations are free from reaction coordinates and bias potentials that were used in many previous enhanced sampling simulations of S-protein. By using Fugaku supercomputer as well as GENESIS program (ver2.0) designed for achieving high scalability on that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jung et al., 2021</xref>), the simulations explored a wide conformational space covering Down, one-Up, one-Open, and two-Up-like structures. The obtained structure ensembles overall agree with the cryo-EM structure distributions and smFRET data, suggesting the existence of the inherent flexibility of S-protein structures without its ligand, such as hACE2 or nAbs. Comparison to cryo-EM and smFRET experiment also indicates the quality of the predicted structures including intermediate states. In fact, comparison of the intermediate structures I2a and I3a with the D614G spike variant cryo-EM structure (PDB:7KRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>) shows a good agreement, with Cα RMSD of 4.9 and 5.1 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s12">Figure 4—figure supplement 12</xref>).</p><p>Besides the enhancement of conformational sampling by gREST_SSCR, there are several remaining issues in the simulations. Within our computational time, one single simulation cannot cover a whole FEL containing all the important structures of S-protein. Three-Up structures, which were found with cryo-EM, for instance, PDB:7DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>), were not observed in the current simulations. As we discuss in the next section, glycans on the surface of S-protein seem to have dual roles in the transitions, either helping or hindering the Down-to-Up transitions, which makes conformational sampling via MD simulations more difficult. However, conformational sampling using gREST_SSCR is much better than cMD without any pre-defined reaction coordinates and/or bias potentials, providing sufficient structural information to investigate the inherent flexibility of S-protein and the transition mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of flexible Down structures in the Down-to-Up transitions</title><p>In this study, we observed the inherent flexibility of S-protein in absence of its ligand, exploring Down, one-Up, one-Open, and two-Up-like structures at 310 K. The flexible nature of RBD forming multiple Down and Up conformations was also demonstrated in the cryo-EM study at physiological pH by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pramanick et al., 2021</xref>. The trimeric RBDs in S-protein are intrinsically flexible even in Down, as their interfaces are electrostatically repulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>). Not only symmetric structures but also anti-symmetric structures are also observed in Down, suggesting the existence of ‘flexible Down structure’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). This flexibility can initiate the Down-to-1Up transition, by allowing the transient reduction of inter-domain interactions in Down<sub>Sym</sub> and allowing the insertion of a glycan at N343<sub>B</sub> underneath RBD<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). This is consistent with the mobile RBD conformations in Down observed experimentally by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ke et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wrobel et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>Following the flexible Down structures, our simulations elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the Down-to-1Up transition involving RBD<sub>A</sub> and the 1Up-to-2Up transitions involving RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub>. This sequence of events can be explained via the changes of inter-domain interactions as well as protein-glycan interactions. As RBD<sub>A</sub>-RBD<sub>C</sub> interaction becomes stronger in the Down-to-1Up transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">8</xref>), RBD<sub>B</sub> becomes more mobile for the next 1Up-to-2Up transition. Among the inter-domain interactions, we pointed out the importance of transient salt-bridges and HBs between R408<sub>A</sub>-D405<sub>C</sub> and R408<sub>A</sub>-D406<sub>C</sub> for stabilizing the intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). The salt-bridge between R408<sub>A</sub> and D405<sub>C</sub> was also observed in the weighted ensemble simulations reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>. This scenario is mediated by protein-glycan interactions, in particular, those involving three glycans at N165<sub>B</sub>, N234<sub>B</sub>, and N343<sub>B</sub> as pointed out in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>). In the current study, we highlighted the dual roles of these three glycans: both to stabilize one of the states and to serve the driving force toward the other state. The glycan at N165 stabilizes Down, representing a barrier for the Down-to-1Up transition, while the glycan at N343<sub>B</sub> drives the transition. Finally, the glycan at N234<sub>B</sub> stabilizes one-Up-like conformation. This picture coincides with the experimental results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson et al., 2020b</xref>, where the population of one-Up is drastically reduced by the glycan deletions at N234 but increases by those at N165. As suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>), the glycans at N165 may also stabilize one-Up conformation but as a minor role because it can adapt various orientations to that conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>). The role of glycan at N343 is noteworthy in that it helps the position of RBD lift up from Down and supports it throughout the intermediates. This well explains the 20-fold reduction of the infectivity upon N343Q mutation observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2020</xref>. Recently, a similar role of the glycan at N343 has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>. Mutational studies of charged residues at the RBD interface (e.g. R408, D405, and D427) could validate the proposed role of the salt-bridge formation in the transition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implication for vaccine and drug developments</title><p>As a consequence of its central role, S-protein has been early identified as potential target for drug repurposing in order to block viral entry. Since the drug repurposing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakowski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deganutti et al., 2020</xref>) mostly target Down or Up from cryo-EM structures, druggable cryptic pockets identified in the intermediates would introduce unprecedented drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brotzakis et al., 2021</xref>). Two cryptic pockets at the RBD interface are identified in the highly populated intermediates along the Down-to-1Up transition. Both I2a and I3a show high stability on the FELs on PC1-PC2 and hinge-hinge angles as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">Figure 4—figure supplement 11</xref>. Notably, allosteric sites in intermediate structures were previously used for drug design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shukla et al., 2014</xref>). From our virtual screening of FDA approved molecules, these pockets are druggable and accommodates several small molecules including irinotecan, ergotamine, nilotinib, and ponatinib. For example, nilotinib was shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection by ~50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cagno et al., 2021</xref>), likely via blocking spike interactions with ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tsegay et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, top-ranked molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>) were also predicted to bind RBD in the previous virtual screening studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deganutti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>). If these bindings happen, the bound molecules at RBD interface could potentially stabilize the intermediate states and reduces the population of Up conformation, to block ACE2 binding. To shift the conformational equilibrium of S-protein toward the inaccessible Down state for blocking ACE2 and subsequent membrane fusion has been a focus of the recent challenges. Indeed, there have been some reports altering the conformational dynamics of S-protein either via site-specific mutations, disulfide bonds, and binding to small molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juraszek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henderson et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCallum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toelzer et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the promising outcome from shifting S-protein equilibrium, the high rate of mutations in spike might hinder its use as drug and antibodies target or even vaccine development. Indeed, continuous assessment of cryptic and epitope regions in spike variants is necessary.</p><p>The understanding of antibody responses is critical for vaccines and nAb developments. The large exposure of RBD<sub>A</sub> in Up forms is shown in the current study, which is consistent with several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grant et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sikora et al., 2021</xref>). In consistent with the conformation-dependent SASA variation reported in the previous cryo-EM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pramanick et al., 2021</xref>), we found that the accessibilities of RBM and the antibody epitopes, including mutational sites, depend sensitively on the RBD conformation. The result suggests that each of the Up conformations (1U, 1U<sub>O</sub>, and 2U<sub>L</sub>) tends to bind with distinct classes of antibodies. From our inspection, 1U<sub>O</sub>, which largely exposes RBM but the antibody epitopes of only Class I and II, is the potentially active conformation for both the ACE2 binding and evading from the antibody attack. Class I and II epitope regions include K417, E484, and N501, and their mutations could effectively enhance the infection either by enhancing the ACE2 binding (N501Y) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>) or reducing the antibody binding (K417N or E484K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, HB analysis shows that K417 and E484 respectively contribute to stabilize the intermediates likely enhancing the population of one-Up conformations. Note that L452 shows a little accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in contrast with the reported severe mutational effect to an antibody recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>). The similar observation was also reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Valdes-Balbin et al., 2021</xref>), while the recent simulation shows the possible interaction between L452 and an antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). A recent comparison of L452R cryo-EM structure with wild type suggested that R452 sterically hinders the nAbs bindings without affecting ACE2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCallum et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the Up conformations are reasonably aligned with the antibody-bound S-protein cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Hence, the antibody bindings of S-protein can be explained based on the conformer selection mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csermely et al., 2010</xref>). The exploration of conformational diversity of S-protein together with binding free-energy calculations followed by docking simulation would provide valuable structural insights with possible antibody bindings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ren et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we highlight the key differences between our simulations and other computational works on S-protein. Current work includes at least two unique features based on the simulation and analysis methods. First, our conformational sampling method, gREST, could avoid the use of pre-defined reaction coordinates and/or bias potentials along the coordinates. Therefore, the gREST simulation is able to generate unexpected structures or structural changes, which are free from the starting cryo-EM structures and the reaction coordinates in biased MD simulations. Two-Up-like structures, Down<sub>Asym</sub>, or 1U<sub>O</sub> were not expected even by us before the extensive gREST simulations and analysis. Since these unexpected structures involve novel molecular interactions, it is necessary to detect which interactions can stabilize the intermediate structures and to examine how the interactions are changed along the transition pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the HBs and contacts in each intermediate, systematically, and quantitatively (the second key feature). The changes of the atomistic interactions involving side chains and glycans could characterize the conformational transition pathways in atomic detail without using simplified reaction coordinates. To understand the effect of mutations in the conformational changes toward the active Up form, the difference of intrinsic flexibility between wild type and mutant S-protein is one of the most important features to be understood. The current simulation and analysis methods are applicable to new variants for giving atomistic pictures of conformational flexibility and transitions of spike proteins, which are both important for understanding the essential characters of new S-protein variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>gREST_SSCR simulations</title><p>The initial structures for S-protein head regions (residues 28–1135) were prepared based on the cryo-EM structures PDB:6VXX and PDB:6VYB for the Down and Up states, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walls et al., 2020</xref>).

The trimeric structure is divided into three regions, the head region which consists of S1 and part of S2 subunits (residues 1–1140), the heptad repeat 2/the transmembrane domain region (residues 1141–1234), and the cytoplasmic tail region (residues 1235–1273) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wrobel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, truncated structures of S-protein including S1 and part of the S2 subunits (residues 28–1135) were used in the simulations. Wherein the starting structure of the Down and Up conformations was based on the cryo-EM structures, PDB:6VXX and the PDB:6VYB, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). The 6VXX PDB structure includes multiple missing regions at the NTD (residues 70–79, 144–164, 173–185, and 246–262), the RBD (residues 445–446, 455–461, 469–488, and 502), and the S2 subunit (residues 621–640, 677–688, and 828–853). The 6VYB PDB structure has even more missing regions in the RBD with Up form and the adjacent NTD. Although higher resolution cryo-EM structures were deposited to the PDB later, only these two structures and PDB:6VSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>) were available when we started this study. Due to the large size and the presence of multiple missing regions, several modeling strategies were used to complete the structures. Wherein, residues 28–292 of NTD were modeled based on the SARS-CoV crystal structure (PDB:5 × 4S at 2.2 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>) using Modeller9.19 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>). Then part of the modeled region (residues 28–288) was inserted in the cryo-EM structure upon fitting the backbone of residues 263–290. Similarly, the crystal structure of the RBD domain (PDB:6LZG at 2.45 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) (residues 336–515) was inserted in the cryo-EM structures upon fitting the Cα atoms of residues 336–400. Both modeled NTD and RBD regions show a good alignment with the resolved regions in the 6VXX and 6VYB cryo-EM structures, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. The VMD program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) was used to superimpose the modeled regions into the cryo-EM structure. Finally, the missing regions in the S2 subunit were modeled as loop conformations using the top-ranked structure from Modeller9.19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCallum et al., 2020</xref>). A total of 13 disulfide bonds were included in each protomer including the original 12 disulfide bonds in the cryo-EM structure and one more in the RBD crystal structure. A comparison of our modeled structure and the more recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure (PDB:6ZGE at 2.6 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wrobel et al., 2020</xref>) shows a very good agreement, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

The total numbers of atoms in each model are 657,411, 654,427, and 654,494, respectively, with the average box lengths of 186.947, 186.452, and 186.475 Å after equilibration, respectively. Finally, the RBD/SD1 monomer models were made by truncating one protomer from the abovementioned Down and Up models, including residues 315–595 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Further details of gREST_SSCR simulations</title><p>We recently proposed an enhance sampling method, the generalized replica exchange with solute tempering of selected surface charged residue (gREST_SSCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dokainish and Sugita, 2021</xref>) to enhance large domain motions in multi-domain proteins. In this method the Coulomb and Lennard Jones parameters of surface charged residues at the domain interfaces are selected as a solute region in gREST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kamiya and Sugita, 2018</xref>). In this study, to enhance conformational dynamics of S-protein, we performed gREST_SSCR simulations, wherein charged residues at the interfaces between two RBD domains, between RBD and NTD, and between RBD and S2, were selected as the solute region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). In total, 16 residues in each protomer, consisting of 8 positive and 8 negative charged residues (870 atoms), were selected as solute in gREST: K113, K378, K386, R408, K417, K462, R466, R983, E132, E169, D198, D405, E406, D420, D428, and E471. We performed two sets of 100 ns cMD simulations from Down and Up cryo-EM conformations in the presence and absence of positional restraints on backbone atoms, respectively, and carried out a preliminary gREST simulation where all charged residues in one of RBDs were included in the solute region. H-bonding and contact analysis were performed to identify the abovementioned residues in the solute region. Some pairs (e.g. D428_R983) represented the native contacts observed in the restrained cMD simulations, Down<sub>Asym</sub> in the cMD simulation in the absence of restraints included the salt-bridge pair, K462_D198, and newly formed salt-bridge pairs (e.g. K378_D405) were found in the preliminary gREST simulation. In summary, we carefully selected essential charged residues from the cryo-EM structures, preliminary cMD and gREST simulations to accelerate large conformational changes of RBDs in S-protein. All simulations were performed using 16 replicas covering a solute temperature parameter range from 310.00 to 545.00 K while maintaining solvent temperature at 310.15 K in NVT ensemble. We carried out three gREST_SSCR simulations: two from Down in the presence (500 ns) and absence of glycans (150 ns), and one from Up (300 ns). The total simulation times correspond to 8, 4.8, and 2.4 µs in gREST_Down, gREST_Up, and gREST_Down w/o glycan, respectively.</p><p>All simulations were performed using the new version of GENESIS MD software that was optimized on Fugaku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jung et al., 2021</xref>). The overall performance of gREST_SSCR simulations using 16 replicas is 52 ns/day using 2048 nodes on Fugaku. CHARMM 36m force field was used for protein (C36m), carbohydrate, and ions, while CHARMM TIP3P was used as a water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guvench et al., 2011</xref>). gREST_SSCR simulations were performed after a series of equilibration steps. First modeled systems were minimized for 10,000 steps, while applying positional restraint on the backbone atoms. Second, using leap-frog integrator and the Langevin thermostat, we heated the simulation systems to 310.15 K in a stepwise manner for 100 ps. Third, a series of equilibration steps were performed: (1) MD simulations in the NVT ensemble using the velocity Verlet integrator with stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>).

(3) After removing all restraints, another MD simulation in the NPT ensemble was performed as equilibration using the same protocol.

(5) Prior to production run, a 2 ns equilibration was performed for 16 replicas. Production runs were then performed for 150, 500, and 300 ns per replica in gREST_Down w/o glycan, gREST_Down, and gREST_Up simulations, respectively.

Hinge and twist angles represent relative domain motions of RBD, wherein the hinge angle describes the Down/Up transition while the twist angle describes RBD side motion. The hinge angle is defined with three points, the center of mass of the Cα atoms in the SD1 core (residues 324–329, 531–590), the top residues of SD1 (residues 328, 329, 530, 531, 543, and 544), and the center of mass in the RBD core (residues 335–466 and 491–526). To define the twist angle, one more point was added at the lower part of RBD (residues 335, 336, 361, 362, 524, and 525). To examine the intra-domain stability, we computed the Cα atom RMSD of RBD (residues 333–528) and NTD (residues 28–306). The Cα RMSD of RBD and NTD upon fitting to their own structures at 310 K in gREST_Down reveal about 1.4 and 2.2 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a and b</xref>). They are comparable to those in the cMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mori et al., 2021</xref>) (1.4 and 1.6 Å for RBD and NTD, respectively). Slightly larger RMSD values of NTD in gREST_SSCR are attributed to the loop regions abundant in NTD, as indicated in root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5c and d</xref>). The Cα RMSD of the simulations’ representative structures (Down<sub>Sym</sub>, 1U, 1U<sub>O</sub>, and 2U<sub>L</sub>) were calculated with respect to cryo-EM structures using all three chains including 2766, 2884, 2450, and 2719 Cα atoms, respectively.

The cluster analysis was performed with the same fittings used in the RMSD analysis of RBD. Only the Cα atoms included in the original cryo-EM structures (PDB:6VXX and PDB:6VYB) were included to avoid flexible regions in our analysis. Furthermore, the distributions of hinge and twist angles for all the eight clusters were calculated for each protomer (in total, six angles) and subsequently the number of clusters was increased until the hinge/twist distribution showed the minimal overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More thorough discussion of the conformational transition pathways, including key intermediates and their structural stability.</p><p>2) More quantitative analysis of the key structural states identified in the study, evaluation of their potential accuracy, especially the intermediate states for which limited high-resolution information is available from experiments so far.</p><p>3) Considering the publication of several recent computational analyses of the same system, it would be important to further highlight the unique insights from the current analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Understanding the conformational dynamics of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can provide valuable guidance to the design of new antivirial drugs and vaccines. Previous computational studies employed either bias or enhanced sampling along specific structural variables, leading to incomplete understanding in the structural flexibility and conformational transition mechanisms. In this study, the authors take advantage of a newly developed enhanced sampling method (gREST_SSCR), which does not specify any biasing coordinates, to better characterize the structural ensemble of the spike protein. The results therefore complement previous simulations studies and enhance our understanding in the conformational flexibility and transition mechanism of the spike protein. For example, the simulations identified intermediate states that were observed in smFRET experiments but not in higher-resolution cryo-EM studies. The sampled conformational ensembles also revealed cryptic binding sites that potentially bind to drug molecules and binding interfaces of antibodies. The results will be instructive to the design of new approaches for battling this important pandemic.</p><p>While I find the simulations impressive and analyses rather comprehensive, I hope the authors would consider the following questions.</p><p>1. For comparing with the cryo-EM structures in Figure 2 – can the comparison be made more quantitative?</p><p>2. On the criterion for selecting the &quot;solute&quot; residues – it is understandable that charged residues at domain interfaces might be good choices since interactions involving them are likely to be reorganized during large-scale conformational transitions. Nevertheless, it will be useful to elaborate how the specific set of residues are chosen. For example, are they involved in different salt-bridge interactions in different conformational states identified in the cryo-EM structures?</p><p>3. Considering recent publications that also highlighted conformational flexibility of the spike protein, roles of glycan in modulating conformational flexibility/transition and binding interface with other proteins, and cryptic binding sites of small molecules, it would be important to clearly highlight how observations from the current work differ from these complementary computational efforts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Sugita and colleagues, the authors describe the results of extensive simulations of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. They used generalized replica exchange with solute tempering of selected surface charged residues (gREST_SSCR) to study the conformational changes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, specifically the up and down motion of the receptor binding domains (RBDs). They observed the Down, one-Up, one-Open and two-Up-like structures in their simulations, and compared them with the cryo-EM structures. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the RBD was measured at each of the above states to study the effect of different conformations for ACE2 and antibodies binding. They further used k-means clustering and re-clustering to obtain five main conformation ensembles, providing structural insight to a previous smFRET experiment and, more importantly, the transition pathway from the Down to one-Up state. The pathway was characterized by the analysis of contacts and hydrogen bonds. At the end, the authors applied P2Rank to search for the formation of druggable pockets in the intermediate structures.</p><p>Overall I found the simulation and analysis methods used in this study very impressive and the findings are important. However, I found the Results section of the manuscript to be rather confusing, making it difficult to capture the major findings of the studies until I read the Discussion section.</p><p>1) The definitions of the many different spike conformations throughout the manuscript were the most confusing part for me. The first four structures (D_sym, 1U, 1U_o, and 2U_L) are the most well defined, with their hingeA and hingeB value provided and a clear figure (Figure 2) showing their 3D structures as well as where they located in the PC space and Hinge angle space. However, things start getting murkier when it comes to the 5 ensembles (Down_sym, Down_like, Int2, Int3 and 1Up) found by k-means clustering. It was not discussed in the main text whether Down_sym is the same state as the D_sym state defined before, or how Down_like is different. It is also not clear what Int2 and Int3 states look like. Only a careful reader would find there are actually more than 5 clusters and their cluster centers can be interpreted from Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and they are grouped into 5 major conformations under the scheme from Figure 4—figure supplement 4e, and their respective distributions on the Hinge angle space was plotted at Figure 4—figure supplement 5. It is not helping that the authors go on referencing these minor clusters in the main text (one-Up-like, 1U_L and 1U_a in the main text, IUa, 2Ua_L, 2Ub_L in Figure 5) without providing their definitions. I believe such information is crucial for the reader to understand the second half of the manuscript, and I suggest the authors reorganize the figures to make the information clear and easy to access.</p><p>2) The second point I want to make goes hand-in-hand with the first point. I find the transition paths and the intermediate states to be the most interesting and novel findings of this work, yet the discussions on these findings are very brief in the manuscript. How does the hinge and twist angles change when you go from one state to another? What are the roles of the intermediate states (Int2 and Int3) in this opening of the RBD? I noticed in Figure 4—figure supplement 5(b) there is no arrow pointing from state I3b to 1U_L. Is I3b a trap state? How did the authors come to this conclusion? How does I3a differ from I3b? What about the one-Open state that the authors suggest to be important for binding? The discussion on the 1Up-to-2Up transition is equally brief. I believe these questions deserve a much longer discussion than a brief page-and-a-half skim over.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This article focuses on the varied conformations that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein takes and how this relates to the function of this protein and potential for drug targets. Extensive molecular simulations at the atomistic level were performed to provide details of the structural transitions of the spike protein and its protective sugar shield. Overall, this manuscript is a strong study on the spike structural states and transitions using enhanced molecular dynamics. This work clearly lays out details of transitions near the down and up states and how glycans can stabilize or alter conformational states and transitions. This work adds important details to the growing body of literature on the spike protein.</p><p>The main weakness in this work is the focus on intermediate structures in drug binding. Although this is an interesting idea, the details of the stability of the intermediate states are not described. Stability is key to stable for drug binding to deactivate the spike protein. It is unclear without more detail if these intermediate states are likely to be stable for drug binding and deactivation.</p><p>Author Recommendations (details):</p><p>1. Lack of details for intermediate states: I don't see analysis showing intermediate stability of I2a and I3a. How stable are these and where are they on the reduced free energy surface in Figure 1? Short-lived intermediates are not good targets for drugs. Figure 4 provides some details in the structure but no info on the free energy surface near the intermediates is provided and how this relates to stability.</p><p>2. Accuracy of intermediate state: How do you know these are accurate intermediate states? Any experimental comparison that would suggest these exist?</p><p>3. Is spike a good drug target?: The spike protein is certainly an important target for antibodies and vaccines. However, it may not be the best target toward drugs and a current FDA approved drug focuses on another part of the virus action. Some discussion on why the spike protein is believed to be a good target should be included in the manuscript.</p><p>4. Supporting figure format: I find it difficult to read and follow the format for the supporting figures that are tied to a main figure and not in a single pdf document.

Previous computational studies employed either bias or enhanced sampling along specific structural variables, leading to incomplete understanding in the structural flexibility and conformational transition mechanisms. In this study, the authors take advantage of a newly developed enhanced sampling method (gREST_SSCR), which does not specify any biasing coordinates, to better characterize the structural ensemble of the spike protein. The results therefore complement previous simulations studies and enhance our understanding in the conformational flexibility and transition mechanism of the spike protein. For example, the simulations identified intermediate states that were observed in smFRET experiments but not in higher-resolution cryo-EM studies. The sampled conformational ensembles also revealed cryptic binding sites that potentially bind to drug molecules and binding interfaces of antibodies. The results will be instructive to the design of new approaches for battling this important pandemic.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also happy to hear the positive comments of reviewer #1 about the public importance of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I find the simulations impressive and analyses rather comprehensive, I hope the authors would consider the following questions.</p><p>1. For comparing with the cryo-EM structures in Figure 2 – can the comparison be made more quantitative?</p></disp-quote><p>To compare the simulated structures with the cryo-EM structures more quantitatively, the Ca RMSD between them are computed. On page 6, lines 143-150 in the revised manuscript, we modified:</p><p>“They are superimposed to the cryo-EM structures having corresponding S-protein conformations in Figure 2d. Down<sub>Sym</sub> and 1U from our simulations are well aligned to the high-resolution cryoEM structures of Down (PDB:6ZGE<sup>16</sup> (RMSD: 3.7Å)) and one-Up (PDB:6XKL<sup>17</sup> (RMSD: 3.6Å)), respectively. Intriguingly, RBD<sub>A</sub> in 1U<sub>O</sub> is aligned to one of the RBDs in one of the three-Up structures (PDB:7DCC<sup>45</sup> (RMSD: 5.4 Å)). Although 2U<sub>L</sub> from our simulations remains some interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub>, which is completely lost in two-Up cryo-EM structures, 2U<sub>L</sub> is aligned with those in one of the two-Up structures (PDB:6X2B<sup>43</sup> (RMSD: 5.8 Å)). The overall comparison of the simulations’ structures to cryo-EM points out the quality of the predicted structures.”</p><p>On Page 21 and lines 522-525 in the revised manuscript, the following sentences of the analysis methods were added:</p><p>“The Ca RMSD of the simulations’ representative structures (Down<sub>Sym</sub>, 1U, 1U<sub>O</sub> and 2U<sub>L</sub>) were calculated with respect to cryo-EM structures using all three chains including 2766, 2884, 2450 and 2719 Ca atoms, respectively. Since 1U<sub>O</sub> is compared to three-Up cryo-EM structure, two RBDs with a down form were excluded in the RMSD calculation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. On the criterion for selecting the &quot;solute&quot; residues – it is understandable that charged residues at domain interfaces might be good choices since interactions involving them are likely to be reorganized during large-scale conformational transitions. Nevertheless, it will be useful to elaborate how the specific set of residues are chosen. For example, are they involved in different salt-bridge interactions in different conformational states identified in the cryo-EM structures?</p></disp-quote><p>The criterion for selecting charged residues “solute” were based on four preliminary cMD simulations of the Down and Up conformations, in the presence and absence of backbone restraints for 100 ns each. Contact and H-bonding analysis were performed to select salt bridge pairs from cMD simulations. This list was further refined based on the results of a preliminary gREST simulation where all charged residues in RBD<sub>B</sub> were included in the solute region. Finally, the solute list was based on comparing native contact in cryo-EM, cMD and gREST simulation. On page 19, line 474-482 in the revised manuscript, the following sentences were added:</p><p>“We performed two sets of 100ns cMD simulations from Down and Up cryo-EM conformations in the presence and absence of positional restraints on backbone atoms, respectively, and carried out a preliminary gREST simulation where all charged residues in one of RBDs was included in the solute region. H-bonding and contact analysis were performed to identify the above-mentioned residues in the solute region. Some pairs (e.g. D428_R983) represented the native contacts observed in the restrained cMD simulations, Down<sub>Asym</sub> in the cMD simulation in the absence of restraints included the salt-bridge pair, K462_D198, and newly formed salt-bridge pairs (e.g. K378_D405) were found in the preliminary gREST simulation. In summary, we carefully selected essential charged residues from the cryo-EM structures, preliminary cMD and gREST simulations to accelerate large conformational changes of RBDs in spike protein”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Considering recent publications that also highlighted conformational flexibility of the spike protein, roles of glycan in modulating conformational flexibility/transition and binding interface with other proteins, and cryptic binding sites of small molecules, it would be important to clearly highlight how observations from the current work differ from these complementary computational efforts.</p></disp-quote><p>We consider that our work has two unique features based on our simulation and analysis methods. gREST simulations could avoid the use of reaction coordinates or collective variables, which might limit the enhanced conformational sampling space to the limited one. Instead, gREST simulations where only the atomic interactions related to the selected solute region is scaled, include less biases in the simulation trajectories and allow us to observe unexpected conformational changes, such as two-Up RBD structures, Down<sub>Asym</sub>, etc. Due to their transient nature, these structures are difficult to be observed by conventional experiments and simulations.</p><p>The transient structures include novel interactions in a spike protein, which are not observed in cryo-EM structures. To clarify the atomic interactions in each intermediate or transient structures is important, while it was not analyzed in the previous computational works. Instead, we quantitatively analyzed hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts in the residues and glycans of intermediate structures observed in gREST, which allow us to define conformational transition pathways and understand molecular mechanisms for the transition in the atomic detail. In the end of Discussion, on page 15, lines 377-392, we added the following sentences:</p><p>“Finally, we highlight the key differences between our simulations and other computational works on spike protein. Current work includes at least two unique features based on the simulation and analysis methods. First, our conformational sampling method, gREST, could avoid the use of predefined reaction coordinates and/or bias potentials along the coordinates. Therefore, the gREST simulation is able to generate unexpected structures or structural changes, which are free from the starting cryo-EM structures and the reaction coordinates in biased MD simulations. Two-Up like structures, Down<sub>Asym</sub>, or 1U<sub>O</sub> were not expected even by us before the extensive gREST simulations and analysis. Since these unexpected structures involve novel molecular interactions, it is necessary to detect which interactions can stabilize the intermediate structures and to examine how the interactions are changed along the transition pathways. Therefore, we analyzed the hydrogen bonds and contacts in each intermediate, systematically, and quantitatively (the second key feature). The changes of the atomistic interactions involving side chains and glycans could characterize the conformational transition pathways in atomic detail without using simplified reaction coordinates. To understand the effect of mutations in the conformational changes toward the active Up form, the difference of intrinsic flexibility between wild type and mutant spike protein is one of the most important features to be understood. The current simulation and analysis methods are applicable to new variants for giving atomistic pictures of conformational flexibility and transitions of spike proteins, which are both important for understanding the essential characters of new spike protein variants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the manuscript by Sugita and colleagues, the authors describe the results of extensive simulations of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. They used generalized replica exchange with solute tempering of selected surface charged residues (gREST_SSCR) to study the conformational changes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, specifically the up and down motion of the receptor binding domains (RBDs). They observed the Down, one-Up, one-Open and two-Up-like structures in their simulations, and compared them with the cryo-EM structures. The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the RBD was measured at each of the above states to study the effect of different conformations for ACE2 and antibodies binding. They further used k-means clustering and re-clustering to obtain five main conformation ensembles, providing structural insight to a previous smFRET experiment and, more importantly, the transition pathway from the Down to one-Up state. The pathway was characterized by the analysis of contacts and hydrogen bonds. At the end, the authors applied P2Rank to search for the formation of druggable pockets in the intermediate structures.</p><p>Overall I found the simulation and analysis methods used in this study very impressive and the findings are important. However, I found the Results section of the manuscript to be rather confusing, making it difficult to capture the major findings of the studies until I read the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for giving us positive comments about our work. In the revised manuscript, we tried to explain our major findings as clear as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The definitions of the many different spike conformations throughout the manuscript were the most confusing part for me. The first four structures (D_sym, 1U, 1U_o, and 2U_L) are the most well defined, with their hingeA and hingeB value provided and a clear figure (Figure 2) showing their 3D structures as well as where they located in the PC space and Hinge angle space. However, things start getting murkier when it comes to the 5 ensembles (Down_sym, Down_like, Int2, Int3 and 1Up) found by k-means clustering. It was not discussed in the main text whether Down_sym is the same state as the D_sym state defined before, or how Down_like is different. It is also not clear what Int2 and Int3 states look like. Only a careful reader would find there are actually more than 5 clusters and their cluster centers can be interpreted from Figure 4—figure supplement 1, and they are grouped into 5 major conformations under the scheme from Figure 4—figure supplement 4e, and their respective distributions on the Hinge angle space was plotted at Figure 4—figure supplement 5. It is not helping that the authors go on referencing these minor clusters in the main text (one-Up-like, 1U_L and 1U_a in the main text, IUa, 2Ua_L, 2Ub_L in Figure 5) without providing their definitions. I believe such information is crucial for the reader to understand the second half of the manuscript, and I suggest the authors reorganize the figures to make the information clear and easy to access.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for making the reviewer being confused because of the lack of cluster definitions. In the revised manuscript, we added the cluster definitions and linked the macro-clusters with micro ones in Table 3 of the supplementary file 1C. Since D<sub>Sym</sub> is the same conformation as Down<sub>Sym</sub>, we changed all the D<sub>Sym</sub> to Down<sub>Sym</sub> in the revised manuscript. In the revised manuscript on page 8, lines 194-201, the following description was added:</p><p>“The 13 micro-clusters were identified from gREST_Down (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) including two clusters representing the symmetric Down (Down_sym: D1<sub>Sym</sub> and D2<sub>Sym</sub>), two clusters of asymmetric Down with differences in RBDs twist angle distribution (Down<sub>Asym</sub>: D1<sub>asym</sub> and D2<sub>asym</sub>), three clusters with a slight increase in the RBD hinge angle around 120°, (Int1: I1a, I1b and I1c), three clusters with one RBD hinge angle around 130° (Int2: I2a, I2b and I2c), two clusters with hinge angle around 140° (Int3: I3a and I3b), and one cluster with an Up-like conformation (1U<sub>L</sub>). Similarly, from gREST_Up, the 13 clusters were identified including ten clusters representing one-Up conformation (1U: 1Ua-1Uj), two clusters with two-Up like conformations (2U<sub>L</sub>: 2Ua<sub>L</sub> and 2Ub<sub>L</sub>) and one-Up open cluster (1U<sub>O</sub>).”</p><p>One page 9, lines 203-205 in the revised manuscript, we modified the sentence as follows:</p><p>By combining the distance distributions from gREST_Down and gREST_Up, we obtain five main conformational ensembles (Figure 4—figure supplement 4): Down symmetric (Down<sub>Sym</sub>), Down like (Down<sub>Like</sub>: Down<sub>Asym</sub> and Int1), two intermediates (Int2 and Int3), and Up (1Up).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second point I want to make goes hand-in-hand with the first point. I find the transition paths and the intermediate states to be the most interesting and novel findings of this work, yet the discussions on these findings are very brief in the manuscript. How does the hinge and twist angles change when you go from one state to another? What are the roles of the intermediate states (Int2 and Int3) in this opening of the RBD? I noticed in Figure 4—figure supplement 5(b) there is no arrow pointing from state I3b to 1U_L. Is I3b a trap state? How did the authors come to this conclusion? How does I3a differ from I3b? What about the one-Open state that the authors suggest to be important for binding? The discussion on the 1Up-to-2Up transition is equally brief. I believe these questions deserve a much longer discussion than a brief page-and-a-half skim over.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the important issues to clarify our key findings in the transition paths and intermediate states in the Down-to-1Up transition. To answer the questions raised by the reviewer #2, we added sentences in the section (On page 9, lines 215-231) in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“We next focus on molecular mechanisms underlying the Down-to-1Up transitions in terms of the correlated motions of the hinge and twist angles in the three RBDs (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). Note that such correlated motions are hardly obtained using targeted MD simulations (Figure 4—figure supplement 6) or the MD simulations enhanced with pre-defined reaction coordinates<sup>40, 48</sup>. Figure 4—figure supplement 5 indicates that the transition pathway from Down-to-1Up conformation occurs via four main states including two intermediates. First, the transition is initiated from flexible Down structures (Down<sub>Sym</sub> and Down<sub>Like</sub>), where three RBDs show high flexibilities reflected by a wide range of twist angle between 10° and 90° while RBD<sub>A</sub> maintains a hinge angle &lt; 125°. The increase in RBD<sub>A</sub> hinge angle to 130° in I2a is accompanied by the reduction in other RBDs flexibility. It is reflected by smaller changes in twist and hinge angles for the chains B and C. Later, two main pathways are identified through I3a or I3b (hinge 140°), however comparisons of all five free energy maps as well as the projection on PC1-PC2 free-energy surface suggest that 13b is an off-target intermediate. In I3a, both hinge and twist angles are increased in RBD<sub>A</sub>, accompanied by a slight reduction in RBD<sub>C</sub> hinge angle. Both I2a and I3a represent stable basins along the free-energy landscapes along the PC1-PC2 and Hinge-Twist angles, emphasizing their role in mediating the transition (Figure 4—figure supplement 5 and 11). Lastly, 1U<sub>L</sub> conformation is formed with hinge angle &gt; 150° with a concomitant increase in its twist angle. In general, Hinge<sub>A</sub> and Twist<sub>A</sub> are highly correlated (cc: 0.94) with each other (Figure 4—figure supplement 5c), while Hinge<sub>A</sub> and Hinge<sub>B</sub> show no correlations (cc: 0.02). The correlations between Hinge<sub>Å</sub> and Hinge<sub>C</sub>/Twist<sub>C</sub> exist to some extent (cc: -0.68 and 0.30).”</p><p>A new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 11) was added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The 1Up-2Up transition pathway was also further discussed</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed the 1Up-2Up transition pathways more carefully on page 10 lines 242-254 in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The formation of two Up-like conformation is characterized by the increase of Hinge/Twist angle in RBD<sub>B,</sub> as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 7c. FEL on Hinge<sub>A</sub>-Twist<sub>A</sub> angles shows a similar transition as observed in RBD<sub>A</sub> in gREST_Down (Figure 1—figure supplement 7c and 6d). The relative RBD motions during the 1Up-to-2Up transition is characterized using the hinge angles (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a). The increase of hinge angle in RBD<sub>B</sub> is accompanied with a slight decrease of hinge angle in RBD<sub>A</sub> in 2Ua<sub>L</sub> and subsequently in 2Ub<sub>L</sub>. Note that both clusters might represent intermediate states toward the full 2Up structure, in which the increase of RBD<sub>A</sub> hinge angle is regained. The latter decrease likely relates with the increases of the contacts and HBs between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>C</sub>, for instance, K378<sub>A</sub>-E484<sub>C</sub>, Y369<sub>A</sub>-N487<sub>C</sub> and D427<sub>A</sub>-Y505<sub>C</sub>, from 1Ua, the top populated cluster in 1U, to 2U<sub>L</sub> structures (Figure 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 7 and 8). The numbers of contacts and HBs in two-Up-like structures are much less than those in 1Ua, suggesting that a drastic reduction of the inter-domain interactions between RBD<sub>A</sub> and RBD<sub>B</sub> is required to form a full two-Up conformations. No specific protein-glycan interactions are found to support the 1Up-to-2Up transition, while more contacts between RBD<sub>B</sub> and glycan at N165<sub>C</sub> are observed in the two-Up-like conformations, emphasizing its role as a bottleneck of the transition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This article focuses on the varied conformations that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein takes and how this relates to the function of this protein and potential for drug targets.

Overall, this manuscript is a strong study on the spike structural states and transitions using enhanced molecular dynamics.

Accuracy of intermediate state: How do you know these are accurate intermediate states? Any experimental comparison that would suggest these exist?</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned, any intermediate states have transient nature compared to the stable cryo-EM structures, such as Down or 1Up forms. Therefore, it is difficult for us to compare all the intermediate structures found in the simulations with experimental results in the atomic detail.

Is spike a good drug target?: The spike protein is certainly an important target for antibodies and vaccines.
