the synaptic basal lamina contains different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and synaptogenic factors that induce and maintain synaptic specializations. Here, we report that podosome-like structures (PLSs) induced by ubiquitous ECM proteins regulate the formation and remodeling of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters via focal ECM degradation. Mechanistically, ECM degradation is mediated by PLS-directed trafficking and surface insertion of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) to AChR clusters through microtubule-capturing mechanisms. Upon synaptic induction, MT1-MMP plays a crucial role in the recruitment of aneural AChR clusters for the assembly of postsynaptic specializations. Lastly, the structural defects of NMJs in embryonic MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice further demonstrate the physiological role of MT1-MMP in normal NMJ development. Collectively, this study suggests that postsynaptic MT1-MMP serves as a molecular switch to synaptogenesis by modulating local ECM environment for the deposition of synaptogenic signals that regulate postsynaptic differentiation at developing NMJs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Voluntary movement relies on skeletal muscle cells and nerve cells being able to communicate with one another. This communication occurs at a specialized region called the neuromuscular junction, or NMJ for short. These junctions are surrounded by a meshwork of proteins, known as the matrix, which structurally supports the nerve and muscle cells.</p><p>Muscle cells contain proteins called acetylcholine receptors on their cell surface. When these receptors cluster together at the NMJ, this allows nerve cells to communicate with the muscle cell and tell the muscle to contract. However, these clusters can also form spontaneously without the help of nerve cells at regions away from the communication site. Alongside these spontaneous clusters of acetylcholine receptors are dynamic actin-enriched structures. These structures are responsible for releasing enzymes that digest the surrounding matrix and are commonly found in migrating cells. But as skeletal muscle cells do not migrate, it remained unclear what purpose these structures serve at the NMJ.</p><p>Now, Chan et al. have used advanced microscopy techniques to show how these actin-enriched structures can help acetylcholine receptors cluster together at the site of communication between the nerve and muscle cells. The experiments showed that these structures direct a molecule called MT1-MMP to the muscle surface. This molecule then clears the surrounding matrix so that signals sent from the nerve can be effectively deposited at the narrow space between these two cells. When the muscle cells receive this initiating signal, acetylcholine receptors are recruited from the spontaneously formed clusters to the communication site, allowing the muscle to contract. When MT1-MMP was experimentally eliminated in mice, this disrupted the recruitment of acetylcholine receptors to the NMJ.</p><p>Overall, these experiments help researchers understand how clearing the matrix between nerve and muscle cells contributes to the deposition of factors that build the communication site at developing NMJs. In the future this might help develop treatments for movement disorders caused by abnormalities that affect the clearing of matrix proteins in these junctions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine receptor</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix protein</kwd><kwd>podosome</kwd><kwd>membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>27102316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi Wai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>04151086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi Wai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17100718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi Wai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17100219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Chi Wai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Postsynaptic MT1-MMP serves as a molecular switch to synaptogenesis by clearing the surrounding ECM environment that allows effective deposition of nerve-derived synaptogenic factors to induce postsynaptic differentiation at developing NMJs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-cell communication in the nervous system occurs at specialized structures called synapses, where nerve signals propagate from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic target cell. The postsynaptic apparatus containing a high density of neurotransmitter receptors represents an important feature of chemical synapses. In the past decades, tremendous effort has been made in understanding how the synthesis, trafficking, localization, and clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at the postsynaptic sites regulate synaptic formation, function, and plasticity in both central and peripheral synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanes and Lichtman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song and Huganir, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Many of those studies were performed using the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a simple peripheral chemical synapse. At the postsynaptic apparatus of NMJs, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) molecules are clustered at a nearly crystalline density of ~10,000 receptors/μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fertuck and Salpeter, 1976</xref>); in contrast, its density drops drastically to &lt;10 receptors/μm<sup>2</sup> at the extra-synaptic regions. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of densely clustered AChR molecules at the postsynaptic apparatus are not fully understood.</p><p>Previous knockout studies showed that even in the absence of motor neurons, AChR clusters can still be found in muscle fibers in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that such AChR pre-patterns are spontaneously formed via muscle-intrinsic mechanisms. Interestingly, a similar structure of aneural AChR clusters can be induced in <italic>Xenopus</italic> primary muscles or immortalized C2C12 myotubes by culturing them on substratum coated with laminin, a major structural glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). These aneural AChR clusters, located at the bottom surface of cultured muscles in direct contact with ECM proteins, may undergo topological transformation, which is mirrored by the progressive structural changes in synaptic AChR clusters during NMJ maturation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>). Our previous work showed that actin-rich structures are highly concentrated at the perforated regions of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). These structures were later shown to share the typical characteristics of podosome-like structures (PLSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Proszynski et al., 2009</xref>). PLSs, initially identified as dynamic foot-like structures in motile or invasive cells, have been linked to pathophysiological processes such as cancer cell invasion and metastasis via local proteolysis of ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linder, 2007</xref>). It is worth to note that a small proportion of aneural AChR clusters can also be identified at the top surface of cultured muscles, and these spontaneously formed clusters are likely mediated through ECM- and PLS-independent mechanisms. At the NMJ, the exact functions of synaptic PLSs in regulating AChR cluster formation and remodeling remain largely unclear. In this study, we show that the assembly of PLSs, which can be induced by different ECM proteins, focally regulates matrix degradation for AChR clustering and topological remodeling. Next, we further demonstrate that intracellular trafficking and surface insertion of membrane-type 1 (MT1-) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are mediated via microtubule-capturing mechanisms at PLSs, which in turn spatiotemporally regulate the topological remodeling of aneural AChR clusters and their dispersal upon synaptic induction. Inhibition of MMP activity or reduced expression of muscle MT1-MMP greatly suppresses nerve-induced AChR cluster formation and stabilizes aneural AChR clusters against dispersal. Lastly, we show that MT1-MMP is required for the recruitment of AChR molecules from aneural to synaptic AChR clusters at developing NMJs in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, this study revealed the significance of PLS-directed MT1-MMP trafficking and surface insertion in modulating the assembly and topological remodeling of AChR clusters via focal matrix degradation at developing neuromuscular synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Topologically complex structures of PLS-associated aneural AChR clusters can be induced by different ECM proteins</title><p>When dissociated myotomal tissues from early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos were cultured on glass coverslips coated with a mixture of ECM proteins, containing entactin/nidogen, collagen and laminin (ECL), topologically complex aneural AChR clusters were observed mostly on the bottom surface of muscle cells in contact with ECL-coated substratum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Some aneural AChR clusters could also be found within the top surface of muscle cells but exhibited a sparsely scattered morphology. To further identify if specific ECM proteins are required for the formation of these topologically complex AChR clusters, we tested several key ECM proteins individually, including laminin, collagen, and gelatin, for their ability to induce AChR cluster formation in cultured <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cells. We found that the formation of bottom AChR clusters could be effectively induced by all ECM proteins tested, in contrast to the negative control using poly-D-lysine (PDL), a polypeptide commonly used to promote cell attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In immortalized C2C12 myotubes, aneural AChR clusters can undergo a topological transformation from a plaque to a perforated pretzel-shaped, and eventually to C-shaped arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, we further classified the aneural AChR clusters in <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cultures into scattered, plaque, perforated, and C-shaped based on their morphological features. A majority of ECM-induced aneural AChR clusters exhibited perforated structures. While the percentage of muscle cells with AChR clusters was largely reduced on PDL-coated substrate, the largest share of AChR clusters exhibited scattered structures (9.59% out of 13.33% total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), similar to those structures found on the top muscle surface. As opposed to a previous study showing the topological transformation of AChR clusters in C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>), most AChR clusters, regardless of their topological features, were gradually dispersed over 6 days in cultured <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our previous study indicated that actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin, one of the molecular components in PLSs, regulates the formation and maintenance of AChR clusters via vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we further performed immunostaining of several typical core markers (composed of F-actin and actin-associated proteins, such as ADF/cofilin, Arp2/3 complex, and cortactin) and cortex markers (composed of adhesion molecules, such as vinculin, talin, and paxillin) of PLSs. All these markers were found to be enriched in the perforations (arrows) of AChR clusters in <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As cortactin is highly enriched and involved in both early and late stages of PLS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Webb et al., 2006</xref>), we then used cortactin as an indicator of PLS localization in AChR clusters. PLSs were spatially concentrated in a majority of perforated AChR clusters induced by different ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). In contrast, PLSs were not localized in AChR clusters, even in a small fraction of AChR clusters (2.16% out of 13.33% total) exhibiting perforated structures, on PDL substrates. These data suggest that different ECM proteins can induce the assembly of PLSs, which may in turn promote the formation of topologically complex structures of AChR clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MMP-mediated ECM degradation regulates topological remodeling of aneural AChR clusters</title><p>The data above showed that perforated AChR clusters can be effectively induced by gelatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), an ECM protein that was previously shown to induce simple AChR plaques only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kummer et al., 2004</xref>). This novel finding prompted us to adopt the well-established fluorescent gelatin degradation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Starnes et al., 2011</xref>) to investigate the possible association between matrix degradation and PLS localization in AChR clusters. After plating the muscle cells on FITC-gelatin-coated substratum, confocal microscopy was performed to visualize the extent of gelatin degradation in 3 day old live <italic>Xenopus</italic> primary muscle cells. We observed FITC-gelatin that was extensively degraded in close association with the perforated regions of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we quantitatively measured the fluorescence intensity of FITC-gelatin in different AChR clusters and identified a linear relationship between the extent of gelatin degradation and the perforation area of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar spatially restricted gelatin degradation pattern was observed in cultured C2C12 myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To further explore if MMP activity regulates the topological remodeling of AChR clusters, we performed time-lapse imaging to monitor the dynamic changes in AChR cluster morphology and intensity in response to BB-94 treatment. AChR clusters were first labeled with fluorescent α-bungarotoxin (0 hr), then they were monitored for 96 hr after treatment. In control untreated cells, we observed a gradual dispersal of aneural AChR clusters over the 96 hr imaging period; however, such spontaneous dispersal and topological remodeling of AChR clusters were largely inhibited by BB-94 treatment within the same imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>).

In the control cell, the peaks of EB1-GFP intensity showed a slight lateral shift towards the center of a perforated region (Top chart, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating the preferential enrichment of EB1-GFP at the edge of perforations.

Together with the above data showing the local capture of EB1-GFP comets, this data further confirmed that vesicular trafficking and surface targeting of MT1-MMP are spatially regulated by PLS cortex proteins at the perforation and periphery of AChR clusters through EB1-/CLASP-mediated microtubule capturing mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Pharmacological inhibition of MMP activity suppresses the assembly of synaptic AChR clusters and the disassembly of aneural AChR clusters</title><p>To understand the functional role of PLS-associated MMP activity at developing NMJs, we first examined the effects of MMP inhibitors on ECM degradation and synaptic AChR clustering in <italic>Xenopus</italic> nerve-muscle co-cultures. Along the trail of neurites in contact with the basal membrane of muscle cells (arrows), we observed spatial degradation of fluorescent gelatin-coated substratum and synaptic AChR clustering at the nerve-muscle contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Like the focal gelatin degradation patterns observed in AChR-poor regions of aneural clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), synaptic AChR clusters at the nerve-muscle contacts were found to be closely associated to, but not perfectly co-localized with, the sites of gelatin degradation, with only 17.15 ± 15% of area in AChR clusters to be associated with gelatin degradation in control co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, both gelatin degradation and nerve-induced AChR clustering were effectively inhibited by BB-94 or BB-2516 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Nerve innervation of skeletal muscles involves local signals to initiate the formation of synaptic AChR clusters and global signals to induce the dispersal of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai and Peng, 1998</xref>). Thus, we further examined the involvement of MMP activity in the dispersal of aneural AChR clusters induced by latex beads coated with agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that induces postsynaptic differentiation. Local application of agrin-coated beads to cultured muscle cells is capable of inducing postsynaptic differentiation in a spatiotemporally controllable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). In control cells, we detected a gradual dispersal of aneural AChR clusters upon agrin-bead stimulation for 24 hr; however, those clusters in agrin bead-contacted muscle cells were greatly stabilized by BB-94 or BB-2516 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Therefore, we further developed an ‘endogenous agrin track’ assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), by which we examined the effects of MMP inhibitors on synaptic AChR clustering in muscle cells cultured on ECL-coated substratum with endogenous agrin tracks.

In this study, we showed that the formation of topologically complex aneural AChR clusters in <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cells requires several key ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As ECM proteins can be secreted and deposited by skeletal myofibers and other different cell types that constitute the synaptic basal lamina at developing NMJs, the initial formation of AChR clusters may not be solely mediated by muscle-intrinsic mechanisms.</p><p>The synaptic basal lamina is unique in composition, containing factors capable of inducing the assembly of synaptic specializations in both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, such as laminin-421, collagen IV/VI/XIII, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (e.g. agrin and perlecan), and other ubiquitously expressed ECM proteins (e.g. laminin-111, fibronectin and entactin/nidogen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cescon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Latvanlehto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Singhal and Martin, 2011</xref>). Among the different factors in the synaptic basal lamina, agrin plays the central role in the formation of postsynaptic specializations by activating the Lrp4/MuSK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we observed extensive degradation of ubiquitously expressed ECM proteins, including gelatin and laminin-111, at AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). A previous study suggested that MMP-3 is implicated for the removal of agrin from synaptic basal lamina at adult NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">VanSaun and Werle, 2000</xref>). In this study, however, the pattern and intensity of endogenous agrin tracks were largely unaffected by MMP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), ruling out the possible proteolytic degradation of secreted agrin by MT1-MMP activity at developing NMJs. Therefore, we hypothesize that PLS-associated MMP activity focally degrades different ubiquitously expressed ECM proteins, which clear the zone at the nascent synaptic basal lamina for the deposition of other secreted synaptogenic factors (e.g. agrin or neuregulin) and/or dismantle the extracellular anchorage of AChR molecules on ECM proteins that allow aneural clusters to undergo dispersal and re-distribution upon nerve induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).

We detected several typical core and cortex markers of PLSs that were highly concentrated at perforated AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), further confirming the presence of PLSs in primary myotomal muscle cultures. Intriguingly, PLS cortex proteins, like vinculin and talin, were enriched not only at the perforated regions, but also at the periphery, of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). At those sites, some MT1-MMP-mCherry signals were captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), and some MT1-MMP-pHluorin signals were spatially recovered after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These data suggested that PLS cortex proteins may capture MT1-MMP-containing vesicles and facilitate their surface insertion at the perforation and periphery of AChR clusters. It is important to note that both signals of MT1-MMP immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and MT1-MMP-mCherry overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were not selectively localized to aneural AChR clusters, as both surface and intracellular MT1-MMP at the vesicular compartments were highlighted. In contrast, the localization patterns of MT1-MMP-pHluroin at a low expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and fluorescent gelatin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) were primarily restricted to the perforated AChR clusters. These results suggested that the vesicular trafficking and surface insertion of MT1-MMP is precisely controlled to mediate ECM degradation during NMJ formation.</p><p>Microtubules are important cytoskeletal structures for intracellular transport of proteins. EB1, a key regulator of the plus-end-tracking protein complex, functions to modulate microtubule dynamics and interaction with other intracellular organelles. Although endogenous EB1 comets can be found in the entire cell, they are highly enriched at the sites specialized for efficient coordination of cargo transport and release, such as focal adhesions and NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Noordstra and Akhmanova, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). Direct interactions between EB1 and other microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (CLASPs and CLIP-170) are implicated in the ‘recruitment mechanism’, by which EB1 functions to search-and-capture post-Golgi vesicles and to spatially capture microtubules at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vaughan, 2005</xref>). LL5β, one of the PLS cortex proteins, is localized at the postsynaptic membrane to serve as a corral for AChRs within the clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kishi et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, LL5β and CLASP1 interact with microtubules for directing the vesicular trafficking of different proteins to the postsynaptic membrane of NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2015</xref>) and to the focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stehbens et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, antisense MO-mediated knockdown of endogenous <italic>Xenopus</italic> CLASP, the homolog of mammalian CLASP1, in cultured muscle cells significantly reduced the local capture of microtubules at AChR clusters, as reflected by the increased average speed of EB1-GFP comets within AChR regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It was also noted that microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins are capable to hop on and off from microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dragestein et al., 2008</xref>), thus we cannot exclude the possibility of EB1-GFP signal recovery at the photobleached region that may be partly contributed by the exchange of EB1-GFP molecules between the free and microtubule-bound pools. Given that MT1-MMP surface insertion at aneural AChR clusters was significantly inhibited in CLASP-MO muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), we therefore hypothesize that EB1-mediated microtubule capturing mechanisms can be regulated by PLSs at both cortex (adhesion molecule-based) and core (actin-based) domains via CLASP-dependent and -independent manner respectively, which is in agreement with other previous studies demonstrating the involvement of microtubule-dependent vesicular transport in AChR clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marchand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has long been suggested that innervation of the skeletal muscle involves local signaling to initiate the formation of synaptic AChR clusters at the nerve-muscle contacts, and global signaling to induce the dispersal of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai and Peng, 1998</xref>). However, a compelling evidence supporting that aneural AChR clusters serve as source for synaptic AChR clusters at developing NMJs is still lacking. In this study, we used laser-based photobleaching approach to demonstrate the differential contribution of AChR molecules from aneural clusters and diffuse AChRs for the assembly of nerve-induced synaptic AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Cohen, 1977a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 1987</xref>), most nerve contacts in <italic>Xenopus</italic> primary cultures are located at either the basal surface or the lateral side of muscle cells, which are influenced by MMP-mediated proteolytic degradation of ECM proteins. Importantly, we demonstrated that the recruitment of AChRs from aneural clusters, but not diffuse AChRs, is mediated by MT1-MMP-dependent processes. While MT1-MMP knockdown caused a significant inhibition in synaptic AChR clustering at the nerve-muscle contacts, it is intriguing to note that diffuse AChRs were constantly recruited to aneural AChR clusters that were stabilized by MT1-MMP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This recruitment may be mediated by the diffusion-trap mechanism, in which diffuse AChRs can be tethered to molecular scaffolds associated with the stable aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geng et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that MT1-MMP facilitates the disassembly of extracellular (e.g. ECM proteins) and/or intracellular (e.g. cytoskeletal proteins) molecular scaffolds that are tightly associated with aneural AChR clusters, such that AChR molecules from dispersing aneural clusters can be recruited to synaptic clusters in response to nerve induction. In a minority of cases, some aneural and nerve-induced AChR clusters can be found at the top muscle surface, where no ECM proteins are directly involved. Particularly, those top aneural AChR clusters are spontaneously formed with possibly no physiological relevance, whether MT1-MMP regulates the formation and remodeling of ECM-independent top AChR clusters remains unknown. Collectively, our present study further supported that postsynaptic MT1-MMP plays a dual-functional role in regulating the formation and dispersal of synaptic and aneural AChR clusters, respectively, via focal ECM degradation.</p><p>MT1-MMP is the best characterized and the most prevalent isoform of the large MMP family, including membrane-type or soluble MMPs. MT1-MMP deficiency causes myogenic impediments and central nucleation of myofibers, which are typically found in muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohtake et al., 2006</xref>). Besides, MT1-MMP knockout mice develop multiple abnormalities and die between 50–90 postnatal days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holmbeck et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting that the possibility of functional redundancy by other MMP isoforms is low. In this study, we used mutant mice lacking MT1-MMP in all cells and observed that the density of aneural AChR clusters was significantly higher than that in wild-type mice at E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), consistent with the in vitro findings on the involvement of MT1-MMP in the recruitment of AChR molecules from aneural to synaptic AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, at E18.5, the density of aneural AChR clusters between MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type mice was comparable. While aneural AChR clusters in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice were not recruited to synaptic AChR clusters, they were subjected to the regular metabolic turnover/degradation, leading to the disappearance of aneural AChR clusters at E18.5. This is supported by previous studies showing that the half-life of extra-synaptic AChRs is only about 19 hr, compared with 8–14 days for synaptic AChRs at mature NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Huang, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steinbach et al., 1979</xref>). On the other hand, reduced synaptic AChR density in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>) is attributed by (1) significantly declined recruitment of AChR molecules from aneural clusters, and (2) reduced amount of newly inserted AChRs into the postsynaptic regions. These data provided a solid validation of our in vitro findings that demonstrate the important role of MT1-MMP in regulating the recruitment of pre-existing and newly inserted AChRs to the nerve-muscle contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It is also important to note that the phrenic nerve in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed a significant reduction of axonal growth and arborization in the diaphragm muscles at both E13.5 and E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>). This phenotype on defects in axonal growth could be explained by the retrograde signaling initiated by postsynaptic MT1-MMP, which could mediate the extracellular cleavage of Lrp4 to generate ecto-Lrp4 fragments that activate agrin signaling in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, Lrp4 is also considered as a retrograde signal to induce presynaptic differentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yumoto et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, postsynaptic MT1-MMP could also mediate the proteolytic conversion of proBDNF to mature BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Je et al., 2012</xref>) that promotes neuronal survival and outgrowth in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, by using the whole-body MT1-MMP knockout mice in the present study, we cannot rule out the possible secondary effects on postsynaptic AChR clustering and remodeling that are contributed by the axonal growth and presynaptic differentiation defects in the absence of neuronal MT1-MMP. Therefore, our future studies plan to develop muscle-specific inducible MT1-MMP knockout animal models to further understand how muscle MT1-MMP controls the formation and maturation of NMJs in vivo. Particularly, it would be of great interest to address whether synaptic maturation, as reflected by the plaque-to-pretzel topological transition of AChR clusters during the early postnatal stages in mice, is critically driven by neuronal or muscle MT1-MMP.</p><p>From a clinical perspective, increased serum levels of several MMPs have been identified in patients with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helgeland et al., 2011</xref>). As inhibiting MMP activity could greatly stabilize aneural AChR clusters against spontaneous and nerve-induced dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), it would be interesting to test if manipulating muscle MT1-MMP expression level or its activity can suppress the pathogenic action in causing NMJ disassembly using our recently established <italic>Xenopus</italic> cell-based assay for investigating the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yeo et al., 2015</xref>). Given the physiological and pathophysiological roles of MMPs at the NMJs, understanding the cell biology of MT1-MMP trafficking and surface delivery in this study may provide additional insight into the regulation of synaptic function and dysfunction by modulating MMP trafficking and activity in neuromuscular development and diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After anesthesia, the left sciatic nerve was exposed with a lateral longitudinal straight incision from the greater trochanter to mid-thigh, and then by blunt dissection between the quadriceps femoris and biceps femoris. After clearing the surrounding connective tissues, the left sciatic nerve was cut with scissors. A sham operation was performed, where the sciatic nerve was exposed, and then the skin was closed immediately afterwards.

The number of aneural AChR cluster was then calculated by subtracting the number of nerve-induced synaptic AChR clusters from the total number of AChR clusters. The calculated numbers were then normalized to the length of the main nerve trunk. Endplate band width was defined by the average distance between two farthest AChR clusters in the muscle fibers along the main nerve trunk.

metalloprotease, MT1-MMP, in regulating AChR organization at the NMJ. Using mostly the <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cultures and fluorescence imaging, the authors show that PLS targets MT1-MMP to the membrane surface via the microtubule capturing mechanism involving EB1 and CLASP; subsequently, local ECM remodelling disperses aneural AChR clusters which then act as a source for synaptic AChR clusters. Nerve-muscle co-cultures are also used to explore the effects of interfering with MT1-MMP activity on agrin and nerve-induced AChR cluster formation. Notably, the loss of MT1-MMP activity compromises synaptic AChR cluster formation in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, the findings highlight the crucial role for MT1-MMP in ECM remodeling and AChR re-organization and the underlying cellular and molecular events at the developing NMJ.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Podosome-directed MT1-MMP trafficking and surface insertion regulate AChR clustering and remodeling at developing NMJs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Colin Adrain (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, at least in its present form. If you disagree that the further experiments requested here are valuable/necessary, we expect that you will take this work to another journal at this time. If you agree with the general thrust of the reviewers' comments and should decide to do further experimental work, we would be open to receiving a new submission with that work, assuming it is responsive to this critique.</p><p>The reviewers have acknowledged the importance of the topic and the extensive amount of work involving expert cell biological analyses. However, all three reviewers have pointed out some shortcomings of the study, especially the lack of compelling experimental evidence for the main conclusion that the AChRs dispersed from aneural clusters serve as the source of synaptic AChR clusters at the NMJ. In addition, the majority of experiments rely on overexpression of MT1-MMP-mCherry, and MT1-MMP is not necessarily selectively targeted to perforations within AChR clusters that raises questions about the model. Finally, mouse experiments using MT1-MMP KO animals are elegant, yet they highlight the possible presynaptic role for MT1-MMP that warrants further clarifications. We hope you will find the reviewer comments appended below to be constructive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Here Chan et al. set out to determine the function of actin-enriched podosome-like structures (PLS) at the NMJ regulating AChR organization. Using mostly the <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cultures and fluorescence imaging, the authors perform experiments to conclude that PLS targets MT1-MMP to the membrane surface via the microtubule capturing mechanism involving EB1 and CLASP, which then locally remodels the ECM to disperse aneural AChR clusters. Nerve-muscle cocultures are also used to explore the effects of interfering with MT1-MMP activity on agrin and nerve-induced AChR cluster formation. Collectively, the findings highlight the crucial role for ECM remodeling in AChR organization, and notably, the loss of MT1-MMP activity compromises synaptic AChR cluster formation in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, the manuscript is disjointed between characterizations of aneural AChR remodeling and synaptic AChR remodeling in the presence of motoneurons, where most of the effort is spent on the former, and it remains unclear if dispersed aneural AChR serves as a source for synaptic AChRs. Moreover, the logical flow of the proposed events is not necessarily consistent with the data shown, and there are tendencies for over-interpretation of data. Collectively, these issues reduce the overall impact of the present findings.</p><p>1) Results, subsection “Topologically Complex Structures of PLS-Associated Aneural AChR Clusters Can Be Induced by Different ECM Proteins”. &quot;These data suggested that different ECM proteins can induce the assembly of PLSs, which in turn regulates the formation and/or remodeling of topologically complex structures of AChR clusters&quot;: Only the first half of the statement is supported by the data shown.</p><p>2) Figure 2. One should clarify whether block of MMP affects the formation of perforated AChR clusters in any way. Especially with respect to panel G, it is not clear whether the total number of AChR cluster changes over time in control and how this is changed in the presence of MMP inhibitors. In addition to% muscle cells with AChR clusters, one should determine the changes in the number of AChR clusters to demonstrate whether MMP activity is restricted to remodeling of preformed AChR clusters or whether it affects new AChR cluster formation.</p><p>3) Results, subsection “MMP-Mediated ECM Degradation Regulates Topological Remodeling of Aneural AChR Clusters”. &quot;These data demonstrated that MMP activity is required for the topological remodeling and dispersal of aneural AChR clusters&quot;. This statement is not fully substantiated by the data shown as Figure 2I illustrates that some degree of remodeling does seem to occur even in the presence of BB-94 for most of the experiments.</p><p>4) Figure 3A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. MT1-MMP is not necessarily selectively targeted to perforations within AChR clusters. Also, hotspots of endogenous EB1 are also not necessarily restricted to areas of perforated AChR clusters.</p><p>5) Results, subsection “MT1-MMP Activity Precisely Controls the Extent of ECM Degradation and AChR Cluster Formation”. &quot;[…] MT1-MMP-mCherry overexpressing cells showed a higher percentage of top AChR clusters at the expense of ECM-induced bottom AChR clusters […]&quot;. The claim that the increase in the proportion of muscle cells that show top AChR clusters occurred &quot;at the expense of bottom AChR clusters&quot; is an overinterpretation of the data. Unless one knows the absolute numbers, one cannot claim for a compensatory effect.</p><p>6) Figure 3D. Despite the fact that MMP inhibitors could prevent the reduction in the intensities of gelatin and AChR induced by overexpression of MT1-MMP-mCherry, the finding that muscle cells knocked-down for endogenous MT1-MMP could still support AChR accumulation of AChR at nerve-muscle contacts albeit inefficiently, which presumably occurs via recruiting of aneural AChR clusters (Figure 7) raises concerns about interpretation of MT1-MMP overexpression experiments.</p><p>7) Figure 4A-C. The analysis of EB1 dynamics at non-AChR regions should target hotspots of EB1 whose intensity matches those associated to AChR-associated regions (cf. Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>8) Figure 4D and Results, subsection “Cortical Microtubule Capturing Is Mediated by EB1-/CLASP-Dependent Mechanisms at Perforated AChR Clusters”. &quot;[…] EB1-GFP signals were primarily enriched at the edge of perforations of aneural AChR clusters in control cells but at the center of perforations in CLASP-MO muscle cells.&quot; No quantified data is presented in support of the claim.

First, by culturing frog myotomal tissues on glass coverslips coated with a mixture of ECM proteins, they showed that aneural AChR clusters were formed at the bottom surface of muscle cells in contact with ECL-coated plates (compared with control – coated with poly-D-lysine, PDL) while AChR clutters were sparsely scattered. A majority of ECM-induced AChR clusters appeared perforated; and, ECM markers were enriched in the perforations. By plating muscle cells on FITC-gelatin-coated plates, they showed gelatin degradation in the perforation areas of AChR clusters; and MMP inhibitors, BB-94 and BB-2516, inhibited gelatin degradation and increased muscle fibers with AChR clusters and cluster areas, demonstrating that MMP activity is required for podosome formation and AChR cluster stability. Next, the authors showed that MT1-MMP is enriched in the perforated areas and MT1-MMP mCherry overexpression reduced bottom AChR clusters and increased top clusters. By micro-injecting CLASP-MO and using TIRF, they confirmed CLASP involvement in microtubule capturing at AChR clusters; PLS regulates microtubule capturing and MT1-MMP trafficking to AChR clusters. Then, the authors showed that MMP inhibitors inhibit nerve-induction of AChR clusters and disassembly of aneural clusters. In another set of experiments, MT1-MMP was shown to be necessary for surface expression of new AChR and redistribution of pre-existing AChR. Finally, in MT1-MMP null mice, AChR cluster density and endplate band width were reduced, and nerve terminals were defasciculated. These in vivo data seemed in agreement with in vitro data. Together the authors concluded that MT1-MMP regulates the formation and topological remodeling of postsynaptic specializations at developing NMJs.</p><p>This is a cell biology-heavy paper with many cutting edge imaging techniques and in vitro manipulations. Data seemed to be solid. Importantly, some conclusions are supported by data of studies of MT1-MMP mutant mice. However, the following concerns should be addressed before publication.</p><p>First, podosome is a morphological phenomenon of some cells in culture.

The paper showed a correlation for nerve-induction of new clusters versus and disassembly of aneural clusters, which was not new (showed by Peng and colleagues a while back). This paper could be substantially improved by addressing this question. Such in vitro experiments are not too difficult to do.</p><p>Third, along the same line, the authors suggested the coupling forming new, nerve-induced clutters with disappearing aneural clusters. However, the paper stopped short in studying MT1-MMP mutant mice. Adding one or more time point(s) should reveal which step(s) is altered. For in vivo studies, imaging and quantification data should be provided regarding &quot;aneural&quot; versus &quot;nerve-induced&quot; clusters. Unfortunately such data are missing in the current version.</p><p>Fourth, citation of the papers was generous. Recent reviews on NMJ formation were not cited. The author cited a paper on Yap in tumor. There seemed to be one paper on Yap at NMJ.</p><p>Fourth, MT-MMPs have six type (MT1-6). Is MT1-MMP a dominant one? No functional redundancy?

Notably, there are also effects on axonal growth and arborization of the phrenic nerve, making it difficult to conclude, as acknowledged by the authors, that pre-synaptic roles cannot also be ruled out for MT1-MMP.</p><p>Overall this is an extensive body of work.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Site-directed MT1-MMP trafficking and surface insertion regulate AChR clustering and remodeling at developing NMJs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.

Using mostly the <italic>Xenopus</italic> muscle cultures and fluorescence imaging, the authors demonstrate that PLS targets MT1-MMP to the membrane surface via the microtubule capturing mechanism involving EB1 and CLASP; subsequently, local remodelling of the ECM disperses aneural AChR clusters which then act as a source for synaptic AChR clusters. Nerve-muscle co-cultures are also used to explore the effects of interfering with MT1-MMP activity on agrin and nerve-induced AChR cluster formation. Collectively, the findings highlight the crucial role for ECM remodelling in AChR re-organization, and notably, the loss of MT1-MMP activity compromises synaptic AChR cluster formation in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have made significant efforts to address the previous criticisms by performing new experiments and additional analysis. In particular, the study has been significantly strengthened by the FRAP experiment which supports the idea that synaptic AChRs are recruited from aneural AChRs. Furthermore, the text has been carefully edited to improve the clarity of the data interpretations. Altogether, the study makes a compelling case for a role MT1-MMP in NMJ formation. However, following remaining points require careful consideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Importantly, &quot;AChR clusters&quot; in the paper are heterogeneous. Therefore, AChR clusters whose formation is triggered by specific stimuli that are found in different locations, may be under different regulatory mechanisms. For example, ECM-induced clusters are located at the bottom surface of myotubes (i.e. surface in direct contact with the ECM), and these clusters seem to be a target of MT1. Whether the effects of MT1 on these &quot;bottom&quot; clusters also apply to AChR clusters on the top surface and/or nerve-induced clusters (which usually are located on the lateral sides of myotubes) remain a critical issue. While it may be beyond the scope of the current study to experimentally clarify the role of MT1 on different AChR cluster types, at the very least, the authors should define these types of AChR clusters in the Introduction. A full discussion of whether and/how MT1 regulates all or just one of the AChR cluster types should be included along with a cartoon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54379.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><p>Four major sets of new data are included in this revision in response to reviewers’ comments:</p><p>1) Contribution of AChRs from aneural to synaptic clusters. All reviewers raised an important question regarding whether aneural AChR clusters serve as a source for the assembly of synaptic AChR clusters. We agree that our previous manuscript lacks the compelling experimental evidence to show the direct contribution of aneural AChR clusters at developing NMJs. In this revision, we have performed this key experiment using laser-based photobleaching approach to demonstrate the differential contribution of AChR molecules from aneural clusters and diffuse AChRs for the assembly of nerve-induced synaptic AChR clusters. Importantly, we have also investigated the involvement of MT1MMP in this recruitment process. The new data are now presented in Figure 9.</p><p>2) Aneural versus synaptic AChR clusters in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> knockout study. We agree with reviewer #2 that our manuscript could be further strengthened by providing additional imaging and quantification data to show both aneural and synaptic AChR clusters at developing NMJs in vivo. As such, we have now performed new quantitative analyses on our existing and new imaging data to measure the numbers of aneural and synaptic AChR clusters between wild-type and MT1-MMP knockout animals. The new in vivo analyses are now presented in Figure 10C-G.</p><p>3) Possible presynaptic role of MT1-MMP at NMJs in vivo. We appreciate the comments from reviewer #3 indicating that it is outside the scope of our present manuscript to determine whether MT1-MMP plays a presynaptic role at developing NMJs in vivo. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now performed the immunostaining experiment using rat leg muscles. Our new results indicated that denervation caused only a slight reduction of MT1-MMP signals at the NMJs, suggesting MT1-MMP is expressed in postsynaptic muscles primarily, but also in presynaptic motor neurons at a lower level. The new in vivo data are now presented in Figure 10B.</p><p>4) Spatial localization of endogenous and overexpressed MT1-MMP in AChRclusters. Reviewers #1 and #2 raised concerns about the spatial localization of endogenous and overexpressed MT1-MMP, as their signals are not selectively restricted to the perforations of aneural AChR clusters. In the revised manuscript, we have now provided additional data using MT1-MMP antibody that was pre-incubated with recombinant MT1-MMP proteins to demonstrate the specificity of MT1-MMP signals at NMJs in vivo in Figure 10A. Moreover, we have further clarified that signals of MT1-MMP immunostaining and MT1-MMP-mCherry overexpression are derived from both surface and intracellular MT1-MMP proteins, explaining why it is reasonable that endogenous and overexpressed MT1-MMP signals are not restricted to AChR clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The manuscript is disjointed between characterizations of aneural AChR remodeling and synaptic AChR remodeling in the presence of motoneurons, where most of the effort is spent on the former, and it remains unclear if dispersed aneural AChR serves as a source for synaptic AChRs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In this revision, we have further provided a direct evidence demonstrating the contribution of AChRs from the aneural to synaptic clusters at developing NMJs in Figure 9. Our new results showed that a majority of AChRs at the nerve-muscle contacts are recruited from aneural AChR clusters, and this recruitment process is significantly reduced in MT1-MMP knockdown muscle cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the logical flow of the proposed events is not necessarily consistent with the data shown, and there are tendencies for over-interpretation of data. Collectively, these issues reduce the overall impact of the present findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the schematic diagram (Figure 11B) by including the relevant data presented in our main figures that support each of the individual proposed events in this logical flow diagram. Moreover, we have toned down several overstatements throughout the revised manuscript. With these changes, we hope that the reviewer and the general audience would better appreciate the overall impact of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Results, subsection “Topologically Complex Structures of PLS-Associated Aneural AChR Clusters Can Be Induced by Different ECM Proteins”. &quot;These data suggested that different ECM proteins can induce the assembly of PLSs, which in turn regulates the formation and/or remodeling of topologically complex structures of AChR clusters&quot;: Only the first half of the statement is supported by the data shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the over-interpretation in this sentence. In this study, we have demonstrated that the formation of bottom AChR clusters could be effectively induced by all ECM proteins tested (Figure 1B), and we have identified PLS localization in a majority of perforated AChR clusters induced by different ECM proteins (Figure 1D-E). Therefore, we have revised the sentence - “These data suggest that different ECM proteins can induce the assembly of PLSs, which may in turn regulate the formation of topologically complex structures of AChR clusters”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2. One should clarify whether block of MMP affects the formation of perforated AChR clusters in any way. Especially with respect to panel G, it is not clear whether the total number of AChR cluster changes over time in control and how this is changed in the presence of MMP inhibitors. In addition to % muscle cells with AChR clusters, one should determine the changes in the number of AChR clusters to demonstrate whether MMP activity is restricted to remodeling of preformed AChR clusters or whether it affects new AChR cluster formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our original Figure 2G did not clearly show the total number of AChR clusters changes over time in control and in the presence of MMP inhibitors. In this revision, we have modified the presentation of the data in the original Figure 2G. Two separate panels are now added to show the effects of MMP inhibition on the formation (Figure 2G) and remodeling (Figure 2H) of AChR clusters. Moreover, we have included the new quantitative data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, showing that there is no significant difference in the total number of AChR clusters between control and MMP inhibitor-treated muscle cells. These data indicated that MMP inhibition affects the remodeling of preformed AChR clusters, rather than the formation of new AChR clusters.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis on the total AChR clusters in cultured cells treated with MMP inhibitors.</title><p>By monitoring muscle cells over 4 days in culture, AChR clusters located in the top versus bottom surface of the muscle cells were quantified in different experimental groups.

This statement is not fully substantiated by the data shown as Figure 2I illustrates that some degree of remodeling does seem to occur even in the presence of BB-94 for most of the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that a small degree of remodeling of aneural AChR clusters can be detected in the presence of MMP inhibitors. This is due to the fact that the activity of MMPs cannot be completely blocked by pharmacological inhibitors. However, it should be noted that we observed a significant inhibition of AChR cluster remodeling in response to BB-94 treatment (Figure 2I-J). Therefore, we have toned down the quoted sentence – “These data demonstrated that MMP activity is involved in the topological remodeling and dispersal of aneural AChR clusters”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1. MT1-MMP is not necessarily selectively targeted to perforations within AChR clusters. Also, hotspots of endogenous EB1 are also not necessarily restricted to areas of perforated AChR clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to emphasize that MT1-MMP immunostaining data in Figure 3A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 indicated the signals from not only surface MT1-MMP, but also intracellular MT1-MMP at the vesicular compartments. Therefore, it was expected that MT1-MMP signals in Figure 3A are not selectively restricted to the perforations of aneural AChR clusters. We have emphasized this in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Regarding the endogenous EB1 signals, we also expected that EB1 signals are not selectively restricted to perforated AChR clusters. As EB1 is a microtubule plus-end-binding protein responsible for regulating microtubule dynamics, endogenous EB1 comets could be found throughout the entire cell. In addition to the location of aneural AChR clusters, it is known that focal adhesions at the cell periphery can also regulate cortical microtubule capturing, representing another possible site of EB1 hotspots in muscle cells. We have now clarified this in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results, subsection “MT1-MMP Activity Precisely Controls the Extent of ECM Degradation and AChR Cluster Formation”. &quot;[…] MT1-MMP-mCherry overexpressing cells showed a higher percentage of top AChR clusters at the expense of ECM-induced bottom AChR clusters […]&quot;. The claim that the increase in the proportion of muscle cells that show top AChR clusters occurred &quot;at the expense of bottom AChR clusters&quot; is an overinterpretation of the data. Unless one knows the absolute numbers, one cannot claim for a compensatory effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this. This statement has been toned down – “MT1-MMP-mCherry overexpressing cells showed a lower percentage of ECM-induced bottom AChR clusters, but a higher percentage of top AChR clusters, in comparison to the wild-type control cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3D. Despite the fact that MMP inhibitors could prevent the reduction in the intensities of gelatin and AChR induced by overexpression of MT1-MMP-mCherry, the finding that muscle cells knocked-down for endogenous MT1-MMP could still support AChR accumulation of AChR at nerve-muscle contacts albeit inefficiently, which presumably occurs via recruiting of aneural AChR clusters (Figure 7) raises concerns about interpretation of MT1-MMP overexpression experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that MT1-MMP serves different roles in regulating the aneural (Figure 3) and synaptic (Figures 7-8) AChR clusters. As the reviewer pointed out, nerve-muscle contacts in the chimeric co-cultures of MT1-MMP-MO muscles and wild-type neurons could still allow the accumulation of some AChRs, albeit inefficiently. This could be explained by: (1) the partial knockdown of endogenous muscle MT1-MMP level by MT1-MMP MO (Figure 8—figure supplement 1); (ii) the recruitment of diffuse AChRs to nerve-muscle contacts, although it is a minor contribution, via MT1-MMP-independent processes (Figure 9). Therefore, it is not contradictory with the findings of MT1-MMP overexpression in aneural AChR cluster formation (Figure 3). We have now clarified this in the subsection “Postsynaptic MT1-MMP is a regulator of NMJ development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4A-C. The analysis of EB1 dynamics at non-AChR regions should target hotspots of EB1 whose intensity matches those associated to AChR-associated regions (cf. Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Apart from the region of aneural AChR clusters, focal adhesion structures located at the cell periphery are the other site of EB1 hotspots in the muscle cells. Therefore, we performed the suggested analysis to compare EB1-GFP dynamics between AChR and focal adhesion regions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the speed of EB1 comets was comparable between AChR and focal adhesion regions. However, CLASP knockdown significantly increased the speed of EB1 comets in AChR regions but not in focal adhesion regions. These data suggested that while cortical microtubule capturing is detected at both aneural AChR clusters and focal adhesion structures, the former is more sensitive to CLASP expression level.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Cortical microtubule capturing at AChR and focal adhesion regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative TIRF images showing the hotspots of EB1-GFP comets in AChR clusters and focal adhesion (FA) structures in control or CLASP-MO muscle cells.

The new data are now presented in Figure 4E.</p><p>However, different perforations in different, and even the same, aneural AChR clusters exhibit a great diversity and variations in terms of their size, shape, and intensity difference.

Since CLASP can control other cellular events (e.g. to maintain a stable spindle position in mitosis (Samora et al., 2011)), it is not desirable to further increase the knockdown efficiency of endogenous CLASP in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Results, subsection “Intracellular Trafficking of MT1-MMP Is Directed to PLS-Associated AChR Clusters”. &quot;[…] these data illustrated that EB1 coordinates the vesicular trafficking of MT1-MMP in cultured muscle cells&quot;.

The intracellular trafficking of MT1-MMP vesicles can be mediated throughout the entire microtubule networks. Even though we were able to observe cases when EB1 comets search and capture MT1-MMP vesicles (Figure 5A), the exact location of MT1-MMP vesicles is not selectively restricted at/near the plus-end of microtubules.

In contrast to MT1-MMP-mCherry overexpression that showed both surface and intracellular MT1-MMP signals (Figure 5), the localization of MT1-MMP-pHluorin signals at a low expression level was indeed more restricted to AChR cluster regions (Figure 6A). Therefore, to minimize the non-specific effects of exogenous overexpression, only those cells with low MT1-MMP-pHluorin expression levels were chosen for the study of AChR cluster remodeling (Figure 6D-H). Taking all these into account, MT1-MMP-pHluorin is still considered as a very useful tool to demonstrate the surface insertion of MT1-MMP in our experiments.

The new data are now presented in Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, along the same line, the authors suggested the coupling forming new, nerve-induced clutters with disappearing aneural clusters. However, the paper stopped short in studying MT1-MMP mutant mice. Adding one or more time point(s) should reveal which step(s) is altered. For in vivo studies, imaging and quantification data should be provided regarding &quot;aneural&quot; versus &quot;nerve-induced&quot; clusters. Unfortunately such data are missing in the current version.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that imaging and quantifying aneural versus synaptic AChR clusters at different embryonic stages would be of help to further support the coupling events between aneural AChR cluster dispersal and synaptic AChR cluster formation at developing NMJs. Thus, we have now classified all AChR signals into aneural and synaptic AChR clusters in wild-type and MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> diaphragm muscles at E13.5 and E18.5, which are now presented in Figure 10C-E. At E13.5, we observed a significant increase in the density of aneural AChR clusters in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> compared with that in the wild-type animals (Figure 10D). In contrast, the density of synaptic AChR clusters in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> was significantly lower than that in wild-type animals at E18.5 (Figure 10E). This new quantitative data further supported that MT1-MMP is involved in the recruitment of aneural AChR clusters to nerve-induced synaptic AChR clusters at developing NMJs in vivo.</p><p>In addition, we have tried to add an additional time point (E15.5) for examining the AChR clusters in embryonic diaphragm muscles between wild-type and MT1-MMP-deficient mice. Unfortunately, because of the low breeding performance of our existing MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> colonies, we were able to obtain only one homozygous MT1-MMP knockout embryo in the past 6 months. From our preliminary data as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, the effects on the density of aneural versus synaptic AChR clusters between the wild-type and MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice at E15.5 showed a similar trend as what we observed using E13.5 mice (Figure 10D-E). With the new analysis suggested by the reviewer as stated above, we think that the comparison between E13.5 and E18.5 is sufficient to demonstrate the coupling events between the dispersal of aneural AChR clusters and the formation of synaptic AChR clusters.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the reviewers consider this as an essential experiment for the revision, we are in the process of replacing the poor breeders, and therefore we shall be able to obtain more homozygous MT1-MMP knockout mice for this study in the next couple of months.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Aneural versus synaptic AChR clusters in MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> diaphragm muscles at E15.5.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal images showing the AChR pre-patterns (red) and synaptic AChR clusters (yellow) in whole-mount diaphragms from control and MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice at E15.5.

In the present study, morpholino-mediated knockdown of MT1-MMP alone was able to significantly inhibit the formation and dispersal of synaptic and aneural AChR clusters, respectively. Besides, MT1-MMP knockout mice develop multiple abnormalities and die between 50-90 postnatal days (Holmbeck et al., 1999), suggesting that the possibility of functional redundancy by other MMP isoforms is low. We have now further clarified this point in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Regarding the specificity of MT1-MMP antibodies, we have now provided additional data using MT1-MMP antibody that was pre-incubated with recombinant MT1-MMP protein to demonstrate the specificity of MT1-MMP signals at NMJs in vivo in Figure 10A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can some podosome-like phenotypes be observed in muscle cells isolated from MT1-MMP mt mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed immunostaining experiments to examine the localization of ADF/cofilin and talin, core and cortex markers of podosome-like structures respectively, at AChR clusters in hindlimb muscles of wild-type and MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> postnatal mice. Consistent with a previous study using adenovirus-expressing actin-GFP in tibialis anterior muscles in postnatal day 8 mice (Proszynski et al., 2009), the spatial localization of synaptic podosomes at the NMJs in vivo is not as obvious as that in cultured muscles. Nevertheless, we were able to detect elevated signals of ADF/cofilin and talin associated with synaptic AChR clusters in hindlimb muscles from both wild-type and MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice at postnatal day 11. This indicated that MT1-MMP deficiency causes no or minimal change in the presence of podosome-like structures at NMJs during early postnatal development.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Localization of PLS core and cortex markers at AChR clusters in postnatal mice.</title><p>Representative confocal images showing the enrichment of PLS core marker, ADF/cofilin (top panels), and cortex marker, talin (bottom panels), at synaptic AChR clusters in longitudinal cryosections of hindlimb muscles isolated from P11 wild-type or MT1-MMP<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Therefore, AChR clusters whose formation is triggered by specific stimuli that are found in different locations, may be under different regulatory mechanisms. For example, ECM-induced clusters are located at the bottom surface of myotubes (i.e. surface in direct contact with the ECM), and these clusters seem to be a target of MT1. Whether the effects of MT1 on these &quot;bottom&quot; clusters also apply to AChR clusters on the top surface and/or nerve-induced clusters (which usually are located on the lateral sides of myotubes) remain a critical issue. While it may be beyond the scope of the current study to experimentally clarify the role of MT1 on different AChR cluster types, at the very least, the authors should define these types of AChR clusters in the Introduction. A full discussion of whether and/how MT1 regulates all or just one of the AChR cluster types should be included along with a cartoon.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewing Editor and reviewers for raising this crucial point and providing an opportunity for us to clarify this. In most of our experiments, aneural AChR clusters located at the basal muscle surface in direct contact with ECM proteins (i.e. bottom AChR clusters), as well as synaptic AChR clusters located at either the basal surface or the lateral side of muscle cells, were investigated. The central idea of this study is to test whether ECM degradation mediated by MT1-MMP regulates AChR cluster formation and remodeling.</p><p>Although it is true that a minority of aneural AChR clusters can be found at the top muscle surface, where no ECM proteins are directly involved, we consider that top AChR clusters are spontaneously formed with no physiological relevance. Thus, we did not investigate the role of MT1-MMP in the formation and remodeling of ECM-independent, top AChR clusters.</p><p>As for nerve-induced AChR clusters, most nerve contacts in <italic>Xenopus</italic> primary cultures are located at either the basal surface or the lateral side of muscle cells, in agreement with previous studies (Anderson and Cohen, 1977; Cohen et al., 1987). Since it is uncommon to find nerve contacts at the top surface of cultured muscle cells, they were not included in our study.</p><p>We have now added several sentences in different parts of our revised manuscript to further clarify these points:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1) “These aneural AChR clusters, located at the bottom surface of cultured muscles in direct contact with ECM proteins, …”.</p><p>2) “It is worth to note that a small proportion of aneural AChR clusters can also be identified at the top surface of cultured muscles, and these spontaneously formed clusters are likely mediated through ECM- and PLS-independent mechanisms”.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>1) “In agreement with previous studies (Anderson and Cohen, 1977; Cohen et al., 1987), most nerve contacts in <italic>Xenopus</italic> primary cultures are located at either the basal surface or the lateral side of muscle cells, which are influenced by MMP-mediated proteolytic degradation of ECM proteins”.</p><p>2) “In a minority of cases, some aneural and nerve-induced AChR clusters can be found at the top muscle surface, where no ECM proteins are directly involved.
