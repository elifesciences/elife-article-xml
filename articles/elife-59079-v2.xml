disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. It is still necessary to explore its detailed mechanisms and identify novel targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previously, we found that a lncRNA named <italic>GAS5</italic> in human could negatively regulate the lipoblast/adipocyte differentiation. However, it is still unclear whether <italic>GAS5</italic> affects osteoblast differentiation and whether <italic>GAS5</italic> is associated with osteoporosis. Our current research found that <italic>GAS5</italic> was decreased in the bones and BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of osteoporosis patients. Mechanistically, <italic>GAS5</italic> promotes the osteoblast differentiation by interacting with UPF1 to degrade <italic>SMAD7</italic> mRNA. Moreover, a decreased bone mass and impaired bone repair ability were observed in <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice, manifesting in osteoporosis. The systemic supplement of <italic>Gas5</italic>-overexpressing adenoviruses significantly ameliorated bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. In conclusion, <italic>GAS5</italic> promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting the UPF1/SMAD7 axis and protects against osteoporosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>osteoblast differentiation</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd><kwd>stromal cells</kwd><kwd>GAS5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yanfeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Huiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19ykpy01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81702120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yanfeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Huiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81871750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yanfeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Huiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81672097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yanfeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Huiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Guangdong Provincial Key R&amp;D Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019B020236001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Zhongyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Huiyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GAS5 is related to osteoporosis by regulating the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells that acts as a promising treatment target for osteoporosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease that manifests as low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Individuals with osteoporosis are at a higher risk of fragility fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eastell et al., 2016</xref>). Over 200 million people worldwide suffer from this disease, and this number is gradually increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lizneva et al., 2018</xref>). Fractures caused by osteoporosis lead to functional disruption and pain along with an enormous therapeutic cost. In the United States and European Union, osteoporotic fractures have been estimated to cost $20 billion to $30 billion annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lorentzon, 2019</xref>). Although many studies on osteoporosis have been conducted in recent years, more effective diagnostic and curative targets need to be explored for osteoporosis.</p><p>The imbalance between bone and fat mass is a typical feature of the osteoporosis pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Paula and Rosen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Paula and Rosen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Infante and Rodríguez, 2018</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that the abnormal differentiation capacities of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) play an important role in this critical pathogenesis of osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). BMSCs are stem cells that possess self-renewal and multiple differentiation abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grayson et al., 2015</xref>). As the major origins of osteoblasts and adipocytes, BMSCs maintain their balance between osteoblast and adipocyte, which are regulated by various molecular checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anthony and Link, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Williams and Hare, 2011</xref>). The abnormal expression of these molecules disrupts the osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation balance and leads to disordered bone metabolism, ultimately resulting in disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, identifying these critical targets of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation will be significantly helpful for the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases.</p><p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a type of RNA longer than 200 nt and do not have protein-coding potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marchese et al., 2017</xref>). The various and vital functions of lncRNAs in cell biology have been proven in numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that lncRNAs are involved in BMSCs osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>GAS5</italic> is a well-researched lncRNA that widely contributes to various cell biology functions such as immunity, tumor generation and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Renganathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In our previous study, we demonstrated that <italic>GAS5</italic> negatively affected the adipoytes differentiation through the <italic>miR-18a</italic>/CTGF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Other researchers also recognized the crucial role of <italic>GAS5</italic> in BMSCs differentiation. For example, the researches of Wang, X etc. indicated that <italic>Gas5</italic> could promotes osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by FOXO1 in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).However, the effect of <italic>GAS5</italic> on human osteoblast differentiation and its role in osteoporosis have not been clearly clarified.</p><p>In our current research, we found that the level of <italic>GAS5</italic> was decreased in both the bones and BMSCs of osteoporosis patients. Molecular and in vivo studies revealed that <italic>GAS5</italic> promoted the osteoblast differentiation through the UPF1/SMAD7 axis. Furthermore, <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice showed decreased bone mass and an impaired bone repair capacity as an osteoporotic phenotype. Bone loss was found to be alleviated in an osteoporosis mouse model after systemic application with <italic>Gas5</italic>-overexpressing adenoviruses. These findings consistently support the hypothesis that the lncRNA GAS5 acts as a protective target in osteoporosis by regulating osteoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GAS5 decreased in osteoporosis and positively correlated with the osteoblast differentiation</title><p>Eight osteoporosis patients who suffered from femoral neck fractures and eight patients with hip dysplasia and eight normal controls with car accident requiring surgery were recruited (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). BGLAP and COL1A1 immunohistochemical staining confirmed the decrease in the bone formation marker in osteoporosis patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mRNA level of <italic>GAS5</italic> in both bone tissues and BMSCs was decreased in patients with osteoporosis compared to in those with hip dysplasia and normal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), which indicated that <italic>GAS5</italic> expression was closely related to bone metabolism in osteoporosis. Given the crucial role of BMSCs in osteoporosis, we explored the variation tendency of <italic>GAS5</italic> expression during osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs. The results showed that <italic>GAS5</italic> was upregulated along with the induction of osteogenesis, as shown by ARS assays, ALP staining, ALP tests and qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, exploration of the specific gene responsible for osteoporosis and identification of new therapeutic targets are especially important. Previously, we found that <italic>GAS5</italic> could negatively regulate the adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Herein, in our research, we found that as a protective target, <italic>GAS5</italic> decreases in both bone tissue and BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of patients with osteoporosis. The osteoblast differentiation could be positively regulated by <italic>GAS5</italic> both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, <italic>GAS5</italic> could specifically interact with UPF1 to accelerate the decay of <italic>SMAD7</italic>, which in turn activates the SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway. Furthermore, <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice showed decreased bone mass and an impaired bone repair capacity. Bone loss in the osteoporosis mouse model was improved by systemic transfection of <italic>Gas5</italic>-overexpressing adenoviruses. Considering all of these findings together, we concluded that <italic>GAS5</italic> is a critical molecule in the osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation and contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, emphasizing its novel role in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.</p><p>As the major originating cells of osteoblasts and adipocytes, BMSCs antagonistically perform osteoblast or lipoblast differentiation both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Physiologically, these differentiation abilities are balanced status and regulated by a variety of checkpoint molecules, including lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grayson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). However, the abnormal expression of these checkpoint molecules could disrupt the differentiation balance, leading to abnormal bone metabolism as well as disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Compston et al., 2019</xref>). For example, the <italic>lncRNA H19</italic> could regulate osteogenesis by sponging <italic>miR-675</italic> and associating with cartilage regeneration, and abnormal <italic>H19</italic> expression was found in patients with osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, we found that <italic>GAS5</italic> inhibited the adipocyte differentiation through the <italic>miR-18a</italic>/CTGF axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In our current research, we demonstrated that <italic>GAS5</italic> expression was positively correlated with the osteoblast differentiation, as shown by ARS and ALP assays, as well as critical osteogenesis marker expression. Inhibiting or overexpressing <italic>GAS5</italic> accordingly decreased or increased the osteoblast differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated that <italic>GAS5</italic> was another critical checkpoint molecule for the osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiation by promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting adipogenesis.</p><p>Recent research found that <italic>GAS5</italic> could regulate osteogenic differentiation in mouse mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). While this result confirmed the role of <italic>GAS5</italic> in osteoblast differentiation, the physiological and pathological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms are different between humans and mice. Therefore, it is important to further explore the detailed mechanisms of <italic>GAS5</italic> in the osteoblast differentiation of human. Critical signaling pathways for osteoblast differentiation, including SMAD1/5/8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grafe et al., 2018</xref>), catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ye et al., 2018</xref>) were detected, but only SMAD1/5/8 was regulated by <italic>GAS5</italic>. Furthermore, SMAD7, an inhibitory protein for the SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway rather than for other molecules, was proven to be the target of <italic>GAS5</italic> in our study. Studies have found that SMAD7 inhibits the SMAD1/5/8 pathway and negatively regulates the osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miyazawa and Miyazono, 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that <italic>GAS5</italic> could not directly interact with SMAD7. Instead, <italic>GAS5</italic> showed a strong affinity for and interactions with UPF1, as shown by a series of results in our research.</p><p>UPF1 is a key molecule in mRNA nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehecq et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies indicated that UPF1 knockdown could inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells through the NMD mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bokhari et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have confirmed that lncRNAs can combine with different functional proteins to exhibit various effects. For instance, lncRNAs can enhance protein recruitment toward the associated target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yari et al., 2019</xref>) or can strengthen/weaken the binding force of proteins and their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In this research, we demonstrated for the first time the role of <italic>GAS5</italic> in RNA NMD of BMSCs via UPF1. By combining and collecting UPF1, <italic>GAS5</italic> accelerated the degradation of SMAD7 and therefore promoted osteoblast differentiation.</p><p>Further exploration in our studies indicated that <italic>GAS5</italic> binds to the HD domain of UPF1. The HD domain was the key functional area in UPF1-associated NMD. Mutations of the HD domain disrupt the RNA helicase activity of UPF1 and perturb the function of UPF1 in NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehecq et al., 2018</xref>). Our results suggested that the binding of <italic>GAS5</italic> and UPF1 may strengthen the binding force of UPF1 and its target mRNA <italic>SMAD7</italic>. We speculated that in osteoblast differentiation, the increased expression of <italic>GAS5</italic> combined with UPF1 strengthened the binding of UPF1 and <italic>SMAD7</italic>, leading to the accelerated degradation of <italic>SMAD7</italic> and activation of the <italic>SMAD1/5/8</italic> pathway, ultimately promoting osteoblast differentiation.</p><p>Decreased bone mass and increased fat formation in bone are the main histopathological manifestations of osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Compston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eastell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Infante and Rodríguez, 2018</xref>), which indicates an imbalance between the osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation in osteoporosis patients. Many studies have confirmed that BMSCs in osteoporosis patients possess a decreased osteogenic ability but an enhanced adipogenic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Paula and Rosen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pagnotti et al., 2019</xref>), which is an important reason for the abnormal bone mass decrease and fat accumulation in bone marrow of osteoporosis patients. However, whether <italic>GAS5</italic> participated in these processes was not clearly clarified. In our research, we found that the level of <italic>GAS5</italic> expression was decreased in the bone tissue and BMSCs of osteoporosis patients, indicating that <italic>GAS5</italic> may be related to the progression of osteoporosis. To confirm this hypothesis, we constructed a global <italic>Gas5</italic> knockout mouse model to explore the role of <italic>GAS5</italic> in osteoporosis. However, global <italic>Gas5</italic> knockout caused unexpected lethality in the embryonic period, which indicated that <italic>Gas5</italic> was indispensable in the development of the embryo. Interestingly, the osteoporotic phenotype, including lower bone mass, was macroscopically and microscopically observed in surviving <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice, as shown by both micro-CT and histological staining, compared with in WT mice. Combining the above results, we speculated that decreased <italic>Gas5</italic> levels may change heterozygote bone mass by regulating the osteoblast differentiation. To further confirm the abnormal osteogenic ability of <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice, we constructed a cranial defect model and found that its bone repair ability was significantly weakened, which further confirmed the dysfunction of osteoblast differentiation in <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice. However, the mechanism of cranial bone formation may not be analogous to what is observed for bone formation and or bone healing in the long bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Katsimbri, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catala et al., 2019</xref>). We do not know exactly how <italic>Gas5</italic> would impact long bone healing and that this is a needed future direction.</p><p>Currently, the treatment of osteoporosis is currently mainly aimed at osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ensrud and Crandall, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roux and Briot, 2018</xref>), and the new therapy with <italic>teriparatide</italic> has shown a more curative effect in osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Minisola et al., 2019</xref>), which suggests that treatment options directed at osteoblasts are of great significance. Adenoviruses containing lncRNAs were used to treat mice and showed a significant therapeutic effect in many diseases, including ischemic myocardial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2019</xref>) and cardiac regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ponnusamy et al., 2019</xref>). To clarify the possible role of <italic>Gas5</italic> in osteoporosis treatment, we supplemented <italic>Gas5</italic>-overexpressing adenoviruses in an osteoporosis mouse model based on the preceding results. Micro-CT, H and E staining, and <italic>Bglap</italic> immunohistochemical staining showed that the bone loss in the <italic>Gas5</italic> overexpression group was more alleviated than the bone loss in the control group. These results indicate that <italic>Gas5</italic> not only participates in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis but also may be a promising therapeutic target.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that <italic>GAS5</italic> acts as a protective target in osteoporosis. The protective function of <italic>GAS5</italic> was exhibited by promoting the osteoblast differentiation by the UPF1/SMAD7 axis. Targeting <italic>GAS5</italic> may greatly contribute to both the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. However, several limitations still exist in our study. For example, more convincing evidence should be obtained by conducting experiments with an osteoblast-specific <italic>Gas5</italic> conditional knockout mouse. Further studies should be performed to address these issues in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The use plan of all involving animals (including the type and number of mice, the specific operation plan, and the principle of optimal substitution, etc.) was proposed, and the final plan was determined after internal discussion in the research group.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yuji Mishina (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p><italic>GAS5</italic> is a long non-coding RNA that has been previously shown to have a role in tumorigenesis, but is less well characterized in other physiologic systems. This team has previously shown that <italic>GAS5</italic> regulates adipogenesis and in this paper they expand their focus to the osteoblast. While previous studies have suggested a role for <italic>GAS5</italic> in regulating osteoblastogenesis, this paper greatly expands on this. These authors first show that <italic>GAS5</italic> is reduced bone from osteoporotic patients and they use a combination of in vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that <italic>GAS5</italic> positively regulates osteoblast differentiation. Using a cutting edge proteomic approach, they identify UPF1 as interactor with <italic>GAS5</italic>, and that this interaction impacts BMP signaling. The authors show that the low bone mass phenotype of <italic>Gas5</italic> heterozygous mice can be partially rescued by systemic expression of <italic>GAS5</italic> and thereby demonstrating how non-coding genes potentially could contribute to human disease. There are 8 essential things that have to be addressed in the revision, although only 1, 2, and 4 will require additional experiments or data acquisition and presentation.Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is well known that <italic>SMAD7</italic> negatively regulates both BMP and TGF-β signaling, which have distinct functions on bone homeostasis. The authors need to measure levels of TGF-β signaling, i.e. checking the levels of phospho-SMAD2/3 when <italic>GAS5</italic> function is altered.</p><p>2) As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2F, <italic>SMAD6</italic> levels are not changed by <italic>GAS5</italic>. Does UPF1 bind to <italic>SMAD6</italic> mRNA less efficiently than <italic>SMAD7</italic> mRNA? Providing data (or make a case based on published information) to explain distinctive outcomes between two inhibitory Smads will further signify this article.</p><p>3) The cranial defect model is an interesting model from which we have learned a great deal about bone healing, the concern was raised during review that the mechanism of cranial bone formation may not be analogous to what is observed for bone formation and or bone healing in the long bone. The limitations of the cranial defect model needs to be carefully and completely presented in the Discussion. It was requested that a long bone fracture healing experiment be conducted and this would certainly strengthen the paper, but it is also recognized that this might not be possible at this time. Therefore, the inclusion of data showing bone formation in a long bone fracture model is suggested but not required. If a fracture healing experiment is not done, it should be stated in the Discussion that we do not know exactly how <italic>GAS5</italic> would impact long bone healing and that this is a needed future direction.</p><p>4) The mRNA expression levels of <italic>Gas5</italic> in cancellous bone tissue in <italic>Gas5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice should be determined if possible.</p><p>5) In the Introduction, a more complete presentation of prior studies of <italic>GAS5</italic> in osteogenic differentiation should be included.</p><p>6) Quantification of the data presented in Figures 2E, 3E, 6B and 7B is required.</p><p>7) It is requested that for Figure 6B, the image of HE staining of <italic>Gas5</italic><sup>+/-</sup> be changed for a clearer image.</p><p>8) Figure 4A created a lot of confusion.

For this question, the binding RNA of UPF1 was tested again with the RIP kit by applied the IP antibody of UPF1. The results of qPCR showed that compared with IgG control, <italic>SMAD7</italic> mRNA increased 8.83 times, while <italic>SMAD6</italic> mRNA increased only 1.47 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). It is indicated that mRNA of <italic>SMAD7</italic> is significantly stronger than <italic>SMAD6</italic> in combination with UPF1.

After literature search and reading, we agree that the skull and long bone repair principle is different. The cranial bone formation is mainly achieved through intramembranous osteogenesis. The cranial bone is a fibrous connective tissue where cells are differentiated from stromal cells. The stromal cells proliferate and then differentiate into osteoblasts. After that osteoblasts deposit collagen fibers and minerals in the bone plate, which enlarges the bone plate and promotes fracture healing (Catala, et al., 2019; Opperman, 2000). Long bones formation mainly through endochondral ossification. After a series of continuous and coordinated differentiation steps, stromal cells form cartilage plate, secrete alkaline phosphatase, and promote calcification of cartilage matrix. Osteogenic precursor cells deposit osteoid matrix in primary ossification center and then mineralize bone matrix to repair long bones (Hinton, et al., 2017; Katsimbri, 2017). It is true that there are differences between the two repair methods, and it is inappropriate to simply use skull defect repair to represent the long bone healing experiment. Due to time limitation and effect of COVID-19, we were hard to conduct the long bone repair experiment, which needs further discussion in the future. We have added the repair difference of skull and long bone, and the limitation of our research in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The mRNA expression levels of Gas5 in cancellous bone tissue in Gas5<sup>+/-</sup> mice should be determined if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. We euthanized <italic>Gas5</italic> knockout heterozygous mice and wild type control mice at week 12. Their femurs were collected. After rinsing the bone marrow cavity with syringe, the cancellous part was scraped. Due to the little amount, we collected the cancellous bone material from both sides of the same mouse together and performed RNA extraction using the RNA extraction method mentioned in the manuscript. The level of <italic>Gas5</italic> was detected after reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA. The results indicated that the expression of <italic>Gas5</italic> in cancellous bone of <italic>Gas5</italic> knockout heterozygous mice decreased compared with the wild type mice.

After Coomassie bright blue staining for the binding proteins of <italic>GAS5</italic>, mass spectrometry analysis was carried out for the 4 significant bands. The results were showed in Supplementary file 5. By combing the mass spectrum results, associated with the influence of <italic>GAS5</italic> on TGF-β/SMAD pathway suggested earlier, and combined the previous research that UPF1 could affect the protein level of <italic>SMAD7</italic>. We believe that UPF1 is the most likely protein to bind <italic>GAS5</italic> for downstream function regulation. For other proteins, we screened two of them for functional analysis. However, neither of them has a positive effect on the SMAD1/5/8 pathway when they were knock down by two selected siRNA.
