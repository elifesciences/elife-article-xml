The importance of convective flow in the subarachnoid and paravascular spaces has long been recognized; a recently proposed ‘glymphatic’ clearance mechanism additionally suggests that aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels facilitate convective transport through brain parenchyma. Here, the major experimental underpinnings of the glymphatic mechanism were re-examined by measurements of solute movement in mouse brain following intracisternal or intraparenchymal solute injection. We found that: (i) transport of fluorescent dextrans in brain parenchyma depended on dextran size in a manner consistent with diffusive rather than convective transport; (ii) transport of dextrans in the parenchymal extracellular space, measured by 2-photon fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, was not affected just after cardiorespiratory arrest; and (iii) <italic>Aqp4</italic> gene deletion did not impair transport of fluorescent solutes from sub-arachnoid space to brain in mice or rats.

The ECS consists of the ventricular system and subarachnoid space containing cerebrospinal fluid, the parenchymal ECS in grey and white matter, and para- and perivascular spaces that surround blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hladky and Barrand, 2014</xref>). The conventional paradigm, which is supported by a large body of experimental evidence, is that solute movement through the narrow, tortuous ECS in brain parenchyma occurs by a diffusive mechanism, whose determinants include solute size and physical properties, and ECS structure and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Syková and Nicholson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verkman, 2013</xref>).</p><p>More recently, Nedergaard and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>) have proposed that convective, ‘glymphatic’ flow of cerebrospinal fluid though the ECS from the para-arterial to the para-venous spaces is largely responsible for solute transport in parenchymal ECS. Glymphatic transport was proposed to have broad consequences in normal brain physiology and in the diseased brain, including clearance of β-amyloid in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>) and metabolic waste products during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), and removal of excess fluid in various forms of brain edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thrane et al., 2014</xref>). It was further proposed that AQP4, a water channel expressed on astrocyte endfeet, facilitates convective solute transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). The glymphatic mechanism and a role for AQP4 have been questioned based on apparent inconsistencies with prior data on solute transport in brain ECS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hladky and Barrand, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spector et al., 2015</xref>), as well as the uncertain plausibility of convective, pressure-driven fluid flow from para-arterial to para-venous spaces through parenchymal ECS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asgari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asgari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we re-examined the major experimental findings and predictions that underlie the glymphatic mechanism, including effects of solute size and <italic>Aqp4</italic> gene deletion on solute transport in brain ECS, as well as the immediate effects of cessation of cardiac and respiratory pulsations. The experimental data, together with quantitative modeling, do not support a glymphatic, convective mechanism of solute transport through brain parenchyma, but instead support the classical view of diffusive solute transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strongly size-dependent macroscopic solute transport in brain parenchyma</title><p>Diffusive transport depends strongly on solute size (hydrodynamic radius, R<sub>h</sub>), whereas convective transport of uncharged solutes through a porous medium is approximately independent of solute size if the ratio of solute size to pore size is less than ~0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dechadilok and Deen, 2009</xref>). To assess the relative importance of diffusion and convection in moving solutes from the subarachnoid space into brain parenchyma, fluorescently labeled, fixable dextrans (10, 70 and 2000 kDa) with different diffusional mobilities (R<sub>h</sub> of approximately 2, 5 and 12 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hadjiev and Amsden, 2015</xref>]) were co-injected into the cisterna magna and their distribution in the brain at 60 min was imaged. All three dextrans were seen at the brain surface and in the paravascular spaces after fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), confirming that solutes applied to the CSF can circulate around the brain and enter the paravascular spaces. Analysis of the fluorescence intensity of each dextran as a function of distance from the brain surface, where tracer is thought to accumulate in a sub-pial space that is contiguous with the paravascular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hladky and Barrand, 2014</xref>), demonstrated that transport into the brain was strongly size-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Modeling of diffusive transport using experimentally measured diffusion coefficients showed that the relative distance of dextran penetration is consistent with purely diffusive transport into the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, absolute penetration distances were not predicted accurately by the model, probably because additional factors, such as solute clearance or barriers between the subarachnoid and subpial spaces, also affect the extent of solute penetration in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27679.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strongly size-dependent penetration of dextrans into mouse brain from the subarachnoid space following intracisternal injection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images showing the distribution of 10, 70 and 2000 kDa fixable dextrans in brain 60 min after their co-injection into the cisterna magna.

However, subtle differences in the distribution of each dextran were seen at higher magnification, as only the smallest (10 kDa) dextran was observed accumulating around cell layers surrounding the vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that transport of large solutes in the paravascular spaces surrounding penetrating arterioles may be limited to the Virchow-Robin spaces in the proximal segment.</p><p>To study size-dependent movement of fluorescent solutes deeper in the brain under conditions where solutes are applied directly to the parenchyma, a small, ~1 nL volume of the dextran mixture was injected directly into the striatum of anesthetized mice using a fine glass needle and brains were fixed at 10 or 60 min after injection. At early times points the distribution of all three dextrans was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting similar convection into the brain during the pressure pulses applied to the injection pipette. However, dextran penetration from the injection site into the surrounding parenchyma at 60 min was strongly size-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Modeling indicated that the measured penetration distance at 60 min was consistent with purely diffusive transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Occasionally, when the injected dextran entered the paravascular space of vessels near the injection site, both the large and small dextrans traveled substantial distances away from the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that solute movement in brain parenchyma is primarily diffusive and non-directional, and support the long-standing idea that paravascular spaces act as a low resistance pathway for convective clearance of solutes from the brain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27679.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Strongly size-dependent transport of dextrans after direct injection into brain parenchyma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images showing the distribution of 10, 70 and 2000 kDa fixable dextrans at 10 and 60 min after coinjection into the striatum.

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching can detect spatial anisotropy in solute movement due to convection or diffusional anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Papadopoulos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). We used 2-photon fluorescence recovery after photobleaching through a cranial window to visualize solute movement in brain ECS. Raster scan-type bleaching under these circumstances is predicted to bleach a disk of depth 3 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazza et al., 2008</xref>). Initial experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) confirmed that that recovery time was approximately linear with radius of the bleached region for bleach regions less than ~40 μm diameter, as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazza et al., 2008</xref>), and that recovery time for a 500 kDa dextran in cortical parenchyma was ~3 fold slower than in a watery solution in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binder et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, recovery from bleaching in paravascular regions was substantially faster than that observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting a role for convection in this area.</p><p>FITC-dextran (500 kDa) was injected into brain cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left) and a circular spot of 10 μm diameter was bleached by ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> right, center). The data were analyzed by several methods designed to detect directional (convective) effects. In one approach, possible anisotropic fluorescence recovery was investigated by dividing the bleached region in quadrants and analyzing recovery in each quadrant, which showed similar recovery rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Simulations with applied convective flow demonstrated different rates of recovery in each quadrant with convection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In a second approach, recovery was analyzed in different regions along the expected direction of convective flow, away from a nearby penetrating arteriole. Comparison of experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) with simulated convection supports the absence of convective flow away from the arteriole. Finally, displacement of the centroid of the darkened bleached spot was determined in each frame after photobleaching, which would occur with convection, as simulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). No evidence for directional movement was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), with an upper limit of ~1 μm/min to convective flow, consistent with previous, macroscopic, failures to detect convection in grey matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenberg et al., 1980</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27679.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Two-photon photobleaching demonstrates non-directional solute transport in brain parenchyma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (left panel) Image of 500 kDa FITC-dextran in mouse cortex visualized by 2-photon fluorescence microscopy at a depth of 60 μm.

Additionally, chronic partial hypoxia may slow parenchymal transport by reducing ECS transport. To distinguish between these possibilities, photobleaching experiments were done to measure solute transport in the parenchyma following sudden cardiorespiratory arrest in which arterial and respiratory pulsations were abruptly terminated by intravenous injection of succinylcholine followed by air embolism.

Some amount of convective flow in the paravascular spaces is generally accepted, although the direction of this flow, its magnitude, and the mechanisms that regulate it remain less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hladky and Barrand, 2014</xref>). Whereas most previous authors have concluded that solute movement in brain parenchyma is adequately described by simple diffusion, Nedergaard and colleagues proposed that convective flow in the para-arterial spaces continues into the parenchyma resulting in directional clearance of solutes into the paravenous spaces, by a mechanism requiring AQP4 expression in astrocyte endfeet. Here, we independently tested several major predictions of the glymphatic hypothesis and find that: (i) <italic>Aqp4</italic> deletion does not impair transfer of solutes from CSF into the parenchyma; (ii) movement of fluorescent solutes of different sizes through brain parenchyma is consistent with their diffusion coefficients; and (iii) local movement of solutes in the parenchyma is not impaired just after cardiorespiratory arrest. These results do not support glymphatic, convective solute transport in brain parenchyma.</p><p>The experiments reported here add to recent work describing the fate of tracer molecules injected into the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedussi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedussi et al., 2017</xref>). We found size-independent distribution of cisternally injected dextrans into the paravascular spaces, but strongly size-dependent dextran penetration into the parenchyma. These results support convective solute transport in paravascular pathways, but provide evidence against a substantial role for convection in brain parenchyma. An interesting observation was that the smallest (10 kDa) dextran was seen in both the paravascular space between astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle and in the ‘perivascular’ space between the smooth muscle and endothelium, according to the terminology of Bakker <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakker et al., 2016</xref>). It remains unclear if accumulation of the small dextran in the perivascular space is due to size-dependent permeability of the living vessel or, alternatively, the early stages of clearance of the low molecular weight dextran along a separate pathway in the peri-arteriolar smooth muscle ring as recently suggested by Morris <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morris et al., 2016</xref>). Direct injection of dextrans into the striatum resulted in their symmetrical, size-dependent movement away from the injection site in a manner consistent with pure diffusion. As with cisternal injections, size-independent accumulation of tracers was observed in the paravascular spaces, consistent with previous measurements of the transport of large solutes during convection-enhanced delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foley et al., 2012</xref>). The relative homogeneity of the striatum results in approximately isotropic diffusion; however, this is unlikely to be the case in more organized regions of the brain where structural barriers, or regional variation in extracellular space fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McBain et al., 1990</xref>), will likely produce anisotropic diffusion. In white matter tracts, both diffusional anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Papadopoulos et al., 2005</xref>) and slow convection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenberg et al., 1980</xref>) have been demonstrated.</p><p>Similar observations were made, with dye visible in both the parenchyma and paravascular areas, when a larger volume of dextran was injected into the cortex and visualized by 2-photon imaging through a cranial window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Recent electron microscopy-level observations of astrocyte fine structure in vitrified samples, where tissue shrinkage during fixation is minimal, demonstrate that the paravascular space may be larger than previously appreciated and that endfoot coverage of vessels is incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). The apparent enrichment of dye around vessels is therefore consistent with a diffusional equilibrium between a fluid-filled paravascular space and a parenchyma with ECS volume fraction of ~0.2. We did not observe directional solute transport in the parenchyma in photobleaching experiments, where recovery of fluorescence in bleached disks was consistently isotropic. Reduction in the rate of solute transfer from the paravascular space to the parenchyma following unilateral internal carotid artery ligation led Iliff <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>) to conclude that cerebral arterial pulsatility is a key driver of paravascular solute influx into and through brain parenchyma. Although the role of arterial pulsation in moving CSF in the subarachnoid and paravascular spaces is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rennels et al., 1990</xref>), it had not been previously been suggested that arterial pulsation could drive fluid flow through the interstitial space. We directly assessed the contribution of arterial pulsatility to solute movement in the interstitial space by photobleaching of 150 kDa FITC-dextran and found that solute transport was unaltered in the period immediately following cardiac arrest. The substantial reduction in solute transport following anoxic depolarization seen at 4 min after cardiorespiratory arrest is consistent with previous reports of astrocyte swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risher et al., 2009</xref>) and hindered extracellular space diffusion due to increased tortuosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zoremba et al., 2008</xref>). We conclude that the reduction in parenchymal tracer accumulation observed by Iliff <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iliff et al., 2013</xref>) is likely due to factors other than inhibition of pulsatile flow through the interstitial space, such as reduction in ECS volume due to partial ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Syková et al., 1994</xref>) or inhibition of fluid movement in the paravascular space.</p><p>The glymphatic mechanism proposes glial involvement in solute transport facilitated by AQP4; however, we found that <italic>Aqp4</italic> deletion in mice or rats did not reduce, but perhaps slightly increased, the transfer of solutes into brain parenchyma following intracisternal injection. A small increase in parenchymal macromolecular diffusion in <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was previously found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binder et al., 2004</xref>), which is probably due to an expanded ECS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang and Verkman, 2010</xref>). The mildly greater solute diffusion in <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> than in <italic>Aqp4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mouse brain could account for the results here. The difference between the results here and the earlier report of Iliff <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>) may be due to differences in experimental methodology or data analysis. For example, beveled glass micropipettes of ~40 μm diameter and pulsed pressure injection were used here, whereas Iliff <italic>et al</italic>. used a 30-gauge metal syringe and constant flow injection for solute application into the cisterna magna. The choice of anesthetics may have also differed between the two sets of experiments (avertin vs. unspecified). The analysis method used by Iliff <italic>et al</italic>., and reproduced here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> for comparison purposes, is inherently non-quantitative as it is based on subjective intensity thresholding that treats large differences in fluorescence intensity, indicative of large variation in solute concentration, as equal. Finally, the experiments and their analyses here were done by an investigator blinded to genotype information. Our results also do not support a role for AQP4 in convection-driven clearance of beta amyloid, though they do not rule out the possibility that AQP4 may contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease in other ways.</p><p>In conclusion, our results do not support the glymphatic clearance mechanism proposed by Nedergaard and colleagues in which transfer of solutes from cerebrospinal to interstitial fluid requires AQP4-dependent convection in brain parenchyma. Instead, our data are consistent with modeling results demonstrating that parenchymal diffusion, coupled to convective or dispersive flow in the paravascular spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asgari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2016</xref>), is sufficient to explain movement of solutes in the brain. Further investigation of how AQP4 regulates the structure of the parenchymal and paravascular extracellular spaces is needed to clarify how its deletion or redistribution affects solute clearance from the brain. Our findings suggest the need for re-evaluation of the role AQP4 in other aspects of the glymphatic hypothesis, such as clearance of β-amyloid aggregates from the brain parenchyma and solute clearance during sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>10 kDa Alexa 647-labelled fixable dextran, 70 kDa tetramethylrhodamine-labeled lysine dextran and 2000 kDa fluorescein-labelled lysine dextran (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) were dissolved at 2.5 mg/ml each in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 150 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.8 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 min to remove aggregates.

A beveled glass micropipette of ~20 μm diameter containing 25 mg/ml fluorescein-dextran in aCSF was inserted at an angle of 30° into the cortex to a depth of 750 μm and ~200 nl of the dextran solution was pressure injected (10 psi, 50–100 ms pulse duration, 1 s duty cycle) over 3–5 min. The pipette was then withdrawn and a 5 mm diameter #1 glass coverslip was cemented with cyanoacrylate glue over the cranial window. Imaging was done on a Nikon A1R 2-photon scanning microscope using a 25x/1.1 N.A. water immersion objective lens. A 100 × 100 μm field of view at a depth of 60–80 μm from the cortical surface was used for measurements. Excitation was with a Spectra-Physics MaiTai DeepSee IR laser tuned to 840 nm. For measurement of lateral movement of bleached molecules in the parenchyma, a circular spot of 10 μm diameter was bleached with laser intensity tuned to give ~50–60% initial bleach depth, and recovery was followed for 60 s. Bleaching was done before and at different times after induction of cardiorespiratory arrest by iv injection of 100 μl of 5 mg/ml succinylcholine followed by embolization with 1 ml of air 30 s later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risher et al., 2009</xref>). Respiratory arrest occurred within 60 s of succinylcholine administration, with cessation of blood flow and the slight movement artifact caused by the pulse. Mean half-recovery times were determined for each condition as well as for in vitro reference experiments done in agarose gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image analysis</title><p>For experiments comparing uptake of tracers into brain parenchyma following injection into the cisterna magna of <italic>Aqp4<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Aqp4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, images of a whole brain hemisphere were captured with a 2x objective and analyzed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>), by measuring the fractional of the total brain area above an arbitrary threshold. The investigator performing the sectioning and image analysis was blinded to genotype information until analysis was complete. For quantitative comparison of labeling intensity as a function of distance from the brain surface, a 20x objective was used to capture three images sequentially from each channel by varying the exposure (1, 4 or 16 μs pixel dwell time) with constant detector gain. The average surface intensity was calculated from the short exposure time images and multiplied by the ratio of exposure durations to allow comparison with parenchymal staining intensity measured at longer exposure times. The linearity of this method was verified by measuring the intensity of a dilution series of each indicator at different exposure times. For determining movement of tracers out of the paravascular space in rat brain a linear analysis region was drawn at right angles to large diameter striatal vessels and fluorescence intensity along this line was determined. The distance at which fluorescence intensity decreased to half its initial value was then determined from four separate vessels for each animal and averaged.</p><p>Photobleaching data were analyzed using custom written Matlab algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Convection-Diffusion-Analysis-">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Convection-Diffusion-Analysis-</ext-link>) to track the center of the bleached spot and to determine possible angular asymmetry in fluorescence images during recovery. To identify angular asymmetry the spot was divided into four quadrants (each 90 degrees) and the averaged fluorescence recovery for each segment was plotted. As a more sensitive measurement of convection, the center of the bleached area in each frame during recovery was determined by scanning a circle of 10 μm diameter across the image and determining the position at which the maximum decrease of fluorescence intensity from basal conditions occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mathematical modeling</title><p>Dye diffusion from the surface to the parenchyma was modeled using the analytical solution to the diffusion equation to compare with experimental data. In vivo diffusion coefficients for dextrans and ovalbumin were taken from the literature as 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for ovalbumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tao and Nicholson, 1996</xref>), 5.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for 10 kDa dextran and 0.75 × 10<sup>−7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/s for 70 kDa dextran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nicholson and Tao, 1993</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers, Devin Binder, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports multiple lines of evidence that solute transport through the brain is independent of APQ4 function, and occurs in large part by diffusion rather than by convection. The results challenge a recently proposed glymphatic mechanism of convection solute transport in brain parenchyma. Experiments directly test and fail to replicate results presented previously by others. In addition, the authors present several other types of compelling evidence to support their conclusions. While overall supporting more of the diffusion mechanism than a &quot;glymphatic&quot; mechanism, this paper provides an incomplete test of the glymphatic mechanism described in Iliff et al. 2012 insofar as no direct test of the paravascular pathway is provided for protein solutes previously hypothesized to follow this pathway for clearance, such as amyloid-β. Tracking fluorescently labeled amyloid-β in the brain to directly refute or confirm Iliff et al. 2012's findings, would greatly strengthen the results. Otherwise, the experiments have been rigorously conducted, properly controlled, properly evaluated and convincing. These results are important for, and should be of interest to, a broad audience. The topic is an important one, and this study highlights the need for further work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The clever experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrate that the absence of respiratory and cardiac pulsations does not influence intraparenchymal solute diffusion; however, this does not directly test whether there is unchanged solute transport from paravascular space into parenchyma (which would be the analogous experiment to test the hypothesis of Iliff et al. (Iliff et al., 2014)). The authors should repeat this experiment with paravascular to parenchymal measurement over the same time windows (before CRA, 1-3min CRA and 4min CRA) to fully test this hypothesis.</p><p>2) The first sentence of the Results states that convective transport is approximately independent of solute size, whereas diffusive transport depends strongly on it. This statement critically underpins the interpretation of the subsequent results that the transport observed is dependent on solute size, and for this reason it should be supported by an authoritative reference. Most readers, myself included, will not be familiar with this topic and it would be important to provide quick access to a reference.</p><p>3) In both the current study Smith et al., and the previous study by Iliff et al., 2012, results from AQP4<sup>-/-</sup> mice play critical roles in the conclusions drawn. Since the conclusions of the two papers are opposite, it is important to compare the experiments conducted in each study. Smith et al. show in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> a direct replication attempt of the data shown in Iliff et al. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>. The Smith et data do not replicate that by Iliff et al., but instead suggest no effect of AQP4<sup>-/-</sup>. As noted in the summary, an experiment testing whether protein solutes, preferably A-β, diffuse similarly to dextrans, should be provided. Furthermore, this experiment appears to be underpowered, with only a small number of mice tested, and with significant variability between mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Test of the 'glymphatic' hypothesis demonstrates diffusive and aquaporin-4-independent solute transport in rodent brain parenchyma&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The experiment of Iliff et al., 2014 measured the rate of accumulation of dyes in the parenchyma after injection into the cisterna magna and subsequent transport through the perivascular spaces, a process that takes 20-30 min. The time frame for measuring the effect of acute cardiorespiratory arrest on solute transport, prior to anoxic depolarization and tissue swelling, is 3-4 min, meaning that transfer cannot be measured before swelling occurs. The simulations in the supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrate that our photobleaching experiments can detect directional convective flow from the paravascular space into the parenchyma. Additional discussion of the differences between our experiment and that of Iliff et al., 2014 has been added (Discussion) to clarify the differences in experimental protocol and the conclusions that can be drawn from them.</p><p><italic>2) The first sentence of the Results states that convective transport is approximately independent of solute size, whereas diffusive transport depends strongly on it.
