are highly temperature-dependent and may be modified by increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven heat events. Here, we show that altered patterns of temperature variance lead to an almost order-of-magnitude shift in thermal performance of host and pathogen life-history traits over and above the effects of mean temperature and, moreover, that different temperature regimes affect these traits differently. We found that diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C lowered infection rates and reduced spore burden compared to constant temperatures in our focal host <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> exposed to the microsporidium parasite <italic>Ordospora colligata</italic>. In contrast, a 3-day heatwave (+6°C) did not affect infection rates, but increased spore burden (relative to constant temperatures with the same mean) at 16°C, while reducing burden at higher temperatures. We conclude that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unanticipated effects on disease dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Global warming is increasing average temperatures and causing extreme temperature fluctuations and heatwaves.

It is now well-established that the interaction between hosts and their pathogens is sensitive to temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>). For example, disease transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Horin et al., 2013</xref>), host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dittmar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rohr and Raffel, 2010</xref>), and pathogen growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gehman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirk et al., 2018</xref>) can increase with temperature, while other host-pathogen life-history traits such as lifespan and fecundity can decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altizer et al., 2013</xref>). The interaction between temperature and multiple host and pathogen life-history traits highlights the inherent complexity of temperature effects on infectious diseases. Indeed, each host or pathogen trait may have a unique dependency on temperature and it is their combined effect (i.e., <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, disease outbreak, virulence) that is often of interest. However, while a growing body of theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>) and empirical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Horin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dallas and Drake, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gehman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) studies have quantified the effect of rising mean temperatures on host and pathogen traits (such as, e.g., within-host growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirk et al., 2018</xref>], pathogen transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirk et al., 2019</xref>], and epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gehman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shocket et al., 2018</xref>]), the influence of variable temperature regimes such as heatwaves and temperature fluctuations remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claar and Wood, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Climate change is predicted to increase not only mean temperatures, but also temperature fluctuations and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schär et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasseur et al., 2014</xref>). Such changes in temperature variance have the potential to modify host-pathogen dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, diurnal temperature fluctuations have been shown to increase malaria transmission at the lower end of the thermal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paaijmans et al., 2010</xref>), while short-term temperature fluctuations led to reduced transmission success due to lower filtration rates in a <italic>Daphnia</italic>-pathogen system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dallas and Drake, 2016</xref>). The effect of extreme heat events on host and pathogen traits is also highly variable and may depend on the magnitude, duration, and intensity of the applied heatwave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreven et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In a parasitoid-insect interaction, a heatwave of 5°C resulted in greater parasitoid development while a 10°C increase reduced parasitoid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreven et al., 2017</xref>). These apparent contrasting results in response to variation in temperature (here used to refer both to fluctuating temperature regimes and extreme heat events) imply that alternate temperature regimes or exposure to temperature shifts of different magnitudes will have distinct impacts on host-pathogen interactions. Indeed, whether all temperature variation acts in the same way or leads to different disease outcomes has been identified as a key open question in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examine the effect of different types of temperature variation on host-pathogen interactions across a broad range of mean temperatures. Specifically, we used the <italic>Daphnia magna</italic>—<italic>Odospora colligata</italic> host-pathogen system to test experimentally how temperature variation alters the thermal performance of both the host and the pathogen across their natural temperature range. <italic>Daphnia</italic> are a well-established ecological model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miner et al., 2012</xref>) used frequently in climate change studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dallas and Drake, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hector et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirk et al., 2020</xref>), while <italic>Ordospora</italic> transmission is representative of a classical environmentally transmitted pathogen (i.e., it mimics diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>) and meets the assumptions of conventional epidemiological models (e.g., infection following mass action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirk et al., 2019</xref>], continuous shedding of infectious particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebert, 2005</xref>] and little or no spatial structure within host populations). Our microcosm experiment comprised three distinct temperature regimes: constant temperatures and two variable temperature regimes with diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C and 3-day heatwaves of 6°C above ambient, all replicated over the natural temperature range of the model system (i.e., 10–28°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These variable temperature regimes were selected to mimic naturally occurring temperature events in habitats our study organisms encounter naturally (i.e., small ponds and rock pools) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuha et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The three temperature regimes used in our experiment.</title><p>Our experimental design comprised seven constant temperature regimes with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 28°C, five variable temperature regimes mimicking diurnal temperature fluctuations of ±3°C around the mean, and four heatwave regimes where temperatures were identical to the equivalent constant treatment except during a 3-day period between days 20 and 23 when temperatures were raised by 6°C. All temperature treatments were exposed to the <italic>Daphnia</italic> parasite <italic>Ordospora</italic> and to a placebo infection that served as a control for parasite exposure. Constant temperature regimes were replicated 12 times (7×12×2=168 individuals), while in the variable temperature regimes, the number of replicates was increased to 18 as we expected increased mortality in these treatments (5×18×2=180 and 4×18×2=144, respectively, for the fluctuating and heatwave regime). All animals were terminated after day 27 and fitness estimates were collected within 3 days.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72861-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>During the experiment, we measured host longevity, fecundity, infection status, and the number of <italic>O. colligate</italic> spores within the host gut (see Materials and methods for details). All measurements were conducted on individually kept <italic>Daphnia</italic> with up to 18 replicates per measurement. To compare the three different temperature regimes (i.e., constant, diurnal fluctuations, and heatwave; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we fitted a Beta Function using a Bayesian framework. While there are numerous non-linear functions that can be used to fit thermal performance curves (e.g., Briére, Ratkowsky equation), the advantage of using the Beta Function is that it provides realistic predictions when extrapolating beyond the measured thermal range and that each of its parameters has a clear a biological meaning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2016</xref>, for a comparison of thermal performance equations), where <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> is the fitness at optimal performance for the fitted host or parasite trait, <italic>T<sub>opt</sub></italic> is the temperature at optimal performance, and <italic>T<sub>min</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>max</sub></italic> are, respectively, the critical minimum and maximum temperatures over which fitness of the trait becomes unviable.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Diurnal temperature fluctuations narrowed the thermal performance curve for infectivity compared with constant temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The estimated (using the Beta Function) maximum temperature at which spores were able to cause infections was 5°C lower under fluctuating temperatures than under constant temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <italic>T<sub>max</sub></italic>=25°C for fluctuating vs. 30°C for constant; confidence intervals for <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> do not overlap). The thermal performance curve for infectivity under the heatwave, where temperatures were raised by 6°C for 3 days and then returned to constant temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), was almost identical to that under constant temperature (all confidence intervals overlap, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, unlike the constant temperature regime, the heatwave did not differ from the fluctuating regime, as estimates for the maximum temperature had broad confidence intervals, likely caused by lack of data at the higher temperatures. Remaining parameter estimates of the Beta Function were similar for the three temperature regimes, with the highest rate of infection at 19°C, a maximum infection rate of ~95% infection and no infections under 10°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; confidence intervals overlap for <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>, <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>min</sub>). Thus, while diurnal fluctuations led to less infection at higher temperatures, a heatwave did not alter infection rates.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Thermal performance curves of host and parasite life-history traits across our three temperature regimes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Infection rates of <italic>Ordospora</italic> in its <italic>Daphnia</italic> host.

Consistent with infection rates, daily temperature fluctuation led to a lower maximum temperature (by ~3°C) for parasite growth within the host, resulting in a narrowed thermal performance curve for burden compared with the other temperature regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, non-overlapping confidence intervals for <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>). This is supported further by the consistently lower spore burden for the fluctuating regime when compared with the constant temperature regime except near the optimum temperature of 19°C, where spore burdens of both temperature regimes were similar (confidence intervals for <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> and <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> overlap). While infection rates and burden showed a similar thermal performance for diurnal fluctuations (both narrowing), the response to the heatwave differed between infection and burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Compared to the constant temperature regime, spore burden in the heatwave showed a shift in the optimum temperature (from 19.4°C to 15.7°C), and an increase in the number of spore clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, confidence intervals for <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub> and <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic> do not overlap). However, while spore burden was different at ~16°C, spore burden at ~19°C was nearly identical for all three temperature regimes. Moreover, due to the opposite effects at 16°C for both variable temperature regimes (i.e., a narrowing of performance under fluctuating temperatures, exacerbation under heatwave), spore burden at this temperature differed by almost an order of magnitude (i.e., 86 vs. 737 spore clusters).</p><p>Host fitness was generally reduced when exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> spores or when experiencing variable temperature regimes. <italic>Daphnia</italic> exposed to the parasite had lower reproductive success near the optimum temperature (~20°C) compared to control animals that were not exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> (non-overlapping confidence intervals for <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic>) and lost between 8% (constant) and 24% (diurnal fluctuation) of reproductive output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Comparing host performance among the different temperature regimes shows that animals exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> in variable temperatures had lower reproductive success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals for <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic>), with a small shift (1.1°C) in their thermal optimum under the heatwave regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals for <italic>T</italic><sub>opt</sub>). Control animals that were not exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> also had lower fitness after the heatwave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals for <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic>) and, while reproduction at the optimal temperature of the control animals experiencing diurnal fluctuations was lower, confidence intervals overlapped with the constant temperature regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The host response to the variable temperature regimes differed from that of the pathogen (compare thermal performance curves for the heatwave and diurnal fluctuating regimes between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B &amp; C</xref>). While host performance was reduced (lower <italic>F<sub>m</sub></italic>) under both variable temperature regimes, parasite traits showed either a narrowing of the performance curve (for diurnal fluctuations) or no effect and greatly increased performance (for infection and burden under the heatwave).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reproductive success in <italic>Daphnia</italic> exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> and controls that were exposed to a placebo.</title><p><italic>Daphnia</italic> exposed to the parasite (dotted lines and filled symbols) produce less offspring than control individuals (solid lines and open symbols).

Indeed, each of the life-history traits we measured was affected differently by thermal variation. With global warming altering the mean and variance of temperature around the world, how this affects diseases and their dynamics is a critical outstanding question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claar and Wood, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the combined effect of changing temperature mean and variance can be highly complex, and may alter the vulnerability of host populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harvell et al., 2019</xref>), affect the evolution of host and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckley and Huey, 2016</xref>), and, therefore, impede our ability to accurately predict future disease outbreaks.</p><p>Infection rates were reduced at higher temperatures when animals experienced diurnal fluctuations but not after experiencing a heatwave. Our estimates of maximum temperature for the heatwave, however, have broad confidence intervals, likely due to the lack of data at high temperatures, and extrapolations of our results beyond our highest heatwave temperature (which was 22°C and reached 28°C during the 3-day heatwave which was close to the estimated maximum thermal tolerance of the parasite) should be interpreted with caution. In <italic>Daphnia</italic>, filtration rates determine the contact rate between host and pathogen, and a reduction in filtration can thus lead to reduced levels of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). As filtration rates of <italic>D. magna</italic> decline at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirk et al., 2019</xref>), average infection rates under diurnal temperature fluctuations would also be expected to be lower due to the non-linear nature of the thermal performance curve (i.e., Jensen’s inequality; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dowd et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, infection probability in our study system decreases sharply when temperatures surpass 22°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirk et al., 2019</xref>), reducing infection rates under fluctuating temperatures that exceed this temperature (again, due to Jensen’s inequality). In systems where immune function depends on temperature (e.g., insects, mosquitos, and ectotherms in general; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paaijmans et al., 2013</xref>), heatwaves may interact with the immune system in complex ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murdock et al., 2012</xref>), particularly when the heatwave occurs early in the infection process. However, given that our heatwave occurred 20 days post-infection and that <italic>Daphnia</italic> are not known to recover from infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebert, 2005</xref>), the effect of the heatwave on established infections may have been limited. Absence of an effect of a heatwave on infection rates has also been found for a pipefish-trematode host-parasite system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landis et al., 2012</xref>). However, though the heatwave did not affect infection rates in our experiment, it did affect parasite burden.</p><p>Our results show that different types of temperature variation can alter parasite burden and thus affect pathogen growth within the host. While diurnal temperature fluctuations and heatwaves brought about an almost order of magnitude difference in spore burden at a mean temperature of 16°C, no differences were observed at ~19°C. Generally, similar to infection rates, the thermal performance curve for spore burden narrowed under fluctuating temperatures, as predicted by averaging over the non-linear thermal performance curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denny, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dowd et al., 2015</xref>). The impact of diurnal temperature fluctuations on parasite fitness has been studied previously, with multiple studies suggesting a shift in the thermal performance of parasite fitness under fluctuating temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dallas and Drake, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenspan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paaijmans et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, our findings that <italic>Ordospora</italic> has a narrower thermal performance for spore burden and infectivity under fluctuating temperatures adds to a growing body of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dallas and Drake, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greenspan et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hector et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roth et al., 2010</xref>) suggesting that estimates and predictions that ignore temperature variation may over- or underestimate disease burden and prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenspan et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raffel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, with almost an order-of-magnitude difference between both our two variable temperature regimes at some, though not all, temperatures, our results highlight that both the context and type of temperature variance need to be considered when trying to understand how pathogen performance may be affected by climate change.</p><p>Spore burden increased following heatwaves, but the effect depended on the mean temperature to which the heatwave was applied. Indeed, the heatwave had either higher, similar or lower spore burden compared to the equivalent constant temperature regime. It was shown recently in a fish-tapeworm host-parasite system that parasite growth, egg production, and the number of first-stage larvae increased after a 1-week exposure to higher temperatures (increase up to 7.5°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franke et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings corroborate that heatwaves associated with climate change may, under some conditions, increase disease burden. Indeed, we found a considerable increase in spore burden and a shift in the optimum temperature following a 3-day increase in temperature of 6°C at 16°C. Although some studies have reported increased disease susceptibility following heatwaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dittmar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roth et al., 2010</xref>), others found no effect on immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stahlschmidt et al., 2017</xref>) or reduced disease performance after exposure to high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fayer et al., 1998</xref>). Our results may explain these conflicting findings—we found that the effects of a heatwave on spore burden are contingent on the mean temperature to which the heatwave is applied. That is, our results show that the heatwave has either lower or higher burden than equivalent constant temperatures. This context-dependency of heatwaves is supported further by studies in both plant-endoparasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreven et al., 2017</xref>) and herbivore-parasitoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) systems, which showed that the effect of a heatwave on parasite traits depended on the amplitude of the extreme event. As highlighted by a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claar and Wood, 2020</xref>), effects of warming events on disease traits remain difficult to generalize, and more studies and insight into underlying principles and mechanisms are needed to forecast the effect of extreme heat events on disease dynamics. Indeed, while it is clear from our experiment that a short, 3-day increase in temperature can drastically alter the thermal performance curve for parasite burden, the exact mechanism(s) underlying this change remains unidentified.</p><p>Differences in acclimatization speeds between hosts and pathogens may explain the observed increase in burden of <italic>Ordospora</italic> at 16°C following a heatwave. According to the temperature variability hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raffel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rohr et al., 2013</xref>), parasites, which have faster metabolic rates due to their smaller size, should acclimatise more rapidly to changing temperatures than their larger hosts. In unpredictable variable environments, such as our heatwave regime, parasites should thus have an advantage over their hosts. Moreover, host resistance may also decrease as a result of the trade-off between the energy demand for acclimatization and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson and Demas, 1996</xref>). That varying temperature can lead to higher infection prevalence has been established in Cuban tree frogs, red-spotted newts, and abalone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Horin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raffel et al., 2012</xref>). While this hypothesis may explain our observation of high burden for the heatwave near 16°C, it does not, however, explain why the response depends on the mean (i.e., lower performance at higher temperatures). Though <italic>Ordospora</italic> should have an overall advantage under the temperature variability hypothesis, the realized advantage may be smaller as its thermal range is more restricted than its host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirk et al., 2018</xref>). The heatwave may thus cause proportionally more stress in the parasite than the host at high temperatures, consistent with the thermal stress hypothesis, which suggests that a shift in temperature may reduce the performance of either host or parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paull et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, that thermal stress can affect host and pathogen performance has been well supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gehman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schreven et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, the observed increase in parasite burden due to heatwaves may be system-specific and not explained by differences in acclimatization speed. Estimates show that growth rates of <italic>Ordospora</italic> increase by a factor of 5 between 20°C and 24°C before declining again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirk et al., 2018</xref>). While the optimal performance of <italic>Ordospora</italic> occurs around 19°C, due to the balance of thermal performance curves of other host and pathogen traits (e.g., mortality, infectivity, etc.), a temporary increase to 22°C, as occurred under our heatwave at 16°C, may thus have exacerbated pathogen growth, particularly if different traits react differently to a temperature disturbance, which may have disrupted the balance between host and parasite.</p><p>Changes in host fecundity in response to temperature variation differed to the response of both parasite traits (i.e., infectivity and spore burden) we measured. While infectivity and burden had either a narrower thermal performance curve or showed a heightened and shifted peak, temperature variation lowered the reproductive output of the host near the thermal optimum. A reduction in reproductive output of the host under variable temperatures is consistent with previous work both on <italic>Daphnia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwartz et al., 2016</xref>) and in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Craig and Kipling, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uvarov et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, a reduction in host fecundity due to parasitism is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebert, 2005</xref>). Infection may also reduce the thermal tolerance of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hector et al., 2019</xref>), which would explain the small shift of the thermal optimum for host reproduction under the heatwave regime. While host responses are thus consistent with expectations, the distinct responses to the different temperature regimes of the different life-history traits we measured (i.e., host fecundity, parasite infectively, and parasite burden) highlight that the effects of temperature variation on host-pathogen systems are complex. When trying to model disease dynamics and outbreaks, we often include a multitude of host and pathogen traits, each with their own thermal dependencies. Recent studies have made advances in predicting disease growth and spread under rising mean temperatures, integrating approaches, and identifying mechanisms that can capture and predict the thermal performance of host and pathogen traits within epidemiological models (e.g., metabolic theory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirk et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be seen, however, whether such modeling frameworks can be extended to incorporate temperature variation, especially considering the distinct responses for the life-history traits we measured to each of our variable temperature regimes.</p><p>Our study shows that temperature variation alters the outcome of host-pathogen interactions in complex ways. Not only does temperature variation affect different host and pathogen life-history traits in a distinct way, but the type of variation and the mean temperature to which it is applied also matters, with up to an order of magnitude change between diurnal fluctuations in temperature and extreme heat events. With global warming altering both the mean and variance of temperature around the world, we can thus expect to see unanticipated changes in disease dynamics of host-pathogen systems. Indeed, extreme temperature events such as <italic>El Niño</italic> have been linked to disease-driven collapses of keystone predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harvell et al., 2019</xref>), increases in diseases such as dengue and cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anyamba et al., 2019</xref>), and shifts in the geographic distribution of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claar and Wood, 2020</xref>). While temperature variation can thus affect disease dynamics in human, wildlife, and livestock populations—with potentially devastating economic and health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altizer et al., 2013</xref>)—the complexity of the effects of temperature and its variation currently limits our ability to move beyond system-specific predictions, in particular for extreme temperature events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claar and Wood, 2020</xref>). We conclude that improving our mechanistic understanding of the role of temperature variation on disease dynamics, and exploring the generality of its effects and how it affects thermal performance curves of both hosts and parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claar and Wood, 2020</xref>), are critical to predicting disease dynamics in a warming world.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study system</title><p>The crustacean <italic>D. magna</italic> plays a key role in ecosystem functioning. <italic>Daphnia</italic> are filter feeders that consume planktonic algae and other microorganisms, thus promoting water transparency and helping to prevent algal blooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miner et al., 2012</xref>).

Each bath was regulated with a temperature controller (Inkbird ITC-308) that interfaced with cooling (Hailea HC300A) and heating (EHEIM JÄGER 300 W) units. Pumps (Micro-Jet Oxy) were used to create constant flow, which ensured equal temperature distribution within the water baths. Each bath held up to 99 microcosms and was kept under natural lighting conditions (16:8 light:dark). Temperature and light intensity were recorded using HOBO loggers housed in spare microcosms.

In the constant temperature regime, individual <italic>Daphnia</italic> were kept at one of seven temperatures for the whole experimental period (i.e., 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, and 28°C). The diurnal fluctuation regime comprised five temperature levels, which experienced the same mean temperature as the constant regimes but with a fluctuation of ±3°C every 12 hr (i.e., 10–16°C, 13–19°C, 16–22°C, 19–25°C, and 22–28°C), mimicking diurnal fluctuations in small rock pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobs et al., 2008</xref>). The heatwave was performed at four different temperature levels (13, 16, 19, and 22°C), with conditions identical to the constant regime except for an increase of 6°C for 72 hr, 20 days after animals were exposed to the parasite, mimicking a short heatwave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuha et al., 2018</xref>). We chose these temperature levels because of their relevance for our host and pathogen system, as no infection occurs below 12°C and hosts have high mortality above 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirk et al., 2019</xref>). Animals were kept individually in microcosms, organized into trays, and repositioned daily to avoid positioning effects. In each temperature regime, half of the microcosms were exposed to the parasite while the other half served as controls. For each of the constant temperature levels, we used 12 replicates for both animals exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> and control animals that received a placebo exposure. However, as we expected greater mortality in the variable temperature regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Régnière et al., 2012</xref>), we increased the number of replicates of these regimes to 18.

To generate sufficient animals for the experiment, we grew <italic>Daphnia</italic> asexually under standardized conditions for 3 weeks. Animals were raised in small populations (20 400 ml microcosms, 12 animals per microcosm) under continuous light at 20°C.

The experiment was initiated by collecting a cohort of female juveniles (~600 females up to 72 hr old) from the small population microcosms. Individual juveniles were then randomly transferred into 100 ml glass microcosms filled with 40 ml ADaM. These glass microcosms were placed into their assigned water baths and, after an acclimation period of 24 hr, the animals were exposed to the parasite by adding 1 ml medium containing ~10,000 spores of <italic>O. colligata</italic>. This spore solution was prepared by crushing 3560 infected <italic>D. magna</italic> individuals with known average burden (determined by using phase-contrast microscopy on a sub-sample), using mortar and pestle and diluting down the resulting spore slurry. The unexposed controls received a placebo exposure consisting of crushed uninfected animals diluted in medium. Animals were exposed either to the parasite or placebo for 6 days and were transferred subsequently to clean microcosms with fresh medium (80 ml of ADaM) twice a week until the end of the experiment. Animals were fed four times a week with an increasing amount of algae to accommodate the increased food demand of the growing animals (from 4 million algae ml<sup>–1</sup> at the start of the experiment to 10 million algae ml<sup>–1</sup> by day 10, which was maintained until the end of the experiment). Between transfers, evaporation of the medium was offset by refilling microcosms daily with 50-50 ADaM-distilled water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measurements of host and parasite life-history traits</title><p>To obtain fitness estimates for the host, we counted the offspring produced and checked mortality of all animals daily.

Any animals that remained alive until the end of the experiment (day 27) were terminated within 3 days, dissected and their infection status and burden determined without the observer being aware of the identity of the sample.

Any male <italic>Daphnia</italic> that were misidentified as female at the start of the experiment were also excluded. In addition, to prevent potentially confounding effects of animals that died early (where the parasite had less time to grow) as having lower spore burden, we included only animals from the last day of the experiment in the analysis of spore burden. Note that, to facilitate good estimates of spore burden, we terminated most hosts before natural death occurred, which limits our ability to assess the effects of virulence (host mortality, reduced fecundity).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analyses</title><p>Analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>) interfacing with JAGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lunn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Plummer et al., 2006</xref>).

The posterior distribution of all parameters was estimated using three chains, 10,000 posterior draws which were then thinned by 5 to yield 6000 samples (3∗10,000/5). Model convergence was checked using the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72861-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Priors for the parameters in the Beta Function.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72861-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Parameter estimates of the Beta Function for infection rates.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72861-supp2-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Parameter estimates of the Beta Function for spore burden of <italic>Ordospora colligata</italic>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72861-supp3-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Parameter estimates of the Beta Function for reproductive success of <italic>Daphnia magna</italic>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72861-supp4-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data and code are available on GitHub <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/charlyknz/HostParasite.git">https://github.com/charlyknz/HostParasite.git</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:67964f43c1c8e968797fe3c1f002890b22d57a41;origin=https://github.com/charlyknz/HostParasite;visit=swh:1:snp:a9a3352f637b9aef2cc5e527489c51b5b538296f;anchor=swh:1:rev:5f2604fe866f547dd80d5a77f99ef8887b9f10e1">swh:1:rev:5f2604fe866f547dd80d5a77f99ef8887b9f10e1</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kunze</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Luijckx</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Donohui</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>Alternate patterns of temperature variation bring about very different disease outcomes at different mean temperatures</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.w0vt4b8s3</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dieter Ebert and Jürgen Hottinger for provision of the biological materials, Alison Boyce for technical assistance in creating the water baths and Maren Striebel for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Line 84. Please mention the advantage of a β function over alternatives.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have expanded on the advantages of the β function over some of its alternatives and included a reference which compares multiple thermal performance curves. Accordingly, we have modified this section as follows (lines 83-87 on our revised manuscript):</p><p>“While there are numerous non-linear functions that can be used to fit thermal performance curves (e.g., Briére, Ratkowsky equation) the advantage of using the Β Function is that it provides realistic predictions when extrapolating beyond the measured thermal range and that each of its parameters has a clear a biological meaning (see Shi et al., 2016, for a comparison of thermal performance equations)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 105. 30C? Not sure I understood correctly, but max temp in constant regime in Figure 1 is set in 28C?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this was unclear. The 30℃ refers to the estimate generated by the Β Function, and not to the observations taken in this study. While this estimate for the maximum temperature is 2 ℃ beyond our last measured datapoint, its confidence intervals (28-34 ℃) and mean (30 ℃) fall well within the expectations based on previous studies (Kirk et al., 2018 Plos Biology and Kirk et al., 2019 Am. Nat.). In response, we have modified the sentence to now read (lines 106-109 on our revised manuscript):</p><p>“The estimated (using the Β Function) maximum temperature at which spores were able to cause infections was 5 °C lower under fluctuating temperatures than under constant temperatures (Figure 2A; T<sub>max</sub> = 25 °C for fluctuating vs. 30 °C for constant; confidence intervals for T<sub>max</sub> do not overlap).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please make it easy to understand the word *exposure*… across the ms you expose Daphnia to different temps, but also to pathogens, and unexposed controls were exposed to a Placebo. Figure 3 legend should be more specific, if you want to expose the reader to some clarity!</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, an excellent point. As infectious disease biologists, we often associate the word “exposure” with parasite exposure but, as the reviewer correctly points out, in our experiment we expose the animals to a wide variety of treatments. Accordingly, we have changed mentions of exposure throughout the manuscript to now specify explicitly what the animals were exposed to. That is; controls were exposed to a <italic>placebo</italic>, parasite treatments were exposed to <italic>Ordospora</italic> and these were crossed with exposure to different temperature regimes. We hope that this clarifies any unclarities and confusion in the text, figures, and legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As I mentioned I have no major concerns about the manuscript, I liked it very much.</p><p>My points (or advices) are as follows:</p><p>– The first (lines 184-187) and the third (lines 188-190) sentences of the discussion basically deliver the same information. I'd suggest to remove the latter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these sentences are indeed redundant and have removed the second sentence as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– lines 196-197: &quot;Infection rates were reduced at higher temperatures when animals experienced diurnal fluctuations but not after experiencing a heatwave.&quot; – given that (as authors suggest in the Results section – lines 108-111) the authors lack the data over 22C for heat wave treatment (for absolutely justified reasons), the statement that infection rates were not reduced at higher temperatures in this treatment has a limited support.

Therefore, I think it would be good to add to the above mentioned statement a similar in character 'warning' as authors did in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree fully. It would indeed not be recommended to extrapolate the results beyond the range of the data. Given that the heatwave at 22 ℃, which reaches 28 ℃ is already near the thermal optimum of the parasite, we do not, however, expect it to have had a significant impact our results. Nevertheless, in response to the comment of the reviewer, we have added the following sentence (lines 194-198 on our revised manuscript):</p><p>“Our estimates of maximum temperature for the heatwave, however, have broad confidence intervals, likely due to the lack of data at high temperatures, and extrapolations of our results beyond our highest heatwave temperature (which was 22 °C and reached 28 °C during the three-day heatwave which was close to the estimated maximum thermal tolerance of the parasite) should be interpreted with caution.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
