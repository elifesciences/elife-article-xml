emphasizing ethnicity as a major risk factor; however, the molecular determinants that drive aggressive progression of AA-TNBC remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that AA-TNBC cells are inherently aggressive, exhibiting elevated growth, migration, and cancer stem-like phenotype compared to WA-TNBC cells. Meta-analysis of RNA-sequencing data of multiple AA- and WA-TNBC cell lines shows enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathways in AA-TNBC cells. Enrichment of GLI1 and Notch1 pathway genes was observed in AA-TNBC. In line with this observation, analysis of TCGA dataset reveals a positive correlation between GLI1 and Notch1 in AA-TNBC and a negative correlation in WA-TNBC. Increased nuclear localization and interaction between GLI1 and Notch1 is observed in AA-TNBC cells. Of importance, inhibition of GLI1 and Notch1 synergistically improves the efficacy of chemotherapy in AA-TNBC cells. Combined treatment of AA-TNBC-derived tumors with GANT61, DAPT, and doxorubicin/carboplatin results in significant tumor regression, and tumor-dissociated cells show mitigated migration, invasion, mammosphere formation, and CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> population. Indeed, secondary tumors derived from triple-therapy-treated AA-TNBC tumors show diminished stem-like phenotype. Finally, we show that TNBC tumors from AA women express significantly higher level of GLI1 and Notch1 expression in comparison to TNBC tumors from WA women. This work sheds light on the racial disparity in TNBC, implicates the GLI1 and Notch1 axis as its functional mediators, and proposes a triple-combination therapy that can prove beneficial for AA-TNBC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>racial disparity</kwd><kwd>GLI1</kwd><kwd>Notch1</kwd><kwd>African American women</kwd><kwd>White American women</kwd><kwd>triple negative breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute, NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA204555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>Dipali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elucidation of GLI1-Notch1 axis as key determinant of racial disparity in TNBC growth in African American and White American women.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women worldwide, mortality associated with breast cancer has been declining owing to the development of novel therapeutics and ensuing advances in clinical care. A large decline in mortality for female breast cancer (by ~40% since 1989) has been observed, but a mortality gap exists between White American (WA) and African American (AA) women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Despite lower incidence rates (126.7/100,000 for AA vs. 130.8/100,000 for WA), AA women are 42% more likely to succumb to breast cancer-related mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeSantis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). The difference in breast cancer incidence and mortality for AA and WA women is most prevalent in younger age-groups and gradually converges in higher age-groups. AA women younger than 50 have 1.9â2.6 times higher breast cancer-related mortality compared to WA women, which declines to 1.1â1.2 times higher in 70â89 age-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeSantis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Higher breast cancer-related mortality in AA women can be partly explained by the disproportionately higher incidence rates for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). AA women have twice as high (38/100,000) TNBC incidence in comparison to WA women (19/100,000). TNBC is a very aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 receptor expression. Not only do AA women have higher TNBC incidence, but the survival rate for TNBC is also significantly lower in AA women in comparison to WA women (5-year relative survival of only 14% for AA in comparison to 36% for WA). Factors such as increased prevalence of obesity and comorbidities; late stage at diagnosis; aggressive tumor characteristics; and reduced access to timely prevention, early detection, and high-quality treatment may contribute to higher TNBC-related mortality in AA women. It is important to note that this disparity in TNBC-related survival in AA women vs. WA women is evident even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and access to medical care, strongly indicating a biological basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dietze et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Most of the studies examining gene expression distinctions in AA and WA breast tumors have identified intriguing patterns according to ethnicities/race but their association with clinical outcomes and different subtypes of breast cancer is largely unexplored. Comparative assessment of the genomic landscape of breast tumors from AA and WA women reveals that AA tumors show higher prevalence of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations (42.9% vs. 27.6%) and lower level of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations (20.0% vs. 33.9%) in comparison WA tumors. Greater intratumoral genetic heterogeneity including an enrichment of immortalization signature gene set is also observed in AA tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keenan et al., 2015</xref>). Even after matching tumors for pathological characteristics, distinct differences in multiple genes including CRYBB2, PSPHL, and SOS1 have been observed in AA vs. WA invasive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field et al., 2012</xref>). Several unique gene expression variations in breast tumors as well as tumor stroma are noted in AA that may support higher microvessel density and macrophage infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2013</xref>). While several cell cycle regulators such as <italic>CDKN2A (p16</italic>), <italic>CCNA2</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic>, and <italic>CCNE2</italic> express at a higher level in AA breast tumors, a unique gene set comprising of PSPHL, CXCL10, CXCL11, ISG20, and GMDS is overexpressed in AA tumor stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grunda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). It is intuitive that unique genetic profiles observed in AA vs. WA breast tumors may vary furthermore according to the subtype of breast cancer, hence appropriate subtype stratification is required. Despite higher prevalence of TNBC and poorer TNBC-related survival among AA women, very few studies have attempted to examine the molecular phenotype of AA-TNBC in direct comparison to WA-TNBC. No significant differences are reported in somatic mutations between AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC in a customized set of 151 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Omilian et al., 2020</xref>) but elevated expression of VEGF-activated genes and proliferation-associated gene signature, altered TP53, NFB1, and AKT pathways and increased microvessel density has been associated with AA-TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindner et al., 2013</xref>). While TNBC biology that drives the aggressive progression of AA-TNBC is still imprecise, it is clear that irrespective of stage at diagnosis, AA-TNBC is more aggressive with higher metastasis and a poorer survival than WA-TNBC.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to investigate the intrinsic differences in the molecular networks that may contribute to the racial disparity in TNBC progression in AA and WA women. We observed that AA-TNBC cells possess inherently higher migration and invasion potential along with elevated self-renewal potential and stem-like phenotype compared to WA-TNBC cells. Our study revealed an enrichment of <italic>glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1</italic> (GLI1) and Notch1 pathways in AA-TNBC as the key node and we found a positive correlation between GLI1 and Notch1 in AA-TNBC tumors in contrast to WA-TNBC tumors. Inhibiting GLI1 and Notch1 potentiates the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens in AA-TNBC and results in mitigation of stemness phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AA-TNBC cells possess distinct functional alterations to support aggressive tumor progression</title><p>With an aim to investigate the racial disparity in TNBC, we started this investigation by analyzing the SEER (The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program) data specifically focusing on differences between AA and WA women. Breast cancer incidence rates revealed higher incidences of TNBC among black women (including Hispanics) than white women (including Hispanics) over multiple years and several age-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Percentage of TNBC incidence among black women was twice as high as white women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The 5-year relative survival rate analysis for TNBC patients based on race/ethnicity and age showed a higher percentage of surviving population among white women (including Hispanics) than black women (including Hispanics) in all the age-groups (15â39, 40â64, 65â74, 75+ ages) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Black women showed higher prevalence of grade 3 TNBC at the time of diagnosis compared to white women (83.1% vs. 77.98%) in SEER dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of the TCGA data indicated higher percentage of AA-TNBC (18.75%) with stage III tumors than WA-TNBC (11.76%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Collectively, disparity in incidence, survival, as well as prevalence of higher-grade tumors at the time of diagnosis among AA and WA women indicated toward a biological basis and led us to test the hypothesis that TNBC arising in AA women are inherently wired for aggressive growth and metastatic progression. First, using multiple TNBC cell lines, we compared the growth and proliferation of AA- and WA-TNBC cells. AA-TNBC cells exhibited higher growth ranging from 2.5- to 4-fold (MDA-MB-468 â 2.5-fold, HCC1569 â 3-fold and HCC1806 â 4-fold) within 96 hr compared to WA-TNBC cells which exhibited growth ranging from 1.8- to 2.5-fold (Hs578t â 1.8-fold, HCC1937 â 2-fold, and BT549 â 2.5-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Trypan blue dye exclusion assay also revealed a 2.5-fold increased growth of AA-TNBC cells in comparison to WA-TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Next, to examine whether migratory potential of AA-TNBC cells differs from WA-TNBC cells, we performed scratch-migration and spheroid-migration assay. More rapid wound closure within 12 hr was observed for AA-TNBC cells (HCC1806 and HCC1569) in comparison to WA-TNBC cells (Hs578t and HCC1937) in a scratch-migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). HCC1806 and HCC1569 migrated at a speed of 3.1 and 2.8 Âµm/hr whereas Hs578t and HCC1937 migrated at a speed of 1.8 Âµm/hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Further validation of our observations using a 3D spheroid-migration assay showed increased migration of AA-TNBC cells from the spheroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). HCC1806 and HCC1569 cells migrated an average distance of 29 and 27.72 Âµm. In the case of Hs578t and HCC1937 spheroids, the distance traversed was 15.45 and 10.08 Âµm. AA-TNBC cells exhibited higher migration rate (1.209 and 1.155 Âµm/hr for HCC1806 and HCC1569 cells) than WA-TNBC cells which migrated at a speed of 0.644 (Hs578t) and 0.42 Âµm/hr (HCC1937) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). These results reveal that AA-TNBC cells have higher migratory potential compared to WA-TNBC cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>African American (AA) women exhibit higher triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) incidence and related mortality and AA-TNBC cells possess higher proliferation and migration potential compared to White American (WA) women.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Race-specific incidence rate of TNBC (female only) (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] data).

Furthermore, analyses of the RNA-sequencing data of TNBC cell lines from Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (available with Expression Atlas of EMBL-EBI database) revealed an upregulation of an embryonic stem cell pluripotency pathway in MDA-MB-468, HCC1806, and HCC1569 (AA-TNBC) cells in comparison to HCC1937, BT20, MDA-MB-231, Hs578t, and BT549 (WA-TNBC) cells. Increased expression of a set of 23 embryonic stemness-associated genes was noted in AA-TNBC cells compared to WA-TNBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Inspired by the results of the in silico analysis indicating inherently higher stemness in AA-TNBC cells, we assessed the self-renewal potential of AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC cells. Higher number of mammospheres (~2-fold increase) were formed by AA-TNBC cells in contrast to WA-TNBC cells which formed fewer mammospheres. Also, the mammospheres formed by AA-TNBC cells were larger in size in comparison to WA-TNBC mammospheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Next, we examined AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC cells for the presence of stemness markers, CD44 and CD49f, using FACS analysis. Higher population of CD44<sup>high</sup>/CD49f<sup>high</sup> breast cancer stem cell (BCSCs) was observed in AA-TNBC HCC1569 (80.7%) and HCC1806 (93.4%) while MDA-MB-468 cells showed slightly decreased levels (15.7%). Among WA-TNBC cells, Hs578t exhibited much lower levels of CD44<sup>high</sup>/CD49f<sup>high</sup> BCSCs (1.6%) whereas BT549 and HCC1937 cells showed slightly higher BCSCs (52.5% and 55.4%). Although variation in the CD44<sup>high</sup>/CD49f<sup>high</sup> population was noted among the AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC cells, AA-TNBC group presented higher overall stemness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, AA-TNBC cells showed elevated expression of embryonic stem cell markers, NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, compared to WA-TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Increased nuclear localization of cMyc, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 was also observed in AA-TNBC cells in contrast to WA-TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of Affymetrix and TCGA datasets revealed higher expression of CD44, KLF4, MYC, and NANOG in TNBC tumors from AA women compared to TNBC tumors from WA women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Collectively, these data show that TNBC in AA women have an inherent propensity for higher growth, migration, and stemness potential.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>African American (AA)-triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells possess higher stem cell enriched population than White American (WA)-TNBC cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of hallmark epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Tavazoie metastasis pathway in cancer between AA-TNBC samples and WA-TNBC samples from GSE46581 dataset (Gene Expression Omnibus).

To address this hypothesis, a co-expression analysis of GLI1 gene signature vs. Notch1 gene signature was conducted in AA-TNBC vs. WA-TNBC samples from TCGA dataset. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed a positive correlation between GLI1-associated genes signature and Notch1-associated gene signature in AA-TNBC tumors (n = 32, R = 0.4845) while a negative correlation was found in WA-TNBC patients (n = 68, R = â0.2220) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, these correlations are not strong and adding more clinical samples for AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC can likely strengthen these observations. We examined the physical interaction between GLI1 and NICD in AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC cells using immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis. Flag-tagged GLI1 was expressed in HCC1569 cells using hgliflag3x plasmid. Immunoprecipitates with GLI1 antibody showed the presence of NICD while IgG controls were negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Owing to the lack of tangible markers and ensuing targeted therapies, TNBC tumors are primarily treated with chemotherapy regimens.

Mice harboring HCC1806-derived tumors were regularly treated with various single agents as well as triple-combination therapies and tumor progression was monitored for 4 weeks. More rapid tumor progression was observed in control group compared to treatment groups. Corroborating our in vitro findings, mice treated with triple-combination therapies (DAPT + GANT61 + DOX/CARBO) exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth in comparison to mice treated with single agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Immunohistochemical analyses showed reduced Ki67, Oct4, and Sox2 staining in DAPT + GANT61 + DOX/CARBO-treated tumors in comparison to tumors from DOX-, CARBO-, GANT61-, and DAPT-treated groups, which showed denser staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Tumors from different treatment groups were dissociated into single cells and examined for their functional attributes pertaining to migration, invasion, and mammosphere-formation potential. Interestingly, tumor cells from triple-therapy treated groups exhibited significantly reduced transwell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6âfigure supplement 5</xref>) and Matrigel invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6âfigure supplement 6</xref>) compared to vehicle and single agent-treated groups. As expected, reduced migration of tumor cells was observed in tumor cell spheroids formed with tumor cells from triple-therapy-treated groups in comparison to vehicle and single agent-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Mammosphere formation potential was evaluated using serial dilution of tumor-derived cells. Decreased mammosphere formation was observed at all dilutions (500â8000 cells/well) for tumor cells from triple-therapy-treated group compared to vehicle and single agent-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Compared to vehicle and single agent treatment groups, reduced mammospheres were formed in DAPT + GANT61 + DOX/CARBO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Tumor-dissociated cells, examined for the presence of stemness marker CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup>, showed higher stemness in vehicle-treated group (87.6%) compared to triple-therapy-treated tumors (48.6% for DGD and 65.2% in CGD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Further, immunohistochemical analyses showed higher staining with OCT4 and SOX2 in vehicle and single agent treatment groups compared to DAPT + GANT61 + DOX/CARBO-treated tumors, which showed reduced OCT4/SOX2 staining indicating reduced stemness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>AA-TNBC cells inherently harbor higher stemness potential. Tumor-dissociated cells from CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT group consistently showed decreased migration, invasion potential, and mammosphere formation in comparison to CARBO and vehicle-treated groups prompting us to investigate if triple-therapy reduced stemness of AA-TNBC tumors. HCC1806-derived tumors from mice treated with vehicle, CARBO, and CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT groups were excised and dissociated to single cells followed by secondary transplants in limiting dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Regular monitoring of tumor incidence and progression uncovered that secondary xenografts from vehicle and CARBO-treated group showed larger tumors and a shorter tumor-free survival while the CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT-treated group exhibited smaller tumor load as well as a longer tumor-free survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT-treated tumor group exhibited significantly decreased tumor-initiating frequencies when transplanted into secondary hosts at limiting dilutions. Stem cell frequency was calculated based on tumor incidence in all treatment groups using L-Calc software for limiting dilution analysis (LDA). The frequency of breast tumor-initiating cells in the CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT-treated tumor group (CGD) was determined to be 1 in 1,178,112 cells compared to 1 in 70,160 cells in the control group and CARBO-treated group at week 3. Analysis at week 4 showed that the frequency of breast tumor-initiating cells in the CGD group remained at 1 in 1,178,112 cells in comparison to 1 in 6256 cells in the control group and CARBO-treated group. Of interest, CGD group consistently showed diminished stem cell frequency compared to CARBO-treated/vehicle group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Immunohistochemical analyses of tumors from CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT-treated group exhibited reduced levels of NICD and GLI1 expression in comparison to vehicle and CARBO-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Tumor-dissociated cells from CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT-treated group exhibited reduced aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (17.7%) in comparison to vehicle (45.5%) and CARBO (40.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Also, reduced percentage of ALDH<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT-treated group (2.5%) compared to vehicle (14.4%) and CARBO (10.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). CARBO + GANT61 + DAPT treatment also resulted in reduced percentage of CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> and CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD49f<sup>+</sup> cells in AA-TNBC tumors compared to vehicle and CARBO-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these results unequivocally present that triple-combination therapy effectively inhibits the growth of AA-TNBC tumors and abrogates the highly migratory, invasive, and stemness-rich phenotype of AA-TNBC tumors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Notch and GLI1 enhances the effect of carboplatin in African American (AA)-triple negative breast cancer (TNBC); Notch1 and GLI1 are overexpressed in AA-TNBC tissues in comparison to TNBC tissues from White American (WA) women.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic outline of the in vivo limiting dilution assay.

This study involved a total of 25 AA and 46 WA-TNBC samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of AA- and WA-TNBC tissues showed nuclear localization of NICD and GLI1 in tumor tissues with varying degrees of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Nuclear intensity of NICD and GLI1 was scored using modified histochemical-score (H-score) system (described in Materials and methods).

sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Existence of racial disparity in breast cancer-related mortality among AA and WA women cannot be completely explained by higher prevalence of TNBC, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, in AA women along with multiple socioeconomic features. We noted elevated incidence of TNBC and lower survival over all age-groups along with increased frequency of higher-grade tumors in AA women in SEER database and then embarked on investigating whether the TNBC arising in AA women are intrinsically wired to support rapid growth and metastasis. A direct comparison of AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC cells reveals several distinct features of AA-TNBC cells that advance our understanding in this regard. Particularly significant is that AA-TNBC cells inherently harbor a highly migratory and stemness-rich phenotype which is supported by the enrichment of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis pathway genes. Indeed, cancer stem-like cells obtained from AA-TNBC cell line show increased self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). Also, 48% TNBC in African women exhibit high ALDH+ population compared to non-African women where only 19â30% TNBC show high ALDH + population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginestier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nalwoga et al., 2010</xref>). Higher stemness in AA-TNBC tumors may also explain significantly higher recurrence and worse overall survival in AA women with TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doepker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siddharth and Sharma, 2018</xref>). Mechanistic evaluations identify elevated levels of Notch1 and GLI1 pathway genes in AA-TNBC cells and a positive correlation is observed between GLI1 gene signature and Notch1 gene signature in AA-TNBC tumors in contrast to WA-TNBC tumors. Few recent studies have investigated various biological aspects of racial disparity in TNBC. A comprehensive analysis of AA- and WA-TNBC tumors report that mutational landscape cannot explain the racial disparity between AA- and WA-TNBC as they have similar mutational profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ademuyiwa et al., 2017</xref>). AA women exhibit higher tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell density compared to white women indicating a potential involvement of immune landscape in racial disparity. Although no clear association is observed between CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell density and overall survival, higher CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell density in AA-TNBC associate with better overall survival which is paradoxical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdou et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, exosome analysis shows higher expression of exosomal-Annexin 2 (exo-AnxA2) in the sera of AA women with TNBC indicating its potential role in angiogenesis and tumor promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaudhary et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, proteome profiling of AA- and WA-TNBC exhibit very few alterations in proteins with HSP71 and HNRNP A2/B1 among the most altered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Torres-Luquis et al., 2019</xref>). AA- and WA-TNBC tumors show differential expression of Kaiso, which has also been linked with increased TNBC aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bassey-Archibong et al., 2017</xref>). Although some of these studies indicate molecular differences between AA- and WA-TNBC, identification of key nodes that can trigger a molecular cascade to alter tumor progression has not been investigated.</p><p>Our study uncovers that AA-TNBC cells harbor intrinsically elevated levels of GLI1 and Notch1 in comparison to WA-TNBC cells, a finding validated in TNBC tissues from AA and WA women. Of importance, GLI1 and Notch1 are transcription factors capable of mediating the transactivation of numerous responsive genes and modulating the biological outcome in AA-TNBC. GLI1 is overexpressed in BCSCs characterized by CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> phenotype compared to other cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) and is important for EMT and metastatic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colavito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riaz et al., 2018</xref>). Inhibiting sonic hedgehog pathway and GLI1 nuclear localization abrogates CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup> positive cell population in TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koike et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). GLI1 also associates with increased angiogenesis in TNBC as GLI1 overexpression pairs with VEGFR2 and its inhibition reduces tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Mauro et al., 2017</xref>). Although expressed in many subtypes of breast cancer, GLI1 preferentially promotes growth of ER-negative breast cancer cells and is associated with poorer survival with TNBC compared to ER-positive disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have reported a breast cancer subtype-specific relationship between GLI1 and various aspects of stemness and metastatic progression. Our results present that GLI1 is inherently expressed at a higher level in AA-TNBC which also harbor a highly migratory and stemness-rich phenotype in comparison to WA-TNBC. Although Notch1 can act as an oncogene as well as a tumor suppressor depending on the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lobry et al., 2014</xref>), its overexpression clearly associates with poor survival in TNBC. Higher growth, EMT, and stemness underlie aggressive metastatic progression of TNBC and worse overall survival. Notch1 can regulate these properties as it plays an important role in maintenance of BCSCs, EMT, as well as metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xie et al., 2017</xref>). Overexpression of Notch1 overlaps with ALDH1 expression in breast cancer tissues and significantly correlates with high grade, metastasis, and TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhong et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study shows a positive correlation between EMT-related genes and Notch1 activation in TNBC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miao et al., 2020</xref>). Positive association between Notch1 and EMT activator-melanoma cell adhesion molecule also denotes its role in EMT progression in TNBC, and accordingly, Notch1 inhibition reverses EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>). Our data uncovers an additional layer of complexity pertaining to Notch1 and racial disparity in TNBC, and presents a greater functional impact of Notch1 in AA-TNBC compared to WA-TNBC.</p><p>Another interesting observation of our study is the positive correlation between GLI1 gene signature and Notch1 gene signature in AA-TNBC tumors in contrast to WA-TNBC tumors. Although a previous study reported the upregulation of Notch-responsive gene HES1 via sonic hedgehog in multipotent mesodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingram et al., 2008</xref>) and co-targeting Notch and hedgehog depletes docetaxel-resistant cells in hormone refractory prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Domingo-Domenech et al., 2012</xref>), functional interactions between these important developmental pathways have been largely unexplored in breast cancer. We present a functional convergence between hedgehog/GLI and Notch pathways as their effector transcription factors, GLI1 and Notch1, exhibit nuclear co-localization and physical interaction via co-immunoprecipitation in AA-TNBC. Indeed, combined inhibition of GLI1 and Notch1 using GANT61 and DAPT exhibits synergistic inhibition of AA-TNBC cells indicating that targeting GLI1 and Notch1 in combination with chemotherapy may prove useful. TNBC are primarily treated with chemotherapy regimens but are marred with poor response and recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marra et al., 2020</xref>). In this context, regimens combining chemotherapy with GANT61 and DAPT not only show significant AA-TNBC tumor inhibition but also abrogate stem cell population. Several preclinical studies have examined the efficacy of notch pathway inhibition in cancer using anti-Notch monoclonal antibodies, peptide inhibitors, and Î³-secretase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Groth and Fortini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Massard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ran et al., 2017</xref>). Various inhibitors targeting hedgehog/GLI pathway including SMO inhibitors like vismodegib and sonidegib as well as GLI1 inhibitors like GANT58 and GANT61 are under preclinical investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhateja et al., 2019</xref>). A phase 1, interventional, non-randomized clinical trial examined the pharmacological and pharmacodynamics of Notch inhibitor MK-0752 and reported the preferred scheduling of MK-0752 which modulated Notch gene signature. The study reported the clinical benefit as some patients on MK-0752 exhibited stable disease for longer duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krop et al., 2012</xref>). Combining escalating doses of MK-0752 with docetaxel showed benefit for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schott et al., 2013</xref>). However, combining Notch inhibitor LY3039478 with additional anticancer agents (LY3023414, taladegib, or abemaciclib) did not yield superior results for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azaro et al., 2021</xref>). Few clinical trials are currently investigating the efficacy of AL101 (an inhibitor of gamma secretase-mediated Notch signaling) (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT04461600</italic>), and CB-103 (inhibitor of CSL-NICD gene transcription factor complex) (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT03422679</italic>). Clinical advances with Notch1 and GLI1 inhibitors will guide the suitable dosing schedules for targeting AA-TNBC. Also, further studies using AA-TNBC PDXs and clinically viable Notch and GLI1 inhibitors will help optimize dose and treatment schedules and strengthen the clinical utility of combination regimens utilizing GLI1/Notch1 inhibitors along with standard chemotherapy. Our results provide preclinical support for the clinical investigations where TNBC in AA women can be effectively treated via co-targeting the actionable key molecular nodes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results presented here explicitly demonstrate that AA-TNBC cells are highly migratory with elevated self-renewal potential and stem-like phenotype compared to WA-TNBC. We uncover the aberrant activation and functional interaction of Notch1 and GLI1 in AA-TNBC. In addition, combining chemotherapy which inhibits bulk tumor with Notch1 and GLI1 inhibitors that abrogate stemness display an excellent synergy in inhibiting AA-TNBC, hence providing a potent therapeutic option for abrogating TNBC in AA women. As we move toward personalized therapy for cancer management, race of the individual has presented another variable to consider, especially to counter racial disparity. Understanding the unique biology of TNBC arising in AA women and guiding the therapeutic regimens on its basis is very challenging, yet very exciting goal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The major issue is that the treatments ( DAPT, GANT61, alone and in combination as well as in combination with doxorubicin or carboplatin) are evaluated solely in the cell lines from African American women. There are two problems here. One is related to all of the data that precedes the chemotherapy testing that suggests that the combinations may not (or should not?) be equally effective in breast tumors of Caucasian women. This may not prove to be the case, which would raise issues as to the relationship of the two sets of findings. The other is relevant in terms of whether some of the proposed therapies should ultimately also be investigated in clinical trials that include Caucasian women, should this work reach that point.</p><p>This is not to say that all of the chemotherapy testing should be repeated in the breast tumor cells from Caucasian women. But the authors are obligated to at least perform some of the key experiments in these cell lines.</p><p>2. The drug efficacy studies appear to be poorly rationalized. In Figure 6: The authors show that a triple combination of drug is superior than a single drug alone. This is not surprising, and I can think of few occasions where 3 agents were not superior to one. It is unclear why the authors are testing combinations with Dox or carbo. The real question is, does the Notch/GLI1 inhibitor combination fare better in AA BC tumors than the current standard of care, such as combined doxorubicin plus taxol? And, does it fare better in AA tumors compared to WA tumors? Such findings would greatly strengthen the impact of the work.</p><p>3. Figure 5, the interaction between Notch and GLI, is the weakest part of the manuscript. The authors should perform IP-western on endogenous proteins in both directions, and confirm using proximity ligation analyses. Also there needs to be a functional assay: does Notch enhance transactivation by GLI, and/or vice versa? Co-IF of two proteins does not indicate interaction; can the authors show whether these two proteins interact directly, for example using recombinant protein? Finally, the authors should provide insight as to why WA TNBC cells show very little NICD compared to AA TNBC cells even after IP.</p><p>4. The presented data in Figure 2G are not very impressive, better quality images may be presented. It is not clear whether Oct4, Nanog, and <italic>SOX2</italic> are localized in nucleus or cytoplasmic compartment.</p><p>5. The abstract does not cover all the key data presented in the manuscript. Similarly, the Discussion section also needs improvement by highlighting the key findings and their implications in the field. For example, first paragraph of the discussion is mostly repetition of the results.</p><p>6. How is ethnicity reported in TCGA? Did the authors use ancestry markers in order to validate ethnicity (WA vs AA)?</p><p>7. In Figure 7 it is not clear why the authors are adding carbo or dox; the real question is do Notch/GLI1 inhibitor combination cause reduced Aldefluor activity? Also the authors should shows some of the IHC data in the TMA.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors were attempting to determine the basis for the higher incidence of triple negative breast cancer in African American versus Caucasian women and reduced survival in the African American population. The studies presented are quite rigorous and largely convincing. The authors utilized both clinical data, cell culture approaches as well as experiments in tumor bearing animals to address these questions. They also identified potential new therapeutic approaches. The extensive experimental work and data generated largely support the conclusions presented.</p><p>This work is likely to have a significant impact in the field of breast cancer, in large part by providing a framework or roadmap as to how studies addressing these types of questions should be performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors demonstrate that TNBC cells derived from AA patients are aggressive and show cancer stem-like phenotype compared to TNBC cells derived from White-American (WA). They observed enrichment as well as nuclear localization of GLI1 and Notch1 pathways in AA-TNBC cells compared to WA-TNBC cells. They further observed that GLI1 interacts with Notch1 in AA-TNBC cells and inhibition of GLI1 and Notch1 synergistically inhibits tumor growth, stemness, and cancer promoting functions. Clinically, they observed that GLI1 and cytoplasmic domain or Notch intracellular domain (NICD) are overexpressed in TNBC tissues from AA women. These observation are highly interesting and provide the molecular basis of breast cancer health disparity among American women. The presented data support the conclusion drawn in this manuscript, but some aspects of the manuscript need clarification and justification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript analyzes TCGA data from TNBC from African American (AA) and white American (WA) women. TCGA data indicates that there is a higher GLI and Notch signature in AA women, and analysis of a small subset of cell lines from AAM vs WA women (between 4-7 lines) suggests that GLI1 and Notch are overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines from AA as well. These findings are corroborated with tumor micro-array data, and this is a strength. Overall the conclusion that Notch and GLI are increased in AA TNBC is well supported by the data presented.</p><p>Weaknesses include the superficial nature of the description of the interaction between Notch and GLI1: it is unclear whether these proteins bind directly, and/or what the impact of this complex is on either Notch or GLI1 function. Additionally, the drug efficacy studies compare triple agents versus a single agent; it is not surprising that 3 agents work better than one.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70729.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Mice harboring HCC1806, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231-derived tumors were regularly treated with DAPT + GANT61 combination or Doxorubicin + Carboplatin combination and tumor progression was monitored. AA-TNBC (HCC1806) tumors showed more effective growth inhibition in response to DAPT + GANT61 in comparison to chemotherapy combination whereas WA-TNBC (HCC1937 and MDA-MB-231) tumors showed enhanced growth inhibition in response to Doxorubicin + Carboplatin combination. GANT61 + DAPT combination treatment did not reduce the growth of WA-TNBC cells-derived tumors (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Tumor dissociated cells from WA-TNBC-HCC1937-derived tumors showed no/low reduction of the Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in response to DAPT + GANT61 combination treatment (32.7%) in comparison to vehicle-treated group (36.5%) and DOX-CARBO group (31.9%). In contrast, AA-TNBC-HCC1806-derived tumors exhibited reduced Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in DAPT + GANT61 treatment group (53.3%) compared to vehicle-treated group (77.5%) and DOX-CARBO (66.4%) (Figure 6A, Figure 6âfigure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have performed multiple experiments to strengthen the interaction between Notch1 and GLI1. WA TNBC cells show very little NICD compared to AA TNBC cells even after IP because WA TNBC cells have very low level of endogenous NICD in comparison to AA TNBC cells. We use same amount of input protein to immunoprecipitate NICD in both sets of cell lines.</p><p>We further evaluated the interaction between nuclear GLI1 and nuclear NICD endogenously present in AA-TNBC and WA-TNBC cells. In a coimmunoprecipitation assay, NICD was immunoprecipitated with GLI1 antibody in the nuclear extracts of AA-TNBC cells while low/no presence of NICD was observed in GLI1-immunoprecipitates in WA-TNBC cells (Figure 5C). In a reciprocal analysis, GLI1 was immunoprecipitated with NICD antibody in the nuclear extracts of AA-TNBC cells while low/no pulldown of GLI1 with Notch1 was observed in WA-TNBC cells (Figure 5C). Next, we investigated whether GLI1 overexpression influences transcriptional activity of NICD in AA-TNBC. Cells overexpressing GLI1 exhibited increased NICD transactivation in a luciferase assay (Figure 5D) and also, showed increased expression of Notch-responsive genes-Hes1 and Hey1 (Figure 5E). Notch1 overexpression also led to increased expression of GLI1-responsive gene-FOXM1 (Figure 5E).

We have provided more data to show the interaction between Notch1 and GLI1 in AA-TNBC. We show that endogenous Notch1 protein can pulldown GLI1 in a coimmunoprecipitation assay and vice versa in AA-TNBC cells while no interaction is observed in WA-TNBC cells. Overexpression of GLI1 increases Notch1 transactivation. GLI1 overexpression increases the expression of Notch1-responsive genes and Notch1 overexpression increases the expression of GLI1-responsive gene. Together, these data show that GLI1 and Notch1 interact in AA-TNBC. We show that combined treatment with GLI inhibitor + Notch inhibitor results in more effective inhibition of AA-TNBC cell-derived tumors in comparison to Doxorubicin and Carboplatin combination. In contrast, WA-TNBC cells-derived tumors do not respond to combined treatment with GLI inhibitor + Notch inhibitor. These studies provide the rationale for examining the GLI1 + Notch inhibitor combination in AA-TNBC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
