specified at the neural plate border, as characterized by <italic>Pax7</italic> expression. Using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with high-resolution <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to identify novel transcriptional regulators, we show that chromatin remodeler <italic>Hmga1</italic> is highly expressed prior to specification and maintained in migrating chick neural crest cells. Temporally controlled CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockouts uncovered two distinct functions of <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest development. At the neural plate border, <italic>Hmga1</italic> regulates Pax7-dependent neural crest lineage specification. At premigratory stages, a second role manifests where <italic>Hmga1</italic> loss reduces cranial crest emigration from the dorsal neural tube independent of <italic>Pax7.</italic> Interestingly, this is rescued by stabilized ß-catenin, thus implicating <italic>Hmga1</italic> as a canonical Wnt activator. Together, our results show that <italic>Hmga1</italic> functions in a bimodal manner during neural crest development to regulate specification at the neural plate border, and subsequent emigration from the neural tube via canonical Wnt signaling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The neural plate is a structure that serves as the basis for the brain and central nervous system during the development of animals with a backbone.

Originating at the neural plate border, these cells occupy the leading edges of the closing neural folds during neurulation. Subsequently, premigratory neural crest cells that initially reside within the dorsal aspect of the developing neural tube undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in order to delaminate and migrate extensively. Upon reaching their terminal locations within the embryo, neural crest cells differentiate into a plethora of derivatives, including craniofacial cartilage, pigment cells, smooth muscle, and peripheral neurons and glia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gandhi and Bronner, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A feed-forward gene regulatory network (GRN) underlies the formation of the neural crest, from induction at the neural plate border to final differentiation into a multitude of cell types. This GRN is comprised of transcription factors and signaling pathways, partitioned into developmental modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martik and Bronner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simões-Costa et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, new tools like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) have enabled analysis of the neural crest GRN at a global level, helping to clarify lineage trajectories and elucidate key biological processes therein, ranging from proliferation to differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). These approaches have opened the way to extensive functional analysis of important nodes within the GRN, particularly at early stages of neural crest development, which are less well-studied.</p><p>Neural crest formation begins at the gastrula stage, with establishment of the presumptive neural ectoderm bordering the non-neural ectoderm. Quantitative gene expression analysis of gastrula stage chick embryos has revealed a surprisingly high degree of overlap of multiple transcription factors associated with diverse cell types within single cells in the early neural plate border region, ranging from markers characteristic of the neural crest (<italic>Pax7</italic>), to neural (<italic>Sox2</italic>) and placodal (<italic>Six1</italic>) cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>). This is consistent with the possibility that cells in the neural plate border are transcriptionally primed toward multiple cell fates, rather than committed to a particular lineage. What then leads to cell lineage commitment and specification toward neural crest rather than alternative fates, and to their subsequent ability to initiate migration from the neural tube? One possibility is that previously unidentified transcriptional and epigenetic regulators play a critical role in these processes.</p><p>In this study, we used scRNA-seq to identify novel transcription factors and chromatin remodelers expressed in neural crest cells of the early chick embryo. We first describe the single-cell transcriptome of early migrating neural crest cells emerging from the hindbrain, with a focus on identifying new transcriptional regulators. One of the genes uncovered in the neural crest cluster was <italic>Hmga1</italic>, a non-histone chromatin remodeler that has known roles in tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Resar et al., 2018</xref>), but has been understudied in development. We first characterized the expression and function of <italic>Hmga1</italic> during neural crest development using <italic>in situ</italic> Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) and observed <italic>Hmga1</italic> transcripts enriched in the neural crest, with the onset of expression preceding neural crest specification in the neural plate border. To test its functional role in neural crest development, we used plasmid- and protein-based CRISPR-Cas9 strategies to knock out <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest progenitors with temporal precision. The results demonstrate an early role for <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest lineage specification in a <italic>Pax7</italic>-dependent manner, resulting in the downregulation of neural crest specifier genes such as Snail2<italic>, FoxD3,</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic>. Interestingly, loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> after completion of neural crest specification revealed a distinct set of defects in cranial neural crest emigration and migration. Using in situ hybridization and a fluorescent protein-based reporter, we show that this is a consequence of reduced canonical Wnt activity mediated by <italic>Wnt1</italic>, which can be rescued by concomitantly expressing stabilized ß-catenin, thus establishing a separate role for <italic>Hmga1</italic> in delaminating neural crest cells as a Wnt pathway activator. Taken together, these results identify a dual role for <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest development with an early effect on neural crest specification and a later effect on initiation of migration via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, mechanisms that may be inappropriately redeployed during tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq of early migrating hindbrain neural crest reveals novel transcriptional regulators</title><p>Many RNA-seq datasets have sought to examine genes that are enriched in cranial neural crest cells compared with other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simões-Costa et al., 2014</xref>) or axial levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martik et al., 2019</xref>). However, here we aimed to identify highly expressed transcription factors and chromatin remodelers that may have been missed due to overlapping expression between neural crest cells and surrounding tissues.

To this end, we shortlisted all genes associated with the gene ontology terms ‘DNA-binding’, ‘regulation of transcription’, and ‘transcription factor’. This revealed several chromatin remodelers and transcription factors with high levels of expression in neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The identified genes fell into two groups, the first of which was comprised of transcription factors enriched in neural crest cells, with little overlap in surrounding cell types. As expected, many of these genes, including <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Ets1</italic>, <italic>MafB</italic>, and <italic>Nrip1,</italic> are known for their expression in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gandhi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tani-Matsuhana et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, the second group was comprised of chromatin remodelers and/or transcriptional regulators previously overlooked in bulk transcriptomic datasets, including <italic>Hmga1</italic>, <italic>Dact2, Ssrp1</italic>, and <italic>Tbxl1x</italic>, due to overlapping expression in other tissues. Indeed, their distribution in low-dimensional space confirmed that a high proportion of cells in the hindbrain and/or ectoderm also expressed these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The expression of a subset of the above genes was validated at HH12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–K</xref>) by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization chain reaction (HCR), which revealed an abundance of transcripts in both r4 and r6 neural crest streams that emerge from the hindbrain. Taken together, the results show that our single-cell gene expression analysis is sufficient to resolve the underlying heterogeneity of the chick hindbrain. We also identified several genes expressed in migrating neural crest cells not highlighted in previous datasets given their broad expression in other tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Hmga1</italic> is expressed in the neural plate, neural plate border, and neural crest cells</title><p>Of the novel transcriptional regulators that were previously overlooked in bulk transcriptomic datasets, we were particularly intrigued by the chromatin remodeler <italic>Hmga1,</italic> due to its extensively studied role in tumorigenesis. A member of the High Motility Group A (HMGA) superfamily, <italic>Hmga1</italic> encodes a small, nonhistone chromatin remodeling protein that binds to the minor groove of DNA, thereby affecting the chromatin landscape and facilitating the binding of other transcription factors in the opposing major groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosschedl et al., 1994</xref>). In developing mouse embryos, Hmga1 has been shown to have widespread expression across several tissues, including the brain, where its loss has been correlated with reduced developmental potential of neural precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kishi et al., 2012</xref>). While well-studied in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masciullo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarhadi et al., 2006</xref>), little was known about its developmental function in neural crest cells. Given the parallels between the mechanisms that regulate delamination, migration, proliferation, and survival of neural crest cells and tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallik et al., 2017</xref>), we sought to characterize the expression of <italic>Hmga1</italic> during neural crest development.</p><p>At HH12, <italic>Hmga1</italic> was observed in migrating neural crest streams emanating from rhombomeres 4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), and in the cranial mesenchyme, suggesting that its expression is not restricted to the hindbrain neural crest.

Next, we investigated the effect of knocking out <italic>Hmga1</italic> on <italic>Pax7</italic> expression in neural crest cells. We examined <italic>Pax7</italic> mRNA expression by HCR in embryos where <italic>Hmga1</italic> was knocked out on the right side, relative to the left side which served as an internal control.

Next, we assessed whether the reduction in <italic>Pax7</italic> transcripts would consequently result in a loss of Pax7 protein in the neural crest by immunostaining <italic>Hmga1</italic>-knockout embryos with a Pax7 antibody. As expected, Pax7 protein levels were dramatically reduced in the migratory cranial neural crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H’</xref>), with further analysis revealing a significant decrease in the number of Pax7+ cells on the knockout side compared to the control side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, student’s t-test).

Taken together, our results indicate that <italic>Hmga1</italic> is important for proper specification of neural crest cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hmga1 regulates expression of <italic>Pax7</italic> in neural crest precursors in the neural plate border</title><p>As the expression of <italic>Hmga1</italic> precedes that of <italic>Pax7</italic> in the neural plate border, and its loss also causes a reduction of <italic>Pax7</italic> levels in neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we next asked if this regulation occurs in the neural crest precursors that reside in the neural plate border. In the preceding experiments, we characterized the expression of neural crest markers following CRISPR-plasmid-mediated loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> at stages corresponding to early stages of neural crest emigration and migration. However, one caveat to our plasmid knockout strategy is that it takes time after electroporation of the CRISPR constructs in gastrula stage embryos for Cas9 to transcribe, translate, and properly fold to form a functional Cas9-gRNA complex. As specification of neural crest cells at the neural plate border is ongoing at HH4, this means that functional Cas9 would not be available until well after initial electroporation. Given that neural crest development occurs in a rostral-to-caudal wave along the body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gandhi and Bronner, 2018</xref>), we speculated that effects of plasmid electroporation would be more penetrant in the hindbrain compared to anterior regions of the embryo, such as the midbrain.

Accordingly, we noticed that while this ratio was 0.948 ± 0.036 (n = 5) at the midbrain level, it was significantly reduced in the dorsal hindbrain, with a mean ratio of 0.69 ± 0.08 (n = 5; p&lt;0.05, paired Student’s t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

This in turn influences neural crest EMT and delamination from the dorsal neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Current model for <italic>Hmga1</italic> function in chick neural crest development.</title><p>Our data suggest that <italic>Hmga1</italic> plays temporally distinct roles in the neural plate border and dorsal neural tube.

Later, in the dorsal neural tube, <italic>Hmga1</italic> regulates the levels of <italic>Wnt1</italic>, thereby modulating the levels of canonical Wnt signaling to control neural crest delamination and subsequent migration.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57779-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is a major input in a complex GRN that activates transcriptional circuits and controls neural crest specification and cell lineage decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martik and Bronner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2019</xref>), influencing multiple aspects of neural crest development from induction at the neural plate border to proliferation, onset of migration via EMT, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milet and Monsoro-Burq, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rabadán et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Steventon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yanfeng et al., 2003</xref>). For example, regulation of the levels of canonical Wnt signaling is critical for progressive basement membrane remodeling during neural tube closure and neural crest delamination. Consequently, perturbation of Wnt signaling output at different stages of basement membrane remodeling or delamination causes severe defects in neural crest EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutchins and Bronner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rabadán et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, early inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling in gastrula stage chick embryos has been shown to reduce <italic>Pax7</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basch et al., 2006</xref>), whereas canonical Wnt inhibition after neural crest specification does not alter Pax7 expression but has a marked effect on EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hutchins and Bronner, 2018</xref>). This suggests that there are separable early versus late effects of canonical Wnt signaling during neural crest development.</p><p>Hmga1 has been shown to upregulate canonical Wnt signaling components and downstream targets in the intestinal stem cell niche, thereby amplifying signaling output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xian et al., 2017</xref>) presumably through increased promotor accessibility. Our results are consistent with a similar role for <italic>Hmga1</italic> in the neural crest, where its loss resulted in decreased output from a canonical Wnt reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) as well as downregulation of the <italic>Wnt1</italic> ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the canonical Wnt target Snail2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, temporally controlled knockdowns revealed that loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> reduced <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression following completion of neural crest specification, but not at earlier stages of neural crest induction. Conversely, <italic>Hmga1</italic> knockdown affected <italic>Pax7</italic> expression during neural crest induction but not after specification is complete. One possible explanation is that once open/remodeled, the chromatin landscape surrounding the <italic>Pax7</italic> regulatory regions form topologically associating domains (TADs) that are stable and resistant to repression. Alternatively, other Hmga1-independent <italic>cis</italic>-elements may influence <italic>Pax7</italic> expression following neural crest induction. Given that neural crest cells appear to have highly dynamic chromatin accessibility surrounding spatiotemporally regulated enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2019</xref>), we would predict the latter, although further investigation is needed to distinguish between these possibilities.</p><p>An intriguing possibility is that Hmga1, in addition to regulating neural crest EMT, is necessary for maintaining the broad developmental potential of neural crest cells. Neural crest cells exhibit stem-cell-like properties, including multipotency and self-renewal. Thus, the early expression of <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest precursors, together with its reported role in maintaining stemness and self-renewal properties in various stem cell and cancer systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battista et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuldenfrei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shah and Resar, 2012</xref>), may indicate a role in maintaining neural crest stemness. In the dorsal neural tube, self-renewal within the premigratory neural crest is driven by the transcription factor c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kerosuo and Bronner, 2016</xref>), which together with its binding partner regulates cell cycle progression. Consistent with this possibility, we found that the mRNA expression of <italic>c-Myc</italic> is downregulated in the dorsal neural tube following Hmga1 knockout. However, given that canonical Wnt signaling also regulates stem cell self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), as well as cell cycle progression in neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2004</xref>), Hmga1 may have additional Wnt-dependent and/or Wnt-independent roles in the maintenance of the neural crest stem cell pool.</p><p>Hmga1 is a member of the high motility group A (HMGA) family of genes that are characterized by their A/T-hook domains and the ability to transform chromatin architecture to regulate transcription of target genes. To date, two members of the HMGA family, <italic>Hmga1</italic> and <italic>Hmga2</italic>, have been identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reeves et al., 2001</xref>), each having distinct roles in oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazawa et al., 2004</xref>). As both genes share several common targets, they may compensate for each other where they overlap. Indeed, <italic>Hmga1</italic>/<italic>Hmga2</italic> double knockout mice have severe embryonic lethality, compared to less-penetrant effects in individual knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Federico et al., 2014</xref>). While both <italic>Hmga1</italic> and <italic>Hmga2</italic> genes are annotated in the chick genome, our scRNA-seq results show that a significant proportion of neural crest cells express <italic>Hmga1</italic> but not <italic>Hmga2</italic>. Consistent with this, loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> resulted in neural crest-related developmental defects, making it unlikely that there is redundancy and/or compensation by <italic>Hmga2</italic> in chick embryos. Interestingly, only the <italic>hmga2</italic> paralogue is present in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macrì et al., 2016</xref>), but morpholino-mediated knockdown of <italic>hmga2</italic> did not affect the expression of neural plate border gene <italic>pax3/7</italic>. This contrasts with our results in chick embryos, where the loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> affected both Pax7 transcription and protein levels in the neural plate border. Together with the absence of Hmga2+ cells in our single-cell data, this raises the possibility that individual HMGA family members play discrete roles in neural crest development, similar to their distinct roles in tumorigenesis.</p><p>In addition to Hmga1, other chromatin remodeling proteins serve similar functions in neural crest cell fate decisions. For example, both the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CHD7 and the histone demethylase Jumonji D2A (KDM4A/JmjD2A) are necessary for expression of neural crest specifier genes; notably, however, these chromatin modifiers appear to function at later developmental time points than Hmga1, as neither knockdown of KDM4A in chick embryos nor CHD7 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos affect <italic>Pax3/7</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajpai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Strobl-Mazzulla et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, KDM4A influences <italic>Snai2</italic> and <italic>Wnt1</italic> levels, raising the possibility that Hmga1 may act in concert with KDM4A or other chromatin remodelers to restructure the accessibility of neural crest GRN circuits at different cell fate checkpoints.</p><p>In summary, our data reveal a dual role for the chromatin remodeler Hmga1 during neural crest development. First, during specification at the neural plate border, Hmga1 regulates the completion of neural crest induction as assayed by readout of <italic>Pax7</italic> expression at the neural plate border. Later, following neural crest specification, Hmga1 plays a second role in modulating the levels of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the closing dorsal neural tube to influence neural crest EMT and delamination at the onset of their migration. Post-embryonically, neural-crest-derived cells are prone to metastasis and give rise to numerous cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maguire et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, neural crest and cancer cells often employ similar mechanisms to drive EMT; in particular, the hallmarks of metastasis often involve disruption of the basement membrane which may also be driven by canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Powell et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, high expression levels of Hmga1 have been associated with premature EMT and prolonged stemness in several cancers of the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2000</xref>), breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flohr et al., 2003</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarhadi et al., 2006</xref>), and ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Masciullo et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to note that Hmga1 may play parallel roles in neural crest development and cancer metastasis. Understanding how Hmga1, and chromatin remodeling in general, alters cell fate decisions and EMT through signaling and transcriptional regulation in neural crest cells will undoubtedly have important and broad implications in human development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

A Bernsen-based auto local-thresholding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernsen, 1986</xref>) followed by watershed segmentation was used to identify cell boundaries. The ‘Analyze particles’ function was used to count the number of cells. All statistical analyses were performed in R. The Wilcoxon rank test was used in datasets that were not normally distributed. In cases where the underlying distribution was normal, a student’s t-test was used to calculate significance. In cases where multiple samples were compared, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test combined with Tukey HSD correction was used. Post hoc power analysis was used to validate sample size and confirm sufficient statistical power (&gt;0.8).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>For technical assistance, we thank Fan Gao with the Caltech Bioinformatics Resource Center of the Beckman Institute, Giada Spigolon and Andres Collazo with the Caltech Biological Imaging facility of the Beckman Institute, and Sisi Chen and Paul Rivaud with the Single Cell Profiling and Engineering Center (SPEC) of the Beckman Institute.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Bimodal function of chromatin remodeler <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest induction and Wnt-dependent emigration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lukas Sommer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Filippo M Rijli (Reviewer #2); Igor Adameyko (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this interesting study, Gandhi et al. used single cell transcriptomics on early migrating neural crest cells to show that the non-histone chromatin remodeler <italic>Hmga1</italic> is highly expressed in neural crest cells. <italic>Hmga1</italic> has been overlooked in previous bulk sequencing approaches due to its simultaneous expression in other cell types. Using a series of elegant CRISPR-Cas9-based temporally controlled knockdowns (KDs), high resolution in situ hybridization, and rescue experiments in the chick embryo, they convincingly show that <italic>Hmga1</italic> has essential and temporally distinct roles in neural crest development.</p><p>This study introduces a new major regulator of neural crest development and represents another example in the literature of a developmental program being re-expressed in carcinogenesis. This is a very interesting, comprehensive and well-done study.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Specific points to be experimentally addressed:</p><p>1) Part of the phenotype (including the reduction of <italic>Pax7</italic> domain) can be caused by the increased apoptosis of KO cells. This needs to be checked. Specifically, cell death at the neural plate border should be evaluated for <italic>Hmga1</italic> KD vs. control in embryos electroporated on both sides.</p><p>2) HMGA1 is known as a powerful driver of cell cycle progression. The KO phenotype can be partly explained by potentially reduced proliferation. This should be investigated more in depth with EdU labeling and / or other complementary methods.</p><p>Specific points to be addressed either experimentally (optionally) or by text revision:</p><p>1) The early role of <italic>Hmga1</italic> involves <italic>Pax7</italic> regulation already in the neural plate border (Figure 4). Are other neural plate border genes (as previously defined by the Bronner lab) affected as well? If so, do they possibly share putative <italic>Hmga1</italic> binding motifs in support of a broader role of <italic>Hmga1</italic> in neural crest specification? Or is the phenotype mainly mediated by <italic>Hmga1</italic>-dependent control of <italic>Pax7</italic> and can be rescued by <italic>Pax7</italic> overexpression?</p><p>2) Gain of function experiments with overexpression of HMGA1/2 might be beneficial.</p><p>3) Can the authors speculate on how <italic>Hmga1</italic> may function as a Wnt activator? This point should be discussed.</p><p>4) The role of HMGA1 in tissue growth and proliferation should be mentioned in the Introduction section.</p><p>5) In general, the figure legends should include more details. Specifically, abbreviations should be explained such as for example in Figure 2. Moreover, the structures/cells, arrows and arrowheads point to, should be consistently referred to in the figure legends.</p><p>6) In the third paragraph of the subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> regulates expression of <italic>Pax7</italic> in neural crest precursors in the neural plate border”, it is stated that the loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> reduces both endogenous <italic>Pax7</italic> protein expression and reporter expression, however the representative images in Figure 4J/J' do not clearly show this effect. Rather, the number of cells appear to be reduced.</p><p>7) In the third paragraph of the subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”, it is mentioned that <italic>Hmga1</italic> knockdown causes defects in basement membrane remodelling and channel formation. However, this is not very obvious from the pictures shown in Supplementary Figure 4D-E. Maybe the authors want to include a positive control here, such as overexpression of draxin that was shown to prevent channel formation, as shown in Hutchins and Bronner, 2019.</p><p>8) Wnt pathway activation was rescued by expression of a stabilised β-catenin (subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”, fourth paragraph), and this resulted in proper neural crest migration in <italic>Hmga1</italic> knockouts. The effect on neural crest migration is not very clear in Figure 5F. An image of the area covered by migratory neural crest cells should be included here, as similarly done in Figure 6—figure supplement 1D.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) It would be important to see if the neural crest cells with HMGA1 KO are capable of differentiating into traditional derivatives or not. What happens to these cells at later developmental stages?</p><p>2) Since the authors take advantage of a single cell transcriptomics, it might be beneficial to attempt to sequence a KO condition to measure how the reduction of HMGA2 correlates with the cell cycle phases, induction of delamination and migratory phenotype. This is a large experiment, which is not strictly necessary for this revision (given the situation with COVID 19). We would like to mention this approach in case the authors will have the opportunity and resources to tackle this now or later in the follow up projects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57779.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Specific points to be experimentally addressed:</p><p>1) Part of the phenotype (including the reduction of Pax7 domain) can be caused by the increased apoptosis of KO cells.

To test possible effects on the cell cycle, we immunostained sections through the neural plate border of embryos after loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> on one side (as described above) with an antibody against phospho-Histone H3 to serve as a readout for cell proliferation. Quantification of these data revealed no significant difference between the treated and control sides, suggesting that reduced proliferation does not explain the observed loss of <italic>Pax7</italic> in the neural plate border cells. These data have been added to the revised manuscript [Figure 4—figure supplement 1, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> regulates expression of <italic>Pax7</italic> in neural crest precursors in the neural plate border”, last paragraph].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points to be addressed either experimentally (optionally) or by text revision:</p><p>1) The early role of Hmga1 involves Pax7 regulation already in the neural plate border (Figure 4).

Or is the phenotype mainly mediated by Hmga1-dependent control of Pax7 and can be rescued by Pax7 overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment. We performed two experiments to test this, first by looking at the effects of losing <italic>Hmga1</italic> on other neural plate border markers, and second, by asking whether <italic>Pax7</italic> could rescue the effects of losing <italic>Hmga1</italic> on neural crest specification.</p><p>To check if the loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> affected other neural plate border genes, we knocked out <italic>Hmga1</italic> using Cas9 protein-<italic>Hmga1</italic> gRNA RNP complexes on the right side of gastrula stage embryos and processed embryos for Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) against the neural plate border genes <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Tfap2a</italic>. The results show that while <italic>Pax7</italic> transcripts were reduced on the knockout side, the expression of <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Tfap2a</italic> was unaffected. This suggests that <italic>Hmga1</italic> specifically regulates <italic>Pax7</italic> in neural crest precursors. These data are now included in the revised manuscript [Figure 4K-Q, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> is not required for expression of neural plate border genes <italic>Msx1</italic> or <italic>Tfap2a</italic>”].</p><p>Next, we tested whether the effects of <italic>Hmga1</italic> loss could be rescued by <italic>Pax7</italic>. To this end, we knocked out <italic>Hmga1</italic> on the right side of gastrula stage embryos using CRISPR plasmids, and simultaneously expressed <italic>Pax7</italic> using a previously described plasmid construct (Roellig et al., 2017) on the right side. The embryos were processed for HCR against neural crest specifier genes <italic>Tfap2B</italic> and <italic>Snai2</italic>. Indeed, expressing <italic>Pax7</italic> was sufficient to rescue the expression of these two genes in the dorsal neural tube as observed in cross-sections through the hindbrain. We thank the reviewers for this suggestion; these data have been added to the revised manuscript [Figure 5H-K, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> rescue the effects of losing <italic>Hmga1</italic> on neural crest specification”, last paragraph].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Gain of function experiments with overexpression of HMGA1/2 might be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. To address this question, we overexpressed <italic>Hmga1</italic> on the right side of gastrula stage embryos and processed embryos for antibody staining against <italic>Pax7</italic>. Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>Hmga1</italic> results in a cranial neural crest migration defects. We reasoned that this was a result of precocious Wnt signaling activation (see below), which in turn results in maintenance of Cadherin6B at premigratory stages, causing a delamination defect. This phenotype has been previously documented by our lab in embryos where the Wnt antagonist Draxin was knocked down using morpholinos and/or CRISPR-Cas9 (Hutchins and Bronner, 2018, 2019). These data are now included in the revised manuscript [Figure 5, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> rescue the effects of losing <italic>Hmga1</italic> on neural crest specification”].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors speculate on how Hmga1 may function as a Wnt activator? This point should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a critical question, and we thank the reviewers for raising it. In our first submission, we speculated that <italic>Hmga1</italic> may regulate the levels of <italic>Wnt1</italic> transcription. This was based on finding an AT-rich domain, to which <italic>Hmga1</italic> might bind, in a putative <italic>Wnt1</italic> cranial neural crest enhancer isolated from a recently published study (Williams et al., 2019). To test this hypothesis, we performed additional experiments in which we knocked out <italic>Hmga1</italic> on the right side of gastrula stage embryos using CRISPR plasmids, allowed embryos to develop to HH9, and processed them for in situ hybridization against <italic>Wnt1</italic>. Interestingly, the results show that loss of <italic>Hmga1</italic> reduces <italic>Wnt1</italic> transcripts in the midbrain, further elaborating a possible mechanism by which <italic>Hmga1</italic> activates Wnt signaling in emigrating cranial neural crest cells in a manner independent of neural crest specification. In these embryos, while the number of <italic>Pax7</italic>+ cells remained similar, more cells appeared stuck in the dorsal neural tube on the knockout side, consistent with a Wnt-mediated migration defect. These data have been added to the revised manuscript [Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”], and we have expanded on this discussion point [Discussion].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The role of HMGA1 in tissue growth and proliferation should be mentioned in the Introduction section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We now discuss the role <italic>Hmga1</italic> plays in tissue growth in early mouse embryos [subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> is expressed in the neural plate, neural plate border, and neural crest cells”, first paragraph].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In general, the figure legends should include more details. Specifically, abbreviations should be explained such as for example in Figure 2. Moreover, the structures/cells, arrows and arrowheads point to, should be consistently referred to in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this oversight. The figure legends have now been expanded to include more details about the figure panels. All arrows and arrowheads have now been described clearly for each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Hmga1 regulates expression of Pax7 in neural crest precursors in the neural plate border”, it is stated that the loss of Hmga1 reduces both endogenous Pax7 protein expression and reporter expression, however the representative images in Figure 4J/J' do not clearly show this effect. Rather, the number of cells appear to be reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. Given that the enhancer data was purely used as another way of confirming the loss of <italic>Pax7</italic> and was not important for the conclusions of our study, we decided to remove them from the manuscript in response to the reviewers’ concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Hmga1 activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”, it is mentioned that Hmga1 knockdown causes defects in basement membrane remodelling and channel formation. However, this is not very obvious from the pictures shown in Supplementary Figure 4D-E. Maybe the authors want to include a positive control here, such as overexpression of draxin that was shown to prevent channel formation, as shown in Hutchins and Bronner, 2019.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this shortcoming. To address this, we have now included a representative image showing the effect of Draxin overexpression on basement membrane remodeling [Figure 6, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Wnt pathway activation was rescued by expression of a stabilised β-catenin (subsection “Hmga1 activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”, fourth paragraph), and this resulted in proper neural crest migration in Hmga1 knockouts.

An image of the area covered by migratory neural crest cells should be included here, as similarly done in Figure 6—figure supplement 1D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. As suggested, we now include quantifications of these data by calculating the ratio of area of neural crest migration between treated and control sides. To further strengthen the effect of expressing ß-catenin on neural crest migration, we have compared this ratio between three different experiments (ß-catenin rescue, <italic>Hmga1</italic> knockout, and <italic>Hmga1</italic> rescue) and use ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD to demonstrate that these differences are statistically significant. These results are now included in the revised manuscript [Figure 6K, subsection “<italic>Hmga1</italic> activates Wnt signaling to mediate neural crest emigration”, last paragraph].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) It would be important to see if the neural crest cells with HMGA1 KO are capable of differentiating into traditional derivatives or not. What happens to these cells at later developmental stages?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and in fact, the first author was hoping to recruit a summer student to perform these experiments, but due to COVID-19, no undergraduates are on campus this summer and the lab is working in shifts. These experiments are in the pipeline and will be addressed in the future when we are back to full operation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since the authors take advantage of a single cell transcriptomics, it might be beneficial to attempt to sequence a KO condition to measure how the reduction of HMGA2 correlates with the cell cycle phases, induction of delamination and migratory phenotype.

We would like to mention this approach in case the authors will have the opportunity and resources to tackle this now or later in the follow up projects.</p></disp-quote><p>Once again, this is another excellent suggestion, one that we are hoping to pursue in the near future. The first author is particularly excited about the application of single-cell transcriptomics to address such questions!</p></body></sub-article></article>
