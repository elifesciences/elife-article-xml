implicated in several diseases and is known to spread in a prion-like manner. There is a relationship between protein aggregate structure (strain) and clinical phenotype in prion diseases, however, whether differences in the strains of α-synuclein aggregates account for the different pathologies remained unclear. Here, we generated two types of α-synuclein fibrils from identical monomer and investigated their seeding and propagation ability in mice and primary-cultured neurons. One α-synuclein fibril induced marked accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein and ubiquitinated protein aggregates, while the other did not, indicating the formation of α-synuclein two strains. Notably, the former α-synuclein strain inhibited proteasome activity and co-precipitated with 26S proteasome complex. Further examination indicated that structural differences in the C-terminal region of α-synuclein strains lead to different effects on proteasome activity. These results provide a possible molecular mechanism to account for the different pathologies induced by different α-synuclein strains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>strain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K21650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Genjiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003837</institution-id><institution>Ichiro Kanehara Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences and Medical Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Genjiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004051</institution-id><institution>Kato Memorial Bioscience Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Genjiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26117005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hasegawa</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR18H3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hasegawa</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18dm0207019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hasegawa</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>One α-synuclein strain inhibited proteasome activity and induced apparent pathologies, while the other did not, indicating a strain-dependent toxicity of α-synuclein aggregates, which support a prion-like behavior of α-synuclein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Misfolding and aggregation of normally soluble proteins are common pathological features of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Creutzfeldt–Jacob and Huntington’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>). For example, Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are characterized by accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in neuronal and/or glial cells, and therefore these diseases are termed α-synucleinopathies. In PD and DLB, α-synuclein pathologies are mainly observed in neurons in the form of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 1998</xref>), while glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) are seen in oligodendrocytes in MSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wakabayashi et al., 1998</xref>). The abnormal α-synuclein observed in brains of patients is accumulated as fibrous or filamentous forms with cross-β structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>), existing in phosphorylated and partially ubiquitinated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasegawa et al., 2002</xref>). These abnormal α-synuclein species exhibit seeding activity for prion-like conversion, being similar in this respect to the infectious forms of prion protein (PrP) causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goedert, 2015</xref>). Various other neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, including amyloid-β, tau and TDP-43, can also propagate through neural networks in a similar manner.</p><p>α-Synuclein is a natively unfolded protein of 140 amino acid residues, normally found in both soluble and membrane-associated fractions and localized in synaptic termini. Although its physiological function has not been fully clarified, it appears to be involved in the regulation of SNARE complex and in dopamine production. Disease-linked missense mutations and multiplication of the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene encoding α-synuclein have been reported in familial forms of α-synucleinopathies, indicating that structural changes and overexpression of α-synuclein protein are involved in the development of α-synucleinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wong and Krainc, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recombinant soluble α-synuclein proteins purified from bacterial cells form amyloid-like fibrils that are morphologically and physicochemically similar to those observed in patients’ brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goedert, 2015</xref>). These synthetic α-synuclein fibrils can act as seeds and induce seeded aggregation of α-synuclein in cultured cells or primary cultured neurons, as well as in animal brains. Intracerebral inoculation of synthetic α-synuclein fibrils induces phosphorylated and ubiquitinated α-synuclein pathologies even in wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Luk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Masuda-Suzukake et al., 2013</xref>). It has also been reported that extracts from brains of patients with α-synucleinopathies induce α-synuclein pathologies in cellular and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watts et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, recent studies have suggested that α-synuclein strains with distinct conformations exist, which is a characteristic of prions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gribaudo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Peelaerts and Baekelandt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peelaerts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shahnawaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woerman et al., 2019</xref>). Synthetic α-synuclein fibrils formed under different physiological conditions in vitro show distinct seeding activities and cytotoxicity in cultured cells and rat brains. Furthermore, MSA brain extracts exhibit distinct infectivity compared to PD or control brain extracts in cultured cells or mice expressing mutant A53T or WT α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prusiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woerman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woerman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>These observations support the idea that α-synuclein shows prion-like behavior, because they can be accounted for by a typical hallmark of the prion phenomenon, that is, the presence of strains. In prion diseases, the variety of strains that can be differentiated in terms of the clinical signs, incubation period after inoculation, and the vacuolation lesion profiles in the brain of affected animals is due to structural differences of PrP aggregates, as identified by biochemical analyses including glycosylation profile, electrophoretic mobility, protease resistance, and sedimentation. These PrP strains are thought to correspond to different conformations of PrP aggregates, as demonstrated for the yeast prion [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>], which induces aggregates of Sup35p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ohhashi et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, as the case of prion disease, differences of lesions among α-synucleinopathies are thought to be caused by conformational heterology of α-synuclein assemblies, probably amyloid-like fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schweighauser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shahnawaz et al., 2020</xref>). However, little is known about how conformational differences of protein aggregates induce a variety of lesions, not only in prion disease, but also in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as α-synucleinopathies.</p><p>In this study, we prepared two α-synuclein assemblies from identical wild-type α-synuclein monomer under different conditions, and established that they have distinct conformations, that is, we succeeded to generating two α-synuclein fibrils from the same monomer. We examined their seeding abilities to convert endogenous soluble α-synuclein monomers into phosphorylated aggregates in mice and primary-cultured neurons, indicating the formation of two α-synuclein strains. Notably, only one strain induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, as well as phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates, indicating the ability of this strain to inhibit proteasome activity. Moreover, only this strain strongly inhibited proteasome activity and co-precipitated with purified 26S proteasome complex in vitro. Structural studies suggested that the C-terminal region plays a key role in the different properties of the two strains. Taken together, these results provide a possible molecular mechanism to account for the different lesions induced by distinct α-synuclein strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of amyloid-like fibrils from α-synuclein proteins in vitro</title><p>We generated two distinct α-synuclein assemblies from the identical purified α-synuclein monomer using the method described in the previous report, with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lau et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, we prepared recombinant α-synuclein monomer and agitated it in the presence or absence of salt at a physiological concentration. In the presence of physiological salt (30 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl), the monomer formed a cloudy solution of assemblies with higher turbidity, while in the absence of salt (30 mM Tris, pH 7.5), a clear solution containing assemblies with lower turbidity was formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Almost all of the α-synuclein was present as aggregates rather than soluble oligomers under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thibaudeau et al., 2018</xref>). Both assemblies showed fibrillar morphology, but the previously reported ribbon-like morphology was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we will refer to the former assemblies as α-synuclein fibrils (+) and the later assemblies as α-synuclein fibrils (-). Both fibrils were stained with Thioflavin T and Congo red, indicating their amyloid-like nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The differences of Thioflavin T fluorescence and Congo red binding of these α-synuclein fibrils suggested that these fibrils have a different structures each other. Next, we examined the in vitro seeding activity of these fibrils and found that α-synuclein fibrils (+) showed higher seeding activity than α-synuclein fibrils (-) in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicated that we had successfully prepared two distinct types of α-synuclein fibrils from the same monomer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Preparation and characterization of two α-synuclein strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of two α-synuclein (αS) strains (left) and the resulted two α-synuclein assemblies (right).

Phosphorylated α-synuclein were accumulated in cells treated with both α-synuclein fibrils (-) and α-synuclein fibrils (+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). However, α-synuclein fibrils (-) induced a greater accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein than did α-synuclein fibrils (+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The phosphorylated and aggregated α-synuclein in these cells was found to be endogenous mouse α-synuclein, indicating that the introduced human α-synuclein fibrils worked as seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also examined the accumulation of detergent-insoluble ubiquitinated proteins and found that not only ubiquitinated α-synuclein, but also other ubiquitinated proteins were accumulated in cells treated with α-synuclein fibrils (-). There was no significant increase of ubiquitinated protein accumulation in cells treated with α-synuclein fibrils (+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). These results indicated that only α-synuclein fibrils (-) induced much accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins in primary mouse cortical neurons, in accordance with the findings in mouse brain. Seed dependent aggregation of α-synuclein must depend on the efficiency of fibril uptake by cells. We confirmed whether the two α-synuclein fibrils were taken up into primary mouse cortical cells with similar efficiency. Cells were treated with the two α-synuclein fibrils or buffer. A day after treatment, we treated cells with trypsin for digestion of extracellular fibrils, collected them and examined the α-synuclein fibrils taken up into the cells by western blotting of sarkosyl insoluble fractions. We found no α-synuclein signal in pellet fraction of cells with buffer control indicating that detected α-synuclein signals were originated from added fibrils. We found α-synuclein fibrils (-), which induced much α-synuclein accumulation, were taken up into the cells lesser than α-synuclein fibrils (+), demonstrating that α-synuclein fibrils (-) efficiently caused the accumulation of α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins in spite of their inefficient uptake into the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Different interactions of α-Synuclein strains with 26S Proteasome</title><p>The above results motivated us to examine proteasome activity in the presence of these two types of α-synuclein fibrils.

The activity of the purified 26S proteasome was examined in the presence or absence of α-synuclein fibrils. The eukaryotic proteasome has three active subunits, β1, β 2 and β 5, each displaying a specific catalytic activity, trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activity, respectively. Thus, we examined the chymotrypsin-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), caspase-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and trypsin-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) activities of 26S proteasome in the presence of these α-synuclein fibrils using each fluorogenic peptide substrate in vitro. The catalytic activity of 26S proteasome was drastically impaired in the presence of α-synuclein fibrils (-), whereas α-synuclein fibrils (+) were ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). These results accord with our mouse and primary-cultured neuron data, i.e., only α-synuclein fibrils (-) could induce much accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins. Co-aggregation of functional proteins with misfolded protein aggregates may cause the impairment of their function. Therefore, we investigated the interaction of 26S proteasome with the fibrils. α-Synuclein fibrils were mixed with purified 26S proteasome, and the mixture was centrifuged. The supernatants and precipitates were analyzed by western blotting. We found that both α-synuclein fibrils (-) and α-synuclein fibrils (+) were fractionated to the pellet fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Indeed, we did observe slight differences between these two types of fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Amyloid-like fibrils are composed of core regions consisting of β-sheet-rich rigid structure, and exposed regions, which might interact with other molecules. The core regions tend to be resistant to protease attack, whereas exposed regions tend to be easily digested by protease. To identify the core regions and exposed regions of these α-synuclein fibrils, we carried out limited proteolysis with proteinase K, followed by mass spectrometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>). We found that α-synuclein fibrils (-) have a smaller core region (amino acid residues 39–96 and 40–94; m/z 5656 and 5268, respectively) corresponding to the NAC region (amino acid residues 61–95), which had previously been reported as the core region of α-synuclein fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guerrero-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, α-synuclein fibrils (+) had a larger core region, extending to the C-terminal regions (residues 31–109, 28–118 and 25–132; m/z 7860, 9115 and 10907, respectively), indicating that α-synuclein fibrils (-) have amyloid structure with a more exposed C-terminal region than α-synuclein fibrils (+). To confirm these results, we performed dot-blot analysis using various antibodies against different regions of α-synuclein protein. Native α-synuclein fibrils were spotted on nitrocellulose membranes and detected by applying various α-synuclein antibodies. Antibodies raised against the N-terminal region of α-synuclein (residues 1–10) and the NAC region (91-99) almost equally recognized both types of α-synuclein fibrils, indicating that they have similar structure in the N-terminal and NAC regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, as expected from the above data, the antibodies raised against C-terminal regions (amino acid 115–122 and 131–140) bound more strongly to α-synuclein fibrils (-) than to α-synuclein fibrils (+), supporting the idea that the C-terminal region of α-synuclein fibrils (-) is more exposed than that of α-synuclein fibrils (+). Thus, we considered that the C-terminal region of α-synuclein fibrils (-) might interact with 26S proteasome and impair its activities. Indeed, we previously reported that C-terminally truncated α-synuclein fibrils induced pathology in mouse brain less potently than did full-length α-synuclein fibrils, even though the C-terminally truncated α-synuclein fibrils had higher seeding activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terada et al., 2018</xref>). To confirm this, we next examined the seeding activity of C-terminally truncated fibrils formed in the absence of salt in primary-cultured neurons. We prepared C-terminally truncated α-synuclein monomer (residues 1–120) and agitated it in the absence of salt. The resulting assemblies showed fibrillar morphology and thioflavin T binding (data not shown), and we refer to them as αSΔC20 fibrils (-). We treated primary mouse cortical cells with αSΔC20 fibrils (-) and examined the accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins. As expected, we observed little accumulation of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Next, we examined the activities of 26S proteasome in the presence of αSΔC20 fibrils (-) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>. The catalytic activity of 26S proteasome was not impaired in the presence of αSΔC20 fibrils (-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also investigated the interaction of 26S proteasome with αSΔC20 fibrils (-) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> and found that αSΔC20 fibrils (-) did not co-precipitated with 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Considering all these results, we can conclude that the C-terminal region of α-synuclein is exposed only in α-synuclein fibrils (-) and this region interacts with 26S proteasome and impairs its activity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Effects of C-terminal truncated α-synuclein fibrils on proteasome in neurons and in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Seeding activities of C-terminal truncated α-synuclein fibrils in primary mouse cortical neurons.

Therefore, if α-synuclein is prion-like, differences in the structure of α-synuclein aggregates should cause the differences in the lesions observed in various α-synucleopathies. Recent analyses have shown that introduction of extracts from brains of patients with PD and MSA into mice and cells induces different pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prusiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tarutani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woerman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woerman et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, it has been clarified that TDP-43 aggregates have a different structure depending on the disease, and different lesions appear when the patients' brain extracts are introduced into cells or animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Laferrière et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nonaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Porta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tsuji et al., 2012</xref>). As for α-synuclein, it has been reported that aggregates having different structures are formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shahnawaz et al., 2020</xref>), and the lesions caused by introduction of aggregates having different structures into cells and rodents are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gribaudo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peelaerts et al., 2015</xref>). However, it has remained unclear what molecular mechanism might lead to the differences in phenotypes induced by different protein aggregates.</p><p>In this study, we confirmed that different pathologies were caused by two α-synuclein strains with different structures, and we also found that these α-synuclein strains differ in their ability to inhibit 26S proteasome activity. It has already been reported that protein aggregates that can cause neurodegenerative diseases may interact with proteasome and inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bence et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thibaudeau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zondler et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is a noteworthy finding in this work that one of the two differently structured fibrils formed from identical monomer under different conditions inhibited proteasome, while the other did not. This clearly raises the possibility that inhibition of proteasome by abnormal α-synuclein plays a role in the pathology. These results provide a possible molecular mechanism to account for the different lesions induced by distinct α-synuclein strains. Considering that PD and MSA have different structures of accumulated α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klingstedt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Prusiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schweighauser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shahnawaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woerman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woerman et al., 2015</xref>), it seems highly likely that the structures of α-synuclein fibrils determine the lesions observed in these diseases.</p><p>Protein inclusions found in many neurodegenerative diseases are often ubiquitinated, and this is consistent with reports that ubiquitin proteasome systems are impaired in neurons of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bence et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, it was reported that protein aggregates co-aggregate with proteasome at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, α-synuclein oligomers, Aβ oligomers and polyglutamine inhibit 20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thibaudeau et al., 2018</xref>). In our α-synuclein fibril formation experiments, almost all the proteins formed insoluble aggregates, and soluble oligomers could not be isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, our results indicate that protein aggregates may also show proteasome-inhibitory activity, and the extent of the inhibitory activity depends on the structure of the aggregates. These facts indicate that pathogenic protein oligomers and aggregates have different effects on cells depending on their structure, and both may be toxic.</p><p>Our results suggest that the difference in the structure of the two strains is mainly at the C-terminal region. The C-terminal region (residues 96–140) of α-synuclein is acidic and contains negatively charged residues, including aspartate and glutamate, as well as proline residues. When intermolecular repulsion at the C-terminal region is weakened by changes in ionic strength, exposure of the C-terminal region decreases, and more tightly packed α-synuclein fibrils are formed in the presence of salt. On the other hand, in the absence of salt, intermolecular repulsion at the C-terminal region causes the formation of α-synuclein fibrils in which the C-terminal region is exposed. Only this latter type of α-synuclein fibrils can interact with 26S proteasome complex in vitro, causing inhibition of 26S proteasome activity. If this also occurs in cells, abnormal α-synuclein aggregates, which might be partially degraded by proteasome, would be accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). More analysis is desired to show that α-synuclein fibrils (-), but not fibrils (+), interact with the mammalian proteasome and inhibit its activity in mouse primary neurons or brains of injected mice. It may also be necessary to examine whether protein aggregates co-aggregate with the proteasome in the patient's brain. Consequently, phosphorylated and ubiquitinated α-synuclein aggregates would be accumulated in neurons and then presumably would propagate throughout the brain in a prion-like manner. Our results imply that inhibition of proteasome activity by protein aggregates is critical for prion-like propagation of these protein aggregates. Thus, inhibiting the interaction between aggregates and the proteasome may be a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of α-synuclein strain formation and strain dependent interaction with 26S proteasome.</title><p>In the absence of salt, α-synuclein monomers have exposed C-terminal region with high electric repulsion.

However, based on our results and previous reports, it seems possible that the results obtained might vary markedly in response to even slight differences in the structure of the introduced fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gribaudo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peelaerts et al., 2015</xref>). Introducing brain extract from a patient with a neurodegenerative disease into cells or animals would also be one approach for identifying the cause of the disease and developing a treatment, but even in patients with the same disease, the results might vary due to slight differences in the structure of the accumulated protein aggregates. Therefore, when conducting such experiments, it is extremely important to analyze the structure of the protein aggregates.</p><p>In this study, we found that the degree of interaction with proteasome and the inhibition of proteasome activity vary depending on the strain of α-synuclein aggregates. The relationship between proteasome inhibition and the induction of the pathology supports the hypothesis that prion-like activity of α-synuclein aggregates contributes to disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

α-synuclein fibrils, which are generated from identical monomers but have different structural properties, show a drastic difference in their abilities to induce formation of aggregates containing α-synuclein and ubiquitin in cultured neurons and mice brain, and also elucidated the underlying mechanism. Thus, this study provides significant insights into how distinct α-synuclein strains lead to different pathologies, an important subject in basic medical science.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;α-Synuclein strains that cause distinct pathologies differentially inhibit proteasome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Suzuki et al. generated two types of α-synuclein fibrils from identical monomers in vitro and investigated their seeding and propagation ability in mice and primary-cultured neurons.</p><p>One of the strains induced phosphorylated α-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive aggregates in cultured neurons and mice brain, whereas the other strain, which formed fibrils more efficiently in vitro, did not. The authors further obtained results suggesting that α-synuclein in the former fibrils adopts a more flexible conformation in its C-terminal region, which interacts with the proteasome and thereby inhibits its activity. Overall, we find this study provides significant insights into how distinct α-synuclein strains lead to different pathologies, an important subject in basic medical science, but some critical issues remain to be addressed.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should include a control in their in vivo study and show it in the immunohistochemistry analysis. The different panels should be labelled with the treatments used. Furthermore, it should be specified how many mice have been used for this experiment. As there is no quantification data presented, it would be nice to mention how many different images were analyzed qualitatively from each condition.</p><p>2) The authors should improve the quality of the IF images in Figure 3A, B. Moreover, they should include the staining of the nuclei in Figure 3A. The nuclei appear to have different size in diameter, the authors should perform a staining for neuronal and astrocyte markers. Furthermore, they should specify what kind of primary neurons they used.</p><p>3) Figure 3D, E: in the WB images, the authors have to show the loading control (e.g., GAPDH).</p><p>4) Figure 4—figure supplement 2A: the authors should improve the quality of the IF images and include the IF related to the α-synuclein fibrils (-) not truncated and the control without fibrils.</p><p>5) Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C: in the WB images, the authors have to include the loading control (e.g., GAPDH).</p><p>6) &quot;Considering all these results, we can conclude that the C-terminal region of α-synuclein is exposed only in α-synuclein fibrils (-) and this region interacts with 26S proteasome and impairs its activity.&quot; To assess these conclusions, the authors should perform in vitro experiments shown in Figure 4 for ΔC20 fibrils (-); whether these fibrils indeed do not interact with the proteasome and inhibit its activity.</p><p>7) The authors should perform co-immunoprecipitation analysis using primary neurons treated with α-synuclein fibrils (-) to confirm that α-synuclein fibrils (-), but not fibrils (+), interact with the mammalian proteasome.</p><p>8) The authors should confirm that the two α-synuclein fibrils were taken up into brain/neuronal cells with similar efficiency. Because different turbidity in these fibril samples suggests that their fibril (particle) sizes are not the same, the authors should carefully consider the possibility that fibrils (+), which might be larger than fibrils (-), were not efficiently introduced into the cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56825.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should include a control in their in vivo study and show it in the immunohistochemistry analysis.

As the reviewer’s indication, we used mouse cortical primary cells, not mouse primary neurons, in this study.

We tried to detect direct interactions between the proteasome complex and α-synuclein fibrils (-), but not α-synuclein fibrils (+) in mouse primary cortical cells, but we could not detect such interactions by co-immunoprecipitation. In our opinion, it is because that both the proteasome complex and α-synuclein are abundant in the cells, however, the inhibitory complex between the proteasome and α-synuclein fibrils must be little compared with the total amounts of these proteins. We will continue to detect interactions between the proteasome complex and α-synuclein fibrils (-) by co-immunoprecipitation or other methods and we will report the results in a preprint on bioRxiv or a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>. We added the discussion about the importance of these experiments in Discussion paragraph four.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should confirm that the two α-synuclein fibrils were taken up into brain/neuronal cells with similar efficiency.

We investigated the uptake of these fibrils into primary cells by western blotting of the cells corrected a day after fibril treatment. Briefly, cells were treated with the two α-synuclein fibrils. A day after treatment, we treated cells with trypsin for digestion of extracellular fibrils, collected them and examined the α-synuclein fibrils taken up into the cells by western blotting of sarkosyl insoluble fractions. Surprisingly, we found α-synuclein fibrils (-), which induced much α-synuclein accumulation, were taken up into the cells lesser than α-synuclein fibrils (+), indicating that α-synuclein fibrils (-) efficiently caused the accumulation of α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins in spite of their inefficient uptake into the cells. We added the result and the method in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, subsection “Formation of Phosphorylated α-Synuclein Pathology Induced by the Two α-Synuclein Strains in Cultured Neurons” paragraph two and subsection “Fibril uptake assay”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
