break (DSB) sites during the very early stages of meiosis, but the reader of these marks remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Zcwpw1 is an H3K4me3 reader that is required for DSB repair and synapsis in mouse testes. We generated H3K4me3 reader-dead Zcwpw1 mutant mice and found that their spermatocytes were arrested at the pachytene-like stage, which phenocopies the <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> knock–out mice. Based on various ChIP-seq and immunofluorescence analyses using several mutants, we found that Zcwpw1's occupancy on chromatin is strongly promoted by the histone-modification activity of PRDM9. Zcwpw1 localizes to DMC1-labelled hotspots in a largely Prdm9-dependent manner, where it facilitates completion of synapsis by mediating the DSB repair process. In sum, our study demonstrates the function of ZCWPW1 that acts as part of the selection system for epigenetics-based recombination hotspots in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>ZCWPW1</kwd><kwd>PRDM9</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd><kwd>DNA double-strand breaks</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Programs of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1003400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hongbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31890780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hongbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009108</institution-id><institution>Shandong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016WLJH50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hongbin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ZCWPW1 is a histone modification reader that localizes to DMC1-labelled double-strand break hotspots in a largely PRDM9-dependent manner, where it facilitates completion of synapsis by mediating DSB repair process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiotic recombination ensures the faithful transmission of the genome through the pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes, and it increases genetic diversity by disrupting linkage relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolcun-Filas and Schimenti, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Handel and Schimenti, 2010</xref>). At the molecular level, meiotic recombination is initiated by the induction of programmed DSBs that are repaired by homologous recombination, leading to gene conversion and cross over formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gray and Cohen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hunter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). DSB induction is a complex process, and DSB locations are known to be marked at the very earliest stages of meiosis by trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Massy, 2013</xref>). In mammals, this is performed by the protein PRDM9, which is expressed in the leptotene and zygotene substages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parvanov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). PRDM9 is a DNA-binding zinc finger protein, with an exceptionally long and genetically variable zinc finger domain that determines its binding specificity (for defining recombination hotspots), while its SET domain possesses histone trimethyl transferase activity, and its KRAB domain is involved in protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paigen and Petkov, 2018</xref>). In yeast, the histone reader Spp1 links H3K4me3 sites at promoters with the DSB formation machinery, thus promoting DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acquaviva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sommermeyer et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, although multiple studies have shown that the H3K4me3 writer Prdm9 controls the locations of DSB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Powers et al., 2016</xref>), much less is known about the subsequent activities of any proteins that might read these epigenetic marks and thus participate in advancing the meiotic recombination process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paigen and Petkov, 2018</xref>).</p><p>DSB formation at sites defined by PRDM9 is catalyzed by an evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme complex consisting of the SPO11 enzyme and its binding partner TOPOVIBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). SPO11-mediated cleavage results in single-strand DNA overhangs that are subsequently coated by various proteins, including DMC1 and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pittman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tarsounas et al., 1999</xref>). The DSBs enable homology searching and alignment to occur, which in turn promote homology synapsis and DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inagaki et al., 2010</xref>). A basic feature of meiosis is that DSB-mediated interactions and repair processes occur differentially between homologous nonsister chromatids, rather than between sisters, as occurs in mitotic DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keeney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lange et al., 2011</xref>). Some DSBs are repaired in a way that generates crossovers, wherein DNA is exchanged between homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baudat and de Massy, 2007</xref>). The ZMM proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic>, TEX11, MSH4/MSH5, and RNF212) are a group of functionally related proteins known for their roles in promoting the formation of crossovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kneitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lynn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that the zinc finger CW-type and PWWP domain containing 1 (Zcwpw1) protein is required for meiosis prophase I in mice, and we found that <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> deficiency disrupted spermatogenesis in male mice but did not disrupt oogenesis in females to the same extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). Zcwpw1 is a member of the CW-domain containing protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perry, 2003</xref>), and its zinc finger CW (zf-CW) domain has three conserved tryptophan and four conserved cysteine residues. Structural analysis has shown that human ZCWPW1 zf-CW domain is a histone modification reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>), while chromatin pulldown analysis has confirmed that ZCWPW1 zf-CW domain recognizes H3K4me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoppmann et al., 2011</xref>). A crystal structure of the human zf-CW domain of ZCWPW1 in complex with a peptide bearing an H3K4me3 mark revealed that four amino acids – W256, E301, T302, and W303 – are primarily responsible for the binding of ZCWPW1 zf-CW domain to H3K4me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>). However, whether the H3K4me3 reading function is required for ZCWPW1's physiological role in meiosis is still unknown.</p><p>To address the physiological role of Zcwpw1’s H3K4me3 reading function, we generated an H3K4me3 reader-dead <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> knock-in mutant mouse line (<italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mouse). We found that spermatocytes were arrested at the pachytene-like stage, which phenocopied the defect seen in <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> knock–out mice thus suggesting that H3K4me3 reader function of Zcwpw1 might facilitate meiotic recombination by facilitating the DSB repair process. Mechanistically, a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of Zcwpw1, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3 in multiple knock–out and knock–in mouse lines established that Zcwpw1 is an H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 reader that exclusively binds at genomic loci bearing Prdm9-deposited histone modifications. Zcwpw1 localizes to DMC1-labelled DSB hotspots where it can read H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks. Thus, beyond demonstrating that the histone modification reader protein ZCWPW1 functions in an epigenetics-based recombination hotspot selection system, this study advances our understanding of the sequence of recruitment events that are required for crossover formation during meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The H3K4me3 reader function of ZCWPW1 is essential for meiotic recombination</title><p>Previously, we developed <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> knockout mice in the C57BL/6 genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019a</xref>) and found that loss of <italic>Zcwpw1</italic> in male mice caused a complete failure of synapsis. This failure resulted in meiotic arrest at the zygotene to pachytene stage, and this was accompanied by incomplete DSB repair and lack of crossover formation, thus leading to male infertility. In light of the known capacity of Zcwpw1 to recognize epigenetic methylation modification marks, we designed a knock-in strategy to generate a H3K4me3 reader-dead Zcwpw1mutant mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specifically, this knock-in mutant of Zcwpw1 had three mutations– W247I/E292R/W294P– and these mutations in mouse Zcwpw1 are equivalent to the previously reported W256I, E301R, and W303P mutations in the human ZCWPW1 protein (except for T302L in humans and S293 in mice, which are not conserved) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and all of them are known to be essential for the H3K4me3 reader function of human ZCWPW1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of the ZCWPW1 protein in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes, while the Zcwpw1<sup>W247I/E292R/W294P</sup> variant protein was expressed at a level similar to that of the wild type (WT) protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Consistent with the western blot data, immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections from 8-week-old WT, <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mouse testes revealed that the ZCWPW1 protein was undetectable in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatocytes but could still be found in Zcwpw1<sup>W247I/E292R/W294P</sup> mutant spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We then performed immunofluorescence staining of chromosome spreads to evaluate the recruitment of DMC1 and RAD51 to single-stranded overhang sequences in WT and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). There were no differences in the numbers of DMC1 or RAD51 foci in the leptotene or zygotene stages of the two genotypes. However, analysis of WT pachytene and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> pachytene-like spermatocytes revealed an obvious discrepancy. Decreased numbers of DMC1 and RAD51 foci were seen in the pachytene WT spermatocytes, indicating successful repair of DSBs, but the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/K</sup></italic><sup>I</sup> pachytene-like spermatocytes retained a large number of DMC1 and RAD51 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). These results suggest that the repair of DSBs is disrupted in the absence of a functional ZCWPW1 H3K4me3 reader protein and that Zcwpw1 might facilitate meiotic DSB repair downstream of strand invasion.</p><p>Seeking to further assess the functional contributions of Zcwpw1 in meiotic recombination, we analyzed chromosome spreads of spermatocytes from the testes of adult WT and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/K</sup></italic><sup>I</sup> mice by immunostaining for the recombination factors MSH4 and RNF212 and the Holliday junction resolution marker MLH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and C and E</xref>).

However, these MSH4 and RNF212 signals decreased as expected in WT pachytene spermatocytes, but persisted on the pachytene-like <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/K</sup></italic><sup>I</sup> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and D</xref>). Additionally, the MLH1 staining patterns indicated that Holliday junction resolution proceeded normally in mid- to late-pachytene WT spermatocytes but indicated that the recombination process was arrested in the pachytene-like spermatocytes lacking Zcwpw1 H3K4me3-reader function, which failed to progress to the pachytene stage and for which no crossover occurred, thus resulting in the absence of MLH1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

We found that DSBs could form normally in all of the genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but there were obvious differences between pachytene WT spermatocytes and pachytene-like <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/K</sup></italic><sup>I</sup> spermatocytes. The WT pachytene spermatocytes exhibited no obvious signal for γH2AX on autosomes, but retained a γH2AX signal on the sex chromosomes, which corresponds to the XY sex body and indicates silencing of the sex chromosomes. In contrast, both autosomes and sex chromosomes retained obvious γH2AX signals, and no XY bodies were observed in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/K</sup></italic><sup>I</sup> pachytene-like spermatocytes.

To this end, we conducted ChIP-seq using antibodies against the Zcwpw1 protein and against H3K4me3 marks. The Zcwpw1 ChIP-seq data for C57BL/6 mouse testis chromatin revealed a total of 14,688 Zcwpw1 peaks, with 499 peaks localized within 2,000 bp upstream of a transcription start site (TSS), 2146 peaks localized in exons, 6172 peaks localized in introns, and 5871 peaks localized within intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Among all ZCWPW1 binding sites detected in mouse testes, 11.5% of the ZCWPW1 binding sites (peaks) overlapped with promoters, while 6.1% of ZCWPW1 binding sites overlapped with CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In HEK293T cells, Wells et al. found that a large proportion of the weakly-binding ZCWPW1 sites overlapped with Alu repeats. Notably, the weakest ZCWPW1 peaks overlapped most frequently with Alus repeats, while the strongest peaks were depleted of Alus repeats relative to random overlap. They also found that ZCWPW1 appears to have a greater affinity for methylated CpG pairs but retains some affinity even for non-methylated regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahgoub et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wells et al., 2019</xref>).

However, most of the DEGs were not the genes whose promoters overlapped with ZCWPW1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

The ChIP-seq data from sorted meiotic cells thus allowed the elimination of H3K4me3 peaks originating from cells that did not express ZCWPW1.

We also found that the distribution pattern of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaks, which overlapped with those 1,433 ZCWPW1 peaks, was significantly different compared to the distribution pattern of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 peaks that overlapped with DMC1-labelled DSB hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, although it is clear that the majority of the Zcwpw1 peaks resulted from Prdm9 activity, it is possible that Zcwpw1 might have an additional transcription regulation function that is not obviously related to the Prdm9-mediated hotspot selection system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data support a working model wherein Prdm9 binds to specific DNA motifs in the genome and writes histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) via the methyltransferase activity of its PR/SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diagouraga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). This leads to the recruitment of proteins required for the formation of DSBs in the vicinity of its binding site (e.g., SPO11, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panizza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stanzione et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tessé et al., 2017</xref>). After these Prdm9-catalyzed epigenetic modifications are deposited, Zcwpw1 can specifically read these H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks in the vicinity of DSB sites, where Zcwpw1 functions to promote DSB repair; Zcwpw1 is not however required for DSB activity and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahgoub et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wells et al., 2019</xref>). This DSB-repair-promoting function greatly increases the overall completion rates of synapsis, crossover formation, and ultimately meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The identification of recombination hotspots was first made in genetically-tractable experimental organisms such as bacteriophages and fungi, but it is now apparent that such hotspots are ubiquitous and active in all organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wahls, 1998</xref>). Higher-order chromosome architecture, which can be described using the terminology of the ‘tethered-loop/axis complex’ model, contributes to DSB hotspot localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blat et al., 2002</xref>), and different strategies and mechanisms for the spatial regulation of DSB formation have evolved in different species, although these have many common features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Massy, 2013</xref>). In considering the evolution of hotspot selection systems, we are interested in whether other meiotic factors might have evolved in vertebrates to link PRDM9 to the meiotic recombination machinery and/or the synaptonemal complex, which would permit direct interactions with the histone marks deposited by Prdm9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paigen and Petkov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tock and Henderson, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Spp1–whose PHD finger domain is known to read H3K4me3 marks– promotes meiotic DSB formation by interacting with the axis-bound Spo11 accessory protein Mer2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acquaviva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sommermeyer et al., 2013</xref>). Our study in mammals supports that one or more other as-yet unknown proteins might function in a similar role during DSB formation. It is noteworthy that there is structural similarity between the zf-CW domain and the PHD finger of Spp1 that helps recognize histone H3 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams-Cioaba and Min, 2009</xref>). Moreover, structural analysis has indicated that the zf-CW domain of human ZCWPW1 is a histone modification reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>), and chromatin pulldown analysis has confirmed that this domain recognizes H3K4me3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoppmann et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we showed that Zcwpw1 can specifically read H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks in the vicinity of DSB sites. However, somewhat surprisingly, our subsequent experiments indicated that deficiency of Zcwpw1 did not affect the recruitment of recombination-related factors like DMC1, MSH4, or RNF212, thereby implying that there might be other unknown proteins that function to link Prdm9 to meiotic recombination machinery.</p><p>The zf-CW domain of ZCWPW1 has previously been shown to bind to H3K4me3 peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2010</xref>), and the PWWP domain, another type of ‘reader’ module, has been shown to recognize H3K36me3 in both peptide and nucleosome contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eidahl et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rondelet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vezzoli et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with a recently deposited pre-print at bioRxiv showing that Zcwpw1 can bind to histone H3 peptides with double H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks with high affinity at a 1:1 ratio in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahgoub et al., 2019</xref>), we also found that Zcwpw1 localized to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment regions in ChIP-seq analysis. Notably, most of the Zcwpw1 peaks overlapping H3K4me3 peaks disappeared in <italic>Prdm9</italic> knockout mice. One functional implication of our study is that it is Prdm9's histone modification activity, rather than the chromatin residence of the Prdm9 protein per se, that might account for the functional interactions of the apparently co-involved Zcwpw1 and Prdm9 proteins.</p><p>Our H3K4me3 reader-dead mutant mice showed that, upon loss of the binding affinity of the Zcwpw1 zf-CW domain for H3K4me3 marks, the Zcwpw1 protein completely lost its ability to bind chromatin, and spermatocytes in mice expressing this knock-in H3K4me3 reader-dead mutant Zcwpw1 exhibited a nearly complete failure of meiosis prophase I. We also hypothesize that this protein is unable to bind unmodified histones, that is, the mutant protein might be a histone binding-dead variant in addition to being a reader-dead variant. However, it remains unclear whether the Zcwpw1 PWWP domain, which likely functions in reading H3K36me3 marks, and/or other regions of the Zcwpw1 protein confer similarly important functions. Indeed, in future work we plan to pursue the selective disruption of the function of particular Zcwpw1 domains in our attempts to elucidate this protein's functions in male meiosis I.</p><p>While we clearly show that Zcwpw1 greatly facilitates PRDM9-dependent DSB repair, we do not yet have strong evidence for the precise nature of its functional role. One possibility is that Zcwpw1, upon binding to PRDM9-dependent histone modification hotspots, might serve as a DSB mark, which can perhaps subsequently recruit other factors involved in DSB repair. Recent studies have reported that PRDM9 binds on both the cut and uncut template chromosomes to promote meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2019b</xref>). It is also possible that Zcwpw1 might directly interact with the SC machinery by using its SCP1-like domain to tether PRDM9-bound loops to the SC in order to promote homologous DSB repair.</p><p>In summary, our study identifies Zcwpw1 as an H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 reader that promotes the repair of DNA DSBs during meiotic recombination. Complementary analyses and similar conclusions were obtained by Maghoub et al and by Wells et al, establishing that ZCWPW1 is not required for DSB activity and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahgoub et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wells et al., 2019</xref>), findings which do not support the previous speculation that Zcwpw1 directs the location or the formation of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). In future studies, we plan to focus on additional proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic>, ZCWPW2, MORC3/4, etc.) that have similar functional domains as Zcwpw1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), with the aim of identifying any unknown biomolecules that might act to link PRDM9 to the DSB machinery specifically or to meiotic recombination more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

From this shuffling, the average overlap and standard deviation of the random binding site set was determined, as well as the statistical significance of the association between ZCWPW1 binding sites. Taking the overlap of ZCWPW1 peaks and transposable elements (from RepeatMasker) as an example, pair-end reads were aligned to mouse genome, and then uniquely mapped reads were used to call peaks in the ChIP-seq Bioinformatics Analysis. The random ZCWPW1 peaks were generated using the aforementioned regioneR package. The number of random ZCWPW1 peaks sharing overlap with different types of transposable elements (TE) was obtained in regioneR (whose overlap calculation is same as in bedtoool intersect).

For background, recall that there is only 25% (83 aa/331 aa) similarity between ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2. The first line of evidence is as follows: we raised the antibody against a 175 amino acid peptide unique to the C-terminal region of ZCWPW1. There is only 8.8% (29 aa/331 aa) similarity between the C-terminal regions of ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2. Epitopes are peptides generally longer than 5 amino acids, and we did not find the same potential epitopes between ZCWPW1 and ZCWPW2. Second, our western blots established that the antibody we produced recognizes a specific band of the expected size in the wild type but not the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> testes (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Third, immunofluorescence staining shows that ZCWPW1 mainly localizes to WT nuclei of leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes but disappears in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>spermatocytes (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). Fourth, our ChIP-seq shows that ZCWPW1 can specifically bind to histone modification sites deposited by PRDM9, while there are no binding peaks in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3A, D). Thus, we have four separate lines of empirical evidence supporting the specificity of our antibody for ZCWPW1 vs. ZCWPW2. We appreciate the necessity of establishing this point to justify our specific claims in this study, and we thank the reviewers for focusing our attention here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Test transcriptome of ZCWPW1 KO, any modification of gene expression and/or TE: analyse transcriptome from 10-12dpp mice and compare with wt and Prdm9 KO.</p><p>Cellularity of wild type and mutants should be quite close (although not necessarily identical) at these ages, and potential gene expression changes could also be compared with binding sites at promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have written the text as the follows:</p><p>“Because we found that 1,766 of the ZCWPW1 binding sites overlapped with promoters, we sought to examine the transcriptome in <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> testes by RNA-seq to investigate whether ZCWPW1 affected the expression of those genes whose promoters overlapped ZCWPW1 binding sites. […] These data strongly suggest that ZCWPW1 might not affect the transcription level of genes even though it can bind to their promoter regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Test in vitro binding affinity of the mutant protein to H3K4, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very important question which, but unfortunately this cannot be addressed with certainty at present. To achieve social distancing in the face of the COVID19 pandemic, our laboratory has been closed since 23 January 2020. However, several other pieces of evidence can potentially offer the same support. For example, Mahgoub et al. confirmed that recombinant ZCWPW1 (1–440aa) binds with the highest affinity to H3K4me3/K36me3 peptides in vitro (Mahgoub et al., 2019). In addition, He et al. have confirmed that the human zf-CW domain preferentially binds to the histone H3 tail with trimethylated K4, and in contrast the zf-CW mutant (W256I/E301R/T302L/W303P) lost its binding to H3K4me3 and H3K4me0 (He et al., 2010). Most importantly, we have also performed an additional ZCWPW1 ChIP-seq analysis of testes samples from PD14 (postnatal day 14) WT, <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice. This analysis clearly indicated that no ZCWPW1 peaks were detected in the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice (Figure 1A and D). These in vivo results, viewed alongside the previous reports of ZCWPW1 function in the meiotic process in addition to reports demonstrating that these specific mutations in ZCWPW1's zf-CW domain affect the protein's ability to read histone modifications (including H3K4me3), together support our conclusion that the ZCWPW1<sup>W247I/E292R/W294P</sup> variant is an H3K4me3-reader-dead variant of ZCWPW1. We hypothesize that the mutant protein is not only an H3K4me3-reader-dead variant of ZCWPW1, but is also a histone binding-dead variant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Revise and improve cytology.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this very constructive critique from the reviewer, and we have worked hard to improve our cytology reporting. First, we have re-organized all of the cytology for WT, <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice. Now, the Results section begins directly with the phenotypic analysis of WT, <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice (Figure 1 and 2) as the basis for exploration of the underlying mechanism of ZCWPW1 involvement in meiosis prophase I. Second, we have quantified the number of synapsis chromosomes in WT, <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> spermatocytes to show the synapsis defects in mutant mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). In addition, we have quantified the number of foci for DMC1, RAD51, MSH4, and RNF212 in WT and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> spermatocytes to show the recombination defects in mutant mice (Figure 1D and F; Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and D).</p><p>In addition, it bears mentioning that we have tested several commercial and homemade antibodies against MSH4 and RNF212 for immunofluorescence staining of spermatocytes, most of which did not work. We found that one commercial MSH4 antibody (Abcam #ab58666 Lot:GR319120-8) and a homemade RNF212 antibody (a gift from Mengcheng Luo, Wuhan University) both worked but with some background noise. We also designed a new immunization strategy to generate new MSH4 and RNF212 antibodies in the hope that they can perform well in spermatocyte immunofluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Analysis of ZCWPW1 binding : explain data, normalization, analyze throughout the genome including TSS, enhancers, CpG islands, along genes.; analyze quantitatively and correlate with other landmarks (H3K4me3, H3K36me3, Spo11, DMC1, PRDM9…), analyse in the PAR (Prdm9 independent DSB sites), full analysis in Prdm9 KO, full analysis in ZCWPW1 KI.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this analysis which has absolutely led to the overall improvement of our study and our manuscript. We have made a major effort to address the remaining concerns, detailed below.</p><p>All of the ChIP-seq signals in this study were normalized, as described in the Materials and methods. Specifically, we first generated the whole genome signal for each base with RPM (reads per million reads). Then, we calculated the fold change over input as the final normalized signal for the whole genome. For the signal in specific regions, we calculated the normalized signal for 40 bp bins using computeMatrix in the Deeptools2 software. We have subsequently fully analyzed ZCWPW1 binding throughout the genome in the revised manuscript (subsection “ZCWPW1 is an H3K4me3/H3K36me3 reader”).</p><p>The quantification and correlation analysis between ZCWPW1 and other landmarks (i.e., H3K4me3, H3K36me3, PRDM9, DMC1, SPO11) are provided in the revised text (subsections “ZCWPW1 is an H3K4me3/H3K36me3 reader”; “<italic>Zcwpw1</italic> binding is strongly promoted by the histone modification activity of <italic>Prdm9</italic>”; “<italic>Zcwpw1</italic> localizes to DMC1-labelled DSB hotspots in a PRDM9-dependent manner”). In addition, we have fully analyzed the ZCWPW1 binding in <italic>Prdm9<sup>−/−</sup> </italic>mice (subsections “<italic>Zcwpw1</italic> binding is strongly promoted by the histone modification activity of <italic>Prdm9</italic>”; “<italic>Zcwpw1</italic> localizes to DMC1-labelled DSB hotspots in a PRDM9-dependent manner”). We conducted an additional ZCWPW1 ChIP-seq analysis of testes samples from PD14 WT, <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, and <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice. This analysis clearly indicated that no ZCWPW1 peaks were detected in the <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Zcwpw1<sup>KI/KI</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3A and D). We also found that ZCWPW1 could localize to DMC1-labelled hotspots in the pseudo-autosomal region similarly to its localization in autosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Strongly revise the whole organisation and presentation of the manuscript and edit for language, remove redundancies, present figures in a proper order as they are cited in the text, make sure all figures and supplementary figures are cited in the text, use a more coherent logic for presenting the ChipSeq localization of ZCWPW1 to hotspots, and for cytology as well, make sure that every conclusion is supported by the data which is presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer’s constructive comments and suggestions that have helped us to improve the coherence of our manuscript. We have modified the whole manuscript to accommodate the reviewer’s suggestions. Specifically, we would also like to note that the revised manuscript has been professionally edited for grammar and usage by a PhD-level scientific editor with a background in molecular biology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
