mechanisms are not well known. Here, we report <italic>CEP78</italic> as a causative gene of a particular syndrome including CRD and male infertility with multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF) both in human and mouse. <italic>Cep78</italic> knockout mice exhibited impaired function and morphology of photoreceptors, typified by reduced ERG amplitudes, disrupted translocation of cone arrestin, attenuated and disorganized photoreceptor outer segments (OS) disks and widen OS bases, as well as interrupted connecting cilia elongation and abnormal structures. <italic>Cep78</italic> deletion also caused male infertility and MMAF, with disordered ‘9+2’ structure and triplet microtubules in sperm flagella. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins IFT20 and TTC21A are identified as interacting proteins of CEP78. Furthermore, CEP78 regulated the interaction, stability, and centriolar localization of its interacting protein. Insufficiency of CEP78 or its interacting protein causes abnormal centriole elongation and cilia shortening. Absence of CEP78 protein in human caused similar phenotypes in vision and MMAF as <italic>Cep78<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Collectively, our study supports the important roles of <italic>CEP78</italic> defects in centriole and ciliary dysfunctions and molecular pathogenesis of such multi-system syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CEP78</kwd><kwd>male infertility</kwd><kwd>cone-rod dystrophy</kwd><kwd>IFT20</kwd><kwd>TTC21A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

disease, features photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gill et al., 2019</xref>). A small portion of CRDs is due to retina cilia defects, and they may have cilia-related syndromic defects in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gill et al., 2019</xref>). In this circumstance, pathogenic genes of those CRDs are associated with connecting cilia in photoreceptor, a type of non-motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khanna et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>CEP250</italic> mutation is related to CRD and hearing loss (CRDHL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kubota et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>CEP19</italic> mutation to CRD with obesity and renal malformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yıldız Bölükbaşı et al., 2018</xref>). Different from photoreceptor connecting cilia, sperm flagellum is motile cilia. Motile and immotile cilia defects usually do not occur at the same time. However, occasionally, CRD can also develop as a syndrome together with abnormalities of sperm flagella. As this syndrome leads to defects of two unrelated physiological functions of vision and reproduction, comprehensive analysis of its specific genetic etiology and molecular mechanism is still limited.</p><p>Centrosomal protein of 78 kDa (CEP78), protein encoded by the <italic>CEP78</italic> gene (MIM: 617110), is a centriolar protein composed of 722 amino acids and possesses two leucine-rich repeat regions and a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunk et al., 2016</xref>). CEP78 localizes to the distal region of mature centrioles and is exclusively expressed in ciliated organisms, supporting its crucial function in maintaining centrosome homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hossain, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azimzadeh et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations in the <italic>CEP78</italic> gene cause autosomal recessive CRDHL (MIM: 617236; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nikopoulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Namburi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanchis-Juan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascari et al., 2020</xref>). Deregulation of Cep78 also contributes to colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2016a</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nesslinger et al., 2007</xref>), and asthenoteratozoospermia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascari et al., 2020</xref>). As a centrosomal protein, CEP78 functions downstream of CEP350 to control biogenesis of primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2021</xref>) and regulates centrosome homeostasis through interactions with other centrosomal proteins, including CEP76, CP110, and EDD-DYRK2-DDB1<sup>VprBP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hossain, 2017</xref>). Despite these findings, the biological function of Cep78, especially its function and mechanism in CRD with male infertility, has not been well understood yet.</p><p>In this study, based on results of a male patient carrying <italic>CEP78</italic> mutation and <italic>Cep78</italic> gene knockout mice, we report <italic>CEP78</italic> as a causative gene for CRD and male sterility. We revealed that CEP78 deficiency caused dysfunction and irregular ciliary structure of photoreceptors. Deletion of <italic>Cep78</italic> triggered male infertility, spermatogenesis defects, aberrant sperm flagella structures and manchette formation, and abnormal spermatid centriole length in male mice. The male patient carrying homozygous <italic>CEP78</italic> mutation leading to CEP78 protein loss also presented with syndromic phenotypes including CRD, hearing loss, and multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). IFT20 and TTC21A are both IFT proteins interacting with each other and vital for spermatogenesis and cilliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). To construct and maintain cilia, IFTs are recruited to the basal body and traffic proteins between cilia and the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hibbard et al., 2021</xref>). IFT particle is assembled with two subcomplexes (IFT-A and -B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wingfield et al., 2021</xref>). IFT20 is part of IFT-B subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petriman et al., 2022</xref>) while TTC21A is part of IFT-A complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hesketh et al., 2022</xref>). We found that CEP78 interacted with IFT20 and TTC21A, which are vital for spermatogenesis and cilliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keady et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2016a</xref>), and regulated their interaction and stability. It recruited centrosome localization of IFT20. Defects of CEP78 and its interaction protein might lead to extended centriole and shortened cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Cep78<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice</title><p>To investigate the role of CEP78, we generated <italic>Cep78</italic> knockout mice using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas 9 system. A single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exons 2 and 11 of the <italic>Cep78</italic> mice gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) was designed, generated, and injected into C57BL/6 mice zygote with the Cas 9 RNA. Genotyping confirmed deletion of exons 2–11 in heterozygotes and homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Meanwhile, the size exclusion chromatography result demonstrated that endogenous testicular Cep78, Ift20, and Ttc21a proteins were co-fractionated in a complex ranging in size of 158–670 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Cep78 was previously reported to localize at the distal half of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hossain, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2021</xref>), our 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) showed that Ift20 and Ttc21a localized peripheral to Cep78 at the top view of the centriole, and Ift20 and Ttc21a co-localized at one end of Cep78-positive centriole part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we found that expression of both Ttc21a and Ift20 decreased in testes of <italic>Cep78</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to <italic>Cep78</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–I</xref>).

These results show that disruption of the Cep78 potentially affects stability of its interacting proteins, Ift20 and Ttc21a.</p><p>We then aimed to determine the functions of Ift20 and Ttc21a. Cep78 is a centrosomal protein that was reported to be located at distal end of centrioles. 3D-SIM results showed that Ift20 and Ttc21a localized at one end of Cep78-positive centriole part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). And we found that all three proteins were located at the base of the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating their roles in ciliogenesis. To respectively clarify the cilliogenesis function of Cep78, Ift20, and Ttc21a, we investigated the functional consequences of their knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N and O</xref>). Efficiencies for <italic>Cep78</italic>, <italic>Ift20</italic>, and <italic>Ttc21a</italic> knockdown using <italic>Cep78</italic>-siRNA, <italic>Ift20</italic>-siRNA, and <italic>Ttc21a</italic>-siRNA and rescue by Cep78<sup>syn</sup>-HA, Ift20<sup>syn</sup>-Flag, and Ttc21a<sup>syn</sup>-Flag with synonymous mutations at their siRNA targeting sequence were confirmed by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J–M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3D, E, H, I</xref>).

However, we observed no change in centriole length after <italic>Ttc21a</italic> knockdown or rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P and Q</xref>). Additionally, we also observed that the centriolar localization of Ift20 protein was disrupted after Cep78 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7R and S</xref>), and depletion of Cep78 downregulated Ift20 and Ttc21a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, H, J and M</xref>), while knockdown of <italic>Ift20</italic> or <italic>Ttc21a</italic> did not significantly affect the protein level of Cep78 and other interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3D, F, G, H, J, K</xref>), indicating that Cep78 maintains centriole homeostasis and cilliogenesis by recruiting Ift20 and Ttc21a.</p><p>Thus, our data suggest that insufficiency of Cep78 and its interacting proteins caused cilia shortening and centriole elongation, which is consistent with phenotypes we observed in <italic>Cep78</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.

Most views hold that manchette microtubules are nucleated at spermatid centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehti and Sironen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kierszenbaum et al., 2002</xref>), which start from nucleator γ-tubulin of the centrosomal adjunct and end at perinuclear rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kierszenbaum et al., 2011</xref>). According to our data, besides disorganized manchette structures, elongated centrioles are also observed in <italic>Cep78<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, indicating CEP78’s potential role in organizing manchette microtubules. Taken together, CEP78 dysfunction specifically impairs organization of microtubular-based structures.</p><p>One previous study indicated the involvement of CEP78 in regulation of centriole length. We herein also observed stretched centriole length in <italic>Cep78<sup>−/−</sup></italic> spermatids, and downregulation of the interacting protein of CEP78, Ift20. CEP78 can recruit the centriole localization of Ift20, whose knockdown causes centriole elongation. Moreover, triplet microtubules, which are specific to proximal centriole in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avidor-Reiss and Fishman, 2019</xref>), are aberrantly found in principal and middle pieces of sperm flagella from both the male patient with <italic>CEP78</italic> mutation and <italic>Cep78<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, possibly caused by abnormal elongation of the triplet microtubules of centriole. However, such anomaly in both human and mouse sperms has never been reported before.</p><p>We found that CEP78 loss led to shortening of sperm flagellum, with Cp110 downregulated in <italic>Cep78</italic><sup>−/−</sup> testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), which is inconsistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2021</xref>’s findings that cells lacking CEP78 display upregulated CP110 and reduced cilia frequency with long cilia phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonçalves et al., 2021</xref>). It seems that Cep78 may regulate formation of sperm flagellum by a different mechanism. Our analysis of interacting proteins of Cep78 showed that CEP78 interacted with two other proteins required for sperm flagellar formation, IFT20 and TTC21A. Cep78 regulates the interaction between Ift20 and Ttc21a, and loss of Cep78 led to downregulation of both Ift20 and Ttc21a. Insufficiency of Cep78 and any interacting proteins disrupts its structure and affects stability of all components, leading to cilia shortening. IFT20, belonging to the IFT family, is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). It is required for opsin trafficking and photoreceptor OS development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keady et al., 2011</xref>) and plays important roles in spermatogenesis and particularly spermiogenesis by transferring cargo proteins for sperm flagella formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>). During spermiogenesis, IFT20 is transported along the manchette microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kazarian et al., 2018</xref>). IFT20 is essential to male fertility, spermatogenesis, and particularly spermiogenesis by transferring cargo proteins for sperm flagella formation. Multiple sperm flagella abnormalities are observed in <italic>Ift20</italic> mutant mice, including short and kinked tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2016a</xref>). TTC21A/IFT139 is also essential for sperm flagellar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). TTC21A interacts with IFT20, and mutations in <italic>TTC21A</italic> gene are reported to cause MMAF in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). However, more studies are still warranted to better elucidate the biological mechanism of CEP78 in regulating features of spermatozoa and photoreceptors.</p><p>CEP78 protein is highly conserved in vertebrate organisms with human and mouse CEP78 proteins sharing over 80% similarity. Disease phenotypes and changes of ultra-structures were highly consistent between human and mice upon CEP78 depletion. Our study also reveals <italic>Cep78<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice model as an applicable animal model for therapeutic research of such a distinct syndrome.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify CEP78 as a causative gene for a type of syndrome involving CRD and male infertility. CEP78 dysfunction induces similar phenotypes and ultra-structure changes in human and mice, including disturbed ciliary structure in photoreceptors, defective sperm flagella structures, and aberrant spermatid head formation. We also found that CEP78 interacted physically with IFT proteins IFT20 and TTC21A and regulated their interaction and stability. The interaction between CEP78, IFT20, and TTC21A is important for the regulation of centriole and cilia length. Our study explains the etiology and animal model of the syndrome of CRD and male infertility, provides basis for molecular diagnosis, and serves as a potential target for future gene therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethnical statement</title><p>Our study, conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, was prospectively reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of People’s Hospital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region ([2016] Ethic Review [Scientific Research] NO. 018) and Nanjing Medical University (NMU Ethic Review NO.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Study on gene knockout mice and human mutant individual reveals absence of CEP78 causes photoreceptor and sperm flagella impairments&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ricardo Azziz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim that CEP78 binds directly to IFT20 and TTC21A is not justified by the data provided. Either this data should be removed from the manuscript or additional experiments (including relevant negative control IPs) should be performed to support this claim. For example, the IPs of mouse testis extracts that were used for the MS analysis in Table S4 were performed with an antibody against endogenous CEP78. One caveat with this approach is that the antibody might block binding of CEP78 to some of its interactors, e.g. if the epitope recognized by the antibody is located within one or more interactor binding sites in CEP78. This could explain why the authors did not identify some of the previously identified CEP78 interactors in their IP, such as CEP76 and the EDD-DYRK2-DDB1-VprBP complex (Hossain et al. 2017) as well as CEP350 (Goncalves et al. 2021).</p><p>2) Details about what part of the CEP78 protein the custom-made antibody detects (before or after 10 bp deletion?), as well as how it was made, need to be provided. This would be necessary to know in order to eliminate the possibility of the existence of truncated CEP78 protein in the affected patient, and could also help clarify whether the antibody might inhibit binding of CEP78 to previously identified binding partners (see comment above).</p><p>3) Figure 1F and Figure 4K: the data needs to be quantified.</p><p>4) In Figure 2A, another marker (e.g. NPHP1) for the connecting cilium should be used, as the connecting cilium is not apparent in the images shown here. Also, notation for red arrows in Figure 2 should be provided, and authors should comment on the apparent shape change of the connecting cilium in the mutant, which seems disorganized and swollen compared to control.</p><p>5) The efficiency of the siRNA knockdown shown in 7J-M was only assessed by qPCR (Figure S4), but this does not necessarily mean the corresponding proteins were depleted. Western blot analysis needs to be performed to show depletion at the protein level. Furthermore, it would be desirable with rescue experiments to validate the specificity of the siRNAs used.</p><p>6) Figure 7I: the resolution of the IFM is not very high and certainly not sufficient to demonstrate that CEP78, IFT20 and TTC21A co-localize to the same region on the centrosome, which one would have expected if they directly interact. CEP78 was previously shown to localize to the distal end of the (mother) centriole wall in cultured mammalian cells (Brunk et al. 2016; Hossein et al., 2017; Goncalves et al., 2021), whereas IFT proteins are concentrated near the transition fibers. If authors want to claim direct interaction and co-localisation between these proteins, higher resolution images (e.g. IEM, STED, 3D-SIM or similar) of these proteins in spermatids need to be provided. Such an analysis might also provide useful information regarding the mechanism by which CEP78 affects flagellum biogenesis, and possibly explain why the mechanism appears different from that observed in cultured human cells (Figure S5, Discussion lines 467-471).</p><p>7) The manuscript text needs to be rewritten to improve clarity, eliminate grammatical errors, make several statements more accurate, and better present and discuss the results in the context of known literature in the field. Specifically:</p><p>a) It is not immediately clear if the human mutation was identified by the authors and presented for the first time in this publication or was already done before. 'In this study, based on results of a male patient carrying CEP78 mutation and Cep78 gene knockout mice, we report CEP78 as a new causative gene for a distinct syndrome involving two phenotypes, CRD and male sterility[16].' Reference 16 does not seem related to the discovery of the CEP78 mutation and it is unclear why it is included here (lanes 106-108). If the patient's CEP78 mutation is the same as published in Qing Fu et al. (10.1136/jmedgenet-2016-104166) why it was reported as causing Usher syndrome and in the current publication it is not mentioned at all? Do authors think that CEP78 mutation is associated with Usher's syndrome? It is important to discuss this.</p><p>b) In a previous study a missense variant in CEP78 was shown to be associated with astenoteratozoospermia and reduced male fertility, but no morphological defects in sperm were observed (Ascari, G., et al., 2020). The authors should discuss this obvious phenotypic and functional difference between the missense variant and 10 bp deletion in CEP78, that they have studied. Also, they may want to comment on the low penetrance of the infertility phenotype in human patients (e.g. see discussion on this in PMID: 35240912).</p><p>c) Page 5, given the previous report of CEP78 patients with retina degeneration, hearing loss, and reduced infertility (Ascari et al. 2020), the statement of &quot;we report CEP78 as a NEW causative gene for a distinct syndrome…TWO phenotypes…..&quot; Is not accurate.</p><p>d) Introduction. The statement that &quot;CRD usually exists with combination of immotile cilia defects in other systems&quot; is not correct. CRD due to ciliopathy can have cilia-related syndromic defects in other systems but it is a relatively small portion of all CRDs and the most frequently mutated genes are not cilia-related genes, such as ABCA4, GUCY2D, CRX.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The manuscript contains several grammatical errors and would benefit from proofreading by an expert in English language.</p><p>2) Reference list: references 8 and 23 are identical; reference 19 is incomplete.</p><p>3) Figures: the following figures are very small, and it is difficult to see all the details: Figure 1F, H, I, J; Figure 4C-J; Figure5N. I recommend increasing the figure size.</p><p>4) Line 27: fertility should be infertility.</p><p>5) Line 92: I believe CEP78 has more than 2 leucine rich repeats (up to 7 or 8), which are distributed in 2 leucine-rich repeat regions. Please double-check and clarify.</p><p>6) Line 180: CEP78 is not a ciliary protein, it is a centrosomal protein. Please correct.</p><p>7) Table S4 and Methods section page 34: the authors need to indicate which CEP78 antibody was used for the IP analysis and how much of it was used.</p><p>8) CEP78 was previously shown to localize to the distal end of the (mother) centriole wall in cultured mammalian cells (Brunk et al. 2016; Hossein et al., 2017; Goncalves et al., 2021), whereas IFT proteins are concentrated near the transition fibers. To support the authors' claim that CEP78 forms a trimeric complex with IFT20 and TTC21A they should consider doing high-resolution localization analysis (TEM, STED, 3D-SIM or similar) of these proteins in spermatids. Such an analysis might also provide useful information regarding the mechanism by which CEP78 affects flagellum biogenesis, and possibly explain why the mechanism appears different from that observed in cultured human cells (Figure S5, Discussion lines 467-471).</p><p>9) Figure S5, Table S2 and Table S3: CP110 looks downregulated in the testis of the Cep78-/- animals, yet CP110 was not detected in the MS analysis shown in Tables S2 and S3. Please explain this discrepancy.</p><p>10) Methods section: information describing how the CEP78 antibodies were produced is missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I suggest rewriting the introduction section to make the statement accurate.</p><p>2. Better quantify the data as suggested in my specific comments.</p><p>3. Conduct experiments suggested to provide evidence to support the conclusion. To show the three protein form timer, additional experimental evidence such as gel filtration is needed. To better visualize CC, NPHP1 or other proper markers should be used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The experimental base is sufficient in this research to validate the statements.

Firstly, the antigenic sequence of our Cep78 antibody is p457-741 (NP_932136.2). Cep78 was reported to bind DD-DYRK2-DDB1-VprBP complex, the 1-520aa is responsible for Cep78’s interaction with VprBP, and deletion of p450-497 didn’t affect Cep78’s interaction with VprBP, indicating1-450aa of Cep78 might interact with VprBp (Hossain et al. 2017). Our anti-Cep78 antibody recognizes p457-741 of Cep78, the binding of Cep78 (p1-457aa) to VprBP is not expected to be blocked by our anti-Cep78 antibody. However, VprBp was not detected by our IP-MS experiment. C-terminal region (395-722aa) of Cep78 overlaps with our Cep78 antibody’s antigenic region (p457-741), and interacts with Cep350 (Goncalves et al. 2021). As a polyclonal antibody, our anti-Cep78 antibody seems not to block the interaction of Cep78 (p457-741) with other proteins, because we still identified Cep350 in our IP-MS. So we believe that our Cep78 antibody may not block the potential interaction of endogenous Cep78 with other known interactors.</p><p>Ttc21a and Ift20 were identified as Cep78’s interacting protein by pulling down endogenous Cep78. To further validate the interaction between Cep78 and Ttc21a or Ift20, we performed reciprocal co-IP between Cep78 and Ttc21a or Ift20 by overexpression (Figure 7A-C), and observed colocalization between Cep78 and Ttc21a or Ift20. As suggested by the reviewer, we added Gapdh (Figure 7D) and Ap80-NB-HA (Figure 7—figure supplement 2 A-C) in co-IP as negative controls. Besides, we provided evidence that Cep78, Ift20 and Ttc21a form a complex, as they all co-fractioned in a testicular protein complex at the size between158 kDa to 670 kDa using size exclusion chromatography (Figure 7E). With these data, we think that Cep78 interacts with Ttc21a and Ift20. We rephrased “direct interaction” as “interaction” in the manuscript.</p><p>We believe that our findings of interactions of Cep78 with Ttc21a or Ift20 do not contradict the previously reports of the functions of Cep78. And we believe that our findings provide novel molecular basis of Cep78 in sperm flagella formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Details about what part of the CEP78 protein the custom-made antibody detects (before or after 10 bp deletion?), as well as how it was made, need to be provided. This would be necessary to know in order to eliminate the possibility of the existence of truncated CEP78 protein in the affected patient, and could also help clarify whether the antibody might inhibit binding of CEP78 to previously identified binding partners (see comment above).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for reviewer’s comments. CEP78 antibody was generated based on the antigen sequence of p100-515 in CEP78 protein (NP_001092272.1). And the antigen sequence is before the 10 bp deletion in the patient with mutation of canonical splicing acceptor site of exon 14 (c.1629-2A&gt;G, p.?). If truncated CEP78 (p.G545Pfs*6) protein of 61 kD is expressed, it will contain the antigen sequence and is expected to be detected by our anti-CEP78 antibody. Our Western blot results showed no expression of truncated CEP78 in the patient (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have added the following detail information of the antibody in the section of Materials and methods: The custom-made human CEP78 and mouse Cep78 antibodies were produced by Abclonal (Wuhan, China), p457-741 of mouse Cep78 (NP_932136.2) and p100-515 of human CEP78 protein (NP_001092272.1) were cloned to pET-28a (+) high-expression plasmid vectors, respectively. The immunogen was expressed in BL21 prokaryotic cells and immunized with experimental Japanese white rabbit. After the animals are sacrificed, the rabbit serum is subjected to antigen affinity purification. Which is at Page 15-16, line 341-348, line 357-358 in our new version of manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1F and Figure 4K: the data needs to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. For Figure 4K, we stained <italic>Cep78<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Cep78<sup>-/-</sup></italic> spermatids with anti-Centrin 1 to measure the centriole length.

Also, notation for red arrows in Figure 2 should be provided, and authors should comment on the apparent shape change of the connecting cilium in the mutant, which seems disorganized and swollen compared to control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion, we have stained retinal cryosections from <italic>Cep78<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Cep78<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with anti-Nphp1 to visualize connecting cilium (Figure 2A-B). The results indicated that connecting cilia are shortened in <italic>Cep78<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to <italic>Cep78<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (Figure 2A-B). We also re-measured the length of CC as the length of ciliary structure out of outer segment in TEM (Figure 2C-D). The ciliary structure inside the outlet segment is axoneme, which is not included in the length measurement. And our TEM results showed shortened connecting cilia in photoreceptors of <italic>Cep78<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figures 2C-D), which is consistent with the results of Nphp1immunofluorescence.</p><p>Besides, we observed that upper parts of connecting cilia were swelled with disorganized microtubules in TEM (Figure 2E-G).

Furthermore, it would be desirable with rescue experiments to validate the specificity of the siRNAs used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To validate the specificity of the siRNAs used, we performed rescue experiments using rescue plasmid with siRNA targeting sequence synonymously mutated (Table 4).</p><p>The efficiency of siRNA knockdown were evaluated by both qPCR (Figure 7—figure supplement 3.A-C) and Western Blot (Figures 7.J-K, Figure 7—figure supplement 3.D-E,H-I). The results showed that siRNAs significantly reduced the expression of Cep78, Ift20, and Ttc21a at both mRNA Figure 7—figure supplement 3.A-C and protein levels (Figures 7.J-K, Figure 7—figure supplement 3.A-C), respectively. Meanwhile, co-transfection of rescue plasmids of Cep78<sup>syn</sup>-HA, Ift20<sup>syn</sup>-Flag and Ttc21a<sup>syn</sup>-Flag rescued the expression of Cep78, Ift20, and Ttc21a at both mRNA (Figure 7—figure supplement 3.A-C) and protein levels (Figures 7.J-K, Figure 7—figure supplement 3.D-E, H-I) compared with siRNA groups, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, we evaluated whether the effects are specific for Cep78, Ift20 and Ttc21siRNAs in the regulation of cilia and centriole lengths. The results showed that the suppression effects of Cep78, Ift20 and Ttc21 siRNAs on cilia and centriole lengths could be rescued by the overexpression of rescue plasmids of Cep78<sup>syn</sup>-HA, Ift20<sup>syn</sup>-Flag and Ttc21a<sup>syn</sup>-Flag (Figures 7.N-S), respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 7I: the resolution of the IFM is not very high and certainly not sufficient to demonstrate that CEP78, IFT20 and TTC21A co-localize to the same region on the centrosome, which one would have expected if they directly interact. CEP78 was previously shown to localize to the distal end of the (mother) centriole wall in cultured mammalian cells (Brunk et al. 2016; Hossein et al., 2017; Goncalves et al., 2021), whereas IFT proteins are concentrated near the transition fibers. If authors want to claim direct interaction and co-localisation between these proteins, higher resolution images (e.g. IEM, STED, 3D-SIM or similar) of these proteins in spermatids need to be provided. Such an analysis might also provide useful information regarding the mechanism by which CEP78 affects flagellum biogenesis, and possibly explain why the mechanism appears different from that observed in cultured human cells (Figure S5, Discussion lines 467-471).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestions. To better demonstrate co-localization of CEP78, IFT20 and TTC21A on the centrosome, we overexpressed Cep78-Halo, Ift20-mCherry and Ttc21a-mEmerald in NIH3T3 cells by lentivirus, and photographed super-resolution images with SIM (N-sim, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The SIM results showed that Ift20 and Ttc21a co-localized with Cep78 (Figure 7F). Cep78 was previously reported to localize at the centriole (Goncalves et al., 2021). The co-localization of Cep78, Ift20 and Ttc21a indicated possible important roles of Cep78 in the regulation of Ift20 and Ttc21a in centriole. Our interaction analysis revealed that Cep78 interacted with Ift20 and Ttc21a (Figure 7D), and formed a complex with Ift20 and Ttc21a (Figure 7E). Loss of Cep78 down-regulated the expression of and interaction between Ift20 and Ttc21a (Figures 7G-M). Loss of either of Cep78, Ift20 and Ttc21a caused ciliogenesis defects (Figures 7N-O), and loss of either Cep78 or Ift20 caused abnormal centriole elongation (Figures 7P-Q). Previous studies have shown that depletion of <italic>Ift20</italic> (PMID: 27682589) or <italic>Ttc21a</italic> (PMID: 30929735) caused sperm flagella and sperm head shaping defects, similar to the phenotypes of <italic>Cep78</italic> knockout sperm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The manuscript text needs to be rewritten to improve clarity, eliminate grammatical errors, make several statements more accurate, and better present and discuss the results in the context of known literature in the field.

(10.1136/jmedgenet-2016-104166), thus, we added “We have previously linked the <italic>CEP78</italic> c.1629-2A&gt;G mutation to autosomal recessive CRDHL, and revealed a 10 bp deletion of <italic>CEP78</italic> exon 14 in mRNA of white blood cells from the patient carrying <italic>CEP78</italic> c.1629-2A&gt;G mutation8[]. We further explored whether c.1629-2A&gt;G mutation in this previously visited patient would disturb CEP78 protein expression and male fertility.”.</p><p>In Qing Fu et al. ’s study, we termed CEP78 mutation caused disease “a distinct type of Usher syndrome”, because patients with CEP78 mutation have syndromes similar but not identical to Usher syndrome. CEP78 disruption distinctively affects cone photoreceptors earlier, while in all other Usher syndrome types, rod photoreceptor functions are initially compromised (PMID: 11701652). This indicates CEP78 mutation is associated with a distinct type of Usher syndrome. So, with revisit of this patient, we found it is more accurate to describe the patient’s symptoms with “cone rod dystrophy”. So, in our new version of manuscript, we report this patient is associate with cone rod dystrophy. We hope our explanation can reduce the misunderstandings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In a previous study a missense variant in CEP78 was shown to be associated with astenoteratozoospermia and reduced male fertility, but no morphological defects in sperm were observed (Ascari, G., et al., 2020). The authors should discuss this obvious phenotypic and functional difference between the missense variant and 10 bp deletion in CEP78, that they have studied. Also, they may want to comment on the low penetrance of the infertility phenotype in human patients (e.g. see discussion on this in PMID: 35240912).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the suggestion. In this study, we reported a patient with <italic>CEP78</italic> c.1629-2A&gt;G mutation, which caused homozygous 10 bp deletion of CEP78 exon 14 in mRNA, and CEP78 protein absence.

The patient in our study showed phenotype of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia with MMAF, consistent with the phenotype observed in Cep78 knockout mice. Whether the patient reported by Ascari, G., et al. had truncated CEP78 by nonsense mutation was not analyzed, which might contribute the phenotypic differences between patients.</p><p>The above is discussed at Page 35,Line 769-779 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Page 5, given the previous report of CEP78 patients with retina degeneration, hearing loss, and reduced infertility (Ascari et al. 2020), the statement of &quot;we report CEP78 as a NEW causative gene for a distinct syndrome…TWO phenotypes…..&quot; Is not accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the comments. We have removed the term “NEW causative gene” in Page 5, Line 108 of the revised version of our manuscript. The revised sentence is “In this study, based on results of a male patient carrying <italic>CEP78</italic> mutation and <italic>Cep78</italic> gene knockout mice, we report <italic>CEP78</italic> as a causative gene for CRD and male sterility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Introduction. The statement that &quot;CRD usually exists with combination of immotile cilia defects in other systems&quot; is not correct. CRD due to ciliopathy can have cilia-related syndromic defects in other systems but it is a relatively small portion of all CRDs and the most frequently mutated genes are not cilia-related genes, such as ABCA4, GUCY2D, CRX.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the comments. We agree with the reviewer that only a small portion of CRDs are due to cilia defects and can have cilia-related syndromic defects in other systems. We corrected this statement in Page 4, Line 80-82 of the revised version of our manuscript. In our revised version, the statement has been changed to “A small portion of CRDs are due to retina cilia defects, and they may have cilia-related syndromic defects in other systems[1].”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The manuscript contains several grammatical errors and would benefit from proofreading by an expert in English language.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

Please double-check and clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have checked the NCBI gene database, and found that CEP78 protein had six consecutive leucine-rich repeats (LRR) in 2 leucine-rich repeat regions (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/84131). To avoid confusion, we modified “Centrosomal protein of 78 kDa (CEP78), protein encoded by the <italic>CEP78</italic> gene (MIM: 617110), is a centriolar protein composed of 722 amino acids and possesses two leucine-rich repeats and a coiled-coil domain[5].” to “Centrosomal protein of 78 kDa (CEP78), protein encoded by the <italic>CEP78</italic> gene (MIM: 617110), is a centriolar protein composed of 722 amino acids and possesses two leucine-rich repeat regions and a coiled-coil domain[5]” in Page 4, Line 92-94 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 180: CEP78 is not a ciliary protein, it is a centrosomal protein.

To clearly addressed the amount and the type of CEP78 antibody for IP analysis we added “5ug of antibody or IgG was subjected for incubation per sample. For in vivo Cep78 IP, the custom-made mouse Cep78 antibody against antigen p457-741 of mouse Cep78 (NP_932136.2) was used. ” in Materials and methods section, which is in Page 16, Line 357-360in the revised manuscript. We also added “The antibody against mouse Cep78 (p457-741) was used for IP-MS analysis.” in Table 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) CEP78 was previously shown to localize to the distal end of the (mother) centriole wall in cultured mammalian cells (Brunk et al. 2016; Hossein et al., 2017; Goncalves et al., 2021), whereas IFT proteins are concentrated near the transition fibers. To support the authors' claim that CEP78 forms a trimeric complex with IFT20 and TTC21A they should consider doing high-resolution localization analysis (TEM, STED, 3D-SIM or similar) of these proteins in spermatids. Such an analysis might also provide useful information regarding the mechanism by which CEP78 affects flagellum biogenesis, and possibly explain why the mechanism appears different from that observed in cultured human cells (Figure S5, Discussion lines 467-471).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the constructive suggestions. To better demonstrate co-localization of CEP78, IFT20 and TTC21A on the centrosome, we overexpressed Cep78-Halo, Ift20-mCherry and Ttc21a-mEmerald in NIH3T3 cells by lentivirus, and photographed super-resolution images with SIM (N-sim, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The SIM results showed that Ift20 and Ttc21a co-localized with Cep78 (Figure 7F). Cep78 was previously reported to localize at the centriole (Goncalves et al., 2021). The co-localization of Cep78, Ift20 and Ttc21a indicated possible important roles of Cep78 in the regulation of Ift20 and Ttc21a in centriole. Our interaction analysis revealed that Cep78 interacted with Ift20 and Ttc21a (Figure 7D), and formed a complex with Ift20 and Ttc21a according to the fractionation analysis by size exclusion chromatography (Figure 7E). Loss of Cep78 down-regulated the expression of and interaction between Ift20 and Ttc21a (Figures 7G-M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure S5, Table S2 and Table S3: CP110 looks downregulated in the testis of the Cep78-/- animals, yet CP110 was not detected in the MS analysis shown in Tables S2 and S3. Please explain this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the comment. In our MS analysis, we identified 7505 proteins in mouse spermatids. Although the number of identified proteins is high, there are still proteins of low abundances beyond the detection limit of MS (PMID:23196971). Cp110 protein is one of such proteins beyond detection limit of MS. Because Cp110 is not detected, there is no TMT reporter ions for quantification of Cp110. Thus, Cp110 is not identified as a differential protein by MS, not due to discrepancy but due to low abundance in expression in spermatids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Methods section: information describing how the CEP78 antibodies were produced is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have added the following detail information of the antibody in the section of Materials and methods: the custom made human CEP78 and mouse Cep78 antibodies were produced using antigen sequence p457-741 of mouse Cep78 (NP_932136.2) and p100-515 of human CEP78 protein (NP_001092272.1) by Abclonal (Wuhan, China). The sequences were cloned to pET-28a (+) vectors, expressed in BL21 prokaryotic cells and immunized with experimental Japanese white rabbit, respectively. After the animals are sacrificed, the rabbit serum is subjected to antigen affinity purification.

According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed the gel filtration.
