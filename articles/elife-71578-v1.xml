Since mTEC numbers are limited, their function is complemented by thymic dendritic cells (DCs), which transfer mTEC-produced self-antigens via cooperative antigen transfer (CAT). While CAT is required for effective T cell selection, many aspects remain enigmatic. Given the recently described heterogeneity of mTECs and DCs, it is unclear whether the antigen acquisition from a particular TEC subset is mediated by preferential pairing with a specific subset of DCs. Using several relevant <italic>Cre</italic>-based mouse models that control for the expression of fluorescent proteins, we have found that, in regards to CAT, each subset of thymic DCs preferentially targets a distinct mTEC subset(s). Importantly, XCR1<sup>+</sup>-activated DC subset represented the most potent subset in CAT. Interestingly, thymic DCs can also acquire antigens from more than one mTEC, and of these, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) were determined to be the most efficient. moDCs also represented the most potent DC subset in the acquisition of antigen from other DCs. These findings suggest a preferential pairing model for the distribution of mTEC-derived antigens among distinct populations of thymic DCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thymus</kwd><kwd>central tolerance</kwd><kwd>thymic epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>cooperative antigen transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20-30350S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Filipp</surname><given-names>Dominik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles University Grant Agency in Prague</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>836119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Březina</surname><given-names>Jiří</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles University in Prague</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Primus/21/MED/003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobeš</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Junior Star grant 21-22435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobeš</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grant RVO Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>68378050-KAV-NPUI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brabec</surname><given-names>Tomáš</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fluorescent protein-based reporter mouse models revealed that thymic cooperative antigen transfer is mediated by preferential pairing between a particular thymic epithelial cell subset and specific subset(s) of thymic dendritic cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central tolerance, which operates during T cell development in the thymus, can result in the elimination of self-reactive T cells or deviation to a thymic regulatory T cell (tTreg) lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2019</xref>). The underlying principle of this event compels immature T cells to test their T cell receptor (TCR) for potential self-reactivity through the scanning of self-antigens that are presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Among all thymic APCs, thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are central to this selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). Based on their localization within the thymus, TECs are generally divided into two major populations: cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derbinski et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, results of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) revealed an unexpected heterogeneity of mTECs with at least five distinct subsets defined by developmental stage, transcription profile, and function (referred to as mTEC-I, -II, -IIIa, IIIb, and Tuft cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baran-Gale et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to their unique ability to express and present more than 80% of the protein-coding genome, mTECs are well-adapted to serve as a principal self-antigen-producing cellular component of central tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennecke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>). This is in part facilitated by the expression of the autoimmune regulator (Aire). Aire controls the gene expression of a large set of tissue-restricted antigens (TRAs) that are found only in the immune periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derbinski et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, an effective display of a complete set of thymically expressed TRAs is achieved by their combinatorial mosaic expression by each mTEC with any particular TRA expressed by only 1–3% of mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derbinski et al., 2008</xref>) while a single mTEC is capable of expressing up to 300 different TRAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>). However, mTEC subsets are not equal in terms of Aire expression and TRA presentation. During their progression through mTEC-I, -II, -IIIa, and -IIIb stages, the highest Aire and TRA expression is observed within the mTEC-II stage, historically referred to as mTEC<sup>high</sup>. As mTEC-II cells enter pre-post Aire and post-Aire phases (phase -IIIa and -IIIb, respectively), they downregulate the expression of Aire, although their TRA protein levels remain high, making them available for transfer to other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kadouri et al., 2020</xref>). It is noteworthy that the expression of TRA in mTEC-I (also referred to as mTEC<sup>low</sup>) is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baran-Gale et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The relatively low number of mTECs in comparison to the sheer number of developing T cells, coupled to mosaic and stage-restricted expression of TRAs, places significant constraints on the process of T cell selection. To overcome this limitation, TRAs from apoptotic mTECs can be transferred into, and indirectly presented to, T cells by thymic dendritic cells (DCs) via the process of cooperative antigen transfer (CAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallegos and Bevan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koble and Kyewski, 2009</xref>). It has been demonstrated that CAT is critical for the establishment of central tolerance to mTEC-derived self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lancaster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry et al., 2018</xref>). Despite its importance, the elucidation of the basic principles of CAT has been hampered by the complexity of thymic DC populations.</p><p>In general, thymic DCs can be divided into two major categories: plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and classical dendritic cells (cDCs), the latter of which can be subdivided into cDC1 and cDC2 subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guilliams et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have shown that these DC subsets vary in their capacity to acquire mTEC-derived antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kroger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lancaster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>). The cDC1 subset has been shown to strongly acquire GFP antigen from mTEC in an <italic>Aire-GFP</italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry et al., 2018</xref>) while the cDC2 subset robustly acquired mOVA antigen in a <italic>RIP-mOVA</italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lancaster et al., 2019</xref>). Since the expression of Aire-driven GFP and mOVA in the thymus was largely restricted to Aire<sup>+</sup> mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardner et al., 2008</xref>) and mTEC<sup>Low</sup>/post-Aire mTECs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mouri et al., 2017</xref>), it has been inferred that distinct subsets of thymic DCs acquire antigens from distinct subsets of mTECs. However, our recent scRNAseq analysis, along with data from the human thymus cell atlas study, exposed a much broader heterogeneity of DCs in the thymus of mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a more comprehensive analysis is needed to determine the mode of CAT between defined subsets of TECs and DCs as well as other means of thymic antigen spreading.</p><p>In this study, we used several <italic>Cre</italic> reporter mouse models in which the expression of fluorescent TdTOMATO protein (TdTOM) is restricted to different subsets of TECs. We present evidence that suggests that distinct subsets of thymic DCs preferentially acquire TdTOM from a specific TEC subset. Using the <italic>Confetti<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup></italic> system, we have also shown that CAT can occur as a repetitive event whereby a single thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> cell can acquire antigen from two or more individual TECs. Furthermore, based on our data, we postulate that antigen transfer can also occur between DC subsets themselves. Thus, this dataset suggests a deterministic model of preferential engagement of specific mTEC and DC subsets for directional thymic antigen distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Thymic epithelial cell models of cooperative antigen transfer</title><p>In recent years, the robustness of scRNAseq has yielded a vast amount of information regarding the thymic APCs inventory and has been instrumental in revealing a list of suitable markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baran-Gale et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bautista et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wells et al., 2020</xref>).

To show differences in the preferential expression of TdTOM among TEC subsets, we first determined the percentage representation of TEC subsets within the TdTOM<sup>+</sup> gate as well as each TEC subset overall (an example of gating is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, top and bottom rows, respectively) in all three mouse models used.

These differences are readily apparent when representative samples from each of the reporter model used are compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The ratio between the percentage of a given TEC subset from TdTOM<sup>+</sup> gate normalized to the percentage of the same TEC subset overall indicates the relative over- or underrepresentation of the former within the thymic CD45<sup>–</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup>TdTOM<sup>+</sup> population among the three models used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).

A comparative analysis of the ability of each of these thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> APC subsets to acquire TEC-derived TdTOM showed that XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs were the most efficient cells involved in CAT irrespective of the <italic>Cre</italic>-based <italic>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> model used. On the other hand, while Macs and pDCs were relatively inefficient, the remaining subsets varied in this efficiency depending on the <italic>Cre</italic>-model analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Using bone marrow (BM) chimeras of sublethally irradiated mouse models (<italic>Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, <italic>Csnb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, and <italic>Defa6<sup>iCre</sup></italic>) reconstituted with congenically marked BM cells isolated from WT animals, we verified that TdTOM is indeed transferred from TECs to all subpopulations of thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> APCs and is not endogenously expressed by these APCs themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–f</xref>).</p><p>Since the frequency of each CD11c<sup>+</sup> APC subset as well as their capacity to acquire TEC-derived antigen differs, we next assessed their contribution to CAT in all three <italic>Cre</italic>-based <italic>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> mouse models. Due to the comparative nature of this approach (comparing the efficiency of CAT for each CD11c<sup>+</sup> APC subset in each <italic>Cre</italic> model), we first performed an unsupervised flow cytometry analysis of all CD11c<sup>+</sup>TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells concatenated from 10 independent samples from each of the <italic>Cre</italic>-based mouse models, that is, 30 samples in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Based on the markers shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>, we identified all phenotypically distinct CD11c<sup>+</sup> APC subsets in the resulting tSNE plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). Analyzing each of the <italic>Cre</italic>-based <italic>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> mouse models individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), the data revealed that whereas the contribution of cDC1s and moDCs to CAT was robust in all three models, the contribution of pDCs, Macs, cDC2s, and both populations of aDC subsets varied among the models. To investigate the preferential uptake of TdTOM among DC subsets, we compared the percentage representation of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> DC subsets (TdTOM<sup>+</sup> DCs) with the frequency of DC subsets among the entire DC population (All DCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>) and calculated the ratios as similarly done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Notably, the ratio between the percentage of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> DC subset and the overall percentage for cDC2s, pDCs, and Macs was increased in the <italic>Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse model. In contrast, this ratio for XCR1<sup>+</sup> and XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDCs was the lowest in <italic>Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, with an increase detected in <italic>Csnb<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, and the highest ratio detected in the <italic>Defa6<sup>iCre</sup></italic> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Taken together, this data shows that the extent of the involvement of each DC subset in CAT depends on the distribution of TdTOM protein expression among the different subtypes of TECs and/or the overall proportion of TECs expressing the TdTOM. In this way, the assorted expression of TdTOM antigen by a limited but defined subset of TECs allows the visual identification of those DC subsets that engage these TEC subsets during CAT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Projecting preferential trajectories of CAT between TEC and thymic DC subsets</title><p>To reveal the possible combinations of TEC and DC subsets that are preferentially engaged in CAT, the ratio between the percentage of a given TEC subset from the TdTOM<sup>+</sup> gate normalized to the percentage of the same TEC subset overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and the ratio between the percentages TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells and the entire population of a particular DC subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) is depicted for each <italic>Cre</italic>-based mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, upper and bottom rows, respectively).

The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> confirmed the selectivity of each of the thymic DC subsets for certain TEC subset(s) from which they preferentially acquired antigens. Specifically, CAT to cDC1s significantly correlated with the expression of TdTOM in mTEC<sup>High</sup>, XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs with mTEC<sup>High</sup>, pre-post Aire, and Tuft mTECs, whereas XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDCs with mTEC<sup>High</sup> and pre-post Aire mTECs. Interestingly, pDCs, and to a lesser extent Macs, correlated with antigen production in post-Aire mTECs. The positive correlation observed between pDCs and post-Aire mTECs is consistent with the fact that Hassall’s corpuscles affect the migration and activation of thymic pDCs through the production of chemokines and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Macs, cDC2s, and pDCs were found to also correlate with the mTEC<sup>Low</sup> population. In addition, the Macs population, and to a lesser extent cDC2s, significantly correlated with the expression of TdTOM in cTECs. This is consistent with the notion that both thymic Macs and cDC2s reside in the thymic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breed et al., 2019</xref>). It is also important to emphasize that CAT to pDCs, Macs, and cDC2s is highly affected by the frequency of total TdTOM<sup>+</sup> TECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Thus, if the availability of TEC-derived antigens is limited, these subsets are outcompeted in CAT by other DC subsets.</p><p>Together, this data confirms the hypothesis that CAT occurs between subsets of TECs and thymic DCs in a selective manner, with the exception of moDCs, which failed to reveal a preference for any subset of TECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Thymic moDCs are the most efficient subset in repetitive CAT</title><p>In experiments in which single-fluorescent protein (FP) transfer mouse models were utilized, most of the thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> subsets acquired antigens from more than one mTEC subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we utilized the <italic>Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>Confetti<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup></italic> mouse model in which cytosolic RFP, YFP, and membrane CFP are expressed individually or in combination by TECs. The transfer of these FPs to DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) was then measured.

Using these studies, along with reports concerning the heterogeneity of thymic APCs as a foundation, we have provided detailed insight into how particular subsets of TECs and thymic APCs are interconnected in the transfer of TEC-produced antigens. Specifically, utilizing several murine genetic models that allowed the tracking of TEC-produced antigen, we determined that CAT is mediated predominantly by preferential pairing between the following TEC and CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC subsets: (i) cTECs to Mac and cDC2; (ii) mTEC<sup>Low</sup> to Mac, cDC2, and pDC; (iii) mTEC<sup>High</sup> to XCR1<sup>+</sup> and XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDC, and cDC1; (iv) pre-post Aire mTEC to XCR1<sup>+</sup> and XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDC; (v) post-Aire mTEC to pDCs and Mac; and (vi) Tuft mTEC to XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDC. These CAT trajectories, which are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, argue in favor of a model of preferential pairing in thymic antigen transfer. It seems that the antigen acquisition by Macs, cDC2s, and, to some extent, pDCs can occur when antigen is abundant. In addition, we also report that thymic moDCs, which do not exhibit subset specificity in CAT, generally obtain antigen from multiple cellular sources of thymic TECs as well as CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC subsets.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of preferential pairing in cooperative antigen transfer (CAT).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Based on the data presented in this study, we postulate that phenotypically defined subsets of thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells preferentially and predictably acquire antigens from distinct subsets of developmentally related thymic epithelial cells (TECs) (left panel). Our data also suggests that thymic monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC), which represented the only CD11c<sup>+</sup> subset that does not specifically prefer any particular subset of TECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), excels in the acquisition of antigens from multiple TECs or other CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells compared to both subsets of activated dendritic cell (aDC), cDC2, and cDC1, which also perform such modes of CAT, however, to a significantly lesser extent (right panel). Note that the size of the antigen acceptor’s images reflects the strength of their correlation with particular TEC subset (left panel) or their potency in defined modes of CAT (right panel).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71578-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In this study, we confirmed a high level of internal TEC heterogeneity that could be divided into a minimum of six distinct subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baran-Gale et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bautista et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wells et al., 2020</xref>). Since the majority of these subsets are developmentally related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metzger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2018</xref>), our <italic>Cre</italic>-based <italic>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) suggest some developmental relationships between mTEC subsets. It has been reported that TdTOM expression in the <italic>Csnb<sup>Cre</sup>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> mouse model is detected in a small proportion of mTEC<sup>Low</sup>, in most mTEC<sup>High</sup>, post-Aire mTEC, and Tuft mTEC subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), which suggests that Csnb is expressed by a specific population of mTEC<sup>Low</sup> progenitors that further differentiate into mTECs<sup>High</sup> cells and later into their progeny. In contrast, the TdTOM expression in <italic>Defa6<sup>iCre</sup>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> should be specifically attributed to the Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>High</sup> subset and their post-Aire progeny since the expression of defensins in the thymus is highly dependent on Aire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobeš et al., 2015</xref>). Despite that, we also observed TdTOM expression in the small LY6D<sup>–</sup> population of mTEC<sup>Low</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Since several distinct subpopulations of post-Aire mTEC were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>Cre</italic> recombination in mTEC<sup>Low</sup> likely reflects the presence of the LY6D<sup>–</sup> population of post-Aire cells than <italic>Defa6</italic> locus activation in Aire<sup>–</sup> mTEC<sup>Low</sup> progenitors. Thus, the significant correlation in CAT between mTEC<sup>Low</sup> and pDC subsets could be influenced by this phenomenon since pDCs were shown to acquire the antigen mostly from post-Aire mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). It is also important to emphasize that all three mouse models used in this study were based on a <italic>Cre</italic> recombination system leading to the production of TdTOM in cells with an active <italic>Foxn1</italic>, or <italic>Csn2,</italic> or <italic>Defa6</italic> locus as well as to those cells that developmentally descend from these cells. Thus, the caveat of this approach is that the expression of TdTOM antigen is not targeted to a particular TEC subset exclusively, which would provide a more accurate system for assessing the preferential pairing of TEC and DC subsets in CAT.</p><p>The development of novel gating strategies has allowed us to reveal the substantial heterogeneity of thymic DCs that could be divided into phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>). Our data points to at least seven subtypes of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells that are capable of antigen acquisition from different subsets of TECs, that is, cDC1, XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDC, XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDC, cDC2, moDC, pDC, and Mac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). Among them, we have phenotypically identified two subsets of thymic aDCs that are marked by the overexpression of the chemokine receptor, CCR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardouin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, it has been reported that the expression of <italic>Ccr7</italic> defines the population of XCR1<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDC1s that is considered to be the progeny of XCR1<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>–</sup> cDC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardouin et al., 2016</xref>). However, since these CCR7<sup>+</sup> cDC1s express not only molecules that are associated with the cDC1 signature, such as <italic>Batf3</italic>, <italic>Cd8α</italic>, <italic>Ly75,</italic> or <italic>Cadm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>), but also molecules that characterize the population of aDCs (<italic>Il12b</italic>, <italic>Il15</italic>, <italic>Il15ra Cd274</italic>, <italic>Cd70</italic>, <italic>Cd40</italic>, <italic>Tnfrsf4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardouin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>), we defined and renamed this subset as XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDC. Remarkably, these cells are the most efficient DC subset in CAT even when compared to cDC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). It was recently suggested that the differentiation of XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs from cDC1s is driven by the uptake of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maier et al., 2020</xref>). Since CAT has been shown to be mediated mostly by endocytosis of apoptotic bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koble and Kyewski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry et al., 2018</xref>), the differentiation of XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs in the thymus is consistent with being driven by CAT. Thus, the grounds for the correlation between mTEC<sup>High</sup> and XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs in TdTOM antigen transfer could be found in the fact that mTEC<sup>High</sup> transfer antigen to XCR1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 that further differentiate into XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardouin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maier et al., 2020</xref>). In this context, it is also important to emphasize that the transcriptional signature of XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDCs is more similar to cDC2 (e.g., <italic>Sirpa</italic> and <italic>Pdcd1lg2</italic>) than the cDC1 subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>). By the same token, this suggests that antigen transfer into cDC2s induces their differentiation into XCR1<sup>–</sup> aDCs.</p><p>Using linear regression analysis of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> TECs and DCs frequencies from all three mouse models, we identified two subsets of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, cDC1 and moDC, that exhibited limited or no correlation with TEC subsets in TdTOM transfer. Surprisingly, the correlation of mTEC<sup>High</sup> with cDC1s seems limited when compared to the correlation of mTEC<sup>High</sup> with XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This is contradictory to previous reports that described cDC1 subset as the most efficient in acquiring antigens from Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>High</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry et al., 2018</xref>). This could be explained by the fact that only XCR1 positivity was used by the authors to characterize cDC1 cells in the thymus. This does not allow one to discriminate between cDC1s and XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs. Thus, as suggested by our data, the antigen transfer from mTEC<sup>High</sup> is mediated mostly by XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs and only to a lesser extent by cDC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). On the other hand, the linear regression model used in this study takes advantage of the variability in the ratios between TdTOM<sup>+</sup> frequencies in TEC and DC subsets across all <italic>Cre</italic>-based <italic>Rosa26<sup>TdTOM</sup></italic> models. Since in the case of cDC1 this variability displays apparent limitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), we see only inadequate correlation for this cell subset.</p><p>The second subset of thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, which failed to show a correlation with any TEC subset in CAT, consisted of moDCs. Interestingly, while moDCs are very potent in CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), their capacity can be further enhanced under inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrated that among other thymic DCs the moDC subset was the most efficient in repetitive CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1g</xref>). This, along with their ability to efficiently acquire antigen from other CD11c<sup>+</sup> APCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), is a testament to their important function in central tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>). Since thymic moDCs were shown to express a plethora of different chemokines and scavenger receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vobořil et al., 2020</xref>), we propose that these characteristics correlate with their high competence in regulated migration and phagocytic activity compared to other DC subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Croxford et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, using novel gating strategies for the identification of multiple TEC subsets that produce TdTOM antigen and tracking of its transfer into phenotypically defined thymic CD11c<sup>+</sup> APC subsets has allowed us to define preferential antigen trajectories that mediate CAT. Our data shows that XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs are the most potent subset in the acquisition of TEC-derived antigens. It also characterizes the moDC subset as the most efficient in the acquisition of antigen from multiple TECs as well as DCs. Taken together, our work proposes that CAT relies on a cellular interaction network with preferential partnerships between defined subtypes of TECs and DCs. This, in turn, suggests that the indirect presentation of antigens from developmentally related but phenotypically and functionally distinct types of TECs is ascribed to different subsets of thymic DCs. However, how these cell-to-cell preferential interactions, which are the underlying characteristics of CAT, facilitate the processes of central tolerance such as the deletion of self-reactive clones of T cells or their conversion to Tregs awaits resolution. Although this study suggests that CAT is a deterministic process, the molecules and mechanisms that determine TEC-to-DC cell-cell interactions remain to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mouse models used in this study were of C57BL/6J genetic background and housed under SPF conditions at the animal facility of the Institute of Molecular Genetics (IMG) in Prague.

To isolate thymic DCs and macrophages, MACS enrichment for CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells was performed using CD11c biotin-conjugated antibody (eBioscience) and Ultrapure Anti-Biotin microbeads (Miltenyi).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting</title><p>Cell staining for flow cytometry (FACS) analysis and sorting was performed at 4°C, in the dark, for 20–30 min, with the exception of anti-CCR7 antibody (BioLegend) staining that required incubation at 37°C for a minimum of 30 min. To exclude dead cells, either Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) or viability dye eFluor 506 (eBioscience) was used. FACS analysis of TECs and DCs was performed using BD LSR II and BD FACSymphony A5 cytometers, respectively. A BD FACSAria IIu sorter was used for cell sorting. BD FACSDiva software and FlowJo V10 software (Treestar) were used for FACS data analysis. For the purpose of tSNE analysis, the same amount of CD11c<sup>+</sup> TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells from each model was concatenated by using the FlowJo concatenate function. The final tSNE was calculated by FlowJo opt–SNE plugin. Total TEC counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> were obtained by analyzing the whole fraction of CD45<sup>–</sup> MACS-enriched cells. Calculation of the ratios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2g</xref> is described in the ‘Results’ section and figure legends.

The next day, the thymi were cut into 10<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C">-μ</ext-link>m-thick sections and put onto microscope slides. To stain thymic medullas, thymic sections were washed three times in PBS, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min, washed again three times in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT), and blocked for 30 min in 5% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (blocking buffer) at RT. Next, slides were incubated for 40 min with purified anti-keratin 14 antibody (BioLegend; clone: Poly19053) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer, washed three times in PBS, and incubated for 20 min with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody (Life Technologies; Cat# A-21244) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. Before imaging, the samples were washed three times in PBS, gently washed in distilled water, and dried. Samples were imaged on Leica DM6000 widefield microscope using HC PL FLUOTAR ×10/0.30 DRY PH1; FWD 11.0; CG 0.17 | BF, DF, POL, PH objective. The tile scans of whole thymi were created using the LAS X Navigator tool (Leica). Importantly, bright-field and keratine 14 staining was imaged on sequential thymic sections to those used for TdTOM imaging. TdTOM was imaged right after cryosectioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Imaging flow cytometry</title><p>Imaging flow cytometry (ImageStream) was performed using AMNIS ImageStream X MkII at the Center for Preclinical Imaging (CAPI) in Prague.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including JC Zúñiga-Pflücker as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that some additional analyses would strengthen the conclusions of the study. However, if these additional analyses lead to altered interpretation of the data presented then the authors should revise the model that was provided.</p><p>2) Please pay close attention to the detailed recommendations provided by Rev #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1- The main approach makes use of different mouse models expressing tdTomato under different cre-drivers, and it would be good to show immunofluorescence (IF) histological analysis of thymus section from these mice, which would further illustrate the elegance of the approach, by directly showing the expression pattern within the thymus medulla, or more broadly for the Foxn1-cre. Potentially, this analysis may even allow for the authors to show neighboring DCs that have picked up dtTomato as well.</p><p>2- For Figure 1, it could be useful to also show the cell numbers for the indicated subsets, rather than just the percentages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some additional analyses would strengthen the conclusions of the study, but they may lead to altered interpretation of the data presented and revision of the model. Here are some suggestions:</p><p>For Figure 1, to strengthen the conclusion about which TEC subsets are over-represented in the 3 reporter mice, it would be helpful to show the distribution of TEC subsets in the CD45-EpCAM+ gate (regardless of TdTomato). This is important because, for example, P5 line 122 indicates that &quot;cTEC and mTEClow subsets were over-represented in Foxn1cre&quot; reporter mice. However, comparison to the frequency of TEC subsets in Supplementary Figure 1 suggests that these TEC subsets are not over-represented in the reporter, but are instead represented according to their normal subset frequencies. Similar conclusions can be drawn for post-Aire TECs and Tuft cells in the Defa6cre reporter. Comparing the percent of TEC subsets within the Tomato+ gate to the percent of subsets overall would more accurately indicate if a given subsets is over- or under-represented. In addition, it would be advisable to show the % of TdTomato+ cells within each subset to help interpret negative results. Both of these analyses could be added to Figure 1, and results/conclusions in the text should be revised accordingly.</p><p>Similarly, in Figure 2g, the % of each DC subsets within the CD11c+Tomato+ cells is quantified, but this could be influenced by the frequency of different DC subsets at steady state and/or their ability to acquire TdTomato from different TEC subsets. So it would be helpful to the frequency of DC subsets out of total CD11c+ cells, relative to the frequency of each subset within the TdTomato+ CD11c gate for each reporter to more accurately determine if the DC subsets are truly over- or under-represented. To this point, P6 line 156 states, &quot;XCR1+ aDCs were the most efficient cells involved in CAT irrespective of the Cre-based ROSA26TdTOM model used.&quot; However, the data show that ~40% of the tdTomato+CD11c+ cells are cDC1. From S2, ~ 40% of all Cd11c+ cells are cDC1. So instead of being more efficient at acquiring tdTomato from Foxn1cre reporter mTECs, they seem to be just the most abundant subset of DCs.</p><p>In Figure S2, showing the gating scheme for DC subsets, ~60% of the Xcr1-Ccr7- DCs do not express either MGL2 or CD14. This large subset of cDC2 cells seems to be excluded from downstream analyses. Do any of these cells acquire TdTomato in any of the reporters? Please either include the subset in the analyses or give a rationale for excluding them.</p><p>Figure 3a provides the overall summary of data in Figures 1 and 2, while Figure 3C presents the results of the linear regression between the frequencies of TdTomato TEC subset and TdTomato DC subsets based on the combined 3 reporters. This regression analysis is used to draw the model in Figure 6. However, some aspects of the model seem inconsistent with data in Figure 1. For example, given the reduced representation of mTEChi plus pre-post Aire+ mTEC in Defa6iCre (54%) relative to Csnbcre (68%) (Figure 3a), one would expect a reduction in the frequency of XCR1+ aDC in tomato+DCs according to the model in Figure 6, since this DC subset acquires antigen from both of these TEC subsets. However, the frequency of XCR1+aDC stays about the same between the two models, as seen by the insignificant difference in the % Xcr1+aDC within the CD11c+TdTOM+ compartment in Figure 1g. So it seems like the model may be overinterpreting the results. The authors acknowledge that the model isn't really accurately reflecting antigen acquisition, as it predicted that cDC1 interacted only with cTECs, despite evidence in the literature to the contrary (lines 224-235). Thus, the authors used an alternate regression model based on Csnbcre reporters at 2 different ages, which precited that cDC1 cells could acquire antigen from mTEChigh cells. However, the possibility should be considered that the frequency of the DC subsets changes between 4-6weeks and 11-13 weeks, so changes in the frequency of DC subsets in TdTomato+ could reflect that change, rather than antigen acquisition from mTEChigh cells. To test this the subset frequency of DCs at 4-6 weeks versus 11-13 weeks should be shown. Also, from the regression data in 3c, it seems like both XCR1+ and XCR1- aDCs can generally acquire antigen from mTEChi and Pre-post Aire cells, while cDC2 seem to acquire antigen from both Post Aire cells and mTEClow cells too.

Potentially, this analysis may even allow for the authors to show neighboring DCs that have picked up dtTomato as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We have now included a novel set of data showing the histological analysis of TdTOM expression and localization in thymic tissue sections (see Figure 1d). This dataset is in the agreement with FACS data both of which point to dramatic quantitative differences in the TdTOM expression pattern among the mouse models used. Specifically, while TdTOM in Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>ROSA<sup>26TdTOM</sup> is expressed in whole thymic tissue, its expression in both the Csnβ<sup>Cre</sup>ROSA26<sup>TdTOM</sup> and Defa6<sup>iCre</sup>ROSA26<sup>TdTOM</sup> models is restricted to the medullary region of the thymus. In addition, the microscopic data from Defa6<sup>iCre</sup>ROSA26<sup>TdTOM</sup> mice shows that the expression of TdTOM is restricted to a relatively small population of cells that reside in the thymic medulla. Since the Defa6 is a fully Aire-dependent TRA, this observation is consistent with the notion that the recombination of Defa6<sup>iCre</sup>ROSA26<sup>TdTOM</sup> construct is microscopically detectable only in Aire<sup>+</sup> mTECs<sup>High</sup> and their descendants (see also the Results section and the discussion of the manuscript). On the other hand, this microscopic approach is not suitable for studying antigen transfer to thymic DCs, since it precludes the costaining of multiple DC-specific markers with TdTOM visualization of the same thymic slices (see the Materials and methods section). Additional transgenic mouse models would have to be created in future studies to overcome these technological obstacles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- For Figure 1, it could be useful to also show the cell numbers for the indicated subsets, rather than just the percentages.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We have now included a graph that compares the total numbers of tdTOM<sup>+</sup> TECs between the models (see Figure 1e). We believe that this analysis complements the microscopic data from Figure 1d. On the other hand, the total number of individual TEC subsets in contrast to the ratios of the frequencies of TEC subsets within CD45<sup>–</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup>TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells to the frequencies of TEC subsets within CD45<sup>–</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (see Figure 1g), can´t be used as a tool for studying the preferential pairing between TEC and DC subsets in CAT given that these numbers drastically decrease from Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>ROSA<sup>26TdTOM</sup> through Csnβ<sup>Cre</sup>ROSA26<sup>TdTOM</sup> to Defa6<sup>iCre</sup> models. Thus, we have decided to omit this type of information and instead we show only the ratios of normalized frequencies (Figure 1g).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some additional analyses would strengthen the conclusions of the study, but they may lead to altered interpretation of the data presented and revision of the model. Here are some suggestions:</p><p>For Figure 1, to strengthen the conclusion about which TEC subsets are over-represented in the 3 reporter mice, it would be helpful to show the distribution of TEC subsets in the CD45-EpCAM+ gate (regardless of TdTomato). This is important because, for example, P5 line 122 indicates that &quot;cTEC and mTEClow subsets were over-represented in Foxn1cre&quot; reporter mice. However, comparison to the frequency of TEC subsets in Supplementary Figure 1 suggests that these TEC subsets are not over-represented in the reporter, but are instead represented according to their normal subset frequencies. Similar conclusions can be drawn for post-Aire TECs and Tuft cells in the Defa6cre reporter. Comparing the percent of TEC subsets within the Tomato+ gate to the percent of subsets overall would more accurately indicate if a given subsets is over- or under-represented. In addition, it would be advisable to show the % of TdTomato+ cells within each subset to help interpret negative results. Both of these analyses could be added to Figure 1, and results/conclusions in the text should be revised accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these suggestions. To show the differences in the distribution of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> TECs between the models, we devised a new type of analysis. As suggested by the Reviewer, and for improving the overall transparency of our analysis, we now show the percentages of TEC subsets from TdTOM<sup>+</sup> gate versus the percentages of these TEC subsets overall (Supplementary Figure 1c). These percentages were determined using the exploratory gating strategy illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1b. Then, the ratio between the percentage of a given TEC subset from TdTOM<sup>+</sup> gate normalized to the percentage of the same TEC subset overall was calculated for each TEC subset. This ratio indicates the relative over- or underrepresentation of the former within the thymic CD45<sup>–</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup>TdTOM<sup>+</sup> population among the three models used (Figure 1g). In this way, we replaced the plots of TEC subsets from TdTOM gates shown in Figure 1e in the original manuscript with the above described graphs with the ratios (Figure 1g). This analysis helped us to normalize the potential differences in the total frequency of TEC subsets between the models used caused by the litter effect, technical variability etc. This “normalization” allows one to report more accurately the increase/decrease in the frequency of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells within the TEC-subset of interest. These ratios were then used for linear regression analysis visualized in Figure 3b. However, it is important to emphasize that trends in the distribution of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells between mouse models are very similar when comparing the simple frequency of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> TECs (used in our original manuscript) to the above-described ratios (normalized frequencies of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> TECs). Also, based on the Reviewer´s suggestion, we have included the analysis of the frequency of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells within the parent population (see Supplementary figure 1b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, in Figure 2g, the % of each DC subsets within the CD11c+Tomato+ cells is quantified, but this could be influenced by the frequency of different DC subsets at steady state and/or their ability to acquire TdTomato from different TEC subsets. So it would be helpful to the frequency of DC subsets out of total CD11c+ cells, relative to the frequency of each subset within the TdTomato+ CD11c gate for each reporter to more accurately determine if the DC subsets are truly over- or under-represented. To this point, P6 line 156 states, &quot;XCR1+ aDCs were the most efficient cells involved in CAT irrespective of the Cre-based ROSA26TdTOM model used.&quot; However, the data show that ~40% of the tdTomato+CD11c+ cells are cDC1. From S2, ~ 40% of all Cd11c+ cells are cDC1. So instead of being more efficient at acquiring tdTomato from Foxn1cre reporter mTECs, they seem to be just the most abundant subset of DCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive input. To address this issue, we implemented the same strategy as described above for TEC subsets. Notably, we calculated the percentages of DC subsets from TdTOM<sup>+</sup> gate (TdTOM<sup>+</sup> DCs) versus the same DC subsets overall (All DCs) which in the revised version of the manuscript are presented in Supplementary Figure 3c. From these frequencies we calculated their ratios, analogously as in the Figure 1g for TECs (Figure 2g). Finally, we used the TEC and DC ratios in the linear regression analysis, the results of which are preseted in Figure 3b and c.</p><p>As far as the concern regarding our statement that &quot;XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs were the most efficient cells involved in CAT irrespective of the Cre-based ROSA26TdTOM model used”, we believe that this is a misunderstanding. The reason being that XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs are not the most abundant subset of DCs in the thymus (see Supplementary figure 2a). Quite contrary, they are rather underrepresented among the DC-subsets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In general, given their relatively low frequency, this makes our statement that XCR1<sup>+</sup> aDCs are the most efficient population in CAT even more convincing and stronger.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71578-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure S2, showing the gating scheme for DC subsets, ~60% of the Xcr1-Ccr7- DCs do not express either MGL2 or CD14. This large subset of cDC2 cells seems to be excluded from downstream analyses. Do any of these cells acquire TdTomato in any of the reporters? Please either include the subset in the analyses or give a rationale for excluding them.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. As pointed out by the Reviewer, in the TdTOM-independent gating strategy (Supplementary figure 2a), we see around 60% of XCR1<sup>-</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup> that do not express either MGL2 or CD14. On the other hand, this population is almost negligible when gating on TdTOM<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (see Supplementary figure 3b). Thus, this suggests that XCR1<sup>-</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup>MGL2<sup>-</sup>CD14<sup>-</sup> cells have a very limited capacity in acquiring TdTOM in any of the reporters. Together with the fact that these cells could not be defined by the expression of established DC markers, argues that these cells could be of mixed origins, which led us to exclude them from our downstream analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3a provides the overall summary of data in Figures 1 and 2, while Figure 3C presents the results of the linear regression between the frequencies of TdTomato TEC subset and TdTomato DC subsets based on the combined 3 reporters. This regression analysis is used to draw the model in Figure 6. However, some aspects of the model seem inconsistent with data in Figure 1. For example, given the reduced representation of mTEChi plus pre-post Aire+ mTEC in Defa6iCre (54%) relative to Csnbcre (68%) (Figure 3a), one would expect a reduction in the frequency of XCR1+ aDC in tomato+DCs according to the model in Figure 6, since this DC subset acquires antigen from both of these TEC subsets. However, the frequency of XCR1+aDC stays about the same between the two models, as seen by the insignificant difference in the % Xcr1+aDC within the CD11c+TdTOM+ compartment in Figure 1g. So it seems like the model may be overinterpreting the results. The authors acknowledge that the model isn't really accurately reflecting antigen acquisition, as it predicted that cDC1 interacted only with cTECs, despite evidence in the literature to the contrary (lines 224-235). Thus, the authors used an alternate regression model based on Csnbcre reporters at 2 different ages, which precited that cDC1 cells could acquire antigen from mTEChigh cells. However, the possibility should be considered that the frequency of the DC subsets changes between 4-6weeks and 11-13 weeks, so changes in the frequency of DC subsets in TdTomato+ could reflect that change, rather than antigen acquisition from mTEChigh cells. To test this the subset frequency of DCs at 4-6 weeks versus 11-13 weeks should be shown. Also, from the regression data in 3c, it seems like both XCR1+ and XCR1- aDCs can generally acquire antigen from mTEChi and Pre-post Aire cells, while cDC2 seem to acquire antigen from both Post Aire cells and mTEClow cells too. So if regression analysis is the basis for the model in Figure 6, it needs to be modified accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this important insight. Based on the Reviewer’s suggestions, Figure 3 has been considerably revised (see updated Figure 3). In brief, we used the above described ratios to reveal a potential preferential pairing between the TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells in TECs and thymic DCs. The overall summary (Figure 3a) now shows the ratios of the frequency of each TEC and DC subset from the dTOM<sup>+</sup> gate to the frequency of a particular population overall across the models used. The dashed line indicates which populations in TECs and DCs are over/underrepresented in a particular mouse model. Then, these ratios were used for linear regression analysis between the TEC and DC subsets (see Figure 3b and c). Since using normalized frequencies of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells for calculating the ratio values for each of these subsets slightly changes the output of this regression analysis, the model of preferential pairing in CAT between the TECs a DCs presented in Figure 6 has been modified accordingly.</p><p>Also, based on the Reviewer's comments we decided to omit the analysis comparing the frequencies of TdTOM<sup>+</sup> cells between younger and older Csnβ<sup>Cre</sup> mice. We agree with the reviewer, that there exist age-related changes in the composition of thymic DC compartment, the phenomenon which has been already described in the literature (Kroger JCH., et al., European Journal of Immunology 2016, Van Dommelen SLH., et al., Cellular and Molecular Immunology 2010). Although these changes can be normalized by using the ratios as in Figure 3a, we realized that many factors such as decreasing T cells input into the thymus or overall involution of the thymic tissue might also affect the function/state of DCs including their capacity to perform CAT in older Csnb<sup>Cre</sup> mice (Baran-Gale J., et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020, Mittelbrunn M. and Kroemer G., Nature Immunology 2021). By analysing only the “young” models, we thus avoided the incorporation of these and other variables, which might have led to misrepresentation of this dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, only ~10% of RFP+ and/or YFP+ TECs in the Foxn1cre ConfettiBrainbow2.1 mice were cDC1.

We stained for some of the TEC populations described in this study and could not detect any changes in RFP/CFP or YFP expression between the subsets analyzed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). First, it is important to emphasize that Figure 4 compares only the frequencies of fluorescent protein<sup>+</sup> cells within the parent population which is different from the comparisons shown in Figure 2. Also, compared to the expression of TdTOM under the Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup> system (Supplementary Figure 2b), different fluorescent proteins in Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>Confetti<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup> model are not expressed in the same concentration by all TECs as TdTOM. Notably, around 25% of TECs which were supposed to express GFP don´t express any fluorescent protein (Supplementary figure 4b and c). Moreover, graphs depicted in Figure 4 compare the antigen transfer of only RFP and/or YFP and not RFP<sup>+</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup> (shown in separate graph) excluding all DCs that performed the “double transfer” from the analysis of Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>Confetti<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup> model but those were not (and could not be) excluded in the case of Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>ROSA<sup>26TdTOM</sup> model analysis (Supplementary Figure 2b). Finally, around 30% of TECs express the membrane-associated CFP antigen whose transfer is much more restricted compared to the one of cytoplasmic TdTOM. Thus, due to these considerations, we believe that the comparison of CAT between Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>Confetti<sup>Brainbow2.1</sup> and Foxn1<sup>Cre</sup>ROSA<sup>26TdTOM</sup> models would not be appropriate.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71578-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5, CD11c+ cell scavenging can occur from all cDC subsets, so the model in 6 should be revised to include these.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well taken.
