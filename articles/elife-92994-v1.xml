However, the mechanisms by which the host regulates microbial communities in the mucus layer remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that the host regulates bacterial colonization in the gut mucus layer by producing a protein called Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1). Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for Gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. By performing fecal microbiota transplantation from Villin-cre mice or replenishing <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in IEC<sup>∆<italic>Chil1</italic></sup> mice, we were able to restore their colitis to the same level as that of Villin-cre mice. In summary, this study shows a ‘scaffold model’ for microbiota homeostasis by interaction between intestinal Chi3l1 and bacteria cell wall interaction, and it also highlights that an unbalanced gut microbiota in the intestinal mucus contributes to the development of colitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chi3l1</kwd><kwd>intestinal homeostasis</kwd><kwd>gut

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intestinal homeostasis is crucial for maintaining human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lozupone et al., 2012</xref>). Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been linked to various diseases including cancer, obesity, and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bäumler and Sperandio, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charbonneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honda and Littman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thaiss et al., 2016</xref>). Dysbiosis, which refers to an imbalance in gut microbiota, is characterized by decreased microbial diversity, the presence of harmful microbes, or absence of beneficial ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petersen and Round, 2014</xref>). Therefore, understanding the factors that influence gut microbiota is a fundamental goal in microbiome research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDonald et al., 2020</xref>). Growing evidence suggests that colonization of the gut mucus layer can affect the susceptibility and progression of intestinal diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome, and celiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon, 2012</xref>). IBDs, such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterized by chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Although the cause of the IBD is unclear, mouse models lacking the key components of the mucus are predisposed to colitis, accompanied by dysbiosis in mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>), which is in accordance with increased epithelial-adherent microbial communities in biopsies from patients with IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Swidsinski et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, there were significant differences in the gut microbiota of CD patients compared with healthy controls, and these differences were only present in mucus samples (not stool samples), suggesting that bacteria in the mucus layer may be more important for the development of IBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gevers et al., 2014</xref>). Donaldson et al. discovered that the intestinal flora utilizes host immunoglobulin A (IgA) for mucus colonization, indicating that the host may secrete certain factors to maintain intestinal flora homeostasis in the mucus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donaldson et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanisms regulating gut microbiota colonization in the mucus layer remain largely unknown. We aim to investigate the regulation of microbial communities in gut mucus and its implications in intestinal diseases.</p><p>Chitinase 3-like protein 1 (Chi3l1, also known as YKL-40 in humans) is a secreted protein that belongs to the glycosylhydrolase 18 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Despite its name, Chi3l1 can bind to chitin but does not have chitinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houston et al., 2003</xref>). In our investigation, we noticed that chitin and peptidoglycan (PGN), a major component of bacterial cell walls, have similar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fulde et al., 2018</xref>). Based on this information, we speculate that Chi3l1 might also interact with PGN and, therefore, interact with bacteria. Interestingly, Chi3l1 is expressed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and the lamina propria. We hypothesize that Chi3l1 may be secreted by IECs and regulate the gut microbiota through its interaction with PGN in the mucus layer. In our study, we discovered that gut microbiota induced the expression of Chi3l1 in epithelial cells. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucosa and interacts with bacteria, particularly with the bacterial cell wall component PGN. This interaction promotes bacterial colonization, especially of beneficial bacteria such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. As a result, mice with higher levels of Chi3l1 are less susceptible to colitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intestinal epithelial cells express Chi3l1 induced by gut microbiota</title><p>The gut microbiota’s composition is shaped by host factors, including IgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donaldson et al., 2018</xref>), RegIIIγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vaishnava et al., 2011</xref>), and TLR-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fulde et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, specific host factors which maintain the homeostasis of the microbiota remain largely undefined. Drawing on the theory of co-evolution between the host and microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groussin et al., 2020</xref>), we propose that host factors, which are induced by bacteria in the gut, could play a pivotal role in regulating bacterial colonization and composition. In a previous study, it was observed that both live <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> treatment resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the gene encoding Chi3l1 in human intestinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hill et al., 2017</xref>). To verify this finding, we conducted immunohistochemical staining on intestinal tissue sections of germ-free and specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6J wildtype mice. We observed a substantial increase of Chi3l1 expression in SPF mice compared to germ-free mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The intestinal epithelium comprises various cell types, including intestinal cells, goblet cells, endoentercrine cells, Tuft cells, Paneth cells, M cells, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>). To identify the cellular sources of Chi3l1, we performed co-staining with markers for specific cell types, including chromogranin A (ChgA) for enteroendocrine cells, <italic>Ulex europaeus</italic> Agglutinin I (UEA-1) for goblet cells and Paneth cells, and double cortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) for tuft cells. Our results revealed that Chi3l1 is primarily expressed in enteroendocrine cells in the ileum and goblet or Paneth cells in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, Chi3l1 expression was not observed in tuft cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intestinal epithelial cells express Chi3l1 induced by gut microbiota.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining to detect Chi3l1 in both ileum and colon from germ-free and wildtype mice.

We found that the bacterial extract directly induced Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To examine whether the induction of Chi3l1 expression requires a specific bacteria strain, we further identified the bacterial extract using 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results revealed that <italic>E. coli</italic> specifically stimulated Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells, while <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> did not have the same effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although our data are limited to these two bacterial strains, it suggests that not all bacteria can induce the expression of Chi3l1. Next, we wondered what component of bacteria can induce Chi3l1 expression. We tried heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic>, which maintains bacterial cell wall integrity. We found that treatment of DLD-1 cells with heat-killed <italic>E. coli</italic> also led to an induction of Chi3l1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings suggest that the induction of Chi3l1 expression does not necessarily require live bacteria and that bacterial components alone are sufficient to induce this response.</p><p>Given that <italic>E. coli</italic> is Gram-negative and <italic>S. sciuri</italic> is Gram-positive, we hypothesized that the difference in their ability to induce Chi3l1 expression might be due to variations between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

The universal bacterial 16S rRNA qPCR data indicated that the majority of gut microbiota were eliminated after antibiotics treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the IEC<sup>∆<italic>Chil1</italic></sup> mice exhibited a milder colitis phenotype, including slower body weight loss, longer colon length, and less inflammation compared to the Villin-cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). We believe that this could be due to the relationship between Chi3l1 and inflammation. Based on these findings, it is apparent that Chi3l1’s effects on gut microbiota play a more significant role in colitis.</p><p>To further elucidate the role of Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota in colitis, we conducted fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic> transplantation experiments. We first eliminated gut microbiota through a 10-day course of antibiotics and then performed FMT from Villin-cre mice or administered oral gavage of <italic>L. reuteri</italic> to IEC<sup>∆<italic>Chil1</italic></sup> mice for 2 weeks, followed by a 7-day period of 2% DSS feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

These findings further validate the notion that Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota, especially <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, offers protection against colitis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The intricate relationship between gut bacteria and their host organisms is crucial for health, maintained through co-evolution and co-speciation. Understanding how the host influences these bacterial communities is critical to understand the complex interplay between host and gut bacteria. In this study, we discovered that Chi3l1 interacts with gut microbiota via PGN, aiding the mucus colonization of beneficial bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, which protects against colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our ‘scaffold model’ demonstrates that Chi3l1 binds to bacterial PGN, helping anchor and organize bacteria within the mucus layer. This interaction promotes the colonization of beneficial bacteria, enhancing gut health.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A schematic working model.</title><p>Intestinal epithelial cells are stimulated by the gut microbiota to express Chi3l1. Once expressed, Chi3l1 is secreted into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, specifically through a component of bacterial cell walls called peptidoglycan. This interaction between Chi3l1 and bacteria is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria in the mucus, particularly for Gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. Moreover, a deficiency of Chi3l1 leads to an imbalance in the gut microbiota, which exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92994-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Several studies have suggested a potential correlation between Chi3l1 and bacteria. For instance, it has been demonstrated that Chi3l1 is produced by IECs in enteritis disease and aids in the elimination of pathogenic bacteria in the gut by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deutschmann et al., 2019</xref>). Another study observed an increase in Chi3l1 expression in mammary tissues of dairy cows infected with pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, which promoted the recruitment of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breyne et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, Chi3l1 was found to be induced during <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection, where it enhanced bacterial elimination by preventing the death of lung macrophages and improving host tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dela Cruz et al., 2012</xref>). One study demonstrated that Chi3l1 contributes to the pathogenesis of colitis, possibly by facilitating the adhesion and invasion of bacteria onto colonic epithelial cells. However, we observed the presence of the Gram-negative bacterium <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> in the mice used in their study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizoguchi, 2006</xref>). According to standard for SPF-grade mice, <italic>Salmonella</italic> should not be present in laboratory mice, and it was also not detected by our 16S RNA sequencing. However, if mice are inadvertently infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the context of IBD, it could likely exacerbate the development of IBD. Our data also demonstrate that Chi3l1 can bind to Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the role of Chi3l1 on microbiota or IBD is heavily dependent on the environmental context. Another study found that caffeine treatment reduce Chi3l1 RNA expression levels, alleviate colitis, and decrease bacterial translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). However, previous research suggested that caffeine can directly inhibit inflammasome activation by suppressing MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vargas-Pozada et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, caffeine treatment may directly reduce colitis by inhibiting inflammation. Moreover, an additional control group of mice with Chi3l1 specifically knocked out in the gut is needed to examine the role of caffeine in the alleviation of colitis. However, the detailed mechanism of the interaction between Chi3l1 and the gut microbiota remains incompletely understood, partly due to the absence of Chi3l1-specific knockout mice and variations in mouse husbandry conditions. Here, by using intestinal Chi3l1-specific knockout mice, we demonstrated a new function of Chi3l1 in gut, which shapes bacterial colonization through direct interaction with bacterial cell wall component, PGN. Moreover, Chi3l1-regulated gut microbiota, especially <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, offers protection against colitis.</p><p>The bacterial cell wall is a complex structure mainly composed of PGN, but it may also contain other components such as teichoic acids and LTA in Gram-positive bacteria, or an outer membrane containing various polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings indicated that LPS, a component of the bacterial cell wall, can slightly increase Chi3l1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), but higher levels of LPS do not further enhance Chi3l1 expression (data not shown). This suggests that there might be other components of the cell wall that can induce Chi3l1 expression in IECs. Given the structural similarity between chitin and PGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), it is likely that Chi3l1 binds to the polysaccharide chains rather than the tetrapeptide in PGN. Previous studies have investigated the crystal structure of human Chi3l1 in complex with chitin, revealing a binding groove with different subsites for chitin fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fusetti et al., 2003</xref>). Other studies have also identified specific amino acids in chitinases that play a key role in the interaction with chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrandon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ranok et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to better understand the binding sites in Chi3l1 for PGN.</p><p>In the colon, there are two distinct parts of the mucus layer. The inner layer is attached and has a low number of microbes, while the outer layer is looser and densely populated by microorganisms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2011</xref>). The diversity of bacteria in the mucus layer is similar to that found in the gut lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). It has to be noted that not all Gram-positive bacteria were reduced in <italic>Chil1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, as we found an increase in <italic>Turicibacter</italic> in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and feces (data not shown). We believe this may be due to a combined effect of the host and gut microbiota. Another important factor for microbial growth in the colon is the integrity of the mucus barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>). We noticed a thinning of the mucus barrier in the mice lacking Chi3l1 compared to normal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, we did not observe an increase in mucin-degrading bacteria such as <italic>Bacteroides</italic> or <italic>Allobaculum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glover et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Raimondi et al., 2021</xref>) or a decrease in mucin-producing cells in these mice. We think that there may be bacteria that aid in the formation of the gut mucus, and these bacteria are decreased in mice lacking Chi3l1. Recent studies have introduced an ‘ncapsulation model’ regarding the nature of mucus in the colon. According to this model, the mucus in the proximal colon forms a primary encapsulation barrier around fecal material, while the mucus in the distal colon forms a secondary barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergstrom et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings indicate that Chi3l1 is expressed throughout the entire colon, including the proximal, middle, and distal sections (data not shown). This suggests that Chi3l1 likely promotes bacterial colonization across the entire colon. Despite most mucus being expelled with feces, the constant production of mucus and the minimal presence of Chi3l1 in feces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) indicate that Chi3l1 continuously plays a role in promoting the colonization of microbiota.</p><p>In patients with IBD, the density and diversity of the microbial community in the intestines are reduced. Specifically, there is a decrease in <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and an increase in <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and facultative anaerobic bacteria like <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). However, the cause of colitis in IBD is still a subject of debate. Our data suggest that disruptions in the gut microbiota contribute to colitis. In summary, our study demonstrates that bacterial challenge induces the expression of Chi3l1 in IECs. Once produced, Chi3l1 is released into the mucus layer where it interacts with the gut microbiota, particularly through PGN, a primary component of bacterial cell walls. This interaction is beneficial for the colonization of bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, in the mucus layer. Dysbiosis resulting from a lack of Chi3l1 exacerbates DSS-induced colitis, highlighting the role of dysbiosis as a contributing factor to colitis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The data also indicate that Chi3l1 interacts with the peptidoglycan of the bacteria cell wall, supporting the colonization of beneficial bacteria strains such as Lactobacillus, and that deficiency in Chi3l1 predisposes mice to colitis.

What about other bacteria? Why does only <italic>E. coli</italic> but not staphytlococcus sciuri induce chi3l1 production? It does not prove that the gut microbiome induces the expression of Chi3l1. If it is the effect of LPS, does it trigger a cell death response or inflammatory responses that are known to induce chi3l1 production? What is the role of peptidoglycan in this experiment? Also, it is recommended to change WT to SPF in the figure and text, as no genetic manipulation was involved in this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and insightful suggestions. In our study, we tried to identify bacteria from murine gut contents and feces using 16S sequencing. However, only <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> were identified (Figure 1D). Consequently, our experiments were limited to these two bacterial strains. While we have not tested other bacteria, our data suggest that not all bacteria can induce the expression of Chi3l1. Given that <italic>E. coli</italic> is Gram-negative and <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> is Gram-positive, we hypothesized that the difference in their ability to induce Chi3l1 expression might be due to variations between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, such as the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used LPS to induce Chi3l1 expression. Consistent with our hypothesis, LPS successfully induced Chi3l1 expression (Figure 1F&amp;G). Additionally, we observed that Chi3l1 expression is significantly upregulated in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice compared to germ-free mice (Figure 1A), demonstrating that the gut microbiome induces the expression of Chi3l1.</p><p>Although we have not examined cell death or inflammatory responses, the protective role of Chi3l1 shown in Figure 5 suggests that any such responses would be mild and negligible. Regarding the role of peptidoglycan in the induction of Chi3l1 expression in DLD-1 cells, we have not yet explored this aspect. However, we agree with your suggestion that it would be worthwhile to investigate this in future experiments.</p><p>We have also made the suggested modifications to the labeling (Figure 1A) and the clarification in the revised manuscript accordingly (page 3, Line 95-96; Line 102-106).</p><p>Thank you again for your constructive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 2, the binding between Chi3l1 and PGN needs better characterization, regarding the affinity and how it compares with the binding between Chi3l1 and chitin. More importantly, it is unclear how this interaction could facilitate the colonization of gram-positive bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions and we have performed the suggested experiments and included the results in the revised manuscript (Figure 2E-G, page 3-4, Line 132-146).</p><p>Our results indicate that Chi3l1 interact with PGN in a dose-increase manner (Figure 2E). In contrast, the binding between Chi3l1 and chitin did not exhibit dose dependency (Figure 2E). These findings suggest a specific and distinct binding mechanism for Chi3l1 with PGN compared to chitin.</p><p>We conducted DLD-1 cell-bacteria adhesion experiments, using GlmM mutant (PGN synthesis mutant) and K12 (wild-type) bacteria to test their adhesion capabilities. The results showed that the adhesion ability of the GlmM mutant to cells significantly decreased (Figure 2F). Additionally, after knocking down Chi3l1 in DLD-1 cells, we observed a decreased bacterial adhesion (Figure 2G). These findings suggest that Chi3l1 and PGN interaction plays a crucial role in bacterial adhesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3, the abundance of furmicutes and other gram-positive species is lower in the knockout mice.

Among the Gram-positive bacteria that we have sequenced and analyzed, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> occupies the largest proportion. Given the significant presence and established benefits of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, we chose it for the subsequent transfer experiments to leverage its known properties and availability, thereby ensuring the robustness and reproducibility of our findings.This is supported by the study referenced below.</p><p>Lamas B, Richard ML, Leducq V, Pham HP, Michel ML, Da Costa G, Bridonneau C, Jegou S, Hoffmann TW, Natividad JM, Brot L, Taleb S, Couturier-Maillard A, Nion-Larmurier I, Merabtene F, Seksik P, Bourrier A, Cosnes J, Ryffel B, Beaugerie L, Launay JM, Langella P, Xavier RJ, Sokol H.

Is it specific for E. faecalis, or it is generally true for all gram-positive bacteria? What about the colonization of gram-negative bacteria?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions and we have investigated the colonization of gram-negative bacteria, OP50-mcherry (a strain of <italic>E.coli</italic> that express mCherry) and included the results in the updated manuscript (Supplementary Figure 3B, page 5, Line 197-200). We performed rectal injection of both wildtype and Chi11-/- mice with mCherry-OP50, and found that Chi11-/- mice had much higher colonization of <italic>E. coli</italic> compared to wildtype mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 5, the fact that FMT did not completely rescue the phenotype may point to the role of host cells in the processes. The reason that lactobacillus transfer did completely rescue the phenotypes could be due to the overwhelming protective role of lactobacillus itself, as the experiments were missing villin-cre mice transferred with lactobacillus.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and thorough review. In our study, pretreatment with antibiotics in mice to eliminate gut microbiota demonstrated that IEC∆Chil1 mice exhibited a milder colitis phenotype (Supplementary Figure 4). This suggests that Chi3l1-expressing host cells are likely to play a detrimental role in colitis. Consequently, the failure of FMT to completely rescue the phenotype is likely due to the incomplete preservation of bacteria in the feces during the transfer experiment.</p><p>We agree with your assessment of the protective role of <italic>lactobacillus</italic>. This also explains the significant difference in colitis phenotype between Villin-cre and IEC∆Chil1 mice (Figure 5B-E), as <italic>lactobacillus</italic> levels are significantly lower in IEC∆Chil1 mice (Figure 4F). Given the severity of colitis in Villin-cre mice at 7 days post-DSS, even if <italic>lactobacillus</italic> were transferred back to these mice, it is unlikely to result in a significant improvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Conflicting literature demonstrating the detrimental roles of Chi3l1 in mouse IBD model needs to be acknowledged and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions and we have included additional discussions in the revised manuscript (page 6-7, Line 258-274).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) Images are of great quality but lack proper quantification and statistical analysis. Statements such as &quot;substantial increase of Chi3l1 expression in SPF mice&quot; (Fig.1A), &quot;reduced levels of Firmicutes in the colon lumen of IEC ∆ Chil1&quot; (Fig.3F), &quot;Chil1-/- had much lower colonization of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>&quot; (Fig.4G), or &quot;deletion of Chi3l1 significantly reduced mucus layer thickness&quot; (Supplemental Figure 3A-B) are subjective. Since many conclusions were based on imaging data, the authors must provide reliable measures for comparison between conditions, as long as possible, such as fluorescence intensity, area, density, etc, as well as plots and statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions and we have performed the suggested statistical analysis on most of the figures and included the analysis in the revised manuscript (Figure 1A, Figure 3E&amp;F, Supplementary Figure 3B&amp;C).Given large quantity of dietary fiber intertwined with bacteria, it is challenging to make a reliable quantification of bacteria in Figure 4G. However, it is easy to distinguish bacteria from dietary fiber under the microscope. We have exclusively analyzed gut sections from six mice in each group, and the results are consistent between the two groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the fecal/Lactobacillus transplantation experiments, oral gavage of Lactobacillus to IECΔChil1 mice ameliorated the colitis phenotype, by preventing colon length reduction, weight loss, and colon inflammation. These findings seem to go against the notion that Chi3l1 is necessary for the colonization of Lactobacillus in the intestinal mucosa. The authors could speculate on how Lactobacillus administration is still beneficial in the absence of Chi3l1. Perhaps, additional data showing the localization of the orally administered bacteria in the gut of Chi3l1 deficient mice would clarify whether Lactobacillus are more successfully colonizing other regions of the gut, but not the mucus layer. Alternatively, later time points of 2% DSS challenge, after Lactobacillus transplantation, would suggest whether the gut colonization by Lactobacillus and therefore the milder colitis phenotype, is sustained for longer periods in the absence of Chi3l1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thorough review and insightful suggestions. Since we pretreated mice with antibiotics, the intestinal mucus layer is likely damaged according to a previous study (PMID: 37097253). Therefore, gavaged <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> cannot colonize in the mucus layer. Moreover, existing studies have shown that the protective effect of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> is mainly derived from its metabolites or thallus components, rather than the living bacteria itself (PMID: 36419205, PMID: 27516254).</p><p>Zhan M, Liang X, Chen J, Yang X, Han Y, Zhao C, Xiao J, Cao Y, Xiao H, Song M.

The study should take into account recent discoveries on the nature of mucus in the colon, namely its mobile fecal association and complex structure based on two distinct mucus barrier layers coming from proximal and distal parts of the colon (PMID:). This impacts the interpretation of how and where Ch3l1 is expressed and gets into the mucus to promote colonization. It also impacts their conclusions because the authors compare fecal vs. tissue mucus, but most of the mucus would be attached to the feces. Of the mucus that was claimed to be isolated from the WT and IEC Ch3l1 KO, this was not biochemically verified. Such verification (e.g. through Western blot) would increase confidence in the data presented. Further, the study relies upon relative microbial profiling, which can mask absolute numbers, making the claim of reduced overall Gram-positive species in mice lacking Ch3l1 unproven. It would be beneficial to show more quantitative approaches (e.g. Quantitative Microbial Profiling, QMP) to provide more definitive conclusions on the impact of Ch3l1 loss on Gram+ microbes.</p></disp-quote><p>You raise an excellent point about the data interpretation, and we appreciate your insightful suggestions. We have included the discussion regarding the recent discoveries in the revised manuscript (page 7-8, Line 304-312). According to the recent discovery, the mucus in the proximal colon forms a primary encapsulation barrier around fecal material, while the mucus in the distal colon forms a secondary barrier. Our findings indicate that Chi3l1 is expressed throughout the entire colon, including the proximal, middle, and distal sections (See Author response image 1 below, P.S. Chi3l1 detection in colon presented in the manuscript are from the middle section). This suggests that Chi3l1 likely promotes bacterial colonization across the entire colon. Despite most mucus being expelled with feces, the</p><p>constant production of mucus and the minimal presence of Chi3l1 in feces (Figure 4C) indicate that Chi3l1 continuously plays a role in promoting the colonization of microbiota.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Chi3l1 express in the proximal and distal colon.</title><p>Immunofluoresence staining on proximal and distal colon sections to detect Chi3l1 (Red) expression.

Therefore, our data is reliable to some extent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other weaknesses lie in the execution of the aims, leaving many claims incompletely substantiated. For example, much of the imaging data is challenging for the reader to interpret due to it being unfocused, too low of magnification, not including the correct control, and not comparing the same regions of tissues among different in vivo study groups. Statistical rigor could be better demonstrated, particularly when making claims based on imaging data. These are often presented as single images without any statistics (i.e. analysis of multiple images and biological replicates).

We have annotated the cells present in the untreated sample based on the overexposure in the revised manuscript (Figure 1G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3B. Is this absolute quantification? How were the data normalized to allow comparison of microbial loads?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thorough review. Figure 3B presents absolute quantification data based on the methodology described in the paper titled &quot;The Antibacterial Lectin RegIIIγ Promotes the Spatial Segregation of Microbiota and Host in the Intestine&quot; (PMID: 21998396). Briefly, we amplified a short segment (179 bp) of the 16S rRNA gene using conserved 16S rRNA-specific primers and OP50 (a strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>) as the template. After gel extraction and concentration measurement, the PCR products were diluted to gradient concentrations (0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.28, 2.56, 5.12, 10.24, 20.48 pg/µl). These gradient concentrations were used as templates for qPCR to generate a standard curve based on Ct values and bacterial concentration. The standard curve is used to calculate bacterial concentration in the samples. The data presented in Figure 3B represent the weight of bacteria/milligram sample, calculated as (bacterial concentration x bacterial volume) / (weight of feces or gut content).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 3D. The major case is made for a dramatic reduction in Gram+ species, but Figure 1D does not show a dramatic change. Is this difference significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thorough review. We don’t think we are clear about your question. However, there was no significant difference in Figure 3D. The dramatic reduction in Gram+ species are made based on the LTA, Firmicutes FISH, individual species comparison between WT and KO mice, bacterial QPCR results together (Figure 3E-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figures 3E and 3F. These stainings are alone not convincing of reduced Gram+ in the KOs. Some stats are required for these images. An independent complementary method is also needed to quantify these with statistics since this data is so central to the study's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive suggestions. We have included statistical analysis in the revised manuscript (Figure 3E and F). Given large quantity of dietary fiber intertwined with bacteria, it is challenging to make a reliable quantification of bacteria in Figure 3E. However, it is easy to distinguish bacteria from dietary fiber under the microscope. We have exclusively analyzed gut sections from six mice in each group, and the results are consistent with the Firmicutes FISH results. Complementary method such as bacterial QPCR have been employed to quantify these (Figure 4E, F). Due to a lack of expertise, it has been challenging for us to perform reliable QMP experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 3G. To make quantitative conclusions, the authors need to do quantitative microbial profiling (QMP) of the microbiota. Relative abundance masks absolute numbers, which could be increased. There are qPCR-based QMP platforms the authors could use (PMID: PMIDs: 31940382, 33763385).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive suggestions. Due to a lack of expertise, it has been challenging for us to perform reliable QMP experiments. However, since QMP involves qPCR combined with bacterial sequencing, we conducted 16S rRNA sequencing and confirmed the quantity of certain bacteria by qPCR (revised manuscript, Figure 3B, H, Figure 4E, F, Supplementary Figure 3A). In addition to the original bacterial qPCR data presented in the manuscript, we included another bacterial species, <italic>Turicibater.</italic> Consistent with the 16S rRNA sequencing analysis data, qPCR results showed that Turicibacter was more abundant in IECΔChil1 mice than Villin-cre mice (revised manuscript, supplementary Figure 3A, page 4, line 171-173) Therefore, our data is reliable to some extent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 4B. The data nicely shows Ch3l1 in mucus. However, no data supports the authors' main claim Ch3h1 binds Gram-positive bacteria in situ. Dual staining of Ch3l1 with Firmicutes probe would be supportive to show this interaction is happening in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>You raise an excellent point, and we agree with your suggestion that we should confirm Chi3l1 binding to Gram-positive bacteria in situ. During the study, we attempted dual staining of Chi3l1 with a universal bacterial 16S FISH probe several times, but we were unsuccessful. Despite various optimizations of the protocol, we were only able to detect bacteria, not Chi3l1. It appears that the antibody is not suitable for this method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figures 4D - F. Because mucus is associated with feces (PMID:), the data with feces likely contains both Muc2/mucus and Feces. Therefore, it is unclear what the &quot;mucus&quot; is referring to in these figures. To support the authors' conclusions, there needs to be some validation that mucus was purified in the assays. This must be confirmed at a minimum by PAS staining on SDS PAGE gel (should be very high molecular weight) or Western blot with UEA lectin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestions. As mentioned in the public review, the mucus layer was isolated following the protocol described in the paper titled &quot;The Antibacterial Lectin RegIIIγ Promotes the Spatial Segregation of Microbiota and Host in the Intestine&quot; (PMID: 21998396). Briefly, after harvesting the middle colon from the mice, we cut open the colon longitudinally. After removing the gut contents, the lumen was vigorously rinsed in PBS while holding one end with forceps. The pellet obtained after centrifuging the rinsate was used as our mucus sample. Fresh feces were collected immediately after the mice defecated in a new, empty cage. We performed Western blot analysis to detect UEA lectin but were unsuccessful.</p><p>However, as noted in the public review, we conducted protein mass spectrometry on the isolated mucus layers and analyzed the data by comparing it with established research (&quot;Proteomic Analyses of the Two Mucus Layers of the Colon Barrier Reveal That Their Main Component, the Muc2 Mucin, Is Strongly Bound to the Fcgbp Protein,&quot; PMID: 19432394). Our data showed a high degree of overlap with the proteins identified in these established studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 4E/F: The units of measurement are in pg/cm2, implying picogram per area. Can the authors please explain what this unit is referring to?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for your thorough review. The unit pg/cm ² represents picograms per square centimeter. Figures 4E and 4F present absolute quantification data based on the methodology described in the paper titled &quot;The Antibacterial Lectin RegIIIγ Promotes the Spatial Segregation of Microbiota and Host in the Intestine&quot; (PMID: 21998396). Briefly, we harvested a 3x0.5 cm section of colon and a 9x0.4 cm section of ileum. And then we collected the mucus layer as previously described (responses to question 10). We measured bacterial concentration as described in response to question 5 using the equation (y = -1.53ln(x) + 13.581), where x represents the bacterial concentration and y represents the Ct value. After obtaining the bacterial concentration, we multiplied it by the volume of the rinsate and divided it by the area to obtain the values for pg/cm² used in the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Figure 5E. Normal tissues appear to be from different colon regions from colitis tissues: the &quot;Normal&quot; looks like the proximal colon, while &quot;Colitis&quot; looks like the Distal colon. They cannot be directly compared.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We have now included the updated image in the revised manuscript as Figure 5E to compare the same region of the colons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Similarly, in Figure 5I it appears different colon regions are being compared between groups: Proximal colon in the bottom panels, and distal in the top panels. Since the proximal colon is less damaged by DSS, this data could be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We have now included the updated image in the revised manuscript as Figure 5I to compare the same region of the colons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) In the DSS studies, are the VillinCre and IEC Chit3l1 mice co-housed littermates?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. In the DSS studies, the Villin-Cre and IECΔChil1 mice are not co-housed littermates. However, they are derived from the same lineage and are housed in the same rack within the same room of the animal facility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Supplementary Figure 3: Mucus thickness images; are they representative? Stats are needed on multiple mice to support the claim that the mucus is thinner.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful suggestion. The images are representative of 4 mice each group. We have now included the statistical analysis in the revised manuscript Supplementary Figure 3C&amp;D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(1) Introduction: Reference to &quot;mucosal layer&quot;: &quot;Mucosal&quot; and &quot;Mucus&quot; are different things. &quot;Mucosal&quot; refers to the epithelium, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosa. &quot;Mucus&quot; refers to the secreted mucus gel, the focus of the authors' study. Therefore, the statement &quot;mucosal layer&quot; is not proper. &quot;Mucosal layer&quot; should be changed to &quot;mucus layer.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive suggestions and we have learned a lot from it. We have made the replacement of “mucosal layer” to “mucus layer in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 366 and related lines: Feces cannot be &quot;dissolved&quot;. &quot;Resuspended&quot; is a better term.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive suggestion and we have made the changes of “dissolved” to “resuspended” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 36-37 and 43-44 are redundant to each other.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive suggestion and we have removed the lines 36-37 in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
