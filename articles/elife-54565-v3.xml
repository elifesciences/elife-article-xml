cell and cancer biologists, partly because of its documented role in tumorigenesis. A common model proposes that the extra centrosomes that are typically acquired during tetraploidization are responsible for driving tumorigenesis. However, tetraploid cells evolved in culture have been shown to lack extra centrosomes. This observation raises questions about how tetraploid cells evolve and more specifically about the mechanisms(s) underlying centrosome loss. Here, using a combination of fixed cell analysis, live cell imaging, and mathematical modeling, we show that populations of newly formed tetraploid cells rapidly evolve in vitro to retain a near-tetraploid chromosome number while losing the extra centrosomes gained at the time of tetraploidization. This appears to happen through a process of natural selection in which tetraploid cells that inherit a single centrosome during a bipolar division with asymmetric centrosome clustering are favored for long-term survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tetraploidy</kwd><kwd>centrosomes</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007263</institution-id><institution>Virginia Tech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>College of Science Dean's Discovery Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cimini</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007263</institution-id><institution>Virginia Tech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fralin Life Sciences Institute Discretionary funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cimini</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007263</institution-id><institution>Virginia Tech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ICTAS Center for Engineered Health Seed funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cimini</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1517506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cimini</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007263</institution-id><institution>Virginia Tech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIOTRANS IGEP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baudoin</surname><given-names>Nicolaas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Newly formed tetraploid cells rapidly lose extra centrosomes acquired upon tetraploidization via asymmetric centrosome clustering during cell division and selective advantage of tetraploid daughter cells that inherit a single centrosome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organismal polyploidy is confined to certain taxa, but many species across the tree of life are thought to have had polyploid ancestors at some point in their evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Comai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Keinath, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wolfe, 2001</xref>) and polyploidy is thought to contribute to speciation and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otto and Whitton, 2000</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, organismal polyploidy is rare, and among mammals it has only been described in a single species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallardo et al., 1999</xref>). However, within individual diploid mammals, some tissues physiologically develop to have a higher ploidy than the majority of somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nagl, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orr-Weaver, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Øvrebø and Edgar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schoenfelder and Fox, 2015</xref>). Polyploidy can also occur outside of the context of normal development, and is linked with both pathology (particularly cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganem et al., 2007</xref>]) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2015</xref>). Tetraploid cells are commonly found in premalignant lesions and tumors at different stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davoli and de Lange, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galipeau et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olaharski et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, meta-analysis of catalogued tumor genomes has provided evidence that close to 40% of all cancers – even those that were not tetraploid at the time of sampling – had a tetraploid intermediate stage at some point during tumor evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zack et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, several studies have shown a direct, causative link between tetraploidy and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujiwara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In proliferating cells, tetraploidy can arise via abnormal cell cycle events, including cytokinesis failure, cell fusion, endoreduplication, and mitotic slippage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davoli and de Lange, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dikovskaya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edgar and Orr-Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rieder, 2011</xref>). Most of these events result in the concomitant acquisition of extra centrosomes along with genome duplication. Importantly, both tetraploidy and extra centrosomes have been shown to trigger a p53-dependent arrest in some experimental systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreassen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fava et al., 2017</xref>). In experimental systems in which such an arrest does not occur, extra centrosomes have been shown to promote chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silkworth et al., 2009</xref>) and invasive/migratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godinho et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have also shown that extra centrosomes promote and in some cases are sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serçin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Based on these studies, it has been speculated that the extra centrosomes emerging as a result of tetraploidization may drive chromosomal instability and, in turn, tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Storchova and Pellman, 2004</xref>). However, it was previously reported that cytokinesis failure does not result in stable centrosome amplification in a cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krzywicka-Racka and Sluder, 2011</xref>). Moreover, anecdotal reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godinho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potapova et al., 2016</xref>) have indicated that clones of tetraploid or near-tetraploid cells displayed normal centrosome numbers. This suggests that our understanding of the evolution of tetraploid cells is incomplete and how centrosome and chromosome numbers evolve after tetraploidization needs to be revisited. To address this problem, we studied the time period immediately following cytokinesis failure and investigated how centrosome and chromosome numbers change in newly formed tetraploid cells. Following the observation that the number of centrosomes, but not chromosomes, rapidly returns to normal, we combined computational and experimental approaches to identify a specific cellular mechanism that underlies the loss of extra centrosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the early consequences of tetraploidy and the evolution of newly formed tetraploid cells, we induced cytokinesis failure by dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB) treatment for 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in both DLD-1 (pseudodiploid colorectal cancer cells) and p53<sup>-/-</sup> hTERT-immortalized RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>) (hereafter referred to as RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup>; p53-null RPE-1 cells were used because the parental, p53-positive, cells display a G1 arrest after cytokinesis failure, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganem et al., 2014</xref>).

We found that multipolar divisions were frequent in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), consistent with the acquisition of extra centrosomes upon cytokinesis failure and with the ability of extra centrosomes to promote formation of multipolar mitotic spindles. We confirmed the high rates of multipolar divisions by analyzing ana-/telophase cells immunostained for α–tubulin and centrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This fixed-cell analysis and analysis of live RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells with GFP-tagged centrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) also confirmed that spindle poles always contained centrosomes (i.e., two centrin dots), as acentrosomal poles were never observed in multipolar ana-/telophase cells. Furthermore, all of the live binucleate cells that we observed contained supernumerary centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These centrosomes were duplicated prior to mitosis and were never lost/extruded during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The observation that only ~20–30% of newly formed tetraploid cells underwent bipolar anaphase indicates that centrosome clustering is not prevalent in newly formed tetraploid cells. However, when we followed these multipolar mitoses through cytokinesis, we found that tripolar or tetrapolar anaphases did not always generate three or four daughter cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Instead, the DNA corresponding to two or more anaphase poles was often enclosed in a single daughter cell, giving rise to binucleated or, rarely, trinucleated daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wheatley and Wang, 1996</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Highly aneuploid cells form early in the evolution of tetraploid cells, but quickly disappear from the population</title><p>We next investigated how these early cell divisions after tetraploidization may impact chromosome numbers in the proliferating cell population. To this end, we carried out a time-course experiment in which we performed chromosome counting in the cell population after the 20 hr DCB treatment and every two days thereafter for a 12 day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Immediately after drug washout, we observed a tetraploid fraction corresponding to approximately 80% and 60% of the population for DLD-1 and RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E,G</xref>, day 0). Two days after DCB washout, we observed high frequencies of cells with chromosome counts in the hypotetraploid/hyperdiploid range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E,G</xref>). It is conceivable that these highly aneuploid cells may originate from the multipolar mitoses we observed in our live-cell imaging experiments. Indeed, by quantifying DNA fluorescence of separated chromosome masses in fixed ana-/telophase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we observed that while chromosome distribution to the daughter cells was balanced in bipolar divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), it greatly deviated from an equal distribution in multipolar mitoses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>), indicating that the daughter cells in multipolar divisions inherit variable proportions of the genome. However, the fraction of cells with highly abnormal chromosome numbers rapidly decreased over the course of the 12 day experiment in both cell types and highly aneuploid cells were virtually eliminated from the DLD-1 population by day 12, leaving sub-populations of near-diploid cells (presumably derived from cells that did not respond to the initial DCB treatment) and near-tetraploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C–E,G</xref>). The appearance and loss of highly aneuploid cells from the RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cell population was delayed compared to the DLD-1 cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), possibly suggesting that newly formed tetraploid RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells display lower proliferation and death rates. Indeed, the appearance and disappearance of highly aneuploid cells corresponded to an increase followed by a decline in the fraction of dead cells between day 2 and 6 in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,H</xref>). However, cell death rates were lower in RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> compared to DLD-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), possibly explaining the delay in both elimination of highly aneuploid cells and proliferation of ~4N cells in the RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High degrees of aneuploidy appear and rapidly disappear following tetraploidization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design for time course experiments to analyze chromosome number evolution over a 12 day time period after experimental induction of tetraploidization by dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB).

To test this, we built a mathematical model based on this assumption (for model details, see Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> ). We started with a simple model (Model I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) in which, initially, 87–90% of the cells have two centrosomes in G1 (four in S/G2/M), corresponding to the experimentally observed frequencies after DCB treatment. Cells in the model can divide in a multipolar or bipolar fashion, and bipolar divisions can occur with either symmetric or asymmetric centrosome clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) – all with probabilities that reflect those observed experimentally (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for details on which experimental data motivated various model parameters). The daughter cells from multipolar divisions have significantly reduced viability and are expected to be quickly eliminated by selection; based on this, in the model these cells were, for simplicity, assumed to die (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Cells inheriting a single centrosome were assumed to become stable cells that undergo bipolar divisions with high viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Cells inheriting two centrosomes would display the same fate as newly formed tetraploid cells, and cells inheriting three centrosomes were assumed to undergo multipolar division and consequently produce non-viable progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Although this model (Model I) captured centrosome loss, it predicted centrosome loss over a much shorter time scale than was observed experimentally for either DLD-1 or RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>, orange line). The final fraction of cells with extra centrosomes predicted from the model was also substantially lower than what was experimentally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>, orange line). Parameter optimization within a reasonable range could not solve this discrepancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In particular, the final steady-state fraction of cells with extra centrosomes was strongly dependent on the probability of cytokinesis failure in cells with normal centrosome number (which generates new cells with extra centrosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3A</xref>). For the experimentally quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicholson et al., 2015</xref>) probability (~2.5%) of spontaneous cytokinesis failure in DLD-1 cells, the steady-state fraction of cells with extra centrosomes cannot match the observed value.</p><p>We next considered the possibility that a sub-fraction of newly formed tetraploid cells may cluster their centrosomes more efficiently than other cells (Model II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), which we herein dub ‘super-clustering’ (SC) cells.

We imaged newly generated tetraploid (binucleate) cells by phase contrast microscopy for 24 hr, after which we determined the number of GFP-centrin dots present in the daughter cells arising from bipolar divisions. These cells were then imaged for an additional 48 hr by phase contrast microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) to determine their fates in relation to the number of centrosomes they inherited. We found that cells that divided in a bipolar manner showed a mix of symmetric and asymmetric centrosome clustering without a strong preference for one mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with our fixed-cell data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>; two-sided Fisher’s exact test, p=0.8224 and p=0.2243 for fixed vs. live cell data in DLD-1 and RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup>, respectively).

This assumption was required to reproduce the observed evolution dynamics and final fraction of cells with extra centrioles, given the observed rate of cytokinesis failure. Based on this assumption, the model predicted that the fraction of SC cells rapidly increased over the first few days and that SC cells would make up about 90% of the remaining cell population with extra centrosomes at the end of the 12 day evolution period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). To test this model prediction, we analyzed fixed DLD-1 cells in ana-/telophase to determine the fractions of cells with extra centrioles that displayed bipolar vs. multipolar configurations. As predicted by our model, we found that approximately 90% of cells with extra centrioles displayed a bipolar configuration at day 12 compared with just 28% in newly formed tetraploid cells at Day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

By combining fixed cell analysis, live cell imaging, and mathematical modeling, we show that this happens by a process of natural selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Specifically, tetraploid cells that inherit a single centrosome during a bipolar division with asymmetric centrosome clustering are favored for long-term survival. Conversely, the majority of cells with extra centrosomes are eventually eliminated because of their high probability of undergoing multipolar division, which has a high likelihood of producing daughters with insufficient amounts of genetic material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Asymmetric clustering of centrosomes defines the early evolution of tetraploid cells.</title><p>The diagram illustrates the possible fates of a newly formed tetraploid cell and the mechanism by which tetraploid cells containing a normal number of centrosomes emerge.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54565-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Our findings can explain previous anecdotal reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godinho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Potapova et al., 2016</xref>) that clones isolated after experimental inhibition of cytokinesis consisted of tetraploid cells with a ‘normal’ number (i.e., same number as in diploid cells) of centrosomes.

Cancer genome sequencing data indicated that tetraploidization occurs at some point during the progression of a large fraction of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zack et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, tetraploid mouse epithelial cells were shown to be more tumorigenic than their non-tetraploid counterparts when injected in nude mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujiwara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davoli and de Lange, 2012</xref>). A popular model for how tetraploidy may promote tumorigenesis is that the extra centrosomes (which arise concomitantly with tetraploidization) contribute to cancer phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Storchova and Pellman, 2004</xref>). This idea is supported by the following observations: centrosome amplification is frequently observed in the pre-malignant stages of certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopes et al., 2018</xref>) and is observed in a large fraction of human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Assoro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gustafson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lingle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pihan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sato et al., 1999</xref>), in which it correlates with poor prognosis/advanced disease stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Godinho and Pellman, 2014</xref>); extra centrosomes can promote tumorigenesis in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serçin et al., 2016</xref>) and enhance the invasive behavior of mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Godinho et al., 2014</xref>); finally, supernumerary centrosomes promote chromosome mis-attachment and mis-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silkworth et al., 2009</xref>), leading to chromosomal instability, a hallmark of cancer believed to drive tumor evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Targa and Rancati, 2018</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that extra centrosomes are likely to contribute to tumor initiation and/or progression.</p><p>Our observation that extra centrosomes gained through tetraploidization are quickly lost raises the possibility that tetraploidy may drive tumorigenesis by means other than the acquisition of extra centrosomes. Indeed, a number of studies and observations suggest that tetraploidy per se may promote the emergence of cancer phenotypes. For instance, tetraploidy was shown to increase tolerance for genomic changes, leading to the rapid evolution of complex genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewhurst et al., 2014</xref>), as seen in cancer, and many tetraploid cells show increased chromosomal instability compared to diploid cells, even when no extra centrosomes are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, polyploid cells were shown to be more resistant than their diploid counterparts to oxidative stress, genotoxic insult, irradiation, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ianzini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Illidge et al., 2000</xref>). Lastly, in cancer patients, genome-doubling in early stage tumors was shown to correlate with poor relapse-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewhurst et al., 2014</xref>), although centrosome number was not examined in these patients.</p><p>In light of our findings, one could imagine that in certain instances, cells experiencing a genome doubling event may initially lose their extra centrosomes and then re-acquire them at a later time, depending on additional factors. At least one example in the literature provides evidence for such a series of events. In Barrett’s esophagus, a pre-malignant condition that predisposes to esophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cameron et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hameeteman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hvid-Jensen et al., 2011</xref>), accumulation of 4N cells has been shown to occur as the tissue transitions to metaplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galipeau et al., 1996</xref>). A study on centrosome status in Barrett’s esophagus reported centrosome amplification prior to the transition to metaplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Segat et al., 2010</xref>), corresponding to the time when tetraploid cells accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galipeau et al., 1996</xref>), but also noted that the frequency of supernumerary centrosomes decreased with progression to metaplasia and neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Segat et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, another study found an increase in centrosome amplification followed by a decrease during the progression from Barrett’s Esophagus to adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lopes et al., 2018</xref>). These results closely mirror the dynamics of evolution seen in our study and illustrate that extra centrosomes can be present early in tumor development (around the time when tetraploidy appears) but subsequently be lost. Therefore, while tetraploidy and supernumerary centrosomes are both individually linked with tumorigenesis, the link between tetraploidy, extra centrosomes, and disease progression may be less direct than conventionally thought.</p><p>Tetraploidization is intimately linked with the birth of extra centrosomes; however, tetraploidization may not lead to stable acquisition of supernumerary centrosomes unless (i) specific cellular/genetic changes have occurred to allow the cell to maintain its extra centrosomes and/or (ii) certain conditions in the tissue microenvironment exist that favor or necessitate the presence of extra centrosomes. Indeed, there is evidence that clustering of extra centrosomes into a bipolar configuration can be influenced by a number of cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and such factors may be important for determining the fraction of cells that retain extra centrosomes. Among cellular factors, the nonessential motor protein KIFC1 (also known as HSET), the epithelial cell protein E-cadherin, spindle assembly checkpoint components, the chromosome passenger complex, the NDC80 complex, and the augmin complex have been shown to affect (either positively or negatively) centrosome clustering efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quintyne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rhys et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabino et al., 2015</xref>). Extracellular factors, such as geometric constraints imposed by the environment, have also been shown to alter centrosome clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, if tetraploidization occurs under circumstances that do not favor retention of extra centrosomes, the tetraploid cells may initially lose their extra centrosomes and then re-acquire them at a later time, as a result of genome instability, which may lead to the non-stoichiometric production of proteins involved in centrosome duplication. Thus, the evolutionary pattern that newly formed tetraploid cells will follow may vary depending on many factors, including genetic background, functional requirements in a given tissue/organ, or a variety of extracellular physical and physiological factors. All these potential factors could explain the high rates of extra centrosomes in certain tumors and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Serçin et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NEB 5α</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs, Inc</td><td valign="top">Cat# C2988J</td><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NEB Stable</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs, Inc</td><td valign="top">Cat# C3040I</td><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DLD-1</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CCL-221 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0248">CVCL_0248</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">hTERT RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup></td><td valign="top">Reference 35</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">DLD-1 GFP-CETN2 RFP-H2B</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Cimini lab, see text for details</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">hTERT RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup>GFP-CETN2 RFP-H2B</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Cimini lab, see text for details</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">GP-293</td><td valign="top">Clontech</td><td valign="top">Cat # 631458 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_WI48">CVCL_WI48</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Viral packaging cell line</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Centrin 3 clone 3E6 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abnova</td><td valign="top">Cat # H00001070-M01 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_464016">AB_464016</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-geminin EPR14637 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat# ab195047 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2832993">AB_2832993</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-α-tubulin (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab18251 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2210057">AB_2210057</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">DAPI stain</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">D1306</td><td valign="top">(300 nM)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">GFP-CETN2 pLNCX2 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">G418 selection.

Supernatant was aspirated, fixative was added dropwise, and the cell suspension was again centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The fixation step was repeated two more times and fixed cells were finally dropped on microscope slides. For RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells, a homemade humidity chamber constructed from PVC piping, plastic sheeting, and a nebulizer was used when drying slides to improve chromosome spread quality (effect of humidity on chromosome spread quality was described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2003</xref>). Chromosome spreads were then stained with 300 nM DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific – Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 10 min. DAPI-stained slides were mounted with an antifade solution containing 90% glycerol and 0.5% N-propyl gallate and sealed under a 22 × 50 mm coverslip (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) with nail polish. For chromosome counting, images of DAPI-stained chromosome spreads were acquired with the Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope setup described in an earlier section. Images were acquired using either a 60X/1.4 NA or a 100X/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromatic phase contrast objective. After image acquisition, chromosome spreads were visualized in gray scale and chromosomes were counted using the count function in NIS elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell death assays</title><p>To measure cell death, 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated in each of three wells of a 6-well plate and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were plated in a T-25 flask. The following day, cells were treated with 1.5 µg/ml DCB for 20 hr. After 20 hr, day 0 cells’ supernatant was collected, while the adherent cells were washed (3 times using PBS) and harvested in trypsin. The supernatant, all the washes, and the cell suspension were collected in the same tube, centrifuged, and re-suspended in 400 µl PBS for counting. Viable cells were differentiated from dead cells by trypan blue exclusion. The numbers of living and dead cells were counted and the fraction of dead cells out of the total number of cells was calculated. Cell counting was performed on days 0, 1, 2, and every 2 days for the remainder of the 12 day period (with new wells being seeded from T-25 flasks on day 2). Cell culture medium was changed 24 hr before counting each day in order to only count cells that died within a 24 hr period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence staining, image acquisition and data analysis</title><p>For centrin and geminin immunostaining, cells were grown on sterilized acid-washed glass coverslips inside 35 mm Petri dishes. Cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer (60 mM Pipes, 25 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0) for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature in PHEM buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X 100. Following fixation and permeabilization, cells were washed three times with PBS and then blocked with 20% boiled goat serum (BGS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were then incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 10% BGS. Next, cells were washed in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) three times, and incubated at room temperature for 45 min with secondary antibodies diluted in 10% BGS. Cells were then washed four times with PBS-T, stained with DAPI (300 nM, Thermo Fisher Scientific – Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 5 min, and coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in an antifade solution containing 90% glycerol and 0.5% N-propyl gallate. For centrin/α-tubulin immunostaining, cells were washed in 1X PBS three times and fixed/permeabilized in 100% methanol for 10 min. After permeabilization, fixed cells were treated as described above for centrin/geminin staining. Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: rabbit anti-geminin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), 1:100; mouse anti-centrin (Abnova, Zhongli, Taiwan), 1:100; rabbit anti-α-tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), 1:250. Secondary antibodies were diluted as follows: Rhodamine Red-X goat anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, PA, USA), 1:100; Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, CA, USA), 1:200.</p><p>Centrin-stained samples were analyzed on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope equipped with a 100X/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromatic phase contrast objective lens, motorized ProScan stage (Prior Scientific, Cambridge, UK), appropriate filter sets, and an XCITE 120Q light source (Excelitas Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). Analysis was performed visually in both interphase cells and mitotic cells. The number of centrin dots was counted in cells that were determined to be in mitosis by DAPI staining. Mitotic cells with four centrin dots (i.e., two dots corresponding to each centrosome of a bipolar spindle) were categorized as normal; mitotic cells with greater than four dots were categorized as possessing supernumerary centrosomes. Interphase analysis was performed in G1/G0 cells, as determined by absence of nuclear geminin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGarry and Kirschner, 1998</xref>). G0/G1 cells with two adjacent centrin dots (corresponding to a single centrosome) were classified as normal, whereas cells with greater than two centrin dots were classified as possessing supernumerary centrosomes. For centrosome clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), bipolar metaphase, anaphase, or telophase cells were analyzed for the number of centrin dots present at respective spindle poles. For analysis of the fraction of fixed cells undergoing bipolar vs. multipolar division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), ana-/telophase cells stained with centrin and α-tubulin were analyzed for polarity (α-tubulin staining) and the presence or absence of centrioles at each spindle pole. To ensure that DCB treatment did not alter the polarity of mitotic cells, we co-treated cells with DCB and the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (which causes a robust G2 arrest) for 20 hr, then washed both drugs out, waited for 1 hr for cells to proceed into mitosis, then fixed, stained and analyzed the relative proportion of bipolar and multipolar ana-/telophases in those cells naturally harboring supernumerary centrosomes. Representative z-stack image examples were acquired on the Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope setup described in an earlier section. Images were acquired using either a 60X/1.4 NA or a 100X/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromatic phase contrast objective and appropriate filters.</p><p>For analysis of genome distribution in bipolar and multipolar divisions, images of ana-/telophase cells were acquired with a swept field confocal system (Prairie Technologies, WI, USA) on the same Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope described previously (Nikon Instruments Inc, NY, USA). The microscope was equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics, AZ, USA), a multiband pass filter set (illumination at 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm), and an Agilent monolithic laser combiner (MLC400) controlled by a four channel acousto-optic tunable filter. Images were obtained by acquiring Z-stacks with 0.6 µm steps (Nyquist matched) so that the entire 3-D volume of the DNA was captured. Images were shading corrected using the NIS Elements shading correction function. Z-stacks were summed using the FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) sum slices function. The freehand selection tool was used to trace the signal area corresponding to an ana-/telophase chromosome cluster and the percentage of the signal intensity relative to total DNA for an ana-/telophase cell was determined. To calculate the symmetry score, the ratio between the actual fluorescence intensity percentage and the expected signal intensity percentage for an even distribution to 2 (50%), 3 (33.3%) or 4 (25%) poles (depending on the polarity of the division) was first calculated for each chromosome cluster. Then, the standard deviation of all measurements for a cell was calculated as a ‘symmetry score’ (ss). If a division was perfectly symmetrical, ss = 0 and any ss &gt;0 indicates proportional increases in the asymmetry of DNA distribution to the poles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live cell imaging of fluorescently labeled cells</title><p>For live cell imaging of GFP-Centrin expressing cells, imaging was performed with a 60X/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromatic phase contrast objective lens (for RPE-1 p53<sup>-/-</sup> cells) or a 100X/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromatic phase contrast objective lens (for DLD-1 cells) controlled by Nikon Perfect Focus (Nikon Instruments Inc, NY, USA). In preparation for short-term live imaging of binucleate cells expressing GFP-centrin and RFP-H2B, the cells were washed out of DCB into medium containing 9 µM of the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306 to arrest cells at the G2/M transition. After 4 hr, the cells were again washed out into high glucose L-15 medium lacking phenol red. Imaging was performed by identifying individual binucleate cells in prophase or early prometaphase using RFP-H2B signal. Cells were imaged at the home Z-position in phase contrast every 4 min and the FITC channel every 4 min with asymmetrical Z-stacks defined by the home position and a range of −2.4 µm and +5.8 µm in 0.6 µm steps (14 steps). Chromosomes were imaged by phase contrast instead of fluorescence (RFP) to keep illumination, and hence photodamage, to a minimum, given that phase contrast imaging required lower exposure times than fluorescence imaging. Cells were imaged for a total of 3–4 hr. The videos were then analyzed to determine the number of centrin dots (centrioles) in the early mitotic cells and again in the resulting daughter cells after division.</p><p>For long-term cell fate experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), GFP-Centrin expressing cells were used. Binucleate cells were imaged at 10 min intervals for 24 hr via phase contrast microscopy under a 60X/1.4 NA or 100X/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromatic phase contrast objective lens. Following this period, a number of daughter cells were selected and the number of centrioles was quickly counted for each by eye. A phase contrast image was obtained, along with asymmetric Z-stack images in the FITC channel, defined by the home position and a range of −2.4 µm and +5.8 µm in 0.6 µm steps. These daughter cells were then tracked via phase contrast microscopy at 10 min intervals for an additional 48 hr period to determine their subsequent fate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Modeling approaches</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Probabilistic model for karyotypic outcomes of multipolar divisions</title><p>We built the following model to evaluate the probabilities of nullisomy and/or monosomy in a cell division with <italic>p</italic> poles in a <italic>k</italic>-ploid mother cell, that is, a cell with <italic>k</italic> sets of <italic>M</italic> nonhomologous chromosomes (e.g., <italic>k</italic> = 2, <italic>M</italic> = 23 for normal, diploid human cells).

centrosomes to derive some cells with normal centrosome numbers, and that this provides a fitness advantage that will allow these cells to dominate the population over time, provides a mechanism to explain how tetraploid cells with multiple centrosomes derived from cytokinesis failure can revert to normal centrosome numbers. Your proposal that some cells in an initial population have an enhanced ability to cluster centrosomes could be important to understand how tumours evolve. Thus your study is an important contribution to the literature.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Asymmetric clustering of centrosomes defines the early evolution of tetraploid cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jon Pines as Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Baudoin et al. propose that the reversion to normal centrosome number following cytokinesis failure results from the difference in fitness between daughter cells after mitosis with asymmetric centrosome clustering. The authors show that some daughter cells stochastically receive a single centrosome following mitosis, and these cells are more likely to continue proliferating. Finally, through computational analysis, the authors propose the existence of a population of “super-clustering” cells that can stably maintain additional centrosomes through a heightened ability to cluster centrosomes in mitosis.</p><p>This study nicely confirms the logical conclusion that supernumerary centrosomes cause a fitness disadvantage and that imperfect clustering of centrosomes in mitosis stochastically generates cells with a normal centrosome content. Due to the rapid proliferation of cells in culture, the growth advantages of cells with normal centrosome numbers quickly leads to their outgrowth within the population. The observations made by the authors in this manuscript provide a nice confirmation of what could be assumed to be the most likely mechanism by which supernumerary centrosomes are resolved in rapidly proliferating cultured cells. Overall, the study is nicely constructed, well-executed, and the data support their claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main experimental support for the existence of SC cells is in Figure 7D. The data show that immediately after cytokinesis failure by cytochalasin treatment and washout, most cells fail to efficiently cluster extra centrosomes whereas 12 days later, clustering efficiency appears higher. My concern is whether this effect can be explained by an artifact from drug treatment rather than reflecting true alterations in the fraction of genetically or epigenetically distinct &quot;SC&quot; cells. In other words, has the transient drug treatment artificially suppressed a baseline fairly efficient process of centrosome clustering. In principle, this might occur because of small amounts of drug retained in cells, a stress response to drug treatment, and/or changes to the actin cytoskeleton that are not immediately resolved after drug treatment.</p><p>To address this concern, I suggest two experiments. First, I suggest arresting cells in G1 with serum starvation, performing the DCB treatment and washout followed by release from the arrest, and determine if DCB treatment in that cell cycle but not during cytokinesis, independent of effects on cytokinesis, affects centrosome clustering efficiency. This would either need to be done by generating cells with extra centrosomes (e.g. transient Plk4) or by restricting the analysis to the cells in the starting population that spontaneously have extra centrosomes. Second, if the evolved population truly has an enhanced capacity to cluster extra centrosomes, then it is predicted that there will be a high efficiency of centrosome clustering in the evolved cells when they are re-challenged with the DCB treatment/washout procedure.</p><p>• Figure 1, 4: The findings were based on phase-contrast live-cell imaging of mitotic tetraploid cells where the authors explained that the reasoning for high rates of multipolar mitoses during the first 24h post DCB were due to acquiring extra centrosomes upon tetraploidization followed by the subsequent formation of multipolar spindle (subsection “Newly formed tetraploid cells undergo diverse fates in their first mitotic division”). These assumptions could be more robustly shown if the authors performed live-cell fluorescent imaging on cells expressing fluorescent centrosomes and nuclei/microtubules. This way the centrosomes could be clearly tracked to their respective poles for accurate quantification as it is well documented that spindle formation can sometimes occur without the presence of centrosomes (e.g. in the case of PCM fragmentation). Furthermore, this would have consolidated the need to perform the fixed analysis of centrosomes in Figure 4. Figure 1, S1: A representative picture of what was quantified would be help interpret the data. Figure 1, S1A, S1B could be combined into a single graph, averaging the cell data in each respective case to allow for easy comparison.</p><p>• Figure 5: The basis of the model for centrosome evolution in Figure 5 was based on the parameters from preceding experiments. The modeling results display high similarity with the “experimental” data. This experimental data was however used in forming the mathematical model.

Therefore, we performed a slight variation of the experiment suggested here. We used RO3306 to induce a G2 arrest. The cells were co-treated with RO3306 and DCB for 20 hrs, the drugs were then washed out, and the cells were fixed and stained after one hour. The analysis was restricted to cells with extra centrosomes, which represent cells from the parental population that already had extra centrosomes. The results from these experiments are now included in Figure 6D (formerly 7D) and show that these cells can cluster their centrosomes as efficiently as the cells with extra centrosomes in the untreated parental population. This indicates that the DCB treatment <italic>per se</italic> does not affect centrosome clustering efficiency.</p><p>We do not think that the second experiment suggested here would be informative and the results would likely be very difficult to interpret for the following reasons: in the evolved population, the remaining cells with extra centrosomes that display high efficiency of centrosome clustering are mainly tetraploid cells. If these cells were challenged again with DCB, they would produce octoploid cells with eight centrosomes. We do not expect cells to cluster eight centrosomes as efficiently as they would cluster four centrosomes. Moreover, the presence of eight sets of chromosomes may further hinder centrosome clustering. Therefore, the results of such an experiment would be extremely difficult to interpret and would likely be uninformative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1, 4: The findings were based on phase-contrast live-cell imaging of mitotic tetraploid cells where the authors explained that the reasoning for high rates of multipolar mitoses during the first 24h post DCB were due to acquiring extra centrosomes upon tetraploidization followed by the subsequent formation of multipolar spindle (subsection “Newly formed tetraploid cells undergo diverse fates in their first mitotic division”).

Some of our live-cell imaging data from the experiments presented in what was previously Figure 6 could also be used to address this point. Therefore, we have moved the data from Figure 6 to an earlier section of the manuscript. These data and the fixed-cell data are now presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. And the data are discussed in subsection “Newly formed tetraploid cells undergo diverse fates in their first mitotic division”.</p><p>We have also revised Figure 1, S1 based on the suggestion. However, we have moved the discussion of these data to a later section of the Results (subsection “Highly aneuploid cells form early in the evolution of tetraploid cells, but quickly disappear from the population”) and the figure is now Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 5: The basis of the model for centrosome evolution in Figure 5 was based on the parameters from preceding experiments.

Instead, validity of the model can be assessed by experimentally testing model assumptions and/or predictions. In our study, an important assumption of the model was that 4N cells inheriting a single centrosome would be the most likely to continue dividing in a bipolar fashion, thus maintaining a ~4N chromosome number in cells with a single centrosome. This assumption was tested in live-cell experiments, results of which are presented in Figure 6A-C (formerly Figure 7) and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. The main prediction of the model was that of the remaining cells with extra centrosomes in the evolved population, a vast majority would be represented by SC cells, which can cluster the extra centrosomes very efficiently. This prediction was tested experimentally and the results are presented in Figure 6D.</p></body></sub-article></article>
