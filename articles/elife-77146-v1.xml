Whereas a central site of action is, due to limited permeability of the blood-brain barrier for large molecules, considered to be of minor relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>), it is predominantly thought that CGRP mAb act peripherally by modulating the interaction between C-type and Aδ-type sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion and trigeminal nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edvinsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edvinsson et al., 2019</xref>), and that CGRP mAb may block CGRP responses in the dura mater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edvinsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Melo-Carrillo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Edvinsson, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our recent study in migraine patients, we demonstrated that administration of the CGRP mAb erenumab results in a diminished activation of the thalamus, the insular cortex, the periaqueductal gray, and the secondary somatosensory cortex. Only responders showed less activation in the hypothalamus whereas non-responders did not, which suggests that CGRP mAb have direct or indirect central effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ziegeler et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The mode of action may however differ between different CGRP mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ziegeler and May, 2020</xref>). We focused on this question and studied 26 migraine patients before and after administration of the CGRP mAb galcanezumab using the same event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and trigeminal nociceptive paradigm that we have used in the erenumab study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stankewitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schulte et al., 2016</xref>).

All stimuli were presented in a pseudo-randomized order, with painful trigeminal stimuli not presented in immediate succession. After each trial, participants were asked to rate the intensity as well as the unpleasantness on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 100, each of which was tested with a paired t-test if the criteria of the Gaussian distribution were fulfilled or otherwise with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Standardized headache calendars were collected at visit 1, visit 2, and in a follow-up interview by telephone and email after a total of 3 months of therapy (Figure 2A).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MRI acquisition</title><p>All images were recorded at a Siemens PRISMA 3T MR system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a 64-channel head coil.

Functional images were then smoothed using a 4 mm<sup>3</sup> full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A general linear model (GLM) analysis was used within each participant providing β-estimates which were used for group statistical analysis. These β-values were calculated for each voxel and signify the condition-specific neuronal activity. Therefore, we were using a hemodynamic response function to model all four stimulus conditions (ammonia, rose, air puff, visual) and three confound conditions (key press/assessment, attention task, anticipation phase) by convolving their onsets and durations and applying them as regressors in the GLM. For further correction of movements that were not intercepted by the realignment processing, we included the six movement regressors provided in the realign and unwarp step mentioned earlier. For physiological noise correction, we included an additional 18–20 regressors extracted from each participants’ breath and pulse signals using the approach described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deckers et al., 2006</xref>.

The ASL sequence used pulsed ASL recorded with 91 repetitions in 17 slices with a TR of 2.6 s (TE 12 ms, 90° flip angle, bolus duration 1800 ms, inversion time 700 ms, PICORE Q2T perfusion mode, voxel size 2 × 2 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>). The relative CBF maps calculated by the scanner software were co-registered to the anatomical image, warped into MNI space using the transformation calculated on the anatomical image, and smoothed using a 12 mm isotropic Gaussian kernel again using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroimaging, London, UK).

However, we asked all patients at the time of the second scan whether they felt the medication to be effective and the number of patients who answered this subjective question positively, corresponded with the 30% response at 3 months (two-tailed Pearson’s correlation, r=0.778, p&lt;0.001). To detect possible predictors of treatment outcome in the processing of trigemino-nociceptive stimuli, we used the visit 1 contrast [ammonia-air puffs]<sub>visit 1</sub> and co-varied the model with the individual response after 3 months (in % reduction of monthly headache days [MHD]) in all patients (n=26) in an one-sided, independent t-test as implemented into the SPM toolbox.

Connectivity increases with the STN were found to areas of the cerebellum, middle temporal gyrus, and insula.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our functional imaging data suggest that galcanezumab therapy is associated with a decrease of hypothalamic activation in all patients following galcanezumab therapy, which is even more decreased in responders. This is in line with our previous study in erenumab patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ziegeler et al., 2020</xref>), where responders also showed decreased hypothalamic activity in comparison to non-responders. Unlike non-responders to galcanezumab in this study, we did not find decreased hypothalamic activation in non-responders to erenumab. Since this could be due to threshold effects (i.e. erenumab also reduced hypothalamic activity but at a lower statistical threshold), we compared both studies directly in the same analysis. This comparison showed that the hypothalamic decrease following galcanezumab is indeed specific to galcanezumab as it was not present in erenumab patients. Of note, the other comparison in this medication-specific analysis showed that the general effects seen after erenumab medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ziegeler et al., 2020</xref>), that is, a decrease in activation in the thalamus, right middle temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and left operculum are specifically only found in the erenumab-treated patients and not after galcanezumab therapy. It is important to state that these findings are related to the response to a trigeminal-nociceptive stimulus, and not some general difference in brain state such as resting state changes for example.</p><p>Our findings suggest that the antibodies to the ligand and the receptor exhibit a similar modulatory change in the hypothalamic area if patients respond to treatment, whereas the general change due to administration of the medication is different and specific for each antibody type. Since the perception of nociceptive input elicited by our paradigm was not significantly different between the two sessions, neither in responders nor in non-responders or within the whole cohort, an external influence on the central processing of these stimuli can be excluded.</p><p>The hypothalamus plays a central role in migraine pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alstadhaug, 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stankewitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Overeem et al., 2022</xref>). Studies in the rhesus monkey confirmed the expression of CGRP receptors in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eftekhari et al., 2016</xref>). However, a direct effect of monoclonal CGRP antibodies in the central nervous system in these areas is unlikely, because the blood-brain barrier is relatively impermeable to substances of this large molecular mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Noseda et al., 2020</xref>). However, the hypothalamus, and indeed the entire central nervous system, is subject to cyclic changes in CGRP concentrations in migraine patients which has been shown in cubital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greco et al., 2020</xref>) and also plasma cranial venous blood analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goadsby et al., 1990</xref>). Since small amounts of CGRP can cross the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>), one could argue that central nervous (hypothalamic) receptors are subsequently stimulated by increased cranial CGRP levels during a migraine attack. Systemic administration of galcanezumab binds free circulating CGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kielbasa and Helton, 2019</xref>) and this modulates the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier from the periphery to the cerebrospinal fluid compartment. Assuming intra- and extrathecal CGRP concentrations pursue an equilibrium or equal concentration gradients, such a decrease in functional CGRP due to antibodies could subsequently lead to reduced CGRP-mediated activation of hypothalamic and other brain areas that express CGRP receptors. This would account for the reduction of hypothalamic activity in all subjects as well as in the responder vs. non-responder comparison. Of note, studies showing an elevated CGRP level in migraine attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goadsby et al., 1990</xref>) have to be seen in the light of studies showing that administration of CGRP may trigger migraine-like attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>) but is in itself not painful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghar et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the elevation of CGRP levels in migraine attacks may be a consequence and not the primary trigger of the attack. That being said, erenumab elicits other modes of action (e.g. intracellular) than just blocking or inactivating the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhakta et al., 2021</xref>). This could explain why we see different central responses to erenumab and galcanezumab, and it could also explain why some non-responders to CGRP-Ab (erenumab or galcanezumab) may indeed have a better response by switching to the other antibody class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ziegeler and May, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that certain areas of the central nervous system like the area postrema or the hypothalamus are not completely protected by the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eftekhari et al., 2016</xref>), one could also argue that the antibodies could still reach the hypothalamus even with intact blood-brain barrier in a very small but effective amount. This could be different for the antibody type and thus could explain why we see different central responses to erenumab and galcanezumab, and it could also explain why some non-responders to CGRP-Ab (erenumab or galcanezumab) may indeed have a better response by switching to the other antibody class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ziegeler and May, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We also found that the STN, which plays a central role in the ascending trigemino-nociceptive pathway, co-varies in its activity already at visit 1 with the response, that is, the efficacy to galcanezumab. In other words, the higher the STN activity to nociceptive stimuli before administration of the drug, the more likely that galcanezumab is effective. One could argue that a sensitization of the STN might be the missing link why some patients benefit from anti-CGRP therapy, others do not. The STN exhibits a particularly high density of CGRP due to termination of afferents from the trigeminal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eftekhari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eftekhari and Edvinsson, 2011</xref>). Recent findings on molecular brainstem and trigeminal ganglion mechanisms suggest that presynaptic CGRP-evoked intracellular mechanisms may lead to a possibly long-term modulation of signaling cascades, which in their consequence could lead to a facilitation and strengthening of (trigeminal) nociceptive transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Messlinger, 2018</xref>). However, we did not investigate sensitization levels or allodynia in our patients and explanations for this correlation between STN activity and treatment response stays speculative at the moment. It is interesting, however, that we found that galcanezumab also decreased the well-known functional connection between the STN and the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schulte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schulte and May, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schulte et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggest that, in addition to peripheral mechanisms, the combination of decreased hypothalamic activity and a simultaneous decrease of the hypothalamic-brainstem connectivity is needed for CGRP antibodies to be effective. The question of whether this is the cause or consequence of blocking the CGRP ligand cannot be answered with our study.</p><p>Some limitations of this study have to be discussed: The number of patients (n=26) in this longitudinal design is difficult to achieve but allows only small subgroups (such as responder/non-responder). We note that the groups were big enough to find meaningful differences between groups and moreover, these findings confirmed our preregistered a priori hypothesis. One could ask the question why we defined treatment response of 30%, rather than 50%. We followed the IHS (International Headache Society) efficacy parameter ‘attack frequency’ although most of our patients reported a marked effect of attack severity rather than frequency reduction. In clinical practice, this means that many patients who show significant improvement in quality of life and reduction in acute medication consumption, and are therefore responders, may still have nominally a high migraine attack frequency. Therefore, because of the methodology used, the observations of this study in terms of responders may be limited to patients who are frequency responders. One could argue that only in frequency responders the hypothalamus is effectively targeted using mAbs and not in severity responders. Unfortunately, given the small group sizes of intensity vs. frequency responders, a subgroup analysis in this regard was not possible, which would have been necessary to answer this question directly.</p><p>We also note that, following national guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diener et al., 2020</xref>), patients receiving mAbs must have demonstrated an unsuccessful treatment effect of a least four different other preventatives and are so-called severe treatment non-responders. Both facts prompted us to focus on a 30% frequency reduction from baseline, which is sufficient to demonstrate robust differences between groups.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>HB received consulting fees from Novartis and Teva.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor.

Also it would be very helpful to elaborate on the interesting distinction between the effect of galcanezumab and erenumab.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper reports a well conducted, carefully analyzed data set with important implications for understanding migraine therapeutics. My comments are modest and advisory.</p><p>A. The Introduction states CGRP mABs are impermeable with regard to the blood-brain barrier. An article is cited that, consistent with what is known, shows their permeability is limited not zero (1). The authors could consider recasting the sentence in line with the citation.</p><p>B. Not all responders to galcanezumab will do so in the first two weeks (2); would this have blunted the responder/non-responder comparison at the two week point? Could it be argued that a longer study time might be considered going forward?</p><p>C. The authors cite six papers for the Method; perhaps one or two would be sufficient?</p><p>D. Given the highly personalized nature of pain, it could be argued that VAS scales by virtue of the underlying biological variability between patients, are poor candidates for being treated as more than within subject ordinal measures? It could be argued that the Wilcoxon test is preferable as has been mentioned by the authors.</p><p>E. Given response rates to galcanezumab vary by frequency of migraine days, as evidenced by headline responses in episodic (3, 4) and chronic migraine (5), did migraine day frequency effect outcomes? Tables one might usefully offer the frequency data for both the episodic and chronic migraine groups.</p><p>F. Regarding concomitant preventives, it is a practical limitation of studies that stopping preventives can be problematic. If the patients taking concomitant preventives with established efficacy in migraine are excluded, and not all those listed un characteristics would fulfill that criterion, does this alter the outcome?</p><p>G. It would be generally accepted that a 30% reduction in migraine days in episodic migraine is a modest effect; if a 50% reduction had been used as the binary response outcome for all participants, would the result be different? The authors very sensibly point out the severity change argument in the limitations section. It could be argued that applying the 50% rule might sharpen the differences.</p><p>References</p><p>1.

These drugs likely do not gain substantial access to the CNS given their size, yet they show efficacy for a neurological disorder that has numerous aspects mediated by the CNS. Thus, the exact mechanism by which they treat migraine is not clear. This group performed a similar study recently using a distinct CGRP antibody that binds to the receptor (erenumab) and the current study extends this work using a CGRP antibody that binds to the peptide (galcanezumab). Using fMRI in 26 migraine patients, the authors performed scans to assess brain activity following nasal administration of ammonia, rose odor, or visual checkerboard stimulation both prior to and three weeks following galcanezumab treatment. Unpleasantness ratings were collected and headache diaries were compiled for each patient, including efficacy of the drug for migraine attacks during the study. Approximately 70% of the patients reported efficacy of galcanezumab for migraine attacks and were defined as responders to the drug. Despite efficacy for headache in the majority of subjects, there were no differences in intensity or unpleasantness ratings for any of the stimuli following drug treatment compared to prior. In contrast, galcanezumab treatment decreased trigeminal stimuli-mediated activation of a number of CNS regions, including the hypothalamus, in all subjects. The regions where stimulated activation were reduced by galcanezumab showed distinct patterns when broken down by responder vs non-responder groups with respect to drug efficacy for migraine attacks. Additionally, when the new data with galcanezumab were compared with prior data generated using erenumab, distinct drug-induced changes in activation patterns were observed. Finally, there was a highly co-variant relationship between the effect of galcanezumab on trigeminal stimulation mediated activation patterns and headache efficacy for responses within the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) and functional connectivity of the STN. This latter finding was the basis of a conclusion by the authors that response patterns in the STN could be predictive and/or required for galcanezumab efficacy for migraine. In general, the studies add to the understanding of how CGRP monoclonal antibodies influence CNS responses to painful stimuli.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the conclusions are supported by the data. There were some questions and comments identified related to the study.</p><p>1. The authors suggest in the discussion that galcanezumab binding to peripheral CGRP could subsequently influence the circulating levels of CGRP and as a result, modulate its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and modulate hypothalamic function. While this is true for galcanezumab, this is unlikely to be true for erenumab since it binds the receptor. Is it possible that these types of differences are responsible for the distinct patterns of effects observed when comparing the two antibodies? The authors discuss other possible explanations in the paper (starting at line 344) but this.</p><p>2. Given that effects of gancanezumab were observed in the hypothalamus, and the hypothalamus has areas not protected by the blood brain barrier, could the observed effects on this region be due to direct access of drug to this CNS region? It might be helpful to discuss the specific regions of the hypothalamus not protected by the BBB and whether these could contribute to the observed effects. This was included in the prior erenumab paper but would be helpful to discuss here.</p><p>3. The prior erenumab study included 81% females while the current study is 96% female. While not a major difference, do the authors expect this has any influence on the findings of the two studies?</p><p>4. It might be helpful to include more detail on the information collected in the headache calendars. This may help readers assess the level of attention subjects paid to the qualities of their migraines across the 3 months. Since this study uses drug efficacy as a method to segregate patients responses to trigeminal stimulation, and efficacy was entirely subjective on the part of the subjects, it seems helpful to have more detail on what was asked of the patients between study visits.</p><p>The current work is quite similar to the prior study by these same authors using erenumab. It would help increase the impact for <italic>eLife</italic> if the authors could provide more information (or data) that clarifies what the major advance is in this work over the prior work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is now well established that CGRP plays a fundamental role in migraine, and therapies targeting CGRP can be highly effective in reducing frequency and severity of migraine. However, multiple aspects of the specific mechanisms of CGRP in migraine remain poorly understood. Ongoing questions include: What triggers the release of CGRP that is involved in migraine? Where does migraine-related CGRP release occur, and where does CGRP binding mediate migraine-related effects? Are the therapeutic effects of CGRP-targeted treatments mediated primarily by the peripheral or central nervous system, or both?</p><p>The current study aims to shed light on the potential therapeutic mechanisms of CGRP-targeted treatments by using fMRI to examine changes in brain activity and connectivity before and after treatment with galcanezumab. These results are compared with a previous similar study of erenumab. The results clearly show central effects of the antibodies, notably in the hypothalamus, and a comparison of the two treatments suggests that there are distinctive patterns of reduction in brain activity resulting from each of the two therapies. The results also show that activation of the spinal trigeminal nucleus by noxious stimulation is correlated with the response to therapy. The results are an important description of the brain effects CGRP-targeted antibodies. Although it is widely presumed that because of their size these antibodies must be working peripherally, the studies do not rule out the possibility that they could be acting in brain regions (like the hypothalamus) that are outside of the blood brain barrier. Although the present study does not definitively answer the question regarding the site(s) of action of the CGRP-targeted therapies, it provides key information about central effects that will enable future studies to address this question. In addition, it identifies patterns of brain activity that could at some point become &quot;biomarkers&quot; of treatment response.</p><p>The imaging studies are of high quality, and the experimental design importantly enables within-subject comparison before and after treatment.</p><p>There are, however, some sources of variability that require consideration in the interpretation of the results, and some interesting findings that warrant further discussion.</p><p>1. The study includes both episodic and chronic migraine patients who are on a variety of different medications. In order to reduce potential migraine phase-related variability, a subgroup of subjects who had either headache or non headache on scan days both pre and post treatment. As it turned out , 14/15 of the phase-consistent patients were scanned on a headache day pre- and post-treatment with galcanezumab, while only 1 was scanned on non-headache days. The fact that nearly all patients were scanned on headache days vs. non-headache days could have important effects on the results. It is also unclear how many of the phase-consistent patients had chronic migraine vs. episodic migraine, which could be another important contributing variable.</p><p>2. The responder rates for both the current galcanezumab study and the previously reported erenumab study that is used for comparison are significantly less than those reported in the clinical trials of these therapies. This suggests that the subjects examined in these studies may be different from the general clinical trial population.</p><p>3. The authors report that there was no difference in headache severity on the day of the scan pre- and post- treatment, despite reductions in brain activation in different regions, particularly in those who responded to treatment with reduced attack severity. This suggests that the reduction in brain activation is not correlated with attack severity, in contrast to the correlation with attack frequency.</p><p>4. The unpleasantness perception in response to trigeminal nociceptive stimulation apparently did not change after treatment despite reductions in the brain responses seen with fMRI. Here again there is a dissociation between the acute clinical response and the changes in brain activity.</p><p>5. Regarding the comparison of the erenumab data vs. the galcanezumab data, there is some concern regarding the comparison of these two groups. Although the demographics of the groups are generally similar, it is not clear how many of the phase-consistent scans in the erenumab study were performed on headache days vs. non-headache days, and how many were in chronic vs. episodic migraine patients. These details would be important to know in considering whether the comparison between the two groups is feasible.</p><p>6. Since the subjects were primarily women, another potential source of variability is the menstrual cycle. Is there any indication that this could be an issue regarding the interpretation of the data?</p><p>7. Regarding the conclusions, the authors should acknowledge the possibility that the antibodies could be acting directly in the hypothalamus, parts of which may be outside of the blood brain barrier. Some brain areas including the hypothalamus have been shown to express CGRP receptors.

It would be helpful to have a greater description in the figure legends for the results tables or elsewhere regarding what each of the values mean and how they were calculated.

For this reason we took the subjective assessment of the participants after 3 weeks as well as the headache calendar after a total of 3 months of therapy into account. This interval is also specified in the German guideline on CGRP therapy for migraine (p. 6 line 16f. and p. 10 line 7).

Given the highly personalized nature of pain, it could be argued that VAS scales by virtue of the underlying biological variability between patients, are poor candidates for being treated as more than within subject ordinal measures? It could be argued that the Wilcoxon test is preferable as has been mentioned by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree. We changed the wording accordingly. Indeed we used a NRS (anchored at 0 – 100). NRS should be treated as a continuous variable and we therefore used paired t-tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E. Given response rates to galcanezumab vary by frequency of migraine days, as evidenced by headline responses in episodic (3, 4) and chronic migraine (5), did migraine day frequency effect outcomes? Tables one might usefully offer the frequency data for both the episodic and chronic migraine groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted sub-analyses of the functional imaging data as well as the analyses mentioned in the manuscript with the diagnosis (episodic vs. chronic) as a covariate. No significant influence by migraine diagnosis could be found.

Regarding concomitant preventives, it is a practical limitation of studies that stopping preventives can be problematic. If the patients taking concomitant preventives with established efficacy in migraine are excluded, and not all those listed un characteristics would fulfill that criterion, does this alter the outcome?</p></disp-quote><p>Concomitant preventives may well influence the results, especially when there is any change (including dosage) between T0 and T1. For this reason, concomitant preventives are only allowed where the kind and the dosage of any medication have remained unchanged starting 3 months before and throughout the entire study period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G. It would be generally accepted that a 30% reduction in migraine days in episodic migraine is a modest effect; if a 50% reduction had been used as the binary response outcome for all participants, would the result be different? The authors very sensibly point out the severity change argument in the limitations section. It could be argued that applying the 50% rule might sharpen the differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer on this point. We therefore also carried out this analysis with 50% responders although not many patients qualified, and found the same result at a less stringent (explorative) significance level (p. 14 line 15f.) because of lower patient numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References</p><p>1.

There were some questions and comments identified related to the study.</p><p>1. The authors suggest in the discussion that galcanezumab binding to peripheral CGRP could subsequently influence the circulating levels of CGRP and as a result, modulate its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and modulate hypothalamic function. While this is true for galcanezumab, this is unlikely to be true for erenumab since it binds the receptor. Is it possible that these types of differences are responsible for the distinct patterns of effects observed when comparing the two antibodies? The authors discuss other possible explanations in the paper (starting at line 344) but this.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is exactly right. We have discussed this issue. Relevant discussion is highlighted in in the text (see page 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given that effects of gancanezumab were observed in the hypothalamus, and the hypothalamus has areas not protected by the blood brain barrier, could the observed effects on this region be due to direct access of drug to this CNS region? It might be helpful to discuss the specific regions of the hypothalamus not protected by the BBB and whether these could contribute to the observed effects. This was included in the prior erenumab paper but would be helpful to discuss here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now included this line of thought into the discussion (page 17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The prior erenumab study included 81% females while the current study is 96% female. While not a major difference, do the authors expect this has any influence on the findings of the two studies?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree that sex hormones play a great role. The difference between the 2 studies (3 males) is however too small to explain the difference in imaging results. Nevertheless, following your suggestion we also carried out a sub-analysis in this regard with only the female study participants and found the same result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It might be helpful to include more detail on the information collected in the headache calendars. This may help readers assess the level of attention subjects paid to the qualities of their migraines across the 3 months. Since this study uses drug efficacy as a method to segregate patients responses to trigeminal stimulation, and efficacy was entirely subjective on the part of the subjects, it seems helpful to have more detail on what was asked of the patients between study visits.</p></disp-quote><p>The classification of the responder group and non-responder group was made after an interval of 3 months with the help of a standardised headache calendar (p. 6 line 16- https://www.dmkg.de/files/Kopfschmerzkalender_PDF/Kopfschmerzkalender_ENGLISCH_18.3.2021.pdf).

Different from erenumab, which targets the CGRP receptor, galcanezumab directly targets the peptide itself. For this reason, we additionally analysed the raw data from both studies (i.e. did not just take analysed data from a historical patient group), and such direct comparisons are therefore in a strong position to point out differences and similarities between the ligand and the receptor antibody on central pain modulation in migraine patients. We additionally and for the first time show that the STN, which plays a central role in the ascending trigemino-nociceptive pathway, co-varies in its activity already at visit 1 with the response, i.e. the efficacy to galcanezumab. These data are new and demonstrate, using functional imaging, a predictor for clinical efficacy of galcanezumab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The imaging studies are of high quality, and the experimental design importantly enables within-subject comparison before and after treatment.</p><p>There are, however, some sources of variability that require consideration in the interpretation of the results, and some interesting findings that warrant further discussion.</p><p>1.

The participants fulfilled the official criteria for CGRP therapy according to the German guideline. This guideline requires that all oral prophylactics have already been tried unsuccessfully, and, in case of chronic migraine patients, have also failed botulinum toxin treatment. Thus, the patients included here formally correspond to a patient group that is difficult to treat (p. 13 line 4). We would argue that the principles of mechanism how the respective antibodies exert their effect (in this case centrally) are however the same in treatment naïve and non-responding patients. We agree that this needs to be investigated in future studies to give a valid answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
