changes in neural activity are implemented at a network level to improve performance. Here we investigate how differences in experience impact brain circuitry and behavior in larval zebrafish prey capture. We find that experience of live prey compared to inert food increases capture success by boosting capture initiation. In response to live prey, animals with and without prior experience of live prey show activity in visual areas (pretectum and optic tectum) and motor areas (cerebellum and hindbrain), with similar visual area retinotopic maps of prey position. However, prey-experienced animals more readily initiate capture in response to visual area activity and have greater visually-evoked activity in two forebrain areas: the telencephalon and habenula. Consequently, disruption of habenular neurons reduces capture performance in prey-experienced fish. Together, our results suggest that experience of prey strengthens prey-associated visual drive to the forebrain, and that this lowers the threshold for prey-associated visual activity to trigger activity in motor areas, thereby improving capture performance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>prey capture</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>experience</kwd><kwd>forebrain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N66001-17-C-4015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallant</surname><given-names>Jack L</given-names></name><name><surname>Isacoff</surname><given-names>Ehud Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2PN2EY018241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isacoff</surname><given-names>Ehud Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>ERC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#311673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyart</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>postdoctoral fellowship (# ALTF 549–2013)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prendergast</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oldfield</surname><given-names>Claire S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Embassy of France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chateaubriand graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oldfield</surname><given-names>Claire S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experience strengthens hunting in larval zebrafish by recruiting the forebrain to increase the prey-evoked activity in visual areas and trigger motor activity and prey capture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To transform sensory input into an optimal behavioral response, animals must extract relevant perceptual information from their environment, interpret it within their internal and external contexts, and translate it into a motor output. Prior experience modulates how this transformation occurs and whether the response is successful. A large body of work has studied how enriching or depriving sensory experience affects perceptual encoding, with both morphological and molecular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feldman, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, teaching an animal to fear or expect a stimulus alters properties of the circuits recruited in response to the cue (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>). Most studies of experience-dependent changes rely on drastic manipulation such as depriving animals of all sensory input in one modality, inducing fear association with a noxious stimulus, or depriving animals of food or water to achieve sufficient motivation to assure a response. However, neurons respond differently to ethologically-relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Felsen and Dan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Theunissen and Elie, 2014</xref>), and the question of how natural experience influences brain activity and downstream native behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sommerfeld and Holzman, 2019</xref>) is becoming increasingly relevant.</p><p>One of the most critical native behaviors for survival in carnivores and omnivores is hunting for food. In many species, the basic hunting sequence is innate and triggered in full by certain sensory cues. For example, predation can be evoked in toads and fish by the sight of small prey-like moving objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ewert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matsunaga and Watanabe, 2012</xref>) and in barn owls by ruffling prey-like noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Payne, 1971</xref>). The accomplishment of this goal-directed behavior is highly flexible and is modulated by experience in animals as phylogenetically distant as mammals (the Etruscan shrew relies on tactile experience to develop efficient predation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anjum and Brecht, 2012</xref>) and mollusks (<italic>Limax</italic> learn to avoid a food if it makes them sick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elliott, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigated how experience-dependent circuit plasticity is implemented. We took advantage of the transparency of larval zebrafish and its ability to initiate prey capture when semi-immobilized, thereby making it possible to simultaneously image behavior and neural activity across a large portion of the brain. In zebrafish larvae, prey-capture behavior is already evident at five days post-fertilization (dpf). At this stage, zebrafish respond to prey, such as paramecia, in a highly stereotyped manner: when the prey is in sight, the fish reorients its body towards it with a series of unilateral tail flicks (J-Bends) and forward swims until the fish reaches a proximal striking zone; it then darts forward to engulf the prey in a final capture swim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McElligott and O’Malley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McClenahan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mearns et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, the onset of this sequence is characterized by gradual eye convergence as the fish gets closer to the prey. The resulting increase of visual field area covered by binocular vision has been suggested to improve depth perception needed for precise targeting of the prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>). Restrained fish presented with virtual prey on a screen (a moving dot) also respond with eye convergences and tail flicks, indicating that visual inputs are sufficient to initiate the preycapture sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Prey capture in larval zebrafish has emerged as a model for understanding how sensory information translates into motor action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gahtan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fajardo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muto and Kawakami, 2013</xref>). Visual information about prey location flows from the retina to two contralateral visual areas: the pretectum and optic tectum (OT). The pretectal area around the 7<sup>th</sup> arborization field of retinal ganglion cells (AF7, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burrill and Easter, 1994</xref>) was shown to be critical for detecting prey-like objects and triggering the prey capture sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antinucci et al., 2019</xref>). Ablation and optogenetic studies indicate that the OT is necessary for prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gahtan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>). Assemblies of medial peri-ventricular neurons in the OT activate prior to eye convergence, suggesting a role in inducing the motor response to the sight of prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, novel results have shown that the nucleus isthmi, a small cholinergic area in the cerebellum, is necessary for maintenance of a hunting routine, but not for initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>). Despite recent progress, the mechanism for integration of information from pretectum and OT, and the precise activation sequence downstream of visual areas, are yet to be discovered. Moreover, it is not known whether prey capture improves with experience, and if so, how improvement might be implemented at the neural level.</p><p>Here we show that experience of live prey increases capture initiation and success in natural conditions. We investigate the brain activity elicited by prey and identify sequential activity in visual areas (pretectum and optic tectum), and motor-related areas cerebellum and hindbrain. We find that prior experience of prey increases the reliability of capture initiation in response to prey-associated visual activity. In prey-naïve and prey-experienced animals, information flow from the pretectum onto the cerebellum and hindbrain correlate with preycapture initiation. However, experience of prey increases the impact of these functional links on preycapture initiation and strengthens the coupling from visual areas to the telencephalon. In agreement with this latter point, prey-experienced animals show increased activation of the forebrain (both telencephalon and habenula) during preycapture initiation. Consistently, we show that ablation of the habenula reduces hunting in prey-experienced animals. Taken together, our findings show that prey-capture behavior is enhanced by prior experience of live prey and suggest that forebrain recruitment increases output gain for the prey-capture circuit in response to the same visual cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prior experience of prey increases preycapture initiation in larval zebrafish</title><p>To assess the effect of experience on preycapture behavior and the underlying neural activity, we compared two groups of sibling zebrafish larvae. Prior to being tested with paramecia at 7 dpf, a first group was fed live paramecia for two days (5 and 6 dpf), whereas a second group was fed inert food flakes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While each group may acquire feeding experience for the food on which it was ‘trained,’ only the first group obtained experience of live prey, on which both groups were later tested.

We found that experienced fish have significantly more pursuits and successful captures than their naïve counterparts, but the same probability of attempting a capture once a pursuit was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Experience did not change the probability of success once a capture was attempted. This analysis suggests that experience increases initiation of prey capture, but not motor performance of the capture.</p><p>We next examined prey capture in a virtual environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>) in prey-experienced or prey-naïve fish. We presented a single moving dot of varying contrast to a fish immobilized in agar with eyes and tail free (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We focused on initiation of prey capture by examining frequency of eye convergences, as described above. We quantified performance using the discriminability index, d’, calculated from response rates to a stimulus <italic>versus</italic> the absence of a stimulus (see Materials and methods, Behavioral data analysis and statistics). We found that at higher contrast, prey-experienced fish responded significantly more than prey-naïve fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). This indicates that response to ‘virtual prey’ is substantially enhanced by prior experience of live prey, even though the virtual prey is a black dot moving steadily and unidirectionally on a white screen, whereas paramecia are translucent and swim erratically in three dimensions.</p><p>If differences in diet (live paramecia <italic>versus</italic> inert flakes) affected fish health, there could be an effect on prey capture performance. To address this concern, we carefully examined numerous indices of fish health. We found that fish length, spontaneous swimming velocity, and swimming velocity in the presence of prey did not differ between the two groups of fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, swim distance and rest times between swims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), as well as rates of baseline tail flicks, eye saccades and eye convergences in the virtual environment did not differ between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results indicate that differences in diet between the two groups of fish did not affect health, and that the improved capture of paramecia results from prior experience of prey.</p><p>A difference in prey capture for experienced and naïve fish could also emerge if there was a difference in hunger or motivation to hunt. To disentangle the effect of experience on feeding from hunger, we performed a flake feeding assay. We fed sibling fish either paramecia or flakes on day 5 and 6 dpf ad libitum, and then starved the fish overnight, as in our usual protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On day seven, we let fish feed on flakes for 10 min. We assessed the number of eye convergences during that time as a proxy for the motivation to hunt. We observed a significantly higher number of eye convergences in response to the flakes in previously flakes-fed fish, suggesting that flake-fed fish are no less hungry/motivated and that the experience with flakes boosts flake ‘hunting’ in the same way as experience with paramecia boosts paramecia hunting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spatio-temporal brain activity pattern associated with prey- capture initiation</title><p>To understand the neuronal basis of the boost in prey capture initiation in prey-experienced fish, we imaged neuronal activity in the form of calcium transients in <italic>Tg(NeuroD:GCaMP6f)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rupprecht et al., 2016</xref>) transgenic zebrafish, which expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f broadly in the central nervous system. Imaging was performed in 7 and 8 dpf fish which were semi-immobilized in agar but with eyes and tail free, similar to the assay with virtual prey above.

We then added a single paramecium to a well in front of the fish and recorded for 11 additional minutes. We focused on brain activity associated with both spontaneous and prey-evoked eye convergence events, time-locked to the moment of strongest ocular vergence. In prey-experienced fish these events showed strong activation of visual areas ( pretectum and OT) and motor-related areas (cerebellum and hindbrain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>), areas that have been shown before to play roles in swim behavior and prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antinucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>). The spatio-temporal patterns of spontaneous and evoked activity were similar, except that activity was more asymmetric in the pretectum and tectal neuropil in presence of prey (i.e. more strongly activated contralateral to the paramecium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in agreement with a moving stimulus being present in one hemifield and not the other.</p><p>We observed responses in AF7 in the pretectum and in the rostral neuropil and periventricular neurons of the OT (output neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scott, 2009</xref>), but not in the caudal neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Regionalization of activity in the tectal neuropil is consistent with prey capture initiation occurring when the paramecium is in front of the fish, because, under these conditions, the prey is in the nasal visual field, and nasal retinal ganglion cells project to the rostral optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karlstrom et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Prey-naïve fish also responded to the sight of prey with eye convergences and tail flicks, albeit at a lower frequency than prey-experienced fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Traditionally, visual responses are evaluated by repeatedly showing identical virtual stimuli, pooling trials and determining if responses in a given region of interest are reliable enough for it to be deemed ‘visually-responsive’. However, natural stimuli have a more complex statistical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001</xref>), and are thought to evoke more ethologically-relevant behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore used natural visual input by presenting the fish with its biological prey, a live paramecium. Since locomotion of the paramecium is not experimentally-controlled, we faced the analytic challenge of dealing with irregular visual stimulation. To address this, we applied a method developed for building predictive encoding models of human brain activity elicited by natural scenes or language, and detected by neurophysiology and functional magnetic resonance imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nishimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huth et al., 2016</xref>). We used regularized regression to construct a separate encoding model for each pixel that predicts the pixel’s fluorescence time series based on the location of the prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). To validate the encoding models, we predicted fluorescence time series on held-out segments of the dataset that were not used for model estimation, and then computed the correlation between predicted and actual time series in this held-out set.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Experience does not affect prey-associated activity in visual areas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, schematic of prey location relative to the fish in polar coordinates (angle α, radius r).

To address this, we applied Granger-causality analysis, a method for determining if a time series of events predicts (or Granger-‘causes’) a second time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Friston, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Granger, 1969</xref>).

It should be pointed out, that the Granger-causality calculation relies on calcium activity dynamics captured at 3.6 Hz but elicited by action potentials that occur on a much faster time scale (although bursts of action potentials may occur over time scales that more closely resemble calcium dynamics).

The anatomical basis for this functional connection needs further investigation. Interestingly, prey-experienced fish did not differ statistically from prey-naïve fish in connectivity strength in visual areas during either spontaneous activity or in presence of prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Together, these results suggest first, an important role of the pretectum and its connectivity to downstream visual and motor-related areas in determining frequency of prey-capture initiation, and second, a possible implication of information flow from tectal PVN to telencephalon in mediating the effect of experience of live prey on subsequent initiation frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Experience of live prey increases the probability of transitioning from sight of prey to capture initiation</title><p>Having observed an augmented drive from tectal PVNs to telencephalon in prey-experienced fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and from pretectum to downstream brain areas in strong hunters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), we asked how experience of prey affects the relationship between these connectivity patterns and prey capture initiation frequency. For both prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish, we found a linear relationship between eye convergence frequency and dynamical drive from pretectum to tectal neuropil, tectal PVNs, cerebellum and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>).

However, there was no significant relationship with interaction strength from tectal PVNs to telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Ci–Ei</xref>). Comparing prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish, we found a significant interaction between experience of live prey and statistical causal strength in predicting prey capture initiation for links from pretectum to cerebellum and hindbrain (3- to 4-fold increase in slope for prey-experienced fish), and tectal PVNs (2-fold increase in slope) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). For example, for a given level of pretectum drive to cerebellum, eye convergence frequency was higher in prey-experienced fish <italic>versus</italic> prey-naïve fish, suggesting the system is sensitized and more likely to trigger a capture. These results suggest that experience of live prey increases likelihood of triggering capture initiation for a given level of information flow from pretectum to downstream areas.</p><p>Our observations of prey-evoked activity suggest the forebrain may play a role in prey capture since the telencephalon and habenula are activated during eye convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and the directed interaction from tectal PVNs to telencephalon is significantly stronger in prey-experienced fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>).

As expected, in both prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish, activity in the cerebellum and hindbrain was only detected when there was a tail flick and eye convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). In contrast, pretectal activation was high in both eye convergence and pretectum-only events, although it lasted longer during eye convergence events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

NTR transforms the innocuous antibiotic metronidazole (MTZ) into a toxic metabolite, resulting in death of expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pisharath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Prey capture is generally thought to be an innate behavior in zebrafish because larvae are capable of capturing prey as early as their first attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McElligott and O’Malley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McClenahan et al., 2012</xref>). We compared hunting of paramecia between zebrafish larvae with two days of experience of live prey and sibling fish with experience of inert dry food, which are exposed to paramecia for the first time. We found that prior experience of live prey increases the frequency of successful captures, indicating that ‘practice’ improves performance of this innate behavior. This improvement can be measured both in freely swimming fish as well as when fish are semi-immobilized for imaging and observing a live prey. Moreover, we find that experience of paramecia generalizes, increasing responsiveness to a virtual prey, even though this small black dot moving at uniform speed on a screen is quite distinct from the erratic 3D movement patterns of a translucent paramecium. While dependence of virtual prey capture on experience of live prey has not been explicitly described previously, we note that studies on prey capture in a virtual environment consistently report feeding the fish paramecia prior to testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henriques et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, experience of live prey may contribute to the ontogeny of prey capture behavior, where older (and therefore more ‘experienced’) fish have more fluid capture maneuvers and hunt prey from a wider angular range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Westphal and O'Malley, 2013</xref>). Our finding is consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lagogiannis et al., 2019</xref>), which showed that differences in hunting kinematics result in higher hunting efficiency in experienced fish.</p><p>Genetically encoded circuits extract information relevant to predation at multiple levels of the visual processing stream. Different groups of retinal ganglion cells and optic tectum neurons respond preferentially to small prey-like objects, or looming predator-like objects in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Preuss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Temizer et al., 2015</xref>), and frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ewert et al., 2001</xref>), similarly to small target motion detector neurons in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barnett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wiederman et al., 2013</xref>). This information is relayed in the tectum, whose optogenetic activation has been shown to trigger the prey capture motor response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fajardo et al., 2013</xref>). Further, recent results have shown that stimulation of single neurons in the pretectum can trigger the hunting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antinucci et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the prey capture circuit is hard-wired in the novice hunter’s brain. Nonetheless, experience of live prey may shape the circuit as shown in this work and the work mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lagogiannis et al., 2019</xref>), and as it appears to do in juvenile fish raised in the dark who learn to forage using their lateral line system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carrillo and McHenry, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Activation of visual areas during prey observation and capture initiation</title><p>Our behavioral analysis showed an increase in pre -capture initiation and successful captures in prey-experienced fish. This observation led us to test whether experience of live prey (vs. experience of dry inert food) enhances the early step of prey visualization or a later step of ‘decision to pursue’. To distinguish between these possibilities, we imaged neural activity in semi-immobilized prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish in response to a live prey. Regression analysis of calcium signals revealed retinotopic maps that encode prey position in the pretectum and optic tectum. Previous findings show that spontaneous activity in the optic tectum changes with development and visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avitan et al., 2017</xref>). We observed no difference in maps between prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish, suggesting that neural encoding of prior experience of prey lies in a step subsequent to visualization of prey.</p><p>We examined brain activity around eye convergences, the hallmark of prey capture initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with an earlier finding that AF7 responds specifically to prey-like objects and is important for mediating the capture response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>), we observed that activation of pretectal neurons, likely surrounding AF7, consistently preceded eye convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also found that activation of the tectal neuropil and PVNs preceded eye convergence, consistent with previous observations showing that optic tectum function is necessary for prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gahtan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smear et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>), and that assemblies of tectal neurons activate specifically when an eye convergence occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>). The amplitude and timing of activity observed in visual areas in the presence of prey was similar in prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish whether it elicited an eye convergence or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, neither the mapping of prey-evoked activity in visual areas nor strength or timing of visual responses appeared to be altered by experience of live prey (vs. experience of dry inert food). We therefore turned to an analysis of motor-related areas inducing prey capture initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Circuit activation during prey capture initiation</title><p>When fish initiate a prey capture sequence, they converge their eyes and flick their tail in a characteristic J-bend. Consistent with this, prey capture initiation events were associated with activation of the cerebellum and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similar to mammals, the teleost cerebellum is compartmentalized into the vestibulo-cerebellar and the non-vestibulo-cerebellar systems that control balance and locomotion respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Volkmann et al., 2008</xref>), which likely play a role in the outcome of a capture sequence. To understand how information flows from visual areas to these motor-related areas, we used Granger-causality analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seth et al., 2015</xref>). We established that the strength of apparent directed information flow from pretectum to optic tectum, cerebellum, and hindbrain were significantly correlated with how frequently a fish initiated a hunting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). This relationship could reflect a role in triggering the motor response to the sight of prey or a change in proprioceptive feedback due to movement. A reason for favoring the former interpretation is that proprioception would be expected to be the same in prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish during an eye convergence event. Instead we observe a difference in slope of directed coupling strength relative to eye convergence frequency for information flow from pretectum to tectal PVN, from pretectum to cerebellum, and from pretectum to hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). For a statistical link with a given strength from the pretectum to motor-related areas, fish with prior experience of live prey initiate prey captures more frequently than those with prior experience of dry inert food. Our results suggest that prior experience of prey increases the gain of information flow from the pretectum to motor-related areas, making a pretectum event more likely to trigger a prey capture response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Forebrain recruitment and the experience-dependent boost in prey-capture initiation</title><p>Wide-field brain activity imaging showed that prey-experienced fish had greater activity in the telencephalon and habenula when visual activity is followed by eye convergence relative to their prey-naïve siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Statistical causality analysis suggested that prior experience of prey increases information flow from tectal PVNs to the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting a role for this connection in improved prey capture performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest forebrain regions activated by the visual system’s response to prey may play a role in setting the gain of information flow through the prey capture circuit, with prior experience of prey sharpening the contrast between visual events that do or do not trigger capture behavior.</p><p>Since the above observations were correlative, we endeavored to perform a causal test of the role of the forebrain in prey capture. To do this, we turned to targeted chemical ablation using nitroreductase in combination with metronidazole. We targeted the habenula for three reasons: availability of a habenula-specific Gal4 driver line, the fact that the habenulae receives considerable anatomical input from the ventral telencephalon (subpallium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Turner et al., 2016</xref>), and our observation from Granger-causality analysis that activity in the habenula is predicted by activity in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We selectively disrupted neurons in the habenula following two days of exposure to live prey and observed a significant reduction in prey capture initiation and performance in fish with disrupted habenula neurons vs. siblings with an intact habenula. Our results indicate that activity in the habenula contributes to optimized prey capture performance in prey-experienced fish by increasing the gain between prey-evoked activity in visual areas and the motor areas that execute hunt behavior.</p><p>To our knowledge, while there are correlative studies for the role of the telencephalon and habenula in prey capture, no functional role for these structures had yet been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ewert et al., 1999</xref>). The dorsal habenula in teleosts is homologous to the mammalian medial habenula and has been shown to modulate fear responses and social conflict outcomes in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agetsuma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chou et al., 2016</xref>), and integrating olfactory and optical cues in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jetti et al., 2014</xref>). Our work suggests the forebrain could mediate the effect of prior experience of live prey on prey-capture performance. Additional work is required to detail the mechanism of this effect. It should be noted that other brain areas may also contribute to gain control. Previous studies identified the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) as an important relay for motor signals controlling the prey capture circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gahtan, 2005</xref>), which was missing from our imaging plane. Some pretectal neurons have direct projections to the nMLF and the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antinucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Helmbrecht et al., 2018</xref>). The mesencephalic reticular formation, a region controlling eye movements and convergence in goldfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angeles Luque et al., 2005</xref>) was also missing from our imaging plane. Neuromodulation could also contribute to the gain control of prey capture behavior observed in this study. The dopaminergic system encodes stimulus valence and regulates motivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; the noradrenergic locus coeruleus is thought to modulate arousal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; different parts of the hypothalamus are thought to control a variety of motivational functions like arousal and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wee et al., 2019</xref>). The central amygdala has recently been shown to control predatory hunting in mice, by increasing capture initiation via the periaqueductal gray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2017</xref>), which is homologous to the <italic>griseum centrale</italic> of zebrafish, and receives input from the habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olson et al., 2017</xref>). Further, the habenula, which is a highly conserved across species, also acts in value-based decision making throughout species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hikosaka, 2010</xref>), and this could contribute to the experience-dependent increase in prey capture performance that we find to be associated with habenula activity. The serotonergic system modulates responsiveness and arousal in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yokogawa et al., 2012</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boulougouris and Tsaltas, 2008</xref>), as well as prey-approach behavior depending on hunger levels of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Filosa et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study showed that a subpopulation of neurons in the dorsal raphe in the hindbrain encodes whether zebrafish are in an hunting ‘exploitation’ state or an ‘exploration’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marques et al., 2020</xref>). This area is another candidate for contributing to the effect of experience of live prey on behavior. Further, another study built a detailed model categorizing zebrafish behaviors, and showed that hunger influenced animals’ likelihood to seek food vs. safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that fish with prior experience of prey are better hunters and respond more reliably to virtual prey. Prey-experienced fish are more likely to trigger a capture initiation in response to a given visual neural event. Prey-experienced fish also display greater activity in the forebrain during visual events that trigger capture behavior relative to those that do not. Finally, prey-experienced fish show strengthened functional links from the output neurons of the optic tectum to the telencephalon. These findings suggest a role for the forebrain in prey capture, and this is supported by the observation that disruption of one of the forebrain areas, the habenula, compromises prey capture in prey-experienced fish. We hypothesize that experience in hunting of live prey boosts prey capture performance by increasing the impact of information transfer from visual to motor-related areas as a result of recruitment of forebrain activity. The forebrain activity may contribute to gating this process, with experience sharpening contrast between visual events to create a ‘go’ / ‘no-go’ signal for initiating this complex motor behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>fish line,<italic>Danio rerio</italic></td><td>AB wild type zebrafish line</td><td>ZIRC</td><td>ZDB-GENO-960809–7</td><td/></tr><tr><td>fish line,<italic>D. rerio</italic></td><td>TL wild type zebrafish</td><td>ZIRC</td><td>ZDB-GENO-990623–2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>fish line, <italic>D. rerio</italic></td><td>TgBAC(gng8:GAL4FF);UAS:GFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">deCarvalho et al., 2013</xref></td><td/><td> obtained from Halpern Lab</td></tr><tr><td>fish line, <italic>D. rerio</italic></td><td>Tg(UAS-E1B:NTR-mCherry)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Curado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsuoka et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td> obtained from Stainier Lab</td></tr><tr><td>fish line, <italic>D. rerio</italic></td><td>Tg(neurod1:GCaMP6F)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rupprecht et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td> obtained from Wyart Lab</td></tr><tr><td>fish line, <italic>D. rerio</italic></td><td>Tg(atoh7:gap43-RFP)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zolessi et al., 2006</xref></td><td/><td> obtained from Wyart Lab</td></tr><tr><td>chemical reagent</td><td>Metronidazole</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>1442009 USP</td><td/></tr><tr><td>organism, <italic>Paramecium caudatum</italic></td><td>Paramecia</td><td>ZIRC</td><td>Paramecium starter culture</td><td/></tr><tr><td>reagent</td><td>Fish flakes</td><td>Hikari USA</td><td>First Bites Specialty fish food</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish care and transgenic lines</title><p>Animal experiments were done under oversight by the University of California Berkeley institutional review board (Animal Care and Use Committee).

Optimal stimulus properties were chosen to maximize prey capture responses: 1 mm diameter dots of varying contrasts on a white background appeared in front of the fish and moved to the left or the right of the screen at 30 degrees/sec. Changes in speed of the stimulus due to the curvature of the screen were corrected for programmatically. The contrast of the dot was varied from 20% (light gray on white) to 100% (black on white) in 20% increments. Dots of different contrasts were presented in blocks. Fish were kept in the dark between trials (12 s inter-trial interval), the white background screen appeared progressively 3 s before the onset of the trial, and at trial onset the stimulus appeared on the screen and moved to the left or to the right for a duration of 3 s. Each contrast was tested eight times (with four in each direction), and 20 blank trials were interweaved randomly with the (8 × 5 contrast types) target trials throughout the experiment, a total of 60 trials per fish. Contrast blocks were also ordered randomly. Fish were illuminated from the side with a custom-built red LED light source and behavior was imaged with a 2.5x/0.06 air objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc, Germany) using a high-speed CMOS camera (Mikrotron Eosens 1362, Germany) at 250 Hz. Behavior image acquisition and stimulus projection was synchronized by the software controlling the behavior camera (Piper, Stanford Photonics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging calcium activity induced by a live paramecium</title><p>Transgenic <italic>Tg(NeuroD:GCaMP6f)</italic> fish were embedded in agar and were placed under a one-photon spinning disc confocal microscope to acclimate for 10 min. They further acclimated for one minute with the 488 nm laser light on continuously before the onset of image acquisition to avoid detecting the strong initial activation of visual response in response to light onset. The laser was on continuously throughout the acquisition session to avoid distracting the animal with flashing light. We limited our imaging to a single plane that contained the pretectal area around AF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Semmelhack et al., 2014</xref>), recording at 5x magnification (0.25NA, air objective, Zeiss Fluar) at 13–15% laser power, with an output laser light at the objective of 150 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>, and acquisition frequency at 3.6 Hz. The x/y optical resolution of the microscope used was 5.4 µm / pixel. Spontaneous activity was recorded for 1500 frames (about 7 min). A single paramecium was then added to a small well cut out in the agar in front of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muto et al., 2013</xref>). The well was sealed with a small lid of agar to keep the paramecium in front of the fish and avoid evaporation. Brain activity in response to the paramecium was recorded for 2500 frames (or 11.6 min). A Logitech C525 webcam (Logitech, USA) was placed under the fish to film the position of the paramecium using dark field illumination with an IR light source. A uEye CCD camera (IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH) was attached to the microscope side port to record eye position. A notch filter 488 nm (Chroma, USA) was placed in front of the webcam to block out the imaging laser light, a 488 band pass filter (Chroma, USA) was used to image GCaMP6f fluorescence and a dichroic mirror (T470lpxr, Chroma, USA) reflected wavelengths below 470 nm and above 750 nm to the uEye camera while transmitting green photons to the fluorescence camera. The webcam and the uEye camera were controlled by custom-written software written in MATLAB so frames were acquired every time a fluorescence frame was acquired. Acquisition was synchronized by a TTL pulse sent from the fluorescence imaging software Slidebook (3I, USA) to MATLAB. It has recently been suggested that the light intensities used for one photon light-sheet microscopy stimulate the blue and UV cones of the retina which compromises visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolf, 2015</xref>). At 5x magnification, light intensity at the focal plane was 50-75µW, which is substantially less than intensities used for light-sheet microscopy. Low magnification imaging resulted some scattered blue light that we supplemented with visible blue LED side illumination, for the fish to see the paramecium in front of it and maximize responses.

At day 4 dpf, we screened for expression of nitroreductase using mCherry fluorescence, excluded fish also expressing GFP, and selected two groups of healthy fish: ones that were positive and ones that were negative for NTR. We used the same feeding protocol described above on 5 and 6 dpf. On the evening of day six, we split the NTR positive and negative fish into two groups each and incubated them on a 48 well plate with either 5 mM MTZ (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.2% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich), referred to as +MTZ group, or 0.2% DMSO only (-MTZ group), overnight for 19 hr. The next morning, we washed the fish three times (five minutes per wash) with E3 fish water and placed them in the incubator to recover for 1 hr. After this period of recovery, fish were placed in a clear plastic 9-well plate (concave wells, diameter 11 mm, depth 10 mm) to record post-treatment feeding behavior. For our behavioral assay of predation, we placed the fish in the plate alternating in neighboring wells between the four groups (in a sequence of: NTR+/+MTZ, NTR+/-MTZ, NTR-/+MTZ, NTR-/-MTZ, and then repeat and so on). Fish behavior was recorded continuously for the first 30 s out of each 60 s period. The observation period consisted of an initial 10 min baseline period and then 20 more minutes after paramecia were added. Fish behavior was imaged with a uEye CCD camera (IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH) at 10 Hz frame rate, with IR illumination and incidental room light. Paramecia were added in a 200 μL volume of pre-counted paramecia. The number of paramecia at start was on average 29.7 ± 8.9 (SD) and did not significantly differ between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Eye convergence was measured manually by counting the frequency and number of frames that the eyes were converged. Paramecia were counted in three 15-frame long windows per time point, (at frames 100–115, 200–215 and 285–300) and averaged to obtain the number of paramecia at each time point. Swim speed was measured by tracking the fish’s location in the well by using a custom MATLAB (Mathworks, USA) script. For all analysis, the experimenter was blind to the genetics and treatment of the animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence analysis</title><p>After the behavioral experiment, NTR+ fish were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight and then washed and mounted in low-melting agarose.

All pairwise comparisons were made with two-sided permutation tests using the difference in means as a test statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Good, 2005</xref>) unless otherwise indicated. Permutation tests do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution, do not require equal variances or equal sample size. We rearranged labels (i.e. prey-experienced or prey-naïve) on observed data points and calculated the new test statistic 100,000 times thus creating a null distribution (under the null hypothesis, labels are interchangeable). We then computed the p-value by calculating the probability of obtaining a test statistic with an absolute value at least as great as the absolute value of the observed statistic (the difference in means between the actual experimental groups) under the null distribution. Permutation tests were two-tailed, because of the comparison of absolute values. We used a significance level α = 0.05 (or a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis). Raw data from individual fish is plotted along with a boxplot summarizing the distribution statistics of the group: the central bar is the median, the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively, and the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered as statistical outliers (as defined by the inbuilt ‘boxplot.m’ function). We used a bootstrapping technique to calculate the percent increase in eye convergence frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral units of the prey capture sequence (pursuits and successful captures) were counted manually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Swimming velocity and percent of time resting were determined using custom tracking code. In the virtual environment setup, eye convergence events and tail flicks were also detected manually. A hit was defined as an eye convergence event when a stimulus was presented and a false alarm was an eye convergence when a blank stimulus was presented. Hit rate was defined as the number of hits divided by the number of stimulus trials and false alarm rate was estimated as the number of false alarms by blank stimulus trials. Blank stimuli were interleaved with stimulus trials throughout the experiment so we used the same false alarm rate for all contrast levels. To measure eye convergence rates compared to baseline for a given fish at each contrast level, we calculated the discriminability index <italic>d’=Z(hit rate) –Z(false alarm rate)</italic>, where Z is the inverse of the cumulative Gaussian distribution. d’ distributions for prey-experienced and prey-naïve fish were compared using a two-way ANOVA test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium and behavior imaging data pre-processing</title><p>Movies were registered using rigid body transformation (dftregistration from the MATLAB File Exchange). Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually around the left and right telencephalon, habenula, pretectum, tectal neuropil, tectal PVNs, cerebellum, parallel fibers of the crista cerebellaris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bae et al., 2009</xref>) and the hindbrain. Left and right regions that appeared to have symmetrical activity around events of interest were averaged. Images were bleach corrected by fitting a single or double exponential (depending on the best goodness-of-fit) to the mean baseline fluorescence of each ROI excluding outliers and subtracting it from each pixel’s fluorescence time series. Fluorescence time-series of each pixel was then z-scored by subtracting the mean of the whole signal and dividing by the standard deviation (all Fz units in standard deviations away from the mean). We further corrected the average fluorescence traces of our ROIs for motion artifacts induced by body movements by interpolating values for all frames that had a displacement larger than two pixels. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, we averaged left and right fluorescence for where signals were similar on either side. For analysis of fluorescence around pretectum transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) we detected pretectal peaks by thresholding the traces at two standard deviations from the mean and correcting for any aberrations manually and considered the highest value after thresholding as the peak. For each transient we considered the contralateral pretectum (to the prey) to be the side with the highest amplitude at peak time. We could not use prey position to determine contralateral identity because the prey was often on the midline and both eyes could detect it, and the prey moved faster than calcium transients rose to maximum meaning that a prey might evoked a transient while on one side of the fish, and already be on the other side by the time the transient has reached its peak. We extracted the average fluorescence in pretectum, optic tectum, cerebellum and hindbrain around 30 frames (~8 s) before and 30 frames after each pretectal peak. We calculated a baseline for each trace by averaging the fluorescence of the first 13 frames (~3.5 s).</p><p>To detect eye angle, for each frame eye contours were identified using custom-written software, and an ellipse was fit to the contours. Eye angle was considered to be the angle of the major axis of the ellipse relative to the midline of the fish. Eye vergence was the angle between the two eyes. Eye convergences were detected semi-automatically by identifying frames where both eye moved sharply towards the midline, thresholding vergence at 30° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>), and correcting any aberrant detections manually. Speed of acquisition did not enable us to track fast changes in tail angle, so tail movements were detected by calculating pixel intensity changes on either side of the tail, subtracting a baseline rolling average over 20 frames. Pixel intensity changes matched tail bend amplitudes remarkably well when we scored movies by eye. Tail flick time points were detected semi-automatically by thresholding at two standard deviations from the mean and corrected for aberrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantifying prey position for the encoding model</title><p>We preprocessed prey-position movies by subtracting a baseline rolling average over 20 frames. Prey position was quantified using a polar representation of space around the fish. We defined 19 angle bins (or angle basis functions) of prey position relative to the fish’s midline. Each bin was represented by a von Mises distribution (which is an approximation of the circular normal distribution) with centers evenly spaced from –pi to pi and the width parameter kappa set to 20. When the prey was close to the center of a bin, that angle was weighted strongly, whereas when the prey was in between two bins, the angles at the centers of those bins were weighted equally, generating a more continuous representation of prey-space. Similarly, we also defined five radial basis functions, which describe distance of the prey from the fish, using Gaussian distributions with centers evenly spaced from 0 to ~5 mm and width parameter sigma set to 40. We then took the product of each angle basis function and each radial basis function, yielding a total of 95 two-dimensional spatial basis functions that vary in both angle and radius. Each frame of the prey video was then projected onto each of these basis functions, producing 95 prey-location time series. For a particular prey-location time series the value is high for times when the prey is near the specified angle and radius and zero at other times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pixel-wise encoding model estimation and validation</title><p>Linearized finite impulse response (FIR) encoding models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nishimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huth et al., 2016</xref>) that predict pixel fluorescence based on the location of prey were estimated for each pixel in each fish. For each pixel (1) we constructed the stimulus input matrix that represents prey location over time: To account for calcium indicator kinetics, and neural response delays relative to movement of the prey, each of the 95 prey-location time series were delayed from −5 to + 15 frames (−1.4 to 4.2 s), yielding a total of 1900 features that were used to predict pixel fluorescence. The shifted prey-location time series were concatenated, and the mean of each 1900 feature time series was then subtracted to avoid fitting an intercept term in the regression. (2) We used ridge regression to estimate the model coefficients that quantify the relationship between prey location and pixel fluorescence. To enable unbiased assessment of model prediction performance we used a 10-fold cross-validation (the outer-layer validation) approach to fit and validate the encoding models. First, the full dataset for each fish was divided into 10 sequential temporal segments. For each fold, one segment was reserved for model validation and the other nine segments were used to estimate the model weights by way of L2-regularized linear regression (ridge regression). (3) We estimated the regularization parameter for each of the 10 outer-layer folds using a second lever of cross-validation. We tested 20 regularization parameters α, log spaced between 1 and 1000. For each parameter α, the following procedure was repeated 50 times: we randomly selected and removed 400 time points (10 blocks of 40 consecutive time points each) from the model estimation dataset. Model weights were then estimated using the remaining time points and used to predict responses in the 400 selected time points. After this procedure was repeated 50 times a regularization-performance curve was obtained for each outer-fold layer by averaging the 50 prediction performance values for each regularization parameter. The regularization parameter with the best prediction performance was selected. (4) We re-computed model weights using the entire model estimation dataset (consisting of the nine segments of data for this cross-validation fold). (5) We predicted fluorescence for the held-out segment of data using the estimated weights. Both weights and predicted fluorescence were saved. (6) We repeated steps 3 to 5 for each of the 10 outer-layer cross-validation folds. (7) After all 10 folds had been completed the predicted segments were concatenated to form a complete prediction dataset of the same size as the original fluorescence data. The Pearson correlation between the complete predicted time series and actual fluorescence time series was then computed for each pixel. For further analysis of pixel selectivity (8) we averaged together the estimated model weights from each of the 10 cross-validation folds (average across delays to obtain spatial receptive fields from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, average across radii to obtain preferred angle, or average across radii and angles to obtain preferred delay, etc). (9) Statistical significance of predictions was computed by comparing estimated correlations to the null distribution of correlations between two independent Gaussian random variables of the same length.

Basically, this cost function balances the variance accounted for by the AR model against the number of coefficients to be estimated. We fixed the common model order of q = 5 frames for all fish (mean of optimal order values obtained for individual fish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pereda et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We estimated GC between GCaMP6f fluorescence signals in spontaneous (without prey) and evoked (with prey) conditions over 1500 frames (7 min) and 2500 frames (11 min) respectively (normalized to zero mean and unitary variance). Each zebrafish’s brain was thus characterized by a full connectivity pattern by quantifying GC influences between identified ROIs. The strength of a functional link between two regions was estimated with the value of the F-statistic, which quantifies the statistical significance of the directed interaction under the assumption of non-directed effect. Statistical differences between groups were evaluated using a Welsh-test for each link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bressler and Seth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gourévitch et al., 2006</xref>).

We used multivariate linear regression to model the relationship between prey capture initiation frequency (response variable), and Granger-causality links strength and experience (two predictor variables). We used the ‘robust’ option in the MATLAB <italic>fitlm</italic> function, which reiteratively weights each data point to reduce the effect of outlier response points on the fit. A bisquare function was used for re-weighting.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Marnie Halpern for generously providing the Tg(gng8:Gal4) fish line; Kait Kliman, Mel Boren, Sonia Castillo, and Allison Kepple for maintaining fish lines at UC Berkeley; Natalia Maties, Bodgan Buzurin, and Sophie Nunes Figueiredo for maintaining transgenic lines at the ICM zebrafish facility; Holly Aaron, Jen Lee, and Feather Yves from the Berkeley Molecular Imaging Center at UC Berkeley.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors looked at prey capture behaviors (eye convergence and tail flick) of zebrafish larvae in a virtual reality environment while at the same time they observed the neuronal activity of the brain in a fixed focal plane. Importantly, they focused on the effect of previous experience on the prey capture performance and its neuronal correlates. They compared fish fed live paramecia (experienced) and fish fed fish flakes (naïve).</p><p>They first looked at the behavior and found that eye convergence of experienced fish in response to prey was higher than in naïve fish (Figure 1). They then monitored the brain and found that the activity of the visual areas, pretectum and tectum, are not very different between experienced and naïve fish. There was also no difference between neuronal activities at eye convergence events that spontaneously occurred without prey and those at prey-evoked eye convergence (Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). To see whether encoding of visual stimuli is different, they performed regularized regression analysis on the neuronal map in the pretectum, tectal neuropil and tectal PVN, and found no difference between experienced and naïve fish (Figure 3). To look at information flow in and out of visual areas, they performed Granger causality analyses. Granger causality between tectum and PVN was increased by presentation of prey, but again, prior experience made no difference (Figure 4). On the other hand, the authors did observe a difference in information flow to the telencephalon from visual areas. Interestingly, looking at individual fish, eye convergence performance was correlated with Granger causality from pretectum and other visual areas, and from visual areas to the telencephalon. This raised the possibility that the forebrain may be involved in increased performance resulting from experience (Figure 5). Triggered by this observation, the authors looked at activity of each area at the time of pretectal activity peaks, and found that responses of the telencephalon and habenular region were different between experienced and naïve fish (Figure 6). To confirm the relevance of brain activity measurements in the habenulae, they performed a functional test to kill habenular neurons using a toxin, and indeed saw decreased success at prey capture (Figure 7).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The writing and figures are generally very good, and most of the small-scale interpretations are sound. However, it is the consensus of the reviewers that the following concerns need to be addressed before the study is publishable.</p><p>1) There is a simple and appealing (maybe preferable) alternative explanation for the results: flake-fed larvae are more satiated than paramecium-fed larvae are. We acknowledge the great lengths that the authors have gone to in demonstrating that larvae in the two groups are similar in size, move similarly, and have had access to saturating amounts of food. This does not mean that they are equally hungry (flakes are easier to catch and may be more nutritious, as this is what they're designed for). The behavioral effect, an increased initiation of pursuit, appears to be more a function of motivation than hunting proficiency. The authors have demonstrated that the visual coding does not depend on experience, nor is there evidence of improved efficacy (say, improved motor coordination) once an initiation occurs. These seem like more motivated animals. Greater hunger is the simplest explanation, and the authors capably outline in their Discussion the mechanisms by which hunger could mediate this stronger motivation to prey.</p><p>We do not think that the authors' model, &quot;experience leads to greater visually-evoked activity in the forebrain&quot;, is supported until the effects of hunger and experience are uncoupled. Unfed fish, which would undoubtedly be hungry and naïve, would provide the answer. If they initiate more and show other effects reported in the manuscript, then it is likely that hunger is responsible. If they act more like flake-fed larvae (or are even farther in this direction), then the authors' model has much stronger support. While it would be less than ideal, and would leave caveats, a clear behavioral effect (even in the absence of brain imaging) could be used to provide this support.</p><p>2) The habenular ablation experiments support that the habenulae are necessary for normal initiation and capture. This is only circumstantially related to the manuscript's other findings. The solution is to do the ablations of flake-fed larvae, where the model would predict no effect.</p><p>3) Subsection “Fluorescence Analysis”. The description of quantifying habenular neuronal loss is confusing. The authors state that &quot;NTR+ fish were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight and then washed and mounted in low-melting agarose. Z-stacks of both habenulae were taken on a Zeiss LSM 880 upright laser scanning confocal at equal laser intensity, making sure no pixels were oversaturated.

We fed sibling fish either paramecia or flakes on day 5 and 6 dpf ad libitum, and then starved the fish overnight, as in our usual protocol. On day 7, when we normally perform our assays, we performed a flake-feeding test. In this test, we let fish feed on flakes for 10 minutes. We assessed the number of eye convergences during that time as a proxy for the motivation to hunt (observation of food ingestion was not possible to do reliably). If the flake fed fish are less hungry, they would display fewer eye convergences. Instead, we observed a significantly higher number of eye convergences in response to the flakes in the previously flakes-fed fish. This shows that flake-trained fish are not less hungry. Moreover, it suggests that the experience with flakes boosts flake “hunting” in the same way as experience with paramecia boosts paramecia hunting, supporting our conclusion that experience improves performance and demonstrating that this effect is specific to the identity of the food. (subsection “Prior experience of prey increases prey capture initiation in larval zebrafish”; Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1G).</p><p>We further tested the interpretation that experience with a particular food source enhances feeding/hunting of that food source. We did this in an experiment with another live prey. Fish were fed with rotifers <italic>ad libitum</italic> in two groups. Group 1 was fed for one day (at 5 dpf) and group 2 was fed for two days (4 and 5 dpf), both groups were starved overnight, until day 6. On day 6, both groups were given fluorescent rotifers for 30 minutes. We fixed the fish and compared the levels of fluorescence in their digestive tract. We observed that fish that were exposed to rotifers for two days consumed more fluorescent rotifers than fish that were fed on only one day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This observation supports the conclusion that experience with prey is the dominating factor. The number of fish we tested was small (N = 10 fish in each group) and the therefore can only show a trend. Power analysis reveals that it would take N = 80 fish to reach significance. We have not been able to obtain sufficient numbers (N = 160) of sibling fish to make this possible. We therefore present this result only for the review.</p><p>These experiments support our interpretation that experience and not hunger is the driving force of improvement in prey capture.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dependence of rotifer ingestion on prior experience.</title><p>A) Example images of gut fluorescence signal (magenta) from animals fed live rotifers stained with TexasRed for 30 minutes on day 6 post fertilization (dpf).

NTR+ fish were fed on flakes on days 5 and 6 and then, overnight between days 6 and 7, given either DMSO alone (-MTZ) or DMSO + MTZ (+MTZ). They were then tested for feeding on paramecia on day 7. There was no statistical difference between the +MTZ, which had habenular damage, and the -MTZ control (indeed, +MTZ consumed slightly, but not significantly, more). This result indicates that the habenula is not necessary for normal initiation and capture.

Under our conditions, the mCherry signal remained bright and we were careful to fix all of the animals in each experiment simultaneously, for the same time, and in the same solutions. Differences in signal between animals more likely reflect typical animal to animal variation in transgene expression. We observed a range of mCherry brightness in both +MTZ and -MTZ sibling NTR+ fish and clearly distinct relations of brightness to volume between the two groups (as we show in new Figure 7—figure supplement 2B), supporting the accuracy of the volume measure in Figure 7C an accurate representation of chemo-ablation. Moreover, across animals with different levels of mCherry signal, we see that the -MTZ controls have a typical diffuse pattern throughout the habenula, whereas the +MTZ-treated animals have a blotchy distribution (Figure 7B and Figure 7—figure supplement 2A), which is typical of chemo-ablation. We have added more example images of +MTZ and -MTZ fish to illustrate this (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A) and we have added a description of this to the figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
