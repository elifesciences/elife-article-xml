between target proteins and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system to cause selective protein degradation. Here, we report a new molecular glue HQ461 discovered by high-throughput screening. Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic screening in human cancer cells followed by biochemical reconstitution, we show that HQ461 acts by promoting an interaction between CDK12 and DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to polyubiquitination and degradation of CDK12-interacting protein Cyclin K (CCNK). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 compromised CDK12 function, leading to reduced phosphorylation of a CDK12 substrate, downregulation of DNA damage response genes, and cell death. Structure-activity relationship analysis of HQ461 revealed the importance of a 5-methylthiazol-2-amine pharmacophore and resulted in an HQ461 derivate with improved potency. Our studies reveal a new molecular glue that recruits its target protein directly to DDB1 to bypass the requirement of a substrate-specific receptor, presenting a new strategy for targeted protein degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular glue</kwd><kwd>target identification</kwd><kwd>targeted protein degradation</kwd><kwd>CDK12/CCNK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Xiangbing</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Municipal Commission of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Xiangbing</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004147</institution-id><institution>Tsinghua University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Xiangbing</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-throughput phenotypic screening followed by unbiased target identification reveals a new molecular glue HQ461 that induces CDK12-DDB1 interaction to promote degradation of Cyclin K via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular glues are a class of small molecules that induce the formation of protein-protein interactions to elicit biologic or therapeutic effects. The name ‘molecular glue’ was first coined to describe the mechanism of action of the plant hormone auxin, which bridges an interaction between the E3 ubiquitin ligase TIR1 and IAA transcription repressors, leading to IAA destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome system to activate auxin-response gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike conventional small molecules that bind to active sites or allosteric sites to modulate the activity of their target proteins, molecular glues influence the activity or fate of their target proteins by bringing them to the vicinity of regulatory proteins. As a result, molecular glues have been viewed enthusiastically as a unique pharmacological modality to target proteins without druggable pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maniaci and Ciulli, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding, molecular glues are rare and were discovered serendipitously; only a handful of molecular glues have been documented over the past four decades. For example, macrocyclic natural products cyclosporin A, FK506, and rapamycin recruit FKBP proteins to the phosphatase calcineurin or the kinase mTORC1, interfering with their enzymatic activities to control intracellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sabatini et al., 1994</xref>). Similarly, the thalidomide class of immunomodulatory drugs binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase cereblon and alters its substrate specificity to recognize and degrade several zinc finger transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krönke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). More recently, indisulam and related anticancer sulfonamides were discovered to function by promoting the interaction between the splicing factor RBM39 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase DCAF15, resulting in the degradation of RBM39 to cause aberrant pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uehara et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several common themes have emerged from this limited set of molecular glues. First, molecular glues often bind to their target proteins with modest or even undetectable affinities, while enhanced affinities are usually observed once a regulatory protein is also present in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussiere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faust et al., 2020</xref>). Such unique binding characteristics can be explained by induced protein-protein interactions and pre-existing protein surface complementarity as revealed by structural analysis of molecular glue-bound protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bussiere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faust et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). Second, molecular glues can target transcription factors and splicing factors, by recognizing either relatively flat surfaces or disordered regions of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krönke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). Third, molecular glues possess favorable pharmacological properties to serve as drug candidates. For example, the compactness of the thalidomide scaffold allowed the development of bivalent proteolysis targeting chimeras to direct cereblon to degrade disease-relevant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winter et al., 2015</xref>). However, the rarity of molecular glues has limited their potential as a general strategy for drug development.</p><p>In this study, we report the discovery and the mechanism of action of a new molecular glue HQ461. HQ461 was identified through phenotype-based high-throughput small-molecule screening and found to possess potent cytotoxicity. Combining chemical genetics and biochemical reconstitution, we show that HQ461 acts by binding to CDK12’s kinase domain, creating a modified CDK12 surface to recruit DDB1, which is a subunit of the DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Distinct from existing molecular glues that engage the ubiquitin proteasome system by binding to a substrate-specific receptor, HQ461 converts CDK12 into a substrate-specific receptor for DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 to trigger the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CDK12’s partner protein Cyclin K (CCNK). HQ461-mediated depletion of CCNK from cells leads to reduced Serine 2 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and affects the expression of genes involved in DNA damage response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HQ461’s cytotoxicity requires DDB1-CUL4-RBX1</title><p>HQ461 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is a compound originated from phenotype-based high-throughput screening for small molecules that suppress NRF2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Phenotypic characterization of HQ461 revealed its potent cytotoxicity to the non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 with a half-maximal inhibitory (IC<sub>50</sub>) concentration of 1.3 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To investigate HQ461’s mechanism of action, we performed pooled genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening by targeting 19,114 genes with four individual sgRNAs per gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doench et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We treated sgRNA-transduced A549 cells with either the vehicle DMSO or a sub-lethal dose of HQ461 for 3 weeks to enrich for cells that were resistant to HQ461’s cytotoxic effects. Afterwards, we isolated genomic DNAs from surviving cells and performed sgRNA amplification by PCR followed by next-generation sequencing to measure the abundance of each sgRNA in these cells. Using the MAGeCK algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>) to rank enriched genes in HQ461 treated relative to DMSO-treated cells, we found the top-ranking genes include the E2 ubiquitin activating enzyme G1 (<italic>UBE2G1</italic>), five members of the DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (<italic>DDB1</italic>, <italic>RBX1</italic>, <italic>DDA1</italic>, <italic>CUL4A, CUL4B</italic>), and multiple regulators of DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 activity (<italic>GLMN</italic>, <italic>NAA30</italic>/<italic>35</italic>/<italic>38</italic>, <italic>NAE1</italic>, and <italic>UBE2M</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

HCT-116 cells are defective in mismatch repair, and therefore exhibits a high rate of random point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>).

To ensure the isolation of independent HQ461-resistant clones, we derived 10 clonal isolates from HCT-116 that were initially sensitive to HQ461 (HQ461<sup>S</sup>).

The residue lysine 867 on DDB1 that was cross-linked to CDK12 in the CXMS experiment is located in the BPC domain of DDB1, which is known to interact with a promiscuous α-helical motif present in DCAF proteins and viral proteins such as the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2010</xref>). We found that a peptide corresponding to the α-helical motif of HBx increased the thermal stability of recombinant DDB1 without its BPB domain (DDB1ΔBPB) by a 2°C increase in Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, HQ461 did not change the thermal stability of DDB1ΔBPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results suggest that HQ461 does not directly bind to DDB1.</p><p>We next evaluated whether HQ461’s binding to CDK12KD/CCNKΔC was affected by G731E/R mutations. Using label-free nanoDSF, we monitored thermal unfolding of CDK12KD/CCNKΔC (wild type or G731E/R mutants) in the presence of increasing concentrations of HQ461. Tm of all three protein preparations increased in an HQ461 concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggests that HQ461 is capable of binding to CDK12’s kinase domain with G731/R mutations.</p><p>THZ531 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) is a specific covalent inhibitor of CDK12/CDK13 by irreversibly targeting a cysteine uniquely present in CDK12/13’s kinase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Using the AlphaScreen assay, we found that THZ531 inhibited HQ461-dependent formation of the CDK12KD/CCNKΔC/DDB1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Dinaciclib (Figure S6B) is a non-covalent CDK inhibitor targeting CDK1, 2, 5, 9, 12, 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Neither THZ531 nor dinaciclib treatment caused CCNK degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, treating cells with THZ531 or dinaciclib prior to HQ461 treatment prevented CCNK degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), clearly suggesting that THZ531, dinaciclib, and HQ461 occupy the same ATP-binding pocket in CDK12’s kinase domain. These results confirm HQ461’s engagement with CDK12’s kinase domain in vivo, and highlight HQ461’s unique ability to induce CCNK degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Structure-activity relationship study of HQ461</title><p>To dissect the chemical basis for optimizing HQ461’s molecular-glue activity, we conducted a thorough structure-activity relationship study of HQ461 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Specifically, we changed the pyridine to small-size groups such as hydrogen (HQ011) and acetyl (HQ019), or replaced the linker between pyridine and aminothiazol to amide (HQ014). All these modifications resulted in losses in activity. We also made changes to the 5-methylthiazol-2-amine moiety of HQ461 by incorporating several substitutions (HQ015, 016, and 017) and discovered that this moiety was crucial for activity. We therefore maintained this pharmacophore and incorporated a variety of substitutions on the pyridine ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The elimination of the methyl group (HQ010) on the pyridine ring resulted in a 6-fold higher DC<sub>50</sub> value, suggesting an important steric effect of the 5-position on the pyridine ring. Consistent with this hypothesis, the incorporation of a bulky ring structures on pyridine’s 5-position (HQ008) led to a 38-fold increase in DC<sub>50</sub>. In addition, substitution of the 5-position with F, Cl, Br, ethyl, methoxyl, and trifluoromethyl (HQ001-004, 006, and 009) all diminished potency.</p><p>Finally, a beneficial effect of polarity is observed by a 3-fold increase in potency of HQ005 (DC<sub>50</sub>: 41 nM) in which the methyl group in HQ461 was replaced by a hydroxymethyl group.

Inactivation of CCNK therefore blocks the functions of both CDK12 and CDK13. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II’s largest subunit is composed of 52 repeats with the consensus heptad sequence YSPTSPS. Serine 2 of the heptad repeat is a known phosphosubstrate of CDK12/13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>). HQ461 treatment reduced POLII CTD Serine 2 phosphorylation without affecting the level of total POLII CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Inactivation of CDK12 is known to preferentially affect the expression of genes involved in DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>).

In cells with CDK12 G731E or G731R mutation, the inhibitory effect of HQ461 on POLII CTD Serine 2 phosphorylation and the expression of DDR genes were abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on our biochemical and biophysical data, we propose a model in which HQ461 binds to CDK12’s ATP-binding pocket to generate an altered surface on CDK12 to interact with the BPC domain of DDB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This model is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, DSF experiments revealed direct binding of HQ461 to CDK12/CCNK instead of DDB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Second, known inhibitors of CDK12 that occupy CDK12’s ATP-binding pocket impeded HQ461’s activity in inducing CDK12-DDB1 interaction and CCNK degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Third, CXMS analysis mapped the HQ461-induced protein-protein interaction interface to be between CDK12’s kinase domain and DDB1’s BPC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the hot spot glycine 731 for HQ461-resistant mutations is located in the vicinity of this interface. G731E or G731R substitution did not affect HQ461 binding to CDK12 but impaired DDB1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Replacing glycine (a neutral residue without a side chain) with glutamate or arginine (charged residues with bulky side chains) may cause steric hindrance and/or disruption of hydrophobic stacking to destabilize the CDK12-DDB1 interaction interface. High-resolution structural analyses of a CDK12-DDB1-HQ461 complex is needed to completely resolve the basis for HQ461’s molecular-glue activity.</p><p>Previously known molecular-glue degraders all interact with a substrate-specific receptor of Cullin-RING ligases (CRL) to exert their functions. Auxin, thalidomide, and indisulam bind to TIR1, cereblon, and DCAF15, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). HQ461 engages the CUL4-RING ligases (CRL4) in an unprecedented manner by directly interacting with the adaptor protein DDB1 of CRL4. CRLs catalyze polyubiquitination of their protein substrates by positioning them in a reactive zone. CDK12 appears to be outside this reactive zone, because HQ461 did not cause CDK12 ubiquitination in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, CDK12’s partner protein CCNK seems to be optimally positioned for polyubiquitination. These findings suggest that HQ461-bound CDK12 is functionally equivalent to a substrate-specific receptor protein for CRL4. Interestingly, several viruses have evolved a similar strategy to use viral proteins as facultative substrate-specific receptors for DDB1 to degrade host restriction factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In vivo, depletion of CCNK resulted in a modest reduction of CDK12 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The underlying mechanism is not understood at the moment, but one possibility is that CDK12 in the absence of CCNK is recognized and degraded by a quality control E3 ubiquitin ligase.</p><p>While we are preparing our work for publication, two studies identified CDK12 inhibitors that induce CDK12-DDB1 interactions to trigger CCNK degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayor-Ruiz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Słabicki et al., 2020</xref>). Slabicki et al. used a correlation of DDB1 mRNA level with drug-sensitivity across hundreds of cancer cell lines as a strategy to discover that the CDK12 inhibitor CR8 recruits CDK12 to DDB1 and leads to the degradation of CCNK. Mayor-Ruiz et al. examined 2000 cytotoxic compounds between normal and CRL-inactivated cells to identify several compounds whose cytotoxicity requires CRL activity. We discovered HQ461 as a chemical toxin from a phenotype-based high-throughput screening project and primarily replied on chemical genetics (hypermutation in HCT-116 and CRISPR-Cas9 screening) to reveal HQ461’s target. All three studies arrived at the same mechanism of action with distinct chemical scaffolds, suggesting that the CDK12-DDB1 interface is a hotspot for molecular glues.</p><p>﻿CDK12 and CDK13 are two structurally similar kinases that has the ability to phosphorylate serine 2 of the POLII CTD heptad repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bösken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon-Clarke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greifenberg et al., 2016</xref>). To execute their functions, CDK12 and CDK13 form two separate complexes with CCNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this notion, HQ461-mediated depletion of Cyclin K phenotypically mimics dual inhibition of CDK12 and CDK13 by the CDK12/13-selective inhibitor THZ531 to trigger cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). CDK12 inactivation is known to cause reduced POLII elongation and premature polyadenylation of select genes enriched in the DNA damage response pathway, resulting in a BRCAness phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubbury et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have shown that inhibiting CDK12 can sensitize cancer cells to PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bajrami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iniguez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). Degradation of CCNK mediated by HQ461 also reduced the expression of DNA damage response genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether HQ461, by depleting CCNK, also enhances the therapeutic efficacy of PARP inhibitors for cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes the identification of a molecular glue (HQ461; HQ for short) that promotes degradation of cyclin K, the activator subunit of CDK12. The authors show biochemically that HQ can promote the recruitment of CDK12 to DDB1-CUL4-RBX1, the core subunits of the CUL4 ubiquitin ligase. Degradation of cyclin K leads to reduced CDK12 (and CDK13) activity and reduced CDK12/13 substrate phosphorylation. Med-chem efforts led to a somewhat more active molecule glue. This work suggests that the appropriate small molecule can bypass a requirement for a substrate-specific adaptor that normally is the target for known molecular glues. Recently, another paper from the Ebert lab identified a different molecule but with a similar activity.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were quite positive about the paper but suggested a couple of aspects that could strengthen the paper, and to a large degree are required to confirm the proposed mechanism.</p><p>To facilitate revision, I have left all of the comments of the reviewers below, in addition to the specific requested revisions below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify effects on CDK12 in Figure 3, including the TUBE experiment. The reviewers are concerned about the conclusion that HQ promotes degradation of CDK12 in addition to cyclinK. Given that degradation of cyclinK would yield &quot;free&quot; CDK12, it could easily be the case that CDK12 degradation in cells is occurring through a separate mechanism, for example involving an &quot;orphan protein&quot; quality control E3. One approach would be to deplete cyclin K by RNAi and ask whether the half-life of CDK12 is affected and also whether HQ affects the turnover of CDK12. The reviewers also realize that formally distinguish between the possibility that degradation of cyclin K yields &quot;free&quot; CDK12 and the other that CDK12 remains glued by HQ461 may not be trivial. But one approach would be to ask whether CDK12 binds DDB1 in the presence of HQ461 but in the absence of cyclin K?

We believe we have tried our best to experimentally, or textually, address all of these comments. In addition to our point-by-point responses below, we complied a table to highlight modifications to the figures to facilitate evaluation of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarify effects on CDK12 in Figure 3, including the TUBE experiment. The reviewers are concerned about the conclusion that HQ promotes degradation of CDK12 in addition to cyclinK. Given that degradation of cyclinK would yield &quot;free&quot; CDK12, it could easily be the case that CDK12 degradation in cells is occurring through a separate mechanism, for example involving an &quot;orphan protein&quot; quality control E3. One approach would be to deplete cyclin K by RNAi and ask whether the half-life of CDK12 is affected and also whether HQ affects the turnover of CDK12. The reviewers also realize that formally distinguish between the possibility that degradation of cyclin K yields &quot;free&quot; CDK12 and the other that CDK12 remains glued by HQ461 may not be trivial. But one approach would be to ask whether CDK12 binds DDB1 in the presence of HQ461 but in the absence of cyclin K? And, if it does, does HQ461 promotes CDK12 ubiquitylation in vitro and degradation in cells?</p><p>In terms of in vivo CDK12 ubiquitylation, one idea would be to use TUBEs to ask whether HQ affects CDK12 ubiquitylation in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is important to clarify the effect of HQ461 on CDK12 in addition to cyclin K. We provide multiple lines of evidence to support the model that CDK12 is not a direct substrate for HQ461-induced polyubiquitination.</p><p>First, the apparent discrepancy between Figure 3A and 3B/C are likely a result of batch variations of the polyclonal anti-CDK12 antibody. Figure 3A was prepared with an old batch of CDK12 antibody while Figure 3B and 3C were prepared with a new batch. We thus repeated the experiments in Figure 3A with the new batch of anti-CDK12. By diluting untreated A549 lysates (lanes #1-3 of Figure 3A), we show that a two-fold dilution resulted in an ~80% drop in CDK12 band intensity and now there is no discrepancy among Figure 3A-C. Despite the antibody batch variation issue, we arrive at the same conclusion that CDK12 is depleted by ~50% while CCNK is depleted by greater than 87.5% after 8 hours of treatment with 10 µM HQ461.</p><p>Second, we used sgRNA to deplete CCNK, and observed a reduction of CDK12 levels. Although the precise mechanism of CDK12 downregulation is not clear at the moment, our result is consistent with the idea that CDK12 stability is decreased upon loss of CCNK. As the reviewer has pointed out, one possibility is that free CDK12 may be degraded by a quality control E3 and we mentioned this possibility in the discussion. The suggestion to examine whether CDK12 binds DDB1 in the presence of HQ461 but in the absence of cyclin K is technically infeasible because CDK12 is destabilized in the absence of cyclin K in vivo. Likely for the same reason, recombinant expression of CDK12 in insect cells is not feasible without co-expression of cyclin K (PMID: 26597175), preventing us from addressing this question with in vitro reconstitution.</p><p>Third, we repeated in vitro ubiquitination assays, blotted for both CCNK and CDK12 (New Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and clearly demonstrated that CCNK is polyubiquitinated in the presence of HQ461 in vitro while CDK12 is not.</p><p>Fourth, we attempted the TUBE experiment suggested by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We were able to use FLAG-TUBE pulldown to efficiently enrich polyubiquitinated proteins from 293T lysates. However, we were not able to observe an enrichment of polyubiquitinated CCNK or CDK12. In contrast, using His-Ub transfected 293T cells treated with a proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, we were able to observe polyubiquitinated CCNK but not CDK12 (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Therefore, we think FLAG-TUBE pulldown may not be as sensitive as His-Ub pulldown in detecting HQ461-induced protein polyubiquitination. We also note that His-Ub pulldown allows the solubilization and purification of polyubiquitinated proteins under denaturing conditions (8M urea), permitting the detection of polyubiquitinated proteins that may be insoluble in non-denaturing conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Use CDK12 mutants in the experiments in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We included CDK12 mutants in the experiments in Figure 4 per reviewers’ request (New Figure 4B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Redo experiment in Figure 4—figure supplement 1, to correct for loading and also blot for CDK12 ubiquitylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated in vitro ubiquitination experiments and blotted for CDK12, now loading is equal and lack of in vitro CDK12 polyubiquitination is demonstrated (New Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Cite Ebert paper and maybe discuss differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We cited Ebert and Winter papers and discussed differences of our studies in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes the identification of a molecular glue (HQ461; HQ for short) that promotes degradation of cyclin K, the activator subunit of CDK12.
