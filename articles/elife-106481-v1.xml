At present, however, little is known about how intracranial stimulation affects activity at the microscale. In this study, we recorded intracranial EEG data from a cohort of patients with medically refractory epilepsy as they completed a visual recognition memory task. During the memory task, brief trains of intracranial theta burst stimulation (TBS) were delivered to the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using simultaneous microelectrode recordings, we isolated neurons in the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex and tested whether stimulation enhanced or suppressed firing rates. Additionally, we characterized the properties of modulated neurons, clustered presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons by waveform morphology, and examined the extent to which modulation affected memory task performance. We observed a subset of neurons (~30%) whose firing rate was modulated by TBS, exhibiting highly heterogeneous responses with respect to onset latency, duration, and direction of effect. Notably, location and baseline activity predicted which neurons were most susceptible to modulation, although the impact of this neuronal modulation on memory remains unclear. These findings advance our limited understanding of how focal electrical fields influence neuronal firing at the single-cell level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intracranial EEG</kwd><kwd>single unit</kwd><kwd>theta burst stimulation</kwd><kwd>modulation</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS115723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Justin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K23NS114178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rolston</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0405n5e57</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH120194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Willie</surname><given-names>Jon Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF2124252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inman</surname><given-names>Cory</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF1747505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollearn</surname><given-names>Martina K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023 NARSAD Young Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Firing rate analyses revealed neurons throughout the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex in humans that exhibited heterogeneous responses to intracranial theta burst stimulation of the human brain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The amygdala is a highly connected cluster of nuclei with input from multiple sensory modalities and vast projections to distributed cortical and subcortical regions involved in autonomic regulation and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McDonald and Mott, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stein et al., 2007</xref>). Numerous studies have described the amygdala’s capacity to facilitate the encoding of long-lasting emotional memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolcos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LaBar and Cabeza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phelps, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phelps, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qasim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richardson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwabe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Specific oscillatory dynamics in the amygdalohippocampal circuit are increasingly understood to be essential in prioritizing the encoding of these salient memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qasim et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, direct electrical stimulation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) in humans has revealed a more generalized ability to enhance declarative memory irrespective of the emotional valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inman et al., 2018</xref>), likely by promoting synaptic plasticity-related processes underlying memory consolidation in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGaugh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McGaugh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roesler et al., 2021</xref>). These pro-memory effects were achieved with rhythmic theta burst stimulation (TBS), which is known to induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a key mechanism in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larson and Munkácsy, 2015</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that intracranial TBS may also enhance memory specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Titiz et al., 2017</xref>), evoke theta-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solomon et al., 2021</xref>), and facilitate short-term plasticity in local field potential recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herrero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). However, the extent to which exogenous TBS modulates activity at the single-cell level and whether this modulation is associated with memory performance remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we address this knowledge gap by conducting simultaneous microelectrode recordings from prefrontal and medial temporal structures during a memory task in which intracranial TBS was applied to the BLA. To characterize neuronal modulation, we contrasted the trial-averaged, peri-stimulation firing rates across stim and no-stim conditions; neurons were further classified based on their location, baseline activity, and direction of effect (enhancement vs. suppression). We predicted that intracranial TBS of the BLA would modulate spiking activity within highly connected regions (e.g. hippocampus) and improve memory task performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded single-unit activity from 23 patients (n=30 sessions) with medically refractory epilepsy as they completed a visual recognition memory task (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for patient demographics). During the encoding session of the experiment, each patient received either 80 or 160 trials of bipolar intracranial TBS to a contiguous pair of macroelectrode contacts in the BLA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for anatomical localization of stimulated contacts). An equal number of ‘no-stimulation’ trials were randomly interspersed to evaluate the effect of stimulation on memory performance and control for neuronal modulation resulting from experimental stimuli (e.g. image presentation). In total, we isolated 203 putative neurons from 68 bundles of 8 microwires each, distributed among recording sites in the hippocampus (HIP, n=95 units), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, n=44), amygdala (AMY, n=39), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, n=25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>); a subset of these units (n=47, 23.2%) was excluded from subsequent analyses because low baseline firing rates (&lt;0.1 Hz) limited the ability to robustly detect modulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microelectrode locations, unit counts, and experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behnke Fried-style macro/micro depth electrode (left) and microelectrode bundle locations projected in MNI space (right).

These results recapitulate our observation that units with higher baseline firing are most likely to exhibit modulation (though the probability of detecting modulation is lower for sparsely active neurons) and suggest that suppression in firing rate is not solely attributable to amplifier saturation following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Neurons exhibit heterogeneous responses to TBS</title><p>Recent studies have reported enhanced neural plasticity (via intracranial local field potential recordings and evoked responses) following repetitive direct electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herrero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, we hypothesized that recorded units would predominantly exhibit enhanced spiking in response to intracranial TBS of the BLA. Similarly, individual units exhibited highly variable responses to stimulation with respect to onset latency (rapid vs. delayed), duration (transient vs. durable), and valence (enhancement vs. suppression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The most common epoch for firing rate modulation was during the 1 s epoch in which TBS was delivered (25.0% of all neurons).

A similar trend was observed for modulation in the no-stim condition: 10.9% during, 5.8% post, and 1.3% for both.

Additionally, intracranial TBS was recently shown to promote region-specific short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herrero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2024</xref>) and entrain frequency-matched oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Solomon et al., 2021</xref>).

Here, we address this knowledge gap by characterizing neuronal firing recorded from microelectrodes in humans undergoing intracranial TBS of the BLA. Our experimental design focused explicitly on stimulation of the BLA, given our prior work that seeks to understand amygdala-mediated memory enhancement in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We observed neurons distributed throughout the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala responsive to direct electrical TBS. The effect of TBS on firing rate was heterogeneous with respect to onset, duration, and valence. Previous work characterizing local field potential responses to intracranial TBS observed similarly bidirectional effects throughout the brain suggestive of short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Few studies, however, have characterized the impact of exogenous stimulation on the spiking activity of individual neurons, none of which involve intracranial TBS. One study reported a long-lasting reduction in neural excitability among parietal neurons, with variable onset time and recovery following continuous transcranial TBS in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Romero et al., 2022</xref>). In a similar vein, it was recently shown that human neurons are largely suppressed by single-pulse electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van der Plas et al., 2024</xref>). Other emerging evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation may entrain the rhythm rather than rate of neuronal spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krause et al., 2019</xref>) and that stimulation-evoked modulation of spiking may meaningfully impact behavioral performance on cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fehring et al., 2024</xref>). An alternative approach has focused on the delivery of spatially selective microstimulation resembling the extracellular currents that normally modulate neuronal activity—this methodology has been used to bidirectionally drive neuronal firing in human temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Youssef et al., 2023</xref>) and enhance memory specificity for images following stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Titiz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although subsets of neurons from each region we sampled were responsive to stimulation, we observed the greatest difference in the proportion of modulated units across conditions in the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. This regional selectivity is to be expected, given that numerous studies have characterized how structural, functional, and effective connectivity among brain regions predicts the effects of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Solomon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stiso et al., 2019</xref>). We also observed that units with greater baseline activity were most likely to exhibit modulated firing rates following stimulation. Other studies have identified firing patterns and waveform properties that differ between inhibitory and excitatory neurons in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Van Quyen et al., 2008</xref>). For example, baseline firing rate disambiguates ‘regular-spiking’ and ‘fast-spiking’ neurons, which are presumed to represent pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. To test these hypotheses directly, we clustered neurons into presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on waveform morphology. In doing so, we observed ~85% excitatory and ~15% inhibitory neurons, which is very similar to what has been reported previously in human intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cowan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, stimulation appeared to modulate approximately the same proportion of neurons for each cell type (~30%), despite the differently sized groups. Recent reports, however, have suggested that the extent to which electrical fields entrain neuronal spiking, particularly with respect to phase-locking, may be specific to distinct classes of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Modulation in neuronal activity was defined by contrasting firing rates before, during, and after TBS across trials. In doing so, we were able to characterize coarse differences in activity indicative of enhancement or suppression. This approach, however, did not allow for analysis of more subtle, nuanced effects such as entrainment of spiking to individual bursts or pulses of TBS. Characterizations of rhythmicity in firing were challenging, given that most of the neurons we identified exhibit sparse activity with low baseline firing rates, and stimulation often resulted in further suppression of spiking.</p><p>Although stimulation artifacts resulted in amplitude threshold crossings that may be spuriously interpreted as a neuronal spike, we implemented several methods to mitigate the influence of nonphysiological activity. First, the characteristics of each unit (e.g. waveform shape) were manually inspected during spike sorting and further quantified using several quality control metrics (e.g. interspike intervals); stimulation resulted in a stereotyped response that was easily detectable and removed from subsequent analyses. Additionally, we tested for modulation both during stimulation and in the post-stimulation epochs—a period in which no artifact was present. Contrary to what would be expected if stimulation artifacts were falsely elevating firing rates, we observed predominantly suppression during stimulation and enhancement post-stimulation.</p><p>Since we collected our microelectrode recordings in the context of a visual recognition memory task, we tested whether stimulation resulted in a change in memory performance. Although we hypothesized that stimulation would improve memory performance, we did not identify an apparent stimulation-related memory enhancement when controlling for individual differences, in contrast to our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inman et al., 2018</xref>). The absence of such an effect may be, at least in part, attributable to the considerable variability that we observed in this cohort; indeed, baseline memory performance and individual differences have been shown to account for a substantial portion of the variability in this amygdala-mediated memory enhancement effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hollearn et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Several studies on rats have demonstrated that brief electrical stimulation of the BLA can prioritize the consolidation of specific memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass and Manns, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manns and Bass, 2016</xref>). These pro-memory effects emerged ~24 hr post-encoding and appear to be hippocampal-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2014</xref>), despite not resulting in a net change in the firing rates of hippocampal pyramidal neurons; instead, BLA stimulation resulted in brief periods of spike-field and field-field synchrony within CA3–CA1 in the low-gamma frequency range (30–55 Hz), which may facilitate spike-timing-dependent plasticity in recently active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass and Manns, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The present study did not investigate interactions between spiking activity and local field potentials because neuronal spiking was sparse at baseline and often further suppressed by stimulation; only a very small proportion of the total number of trials across all neurons exhibited ≥10 spikes in both the 1 s pre- and post-stimulation epochs (~2.5%). Although certain metrics are not biased by sample size (e.g. pairwise phase consistency), low spike counts can dramatically affect variance and, therefore, result in unstable estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vinck et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>How exactly the activity of single neurons is aggregated to produce local field potentials, which in turn interact with neuronal ensembles distributed throughout the brain, remains an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herreras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teleńczuk et al., 2020</xref>). One recent study that leveraged closed-loop stimulation targeting memory consolidation during sleep observed neuronal spiking with greater phase-locking to medial temporal lobe slow-wave activity following stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geva-Sagiv et al., 2023</xref>); neuronal phase-locking, particularly to hippocampal theta oscillations, has long been associated with robust memory encoding and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rutishauser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schonhaut et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoo et al., 2021</xref>). Further characterization of these spike-field interactions and refinement of closed-loop stimulation methods may provide a means for precisely modulating neuronal dynamics, for example, by entraining neuronal spiking that is phase-aligned to endogenous hippocampal theta oscillations to selectively enhance the encoding or retrieval of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hasselmo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hasselmo and Stern, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we performed an exploratory analysis of neuronal pseudo-population activity, which suggests that hippocampal neurons exhibit robust changes in firing rate coactivity in response to BLA stimulation. Related research has similarly described how BLA stimulation can induce synchronous firing of hippocampal neurons, which has memory-enhancing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass and Manns, 2015</xref>). Other studies have leveraged similar, low-dimensional representations of population dynamics to describe how coordinated neural activity facilitates inferential reasoning and memory retrieval within the medial frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Courellis et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Minxha et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a greater understanding of how neuronal coactivity may be precisely modulated by stimulation may help to refine therapeutic interventions targeting complex cognition and computation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>By characterizing patterns of neuronal modulation evoked by intracranial TBS, we provide new insights that link micro- and macroscale responses to stimulation of the human brain. These insights advance our limited understanding of how focal electrical fields influence neuronal firing at the single-cell level and motivate future neuromodulatory therapies that aim to recapitulate specific patterns of activity implicated in cognition and memory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We report results from a cohort of 23 patients with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent stereoelectroencephalography to localize epileptogenic foci (74% female, 19–66 years of age). All patients were age 18+ and able to provide informed consent. No exclusion was made concerning a patient’s sex, gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Surgeries were performed at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT, USA (n=10) and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO, USA (n=13). Patients were monitored continuously by a clinical team during their postoperative hospital course. Each patient signed a written informed consent form before participation in the research study; all study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah (IRB 00144045, IRB 00114691) and Washington University (IRB 202104033).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrode placement and localization</title><p>Numbers and trajectories of stereoelectroencephalography electrode placements were determined case-by-case and solely derived from clinical considerations during a multidisciplinary case conference without reference to this research program.

Data were aggregated across four highly similar experimental paradigms with minor differences in the content of visual stimuli, number of trials, stimulation parameters, and testing intervals.

Finally, the waveform shapes, interspike interval distribution, consistency of firing, and isolation from other waveform clusters were manually inspected for further curation and removal of spurious, nonphysiological threshold crossings that could represent stimulation artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Single-unit quality metrics</title><p>We calculated several distinct metrics to characterize detected units’ properties and assess the quality of our spike sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>): the number of units detected per microelectrode bundle, the mean firing rate (Hz) for each unit, the percentage of interspike intervals &lt;3 ms, the coefficient of variation across each unit’s spike train, the average presence ratio of firing in 1 s bins (proportion of bins which contain ≥1 spike), the ratio between the peak amplitude of the averaged waveform and its standard deviation, and the mean signal-to-noise ratio of the averaged waveform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Discrimination of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons</title><p>We calculated two metrics from the averaged waveform from each detected unit: the VP and the PHW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>); previously, these two properties of waveform morphology have been used to discriminate pyramidal cells (excitatory) from interneurons (inhibitory) in human intracranial recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peyrache et al., 2012</xref>). Next, we performed k-means clustering (n=2 clusters) on the waveform metrics, in line with previous approaches to cell-type classification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Intracranial TBS</title><p>We delivered direct electrical stimulation to the BLA during half of the trials in the encoding phase of each experimental session. Stimulation pulses were delivered immediately once the image was removed from the screen and in a patterned rhythm designed to entrain endogenous theta-gamma oscillatory interactions (i.e. TBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanslmayr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suppa et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, we administered current-controlled, charge-balanced, bipolar, 1 mA, biphasic rectangular pulses over a 1 s period with a 50% duty cycle. Stimulation pulses were delivered at a rate of 50 Hz and nested within eight equally spaced bursts (~8 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). A subset of experiments (n=7) used a lower current (0.5 mA) with variable pulse frequencies across trials (33 Hz, 50 Hz, 80 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Peri-stimulation modulation analyses</title><p>We first created peri-stimulation epochs (1 s pre-trial ISI, 1 s after image onset, 1 s during stimulation/after image offset, 1 s post-stimulation), with t=0 representing stimulation onset and the moment at which the image was removed from the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); identical epochs were created for the image-only (no-stimulation) trials. Each epoch was constrained to 1 s to ensure that subsequent firing rate contrasts were unbiased and to capture potential transient effects (e.g. image onset/offset). Units with a trial-averaged baseline (pre-trial ISI) firing rate of &lt;0.1 Hz were excluded from subsequent analyses because low firing rates limited the ability to detect modulation robustly. Units were designated as ‘modulated’ if either the during- or post-stimulation firing rate contrast was significant following permutation testing (described in Statistical approach). An additional contrast of pre-trial ISI vs. image onset was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of neurons to task stimuli (i.e. image presentation).</p><p>To investigate whether stimulation altered rhythmicity in neuronal firing, we analyzed the spike timing autocorrelograms. More specifically, we computed the pairwise differences in spike timing for each trial (bin size = 5 ms, max lag = 250 ms) and then contrasted the differences in the latencies of the peak normalized autocorrelation value between epochs (pre-, during-, post-stimulation). Only neurons with a firing rate of ≥1 Hz (n=70/203, 34.5%) were included in this analysis since sparse firing resulted in noisy autocorrelation estimates.</p><p>Finally, we measured modulation in MUA by filtering the microelectrode signals in a 300–3000 Hz window and counting the number of threshold crossings. Thresholds were determined on a per-channel basis and defined as –3.5 times the root mean square of the signal during the baseline period; activity during stimulation was excluded since stimulation artifact is difficult to separate from MUA in the absence of spike sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Population analyses</title><p>To analyze pseudo-population activity, we performed a linear dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) on a matrix of the z-scored trial-averaged firing rates of all neurons recorded across patients (<italic>sklearn.decomposition.PCA</italic>). This approach enables the identification of dominant patterns of coordinated neural activity that may not be apparent when examining individual neurons in isolation. Doing so allowed us to qualitatively examine the temporal dynamics of the dominant modes of neuron coactivity in a low-dimensional subspace, separated by experimental condition (stim vs. no-stim), region, and laterality relative to stimulation. The firing rate matrices for each condition were concatenated prior to PCA to facilitate direct comparison among the principal components; for simplicity, only the first three principal components are visualized. By collapsing across subjects into a common pseudo-population, this analysis provides a mesoscale view of how stimulation modulates shared activity patterns across anatomically distributed neural populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical approach</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted using custom Python scripts and established statistical libraries (i.e. Scikit-learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pedregosa et al., 2012</xref>], <italic>Scipy</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>]<italic>, Statsmodels</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>]). We performed two separate Wilcoxon signed-rank tests across trials on the during- and post-stimulation spike counts relative to their corresponding pre-trial baseline spike counts. To control for false positives, we compared the empirical test statistic against a null distribution generated from shuffling pre/during/post epoch labels (n=1000 permutations) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). An identical analysis was also performed on the no-stimulation (image-only) trials.</p><p>To test for differences in the proportion of modulated units (across conditions, regions, cell type, stimulation parameters, and behavioral outcomes), we performed a series of one- and two-sided Fisher’s exact tests. Next, we used Mann-Whitney U tests to contrast baseline firing rates among modulated vs. unaffected units. Behavioral performance during the memory task was calculated using d-prime (d’), defined as the difference in an individual’s z-scored hit rate and false alarm rate. Observed changes in recognition memory were split into two categories using a d’ difference threshold of ±0.5: responder (Δd’&lt;–0.5 or Δd’ &gt;+0.5) or non-responder (–0.5≤Δd’≤0.5). The threshold of ±0.5 was chosen based on the defined range of a ‘medium effect’ for Cohen’s d<italic>,</italic> which bears conceptual similarity to d’. To test the hypothesis that stimulation affected behavioral performance, we used a linear mixed effects model with d’ score as the dependent variable, condition and experiment as fixed effects, and session as a random effect; an additional test for differences among hit rates (percent of previously seen images correctly identified) was implemented using a paired-samples t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Firing rate control analyses</title><p>We performed a series of control analyses to test whether our approach to firing rate detection was robust. First, we performed a sensitivity analysis by systematically varying the baseline firing rate threshold used to exclude units from modulation analyses. The threshold for inclusion of units was varied from 0 to 3 Hz (0.1 Hz step size), and the firing rate analyses were repeated to quantify the proportion of units meeting inclusion criteria and the proportion of units designated as modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we performed a dropout analysis wherein segments of data near the onset of a stimulation burst were removed from the during-stimulation epoch (an identical segment was also removed from the pre-trial ISI and post-stimulation epochs). To this end, we removed a window of data starting at the onset of each burst spanning 0–60 ms (5 ms step size, eight bursts in train) and recomputed the proportion of units meeting inclusion criteria and the proportion of units designated as modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, to better understand the trade-offs with our statistical approach, we generated synthetic data with different baseline firing rates (0.1–5.0 Hz) and effect sizes (±0.1–0.7 Hz), then simulated the likelihood of detecting modulation across variable conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Software, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Software, Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration NCT05065450.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Utah (IRB 00144045, IRB 00114691) and Washington University (IRB 202104033).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-106481-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Patient demographics and clinical characteristics.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-106481-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Custom Python analysis scripts used in the manuscript are publicly available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Justin-Campbell/BLAESUnits">https://github.com/Justin-Campbell/BLAESUnits</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell, 2025</xref>).

It is written clearly and concisely, allowing readers to fully understand the analysis used.</p><p>The authors used a visual recognition memory task previously employed by their group to characterize the effects of basolateral amygdala stimulation upon memory consolidation (Inman et al, 2018). This current report presents an interesting analysis that complements the results reported in the 2018 paper.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Rare combination of human neurophysiology and behavior -</p><p>The type of experiment performed in the manuscript, which contains both neurophysiological data, behavior, and a deep brain stimulation intervention (DBS), is incredibly rare, takes many years to accomplish with tight collaboration between clinical and research teams. Our understanding of spiking dynamics of human neurons is very limited, and this report is an important piece in the puzzle that allows DBS to be used in future interventions that will benefit patients' health.</p><p>Multiple brain areas included -</p><p>It's important to note that the report analyzes brain areas with which the Amygdala has extensive connections (Fig. 1A) - Hippocampus, OFC, Amygdala, ACC. It seems that neurons in all these areas were modulated by the stimulation, except the ACC, in which firing rates were so low that only a handful of neurons were included in the analysis. This is an important demonstration that low-amplitude stimulation (even when reduced to 0.5mA) can travel far and wide across the human brain.</p><p>The experiment is cleverly designed to tease apart responses due to visual stimuli (image presentation) and electrical stimulation. Authors suggest that the units modulated by stimulation are largely distinct from those responsive to image offset during trials without stimulation. The subpopulation that responds strongly also tends to have a higher baseline firing rate. It's important to add that the chosen modulation index is more likely to be significant in neurons with higher firing rates (Figure S8). The authors discuss the tradeoff of using a nonparametric modulation index for vs. other methods (for example, percent change in trial-averaged firing rate from baseline).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

that doesn't explore quite enough. Critically, the authors make a point of mentioning that neuronal firing properties vary across cell types, but only use baseline firing rate as a proxy metric for cell type. This leaves several important explorations on the table, not limited to the following:”</p><p>1a: “Do waveform shape features, which can also be informative of cell type, predict the effect of stimulation?”</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we modeled our approach to cell type classification after Peyrache et al. 2012. More specifically, we extracted two features from the mean unit waveforms—the valley-to-peak time (VP) and the peak half-width (PHW). These features were then used to classify units into two distinct clusters (k-means, clusters = 2, based on a strong prior from existing literature), representing putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our approach recapitulated many of the same observations in Peyrache et al. 2012, namely (1) identification of two clusters (low PHW/VP: inhibitory, high PHW/VP: excitatory), (2) an ~80/20 ratio of excitatory/inhibitory neurons, and (3) greater baseline firing rates in the inhibitory vs. excitatory neurons. However, we did not observe a preferential modulation of one cell type compared to another (see newly created Figure 4). A description of this analysis and its takeaways has been incorporated into the manuscript.</p><p>Change to Text:</p><p>Created Figure 4 (Separation of presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons by waveform morphology).</p><p>Caption: (A) Two metrics were calculated using the averaged waveforms for each detected unit: the valley-to-peak width (VP) and peak half-width (PHW).

Next, we performed k-means clustering (n = 2 clusters) on the waveform metrics, in line with previous approaches to cell type classification.</p><p>Added a section in the Results titled “Theta Burst Stimulation Modulates Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons Equally”. Lines 370-378: “Using k-means clustering, we grouped neurons into two distinct clusters based on waveform morphology, representing neurons that were presumed to be excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) (Figure 4B). Inhibitory (fast-spiking) neurons exhibited shorter waveform VP and PHW, compared with excitatory (regular-spiking) neurons (I cluster centroid: VP = 0.50ms, PHW = 0.51ms; E cluster centroid: VP = 0.32ms, PHW = 0.31ms), and greater baseline firing rates (U(N<sub>I</sub> = 23, N&lt;<sub>E</sub> = 133) = 1074.50, p = 0.023) (Figure 4D). Although we observed a much greater proportion of excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons (E: 85.3%, I: 14.7%), stimulation appeared to affect excitatory and inhibitory neurons equally, suggesting that one cell type is not preferentially activated over another (Figure 4E).</p><p>Modified discussion of the effects of stimulation on different cell types. Lines 475-483: “…To test these hypotheses directly, we clustered neurons into presumed excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on waveform morphology. In doing so, we observed ~85% excitatory and ~15% inhibitory neurons, which is very similar what has been reported previously in human intracranial recordings (Cowan et al. 2024, Peyrache et al., 2012). Interestingly, stimulation appeared to modulate approximately the same proportion of neurons for each cell type (~30%), despite the differently-sized groups. Recent reports, however, have suggested that the extent to which electrical fields entrain neuronal spiking, particularly with respect to phase-locking, may be specific to distinct classes of cells (Lee et al., 2024).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1b: “Is the autocorrelation of spike timing, which can be informative about temporal dynamics, altered by stimulation? This is especially interesting if theta-burst stimulation either entrains theta-rhythmic spiking or is more modulatory of endogenously theta-modulated units.”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in suggesting that rate-modulation represents only one of many possible ways by which exogenous theta burst stimulation may influence neuronal activity. Indeed, intracranial theta burst stimulation has previously been shown to evoke theta-frequency oscillatory responses in local field potentials (Solomon et al. 2021), and other forms of stimulation (i.e., transcranial alternating current stimulation) may modulate the rhythm, rather than the rate, of neuronal spiking (Krause et al. 2019).</p><p>To investigate whether stimulation altered rhythmicity in neuronal firing, we contrasted the spike timing autocorrelograms, as suggested. More specifically, we computed the pairwise differences in spike timing for each trial, separating spikes into the same pre-, during-, and post-stimulation epochs described in the manuscript (bin size = 5 ms, max lag = 250 ms), grouped neurons by whether they were modulated, and then contrasted the differences in the latencies of the peak normalized autocorrelation value between epochs. Only neurons with a firing rate of ≥ 1 Hz (n = 70/203, 34.5%) were included in this analysis since sparse firing resulted in noisy autocorrelation estimates. Subsequent statistical testing of the peak latency differences between pre-/during- and pre-/post-stimulation did not reveal any group-level differences (Mann-Whitney U tests, p &gt; 0.05). Thus, we were not able to identify neuronal responses suggestive of altered rhythmicity (see Figure S5). A description of this analysis and its takeaways has been incorporated into the manuscript.</p><p>Of note, there are two elements of the data that constrain our ability to detect modulation in the rhythm of firing. First, the baseline activity recorded across neurons modulated by stimulation was relatively low (i.e., median firing rate = 1.77 Hz). Second, stimulation often resulted in a suppression, rather than an enhancement, of firing rate.

Given that many metrics are biased by sample size (e.g., number of spikes), which can vary considerably, computing the pairwise phase consistency (PPC) between spikes and LFP is a preferred metric (Vinck et al. 2010). Although PPC is unbiased, its variance nonetheless increases considerably with low spike counts; pooling spike counts across trials, however, decouples the temporal relationship between spiking and the LFP phase for each trial, confounding results and yielding an unstable estimate.</p><p>To determine whether such an analysis is indeed possible, we calculated the percentage of stimulation trials with ≥ 10 spikes in both the 1s pre- and post-stimulation epochs (a relatively low threshold for inclusion).

Or focus on individual sessions that do change in Figure 4A?) to make a stronger statement connecting the neural results to behavioral relevance.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the connection between the observed stimulation-induced neuronal modulation and effects on behavior is unclear and has proven challenging to elucidate. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we further focused our analyses on the neuronal modulation effects in the individual sessions that resulted in a robust change in memory performance (stimulation vs. no-stimulation d’ difference threshold of ± 0.5, based on a moderate effect size for Cohen’s d); both a positive and negative threshold were used to capture robust changes in memory performance associated with firing rate modulation, whether enhancement or suppression. To this end, we contrasted the proportion of modulated neurons in the sessions where stimulation resulted in a robust behavioral change (Δd’) with those that did not (~d’). We did not observe a difference in the proportions between groups when collapsed across all sampled regions, or when separately evaluated (Fisher’s exact tests, p &gt; 0.05; see Figure 5C).</p><p>Given that this approach did not further clarify the connection between our neural and behavioral results, we believe it is most appropriate to deemphasize claims in the manuscript regarding the potential insights for behavioral modulation (e.g., memory enhancement), and have done so.</p><p>Change to Text:</p><p>Toned down reference to the memory-related effects of stimulation in the abstract by removing the following lines from the abstract: “Previously, we demonstrated that intracranial theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) can enhance declarative memory, likely by modulating hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation…” and “…and motivate future neuromodulatory therapies that aim to recapitulate specific patterns of activity implicated in cognition and memory.”</p><p>Changed Figure 4 to Figure 5</p><p>Created Figure 5C (Interaction between behavioral effects and neuronal modulation)(C) Change in recognition memory performance was split into two categories using a d’ difference threshold of ± 0.5: responder (positive or negative; Δd’, pink) and non-responder (~d’, grey).

Our decision to limit each of the analysis epochs to 1s was chosen for two reasons. First, the maximum possible length of the during-stimulation epoch was 1 s (stim on for 1 s). Although the pre- and post-stimulation epochs could be extended without issue, we were concerned that variable time windows could introduce a bias, for instance, resulting in different variances between epochs. Second, we anticipated, both from empirical observations and prior literature, that the neural response following stimulation or task features (e.g., image onset/offset) was likely to be transient, rather than sustained for a period of many seconds. By keeping the windows short, we ensured that our approach to detecting modulation (i.e., contrasting trial-wise spike counts between each pair of epochs) captured the intended effect rather than random noise. We have incorporated a discussion of this rationale in the Peri-Stimulation Modulation Analyses section.</p><p>Change to Text:</p><p>Lines 156-158 have been added: “Each epoch was constrained to 1 s to ensure that subsequent firing rate contrasts were unbiased and to capture potential transient effects (e.g., image onset/offset).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: “This work coincides with another example of human intracranial stimulation investigating the effect on firing rates (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.28.625915">https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.28.625915</ext-link>).

One study reported a long-lasting reduction in neural excitability among parietal neurons, with variable onset time and recovery following continuous transcranial TBS in non-human primates (Romero et al., 2022). In a similar vein, it was recently shown that human neurons are largely suppressed by single-pulse electrical stimulation (Cowan et al., 2024; Plas et al., 2024). Other emerging evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation may entrain the rhythm rather than rate of neuronal spiking (Krause et al., 2019) and that stimulation-evoked modulation of spiking may meaningfully impact behavioral performance on cognitive tasks (Fehring et al., 2024).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: “What information does the pseudo-population analysis add?

The subpopulation that responds strongly also tends to have a higher baseline of firing rate. It's important to add that the chosen modulation index is more likely to be significant in neurons with higher firing rates.”</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that was not previously addressed in our manuscript. We suspect there are likely two factors at play worth considering with respect to our chosen nonparametric modulation index: neurons with lower activity require smaller changes in spike counts to be significantly modulated (easier to flip ranks), and neurons with higher activity empirically exhibit greater absolute shifts in the number of spikes. Our further use of permutation testing, while mitigating false positives, may also somewhat constrain the ability to detect modulation in sparsely active neurons. Nonetheless, given that many trials entailed few or no spikes, we believe this approach is preferable to alternatives that may be more susceptible to noise (e.g., percent change in trial-averaged firing rate from baseline).</p><p>To better understand the tradeoffs with detection probability, we performed a sensitivity analysis. We generated synthetic data with different baseline firing rates (0.1-5.0 Hz) and effect sizes (± 0.1-0.7 Hz) and simulated the likelihood of detection with our given modulation index across neurons. The results of the simulation support the notion that the probability of detecting modulation is lower for sparsely active neurons (Figure S8C).
