play a critical role in central immune tolerance by mediating negative selection of autoreactive T cells through the collective expression of the peripheral self-antigen compartment, including tissue-specific antigens (TSAs). Recent work has shown that gene-expression patterns within the mTEC compartment are heterogenous and include multiple differentiated cell states. To further define mTEC development and medullary epithelial lineage relationships, we combined lineage tracing and recovery from transient in vivo mTEC ablation with single-cell RNA-sequencing in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. The combination of bioinformatic and experimental approaches revealed a non-stem transit-amplifying population of cycling mTECs that preceded <italic>Aire</italic> expression. We propose a branching model of mTEC development wherein a heterogeneous pool of transit-amplifying cells gives rise to <italic>Aire</italic>- and <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing mTEC subsets. We further use experimental techniques to show that within the <italic>Aire-</italic>expressing developmental branch, TSA expression peaked as <italic>Aire</italic> expression decreased, implying <italic>Aire</italic> expression must be established before TSA expression can occur. Collectively, these data provide a roadmap of mTEC development and demonstrate the power of combinatorial approaches leveraging both in vivo models and high-dimensional datasets.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Specialized cells in the immune system known as T cells protect the body from infection by destroying disease-causing microbes, such as bacteria or viruses. T cells use proteins on their surface called receptors to stick to infectious microbes and remove them from the body. Some newly developed T-cells, however, contain receptors that recognize and bind to cells that belong in the body. If these faulty T cells are released, they can attack healthy tissues and cause an autoimmune disease.</p><p>After a new T cell is developed, it gets carried to a gland in the chest known as the thymus. Cells in the thymus called mTECs screen T cells for receptors that may bind to the body’s tissues. mTECs do this by presenting T cells with proteins that are commonly found on the surface of healthy cells in the body. If a T cell recognizes any of these ‘tissue specific proteins’, it is destroyed or given a new role in the body. Some faulty T cells, however, still manage to evade detection. One way to uncover why this might happen is to investigate how mTECs develop. Previous work showed that mTECs transition through various stages before reaching their final form. However, the order in which these events occur remained unclear.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of these developmental steps, Wells, Miller et al. extracted mTECs from the thymus of mice and analyzed the genetic make-up of individual cells. This uncovered a missing link in mTEC development: a new type of cell that is the immediate predecessor of the final mTEC. These ‘predecessor’ cells were actively growing, highlighting that mTECs can be constantly generated in the body. By probing the genes that generate tissue-specific proteins in mTECs, Wells, Miller et al. revealed that these proteins were only produced for short periods and in the late stages of mTEC development.</p><p>These findings contribute to our understanding of how mTECs develop to screen T cells. Mapping these developmental stages will make it easier to identify when faulty T cells are able to evade mTECs. This will lead to earlier detection of autoimmune diseases which could result in better treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>medullary thymic epithelial cell</kwd><kwd>immune system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE- 1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Kristen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 HG000205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinmetz</surname><given-names>Lars M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI097457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combination of experimental mouse models with single-cell RNA-sequencing creates a detailed map of medullary thymic epithelial cell development and identifies a transit-amplifying population as the immediate precursor to <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thymus is the primary site of T-cell development and is required for the establishment of central immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). Within the thymus, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) play a key role in enforcing tolerance by expressing a wide array of tissue-specific self-antigens (TSAs) that serve to eliminate potentially autoreactive developing T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Derbinski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lancaster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metzger and Anderson, 2011</xref>). The autoimmune regulator (Aire) protein plays a central and nonredundant role in the expression of a subset of TSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>) and is believed to function, in part, by modulating chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perniola, 2018</xref>). The transcription factor Fezf2 has also been shown to promote the expression of TSAs within mTECs in an Aire-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaba et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs are characterized by high levels of MHC class II expression in the adult thymus and have an estimated half-life of 12–14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2006</xref>). These mTEC-MHC Class II high cells (mTEC-hi) are thought to arise from mTEC-MHC Class II low progenitors (mTEC-lo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>) through inductive signals that include signaling through receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rossi et al., 2007</xref>). Within mTEC-hi cells, single-cell studies have shown that expression of TSAs is highly heterogeneous, with each cell expressing only 1–3% of all TSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Jenkinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brennecke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meredith et al., 2015</xref>). This heterogeneity is likely due to complex regulatory events that occur before expression of <italic>Aire</italic> and <italic>Fezf2</italic>.</p><p>Considerable effort has been devoted to identifying the progenitors of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs in the mTEC-lo compartment. It has been suggested that these progenitors express high levels of <italic>Ccl21a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Onder et al., 2015</xref>), which encodes a chemokine ligand known to regulate the migration of positively selected thymocytes into the thymic medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozai et al., 2017</xref>). However, disruption of these cells in mice without lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR) does not impact <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs, implying that <italic>Ccl21a-</italic>expressing cells may not be the precursors of <italic>Aire-</italic>expressing mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lkhagvasuren et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, thymic cells expressing Sca-1 were recently found to self-renew and generate both mTEC and cortical thymic epithelial cell (cTEC) lineages, suggesting these may be a bi-potent progenitor of early TEC development and further obfuscating previous work describing epithelial subset relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ucar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been utilized to define the mTEC compartment during neonatal and adult stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kernfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miragaia et al., 2018</xref>). Using this approach, we and others identified a previously unappreciated and highly-differentiated mTEC subset that bore striking similarity to peripheral tuft cells found at mucosal barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). Although scRNA-seq is a powerful tool for characterizing distinct cell populations, including minor and rare populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>), assigning precursor–product relationships is difficult based on gene expression alone. In the current manuscript, we reasoned that combining scRNA-seq with in vivo tools would better resolve our understanding of the developmental relationships between mTECs. First, we used a bioinformatic approach on scRNA-seq of control thymus to characterize mTEC lineage relationships. Second, we combined scRNA-seq with a lineage tracing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kretzschmar and Watt, 2012</xref>) in which the developmental relationships of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs and their progeny are readily discernible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2013</xref>). Third, we combined scRNA-Seq with a transient ablation model in which differentiation of mTEC-hi cells is selectively blocked after treatment with anti-RANK-ligand (RANKL) antibody. Inhibition of RANK signaling depletes the <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTEC population, which then recovers over 10 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2013</xref>). Using these approaches, we created a molecular roadmap of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTEC development that details the kinetics of TSA expression in relation to Aire and identified a transit-amplifying population of mTECs that we propose is the immediate precursor of the <italic>Aire-</italic>expressing and <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell classification of mTEC populations</title><p>First, we utilized a bioinformatic approach to identify TEC populations and lineage relationships at the single-cell level that could be subsequently validated using lineage tracing and transient in vivo ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Further, single-cell velocity predicted a branching model of mTEC development in which ‘TAC-TECs’ give rise to both the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ and ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), rather than a precursor-product relationship between <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing and <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Onder et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, ﻿this model also predicted a path to minor mTEC subsets, including the ‘Tuft’ cluster. Therefore, single-cell velocity analysis suggested that the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster populates the mTEC subsets observed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The TAC-TEC population is actively cycling</title><p>To further characterize the 'TAC-TEC’ cluster, we generated an unbiased list of all genes specifically upregulated in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

It had been hypothesized that a transit-amplifying cell exists in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>) therefore, we compared the transcriptional signature of the ‘TAC-TECs’ to the gene signature of a published transit-amplifying population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basak et al., 2018</xref>) and noticed a striking overlap. To test this overlap, we performed a hypergeometric test and determined that there was in fact significant enrichment of previously described transit-amplifying genes in the ‘TAC-TEC’ population (p=1.44×10<sup>−34</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

To test this we used cyclone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scialdone et al., 2015</xref>), an algorithm that determines cell-cycle state based on expression of cell-cycle genes, which revealed that the majority (104/123) of cells in the G2/M phase were located in the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

While mTECs are capable of expressing the majority of the protein-coding genome, little is known about the kinetics of TSA expression in vivo and how specific regulatory factors impact TSA expression during mTEC maturation. Performing pseudotemporal analysis on single-cell RNA-seq data can be used to predict lineage relationships and the order of events that occurs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loo et al., 2019</xref>). To provide insight into the process of TSA expression, we examined gene expression across predicted developmental time using pseudotime to computationally order cells. To accomplish this, we used the Fantom database to compile a list of TSAs by identifying genes detected in five or fewer tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brennecke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forrest et al., 2014</xref>).

Based on pseudotime predictions, TSA expression did not peak until well after the initiation of <italic>Aire</italic> expression and was maintained even after <italic>Aire</italic> expression decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). To determine if the increase of average TSA expression late in pseudotime was because of changes in the number of TSAs expressed or the expression level of TSAs, we observed both the percent of TSAs expressed per cell and the average expression of only the expressed TSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). The percent of TSAs expressed peaked late in pseudotime and followed the pattern described for all TSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In contrast, the average expression of only expressed TSAs did not show this pattern and instead increased gradually throughout pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). These results demonstrate that the number of TSAs expressed peaks late in pseudotime rather than the expression level of TSAs and suggest <italic>Aire</italic> expression must be well-established before TSA expression can occur.</p><p>To further dissect TSA expression patterns, we used previously described <italic>Aire-</italic> and <italic>Fezf2</italic>-dependent gene sets identified through characterization of the respective knockout animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaba et al., 2015</xref>). Although <italic>Aire</italic> expression was detectable in dividing mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), the pattern of <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent gene expression (a slow increase to peak levels followed by a decrease) was very similar to that of all TSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). <italic>Fezf2</italic> expression peaked earlier in pseudotime than <italic>Aire</italic> expression and, in contrast to <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent gene expression, <italic>Fezf2-</italic>dependent genes were expressed more uniformly across pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). To ensure the timing of gene expression over pseudotime wasn’t affected by TSAs, we repated the analysis after removing TSA genes from the ordering and observed similar timing of events across pseudotime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>).

Thus, bioinformatics can predict lineage relationships between mTECs but cannot, in isolation, prove those relationships. To provide experimental support for the predicted lineage relationships, we first utilized an <italic>Aire</italic> lineage tracing system in which <italic>Aire-</italic>expressing cells are inducibly and indelibly labeled with the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen after tamoxifen treatment (<italic>Aire<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Rosa26<sup>CAG-stopflox-zsGreen</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2013</xref>).

Because transient <italic>Aire</italic> expression occurs during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nishikawa et al., 2010</xref>), tamoxifen was used to allow strict temporal control of Cre recombinase activity as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2013</xref>). In this system, mice must be treated with tamoxifen to induce Cre translocation to the nucleus and initiate reporter expression.

However, once the Stop codon has been removed labeling is permanent and the reporter will continue to be expressed in cells after <italic>Aire</italic> expression ceases. Following a 10 day tamoxifen label, total TECs were purified by flow cytometry (EpCAM<sup>+</sup> CD45<sup>-</sup>) and subjected to scRNA-seq on the 10x Genomics platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

First, we used the gene-expression patterns from our initial bioinformatic analysis from control mice to provide putative identities to the clusters observed in the lineage tracing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Notably, there was strong agreement between the clusters identified in control mice and those observed in the lineage tracing mice, indicating lineage trace samples were comparable to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we examined the robustness of the computational lineage predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) by comparing the expression pattern of the ZsGreen lineage reporter to <italic>Aire</italic>. Specifically, in the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ cluster, 92% of cells expressed high levels of both <italic>Aire</italic> and ZsGreen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the ‘Late-<italic>Aire’</italic> cluster, 46% expressed both <italic>Aire</italic> and ZsGreen, while 43% expressed only ZsGreen, confirming prior widespread <italic>Aire</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The ‘Late-<italic>Aire</italic>’ cluster was also marked by a small number of cells (14%) expressing high levels of <italic>Krt10</italic>, which has previously been described as a maker of post-<italic>Aire</italic>, terminally differentiated cornifying mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Metzger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, 52% of cells in the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster expressed both <italic>Aire</italic> and ZsGreen but 18% of cells expressed only <italic>Aire</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This was expected because ZsGreen reporter expression requires multiple downstream events after <italic>Aire</italic> expression, including Cre<sup>ERT2</sup> translation, nuclear localization in the presence of tamoxifen, Cre-mediated Rosa-Stop-flox excision, and ZsGreen transcription and translation, which delay the kinetics of ZsGreen expression in comparison to <italic>Aire</italic>. This transcriptional lag provides a useful signature (<italic>Aire</italic><sup>+</sup>, ZsGreen<sup>-</sup>) that is indicative of recent <italic>Aire</italic> induction and was the pattern uniquely observed within the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, co-expression of ZsGreen and <italic>Aire</italic> in the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ cluster was nearly ubiquitous and consistent with established <italic>Aire</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). There were also 34% of cells that highly expressed ZsGreen in the ‘<italic>Ccl21a</italic>-high’ population but only 2% of these cells also expressed <italic>Aire</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To determine if ZsGreen was expressed in the <italic>‘Ccl21a</italic>-high’ population at the protein level, we performed flow cytometry on <italic>Aire</italic> lineage tracing mice treated with tamoxifen as above and stained for intracellular CCL21 protein. Approximately half of cells that expressed CCL21 also expressed ZsGreen reporter but 25% of these double-positive cells were MHCII<sup>lo</sup>, indicating that a subset of ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ cells are likely downstream of an <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The finding that <italic>Ccl21a</italic> cells are marked by ZsGreen is consistent with the pseudotime prediction that the ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ population is downstream of the ‘TAC-TEC’ population rather than the progenitor of the <italic>‘Aire-</italic>positive’ population. Taken together, these data are consistent with the pseudotime predictions and provide further support for the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster as the transit-amplifying population feeding the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ and ‘<italic>Ccl21a</italic>-high’ compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we again observed heterogeneity in the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster with some cells expressing <italic>Aire</italic> and other cells expressing <italic>Ccl21a</italic>, but rarely high levels of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

For example, if cluster 1 contained <italic>Aire </italic>lineage tracing cells classified as ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’, cluster 1 would be classified using this label. We found that gene-expression patterns between populations closely resembled those seen in the <italic>Aire</italic> lineage tracing experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>).

The decrease in all mTECs, and specifically AIRE<sup>+</sup> mTECs (both in absolute count and relative frequency) was also observed by intracellular flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Although the <italic>Ccl21a</italic> population appeared to expand following treatment with anti-RANKL, intracellular flow cytometry revealed no significant difference in absolute counts of CCL21<sup>+</sup>AIRE<sup>-</sup> cells at week four in treated and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Thus, only the <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing developmental branch was depleted by treatment with anti-RANKL.</p><p>If the ‘TAC-TEC’ population precedes the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ and ‘Late-<italic>Aire</italic>’ populations in development as predicted by single-cell velocity and <italic>Aire</italic>-lineage tracing, recovery should follow this chronological order after ablation. To test this hypothesis, we overlaid the predicted pseudotemporal ordering of the <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing branch from all samples generated by Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Street et al., 2018</xref>) with the RANKL time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Two weeks following treatment with anti-RANKL, the majority of remaining cells were located in the ‘Late-<italic>Aire</italic>’ cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). These ‘Late-<italic>Aire</italic>’ cells likely represented the final wave of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing cells immediately before RANKL blockade, consistent with estimates of mTEC half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Four weeks after treatment, cells at the earliest point in pseudotime began to return, while the number of cells late in pseudotime decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Six weeks into recovery, the cell populations recovering continued to shift further along the pseudotime axis, and by week 10, the cell distribution over pseudotime closely resembled that of untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) in agreement with immunostaining showing that anti-RANKL thymi at week 10 were indistinguishable from control thymi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khan et al., 2014</xref>). The close correlation of the in vivo recovery of the <italic>Aire</italic>-developmental branch and the ordering predicted by pseudotime provides strong validation of the pseudotime bioinformatic model. Finally, comparison of gene expression between the final timepoint and isotype control treated animals confirmed mTECs had fully recovered by week 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Thus, the pattern of mTEC recovery after transient anti-RANKL ablation provides in vivo support for the predictions made based on lineage tracing and bioinformatic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The TAC-TEC population contains cells primed for both the Aire and Ccl21a fates</title><p>Our data suggest the TAC-TEC population is a heterogeneous population consisting of a <italic>Ccl21a-</italic>expressing and <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing population.

Although the ‘TAC-TEC’ population was partially depleted after treatment with anti-RANKL, a small number of ‘TAC-TECs’ remained. Intracellular flow cytometry revealed that there were fewer Ki67<sup>+</sup> cycling cells (p&lt;0.0005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

To better understand the ‘TAC-TECs’ that persisted during antibody treatment, we performed focused analysis on all ‘TAC-TECs’ collected in the study (n = 511 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

Genes from the co-expression groups began to recover by week 6, had fully recovered by week 10, and all co-expression groups appeared to recover with similar kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).</p><p>To determine if fewer genes were detected because the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ population contained fewer cells following anti-RANKL treatment, we down-sampled cells from the week 10 control to the number of cells observed in each of the recovery samples. After down-sampling to equivalent cell numbers, we still observed fewer <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent and total TSA genes expressed after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d</xref>). The total number of genes expressed per cell did not change over the course of recovery although the number of total TSA genes per cell, and especially <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent genes, did decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d</xref>). Overall, the gene-expression patterns observed during recovery of mTECs mirrored the gene-expression dynamics predicted by pseudotime.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing with lineage tracing and transient in vivo ablation to establish a high-resolution map of events that occur during mTEC development. While other single-cell studies have identified similar sub-populations of mTECs, our approach has enabled, for the first time, the identification and validation of lineage relationships between these populations across the Aire branch of mTEC development. Critically, our conclusions extend beyond traditional bioinformatic analysis of high-dimensional single-cell data by including in vivo lineage reporters and an in vivo transient ablation model. In this way, we revealed a transit-amplifying population of mTECs which we dubbed ‘TAC-TECs’. We provide both experimental and computational evidence that ‘TAC-TECs’ are the immediate precursor of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing MHCII<sup>hi</sup> mTECs. The ‘TAC-TECs’ have a differentiating phenotype, including high expression of histone proteins, chromatin-modifying factors, and cell-cycle–related genes. The preponderance of factors associated with chromatin organization within ‘TAC-TECs’ provides transcriptional evidence that chromatin remodeling may occur immediately before high levels of <italic>Aire</italic> expression, and this temporal relationship may establish a permissive chromatin landscape upon which the Aire complex can act. The mechanisms underlying the extraordinary ability of mTEC-hi to heterogeneously express TSAs covering the majority of the protein-coding genome remain poorly understood. The observation of this transient state immediately preceding accumulation of high levels of the Aire complex may aid future studies directed at understanding how Aire accesses and interacts with the genome.</p><p>The identification of a transit-amplifying population immediately preceding the <italic>Aire-</italic>expressing mTEC-hi population is consistent with previous reports interrogating mTEC development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gäbler et al., 2007</xref> used BrdU labeling to demonstrate that cells from both mTEC-hi and mTEC-lo populations were post-mitotic, but a higher percentage (80%) of mTEC-hi cells were post-mitotic than mTEC-lo (30%). This is consistent with our observation that there is a higher frequency of cycling cells expressing <italic>Aire</italic> than cycling cells expressing high levels of <italic>Ccl21a</italic> and a higher rate of ZsGreen expression in the ‘Late-<italic>Aire’</italic> branch than the ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ branch. Gray et al. also showed that <italic>Aire</italic>-positive mTECs incorporated BrdU, consistent with our model that these cells derive from a cycling precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>). By flow cytometry, they identified a cycling population that they suggest may be a transit-amplifying population based on cell-cycle dynamics alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>). The rapid turnover of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs and their ability to recover from acute injury, such as treatment with anti-RANKL, further suggest a rapidly cycling precursor must be populating this compartment. While previous studies have suggested the presence of transit-amplifying cells in the medulla and that <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs follow a cycling population, we confirm the existence of a transit-amplifying population using defined gene-expression patterns and uniquely demonstrate that this transit-amplifying population immediately precedes <italic>Aire</italic> expression by leveraging both lineage tracing and transient ablation. Additionally, the high resolution of our single-cell data provides a detailed road-map of gene-expression events from the transit-amplifying population through the expression of TSAs.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing cells give rise to <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Onder et al., 2015</xref>). However, disruption of the <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing population has been shown to have minimal impact on the <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing compartment, arguing against a precursor–product relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lkhagvasuren et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Gray et al. demonstrated that mTEC-lo can give rise to <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTEC-hi with low efficiency, suggesting only a minor subset of mTEC-lo maintain this potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>). In the context of our findings, one possible explanation is that the mTEC-lo fraction included infrequent ‘TAC-TECs’ amongst the majority ‘Cc21a-High’ mTEC-lo. We therefore speculate that the mTEC-lo cells described by Gray et al., which eventually give rise to <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs, are in fact proliferating ‘TAC-TECs’.</p><p>We provide multiple lines of evidence that we believe support a model in which <italic>Ccl21a-</italic>expressing cells are not the progenitors of the <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs but are a distinct population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lkhagvasuren et al., 2013</xref>). First, single-cell velocity predicted the ‘<italic>Ccl21a</italic>-high’ cluster was a terminal population and identified ‘TAC-TECs’ as the precursor to ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ mTECs. Second, cycling cells were confined to the ‘TAC-TECs’ and were not seen elsewhere in the thymic epithelial cells examined. Third, the ‘TAC-TEC’ population was heterogeneous, with some cells expressing <italic>Ccl21a</italic> and other cells expressing <italic>Aire,</italic> consistent with lineage-biased transit-amplifying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang and Hsu, 2017</xref>). Fourth, half the cells in the CCL21 compartment express ZsGreen. This provides experimental evidence that a portion of the <italic>Ccl21a</italic> population is downstream of an <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing progenitor. Because most of the cells in the TAC-TEC population don’t express ZsGreen, this population cannot be downstream of the lineage-traced <italic>Ccl21a</italic> cells and therefore <italic>Ccl21a</italic> cells are unlikely the progenitors of the <italic>Aire</italic>-positive population. This finding is most consistent with the branching model proposed by this study. Fifth, treatment with anti-RANKL decreased the frequency of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing but not <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing cycling ‘TAC-TECs’. Because cycling <italic>Ccl21a</italic> cells persisted after ablation, absolute counts of ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ cells were not significantly affected by treatment with anti-RANKL while the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ subset was almost completely lost. Indeed, the observation that the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster can be subsetted into cycling <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing and <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing populations provides evidence that these transient amplifying cells are primed in a partially RANK-dependent manner to further differentiate in response to continued exposure to inductive signals. Taken together, we believe these results suggest a branching, rather than linear, model for mTEC development and raise exciting new questions about instructive signals other than RANK which are integrated at this critical bifurcation point.</p><p>Other recent single-cell studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref> have also identified a proliferating mTEC population that is very similar to the ‘TAC-TEC’ population presented here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref> used multiple pseudotime methods, including RNA velocity as we performed here, to determine lineage relationships between mTECs. Using diffusion pseudotime, the authors identified similar trajectories to our analysis but concluded that proliferating mTECs were downstream of the <italic>Ccl21a-</italic>expressing mTECs based on their RNA velocity data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhalla et al., 2020</xref>). While we combine multiple experimental techniques to support the branching model proposed here, aspects of both models could fit our data. For example, the <italic>Ccl21a</italic> population may contain a quiescent stem cell that transitions into a ‘TAC-TEC’ before becoming an <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing cell. In this scenario, it is possible that cells are blocked from transitioning from the ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ fate into the ‘<italic>Aire-</italic>positive’ fate in the presence of anti-RANKL leading to our observation of only <italic>Ccl21a</italic>-expressing cells in the ‘TAC-TEC’ population following treatment. Additionally, zsGreen-expressing cells in the ‘C<italic>cl21a-</italic>high’ population could be cells that are beginning to turn on <italic>Aire</italic> as they transition into an <italic>Aire-</italic>expressing state. Further validation including lineage tracing using methods such as SCAR-trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spanjaard et al., 2018</xref>) or isolation of the TAC-TEC population for evaluation of their ex-vivo differentiation capacity will be required to confirm which model is correct.</p><p>It is now well-established that <italic>Aire</italic> expression in mTECs is dependent on RANK signaling. However, the signals required to induce <italic>Fezf2</italic> in the thymus remain less clear. Both lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaba et al., 2015</xref>) and RANK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosway et al., 2017</xref>) signaling have been implicated by previous studies. While there is evidence that <italic>Fezf2</italic>-expression is RANK-inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosway et al., 2017</xref>), here we show that in adult thymus, <italic>Fezf2</italic> expression is generally independent of RANK. Notably, induction of <italic>Fezf2</italic> preceded that of <italic>Aire</italic>, <italic>Fezf2</italic> was expressed broadly within the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster, and <italic>Fezf2</italic> expression was largely unaffected by anti-RANKL antibody treatment. Curiously, while <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent gene expression peaked at the transition from ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ to ‘Late-<italic>Aire’</italic>, expression of <italic>Fezf2-</italic>dependent genes increased evenly over pseudotime. In sum, these data suggest that <italic>Fezf2</italic> is regulated differently than <italic>Aire,</italic> eliminate RANK signaling as a necessary driver of the <italic>Fezf2</italic> TSA axis and support the possible role of LTβ or other alternative regulatory pathways, as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaba et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our combination of single-cell sequencing with lineage tracing and recovery from ablation helps defines the lineage relationships between mTECs, identifies the transit-amplifying population that is the precursor of <italic>Aire</italic>-expressing mTECs, and details the functional steps that occur before TSA expression. Our data also suggests that the TAC-TECs may also be the precursor of the ‘<italic>Ccl21a-</italic>high’ mTEC population. These data and the high-resolution map of mTEC development will serve as a valuable resource to further dissect the functional steps of mTEC development and, ultimately, how T-cell tolerance and selection is maintained by this heterogenous population of cells. Lastly, this combinatorial approach provides a powerful framework for integrating in vivo reporter tools into transcriptomic datasets and can be applied to future studies aimed at generating high-resolution maps of development of other tissues and cell types.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Code availability</title><p>Plots were made using ggplot2 in R using our personal package that have been made publicly available.

Cell-cycle state was again determined using cyclone from scran.</p><p>Pseudotime scores were determined using slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Street et al., 2018</xref>) v1.1.0 with the ‘TAC-TEC’ cluster as the argument for start.clus. These pseudotime scores were used as the pseudotime values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. The density of cells across psuedotime for each sample was plotted using ggplot2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Further analysis of ‘TAC-TEC’ population</title><p>Cells in the ‘TAC-TEC’ population for each sample were subset from the Seurat of all samples using SubsetData with subset.raw = TRUE. Data from each seven new Seurat objects were normalized by using ‘LogNormalize’ method and data scaled with ‘scale.factor=1000’ from Seurat. For each sample, variable genes were found by using ‘FindVariableGenes’ with the following options mean.function = ExpMean, dispersion.function = LogVMR, x.low.cutoff = 0.0125, x.high.cutoff = 3, y.cutoff = 0.5. The top 1000 most highly variable genes from each sample were merged, keeping only genes that were present in all samples were used for CCA analysis. The 7 Seurat objects and the variable genes found above were used to generate a new Seurat object with the RunMiltiCCA function, using num.ccs = 10. The canonical correlation strength were calculated using num.dims = 1:10 and the samples were aligned using dims.align = 1:10. Clusters were found using the ‘FindClusters’ function based on the aligned CCA with the following options reduction.type = (‘cca.aligned’, resolution = 0.7, dims.use = 1:7, random.seed = 0). Further dimensionality reduction was performed by using RunUMAP using the options reduction.type = ‘cca.aligned’, dims_use = 1:10, seed.use = 0. Differential gene expression was performed by running FindAllMarkers. Genes were called differentially expressed if the adjusted p-value was less than 0.05 and the log fold change was greater than 0.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>UMI correction and cell down-sampling</title><p>A Seurat object containing only cells from the ‘<italic>Aire-</italic>positive’ population was created using SubsetData. UMIs for each sample were down-sampled to the number of UMIs in the week four sample using DropletUtils v1.2.1 downsampleMatrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffiths et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lun et al., 2019</xref>). Effectiveness of the down-sampling was determined by observing the number of dropouts of housekeeping genes before and after the down-sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3d</xref>). The percent of dropouts was computed by dividing the number of cells with expression values of 0 for each housing keeping gene (<italic>Chmp2a, Emc7, Psmb4, Vcp,</italic> and <italic>Gapdh)</italic> by the total number of cells for each sample. This was calculated before and after down-sampling UMIs for each sample.</p><p>Cumulative fraction of genes was determined for TSAs, <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent genes, <italic>Fezf2-</italic>dependent genes, and all other genes (genes not listed as TSAs, <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent, or <italic>Fezf2</italic>-dependent). For each gene list, a gene was counted as ‘expressed’ if at least one cell in a sample had an expression value greater than 0. The percent of the gene list expressed was determined by dividing the total number of expressed genes by the total number of genes in the list. The cumulative fraction of genes detected was also determined for the control samples before downsampling UMIs to determine the number of genes detected in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To determine the number of genes expressed per cell from each list, a gene was again counted as ‘expressed’ if its expression was greater than 0 for the given cell.</p><p>To determine the number of genes from each gene set expected for a specific number of cells from the 10 week control ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ population, cell_sampler from dropseqr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rdrr.io/github/argschwind/dropseqr/">https://rdrr.io/github/argschwind/dropseqr/</ext-link>) was used with ncells set to the number of cells in the ‘<italic>Aire</italic>-positive’ population in each sample. For each subsample of the control, the percent of observed genes from each gene set was calculated 1000 times. The percent values were used to create a distribution for each sample. The actual observed percent of the gene set was plotted as a red line and a p-value was determined using a z-score using the mean and standard deviation from the distribution of subsampled cells from the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Gene sets</title><p>The list of <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent genes was originally determined by comparing <italic>Aire</italic> knockout to WT mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sansom et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Fezf2</italic>-dependent genes were determined by performing differential expression of a <italic>Fezf2</italic> knockout to WT mTECs from a published dataset using a adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05 and a log fold change value of 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takaba et al., 2015</xref>). TSA genes were found using the Fantom database and curated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brennecke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forrest et al., 2014</xref>). Genes were called a TSA if they were observed in five tissues or less. All other genes were determined by taking all protein-coding genes and subtracting out genes from the <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent, <italic>Fezf2-</italic>dependent, and TSA gene lists.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sandy Klemm, Elisa Zhang, Mariona Nadal Ribelles, and Michael Sikora for helpful feedback and discussion.

The manuscript is well written and provides further validation of previously published data and offers new insights into the role of RANK signaling in mTEC differentiation. Another intriguing observation is the delay between AIRE induction and Aire-dependent tissue restricted antigen (TSA) expression, and the distinct kinetics displayed by <italic>Fezf2</italic> and its targets. Unfortunately, the authors do not appear to acknowledge all essential prior work that described similar populations and arrived at similar conclusions. There are also some key technical issues that should be corrected.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The TAC-TEC population appears to be the same as or very similar to the proliferating mTEC cluster characterized in Dhalla et al., 2020. While this earlier paper is cited in the Introduction, the authors should acknowledge that this past work identified a proliferating mTEC population that was predicted to give rise to both Ccl21-expressing mTEC (termed pre-Aire by those workers, possibly incorrectly) and Aire+ mTEC, by very similar bioinformatic approaches (Velocity).</p><p>2) One of the authors' major conclusions, that TAC-TECs give rise to both the Ccl21a-expressing branch and the AIRE expression branch of mTEC development, is not strongly supported by the current data. In particular, there is a possibility the TAC-TEC cluster contains with separate and developmentally unrelated precursors for Aire+ and Ccl21a-hi (and Tufts cell) mTEC populations. Given that substantial fraction of TAC-TECs is characterized by expression of Aire mRNA (reflecting an active Aire locus) (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and that a substantial fraction of this subset even expresses the Aire protein (Figure 2C) – one would expect a large fraction of the Ccl21 cluster to also be ZsGreen positive (like late mTECs or tuft cells). However Figure 3C, shows almost no expression of ZsGreen reporter in the Ccl21+ cluster. The authors also argue for their conclusion based on the co-expression of Ccl21 protein and ZsGreen reporter. &quot;Approximately half of cells that expressed CCL21 protein also expressed ZsGreen reporter but 25% of these double-positive cells were MHCIIlo, indicating that a subset of “Ccl21a-high” cells are downstream of an Aire-expressing population (Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). The finding that Ccl21a cells are marked by ZsGreen is consistent with the pseudotime prediction that the “Ccl21a-high” population is downstream of the “TAC-TEC” population rather than the progenitor of the “Aire-positive” population&quot;. However, these data appear to be line with previous findings suggesting that Ccl21+ cells (jTECs/mTEC-I) give rise to Aire+ cells. The likely explanation for this is that the Ccl21 protein persists into Aire+ stage (Lkhagvasuren and Kozai et al.) rather than the other way around. Moreover, there is evidence from other groups showing that mTEClo population in the adult thymus contains progenitors that give rise to mTEChi cells. If the mTEClo population consists of tuft cells, late mTECs and Ccl21+ mTECs, which of these cells gives rise to mTEChi cells? Ideally, the authors should define the TAC-TECs by unique surface markers, which would allow them to isolate this population and experimentally validate some of their conclusions. In the absence of clearer experimental evidence regarding the developmental potential of the 2 TAC-TEC populations, the authors should discuss alternative interpretations of their findings.</p><p>3) More characterization of the clusters is needed. For example, what proportion of the Ccl21a-hi cluster cells were ZsGreen+ (the text only specifies a &quot;small number&quot;)? Given that chemokines are secreted and present on surfaces of other cells, these double positive cells should be isolated, and Ccl21 expression verified by qPCR. What is the MHC II profile on the Ccl21+, Aire/lineage negative populations in Figure 3E and Figure 4D? While in Figure 1 the authors show that the TAC-TEC express low levels of Aire and <italic>Fezf2</italic> mRNA – the authors do not show other key developmental markers that traditionally define the mTEC compartment and its developmental stages. The authors should also include MHCII, CD40, CD80 or RANK (which becomes very relevant in the second part of the manuscript). Similarly, the authors should also include additional markers that were previously shown to define the mTECI and/or jTEC populations, such as Itgb4, Itga6, Sox4, Pdpn, etc.</p><p>4) Were genes considered as TSAs excluded from the list of ordering genes used to calculate the pseudotime trajectory? If this was not done, do the authors know if conclusions remain evident when the ordering genes are distinct from known TSAs?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60188.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The TAC-TEC population appears to be the same as or very similar to the proliferating mTEC cluster characterized in Dhalla et al., 2020.

However Figure 3C, shows almost no expression of ZsGreen reporter in the Ccl21+ cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional visualizations should be added in addition to the violin plot in Figure 3C to better represent zsGreen transcript levels. zsGreen reporter protein is readily detected in about half of Ccl21 protein-expressing cells by flow cytometry. Therefore, in zsGreen+ cells recombination of the reporter locus has definitively occurred and, given the mechanism of the lineage-tracing system, transcription will be driven by the constitutive CAG promoter and transcript should be present. To address this, we have provided an alternative visualization of zsGreen transcript that confirms it is detected in approximately 34% of the “Ccl21a-high” cluster. We have also included a table that indicates what percent of each population expresses all of the genes shown in the new visualization. Additionally, this analysis shows that 18% of the TAC-TEC cluster is Aire-, ZsGreen- indicating that some of the cells feeding the Ccl21a population may never pass through an Aire-expressing stage. We have added this data to the manuscript as Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 1 to provide improved clarity for the reader. We have updated the subsection “Aire lineage tracing mice demonstrate cellular relationships in the Aire branch of mTEC development” to include percentages relating to the expression in each population.</p><p>Finally, the distribution of lineage reporter may be related to the kinetics of cell turnover in the medullary compartment. For example, it has previously been shown that after 3 weeks of BrdU labeling, 80% of mTEC-hi cells were post-mitotic and only 30% of mTEC low cells were post-mitotic. Therefore, the Ccl21+ cells may have lower ZsGreen expression than, for example the late tuft cells, because a smaller proportion of the “Ccl21a-high” population has turned over and differentiated during the 10-day tamoxifen treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also argue for their conclusion based on the co-expression of Ccl21 protein and ZsGreen reporter. &quot;Approximately half of cells that expressed CCL21 protein also expressed ZsGreen reporter but 25% of these double-positive cells were MHCIIlo, indicating that a subset of “Ccl21a-high” cells are downstream of an Aire-expressing population (Figure 3E and Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).

The likely explanation for this is that the Ccl21 protein persists into Aire+ stage (Lkhagvasuren and Kozai et al.) rather than the other way around.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the flow cytometry data alone is not definitive evidence of the precursor-product relationship proposed in the manuscript. Instead, this model is constructed by considering the totality of both bioinformatic and wet lab findings. Indeed, examination of ZsGreen positive cells in the “Ccl21a-high” population has shown that only 2% of the ZsGreen positive cells also express Aire. Given the kinetics of this reporter system (in which ZsGreen lags behind Aire), this observation provides strong additional evidence arguing against Ccl21 expression persisting into the Aire+ stage and is instead suggestive of a population in which Aire was previously expressed (post-Aire).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, there is evidence from other groups showing that mTEClo population in the adult thymus contains progenitors that give rise to mTEChi cells. If the mTEClo population consists of tuft cells, late mTECs and Ccl21+ mTECs, which of these cells gives rise to mTEChi cells? Ideally, the authors should define the TAC-TECs by unique surface markers, which would allow them to isolate this population and experimentally validate some of their conclusions. In the absence of clearer experimental evidence regarding the developmental potential of the 2 TAC-TEC populations, the authors should discuss alternative interpretations of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>While we identify a population of cells highly enriched for actively cycling transit-amplifying TECs, we do not purport to identify stem-like progenitors. In Figure 2C of the manuscript, we show that surface levels of MHCII on Ki67bright TECs are considerably lower (on a log scale) than those on bona fide MHCIIhi cells. Furthermore, there is variability in the MHCII surface levels on Ki67bright TECs and some of these cells are definitively MHCIIlo. Finally, the levels of transcript for MHCII alleles within the TAC-TEC population are low compared to “Aire-positive” mTECs (see below, point 3 and new Figure 1C). Therefore, taken together, we believe these observations are fully consistent with previous reports that mTEClo (a broad concept dependent on the technical details of experimental design and data analysis), are likely to contain at least some Ki67bright cycling TECs and may also include even earlier stem-like progenitors not described here.</p><p>We agree that unique surface markers of the TAC-TEC population are critical for more robust characterization of this population. Despite significant efforts to identify such markers, putative markers we have evaluated to date have proved unsuitable (data not shown) and this work remains ongoing. Therefore, we believe that surface characterization of TAC-TECs is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and hope to provide such markers in future publications.</p><p>Finally, to underscore and acknowledge alternative interpretations of our data, we have added new text to the Discussion:</p><p>“Furthermore, Gray et al. demonstrated that mTEC-lo can give rise to Aire-expressing mTEC-hi with low efficiency, suggesting only a minor subset of mTEC-lo maintain this potential (Gray et al., 2007). […] We therefore speculate that the mTEC-lo cells described by Gray et al., which eventually give rise to Aire-expressing mTECs, are in fact proliferating “TAC-TECs”.”</p><p>“While we combine multiple experimental techniques to support the branching model proposed here, aspects of both models could fit our data. […] Further validation including lineage tracing using methods such as SCAR-trace (Raj et al., 2018; Spanjaard et al., 2018) or isolation of the TAC-TEC population for evaluation of their ex-vivo differentiation capacity will be required to confirm which model is correct.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More characterization of the clusters is needed. For example, what proportion of the Ccl21a-hi cluster cells were ZsGreen+ (the text only specifies a &quot;small number&quot;)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the improved visualization of zsGreen transcript in approximately 34% of the “Ccl21a-high” cluster, as well as in a subset of “Aire-positive” and “Late-Aire” cells directly address this comment (please see Discussion and data above under Essential revisions 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that chemokines are secreted and present on surfaces of other cells, these double positive cells should be isolated, and Ccl21 expression verified by qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that surface binding of chemokines could account for Ccl21 signal by flow cytometry and confound interpretation—especially of “double positive” events. To evaluate this possibility, we performed Ccl21 intracellular staining with and without intracellular permeabilization. The data in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 is gated on CD11c- EpCam+ CD45- TECs. Notably, even in the no permeabilization control, a small amount of Aire staining is still present. Therefore, setting the Ccl21 gate using the no permeabilization control is expected to provide an underestimate of true intracellular staining. However, using this stringent gating strategy, we still see events that are both Aire+ and Ccl21+, demonstrating that at least a subset of “double positive” cells contain intracellular protein and supporting our scRNA-seq observation of rare Aire and Ccl21 co-expressing cells. This data has been added to Figure 3—figure supplement 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the MHC II profile on the Ccl21+, Aire/lineage negative populations in Figure 3E and Figure 4D? While in Figure 1 the authors show that the TAC-TEC express low levels of Aire and Fezf2 mRNA – the authors do not show other key developmental markers that traditionally define the mTEC compartment and its developmental stages. The authors should also include MHCII, CD40, CD80 or RANK (which becomes very relevant in the second part of the manuscript). Similarly, the authors should also include additional markers that were previously shown to define the mTECI and/or jTEC populations, such as Itgb4, Itga6, Sox4, Pdpn, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided MHCII profiles for the Ccl21+ subset to Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and Figure 4—figure supplement 2B.</p><p>We agree that more mTEC markers would be valuable to the interpretation of the clustering analysis. Therefore, we have generated a heatmap using a curated list of key genes from the literature described in both low dimensional mTEC analysis and mTEC single cell analysis. We have added this data to the manuscript as Figure 1C. This heatmap includes genes used in previous studies to identify populations. The inclusion of these genes will allow the populations described in our study to be more easily compared to existing mTEC publications. Additionally, we have added MHCII genes (H2-Aa and H2-Eb1). At the RNA level, the expression of MHCII genes agrees with our analysis using flow cytometry, that the expression of MHCII by the “TAC-TEC” population is higher than the “Ccl21a-high” population and lower than the “Aire-positive” and “Late-Aire” populations. Finally, we added Pdpn, Itga6, Sox4, and Itgb4 as requested. All of these genes were primarily expressed in the “Ccl21a-high” and “cTEC” populations.</p><p>Finally, we examined the expression of Pdpn (gp38 by flow cytometry). Similar to the findings of Onder et al., we do see a small population of Pdpn+ EpCAM+ TECs that are MHCIIlo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). However, we find that the frequency of Pdpn+ TECs is quite low and that the vast majority of Ki67bright TECs are Pdpn-. Given the lack of definitive surface markers for the “TAC-TEC” population and the uncertainty of the relationship between Pdpn and “TAC-TECs”, we feel that a detailed discussion of Pdpn within the TEC compartment is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60188-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Were genes considered as TSAs excluded from the list of ordering genes used to calculate the pseudotime trajectory?

There were a small number of TSAs included in the ordering genes used to calculate the pseudotime trajectory. We have repeated the analysis without the TSAs included and it does not impact our results (and have added this data as Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). We have added a sentence reflecting this addition to the subsection “TSAs appear late in mTEC development”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
