The primary outcome was the comparison of viral clearance rates in the modified intention-to-treat population. This was derived from daily log<sub>10</sub> viral densities in standardized duplicate oropharyngeal swab eluates.

Monoclonal antibodies, mainly directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, have proved effective in preventing and treating COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Weinreich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">O’Brien et al., 2021</xref>), but they are expensive, require parenteral administration, and are very vulnerable to the emergence of spike protein mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bruel et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, large randomized controlled trials have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of early COVID-19 for the ribonucleoside analog molnupiravir and the protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir (in combination with ritonavir) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Jayk Bernal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>), but these drugs are not yet widely available, especially in low- and middle-income settings. There have been no reported randomized comparisons between these expensive medicines. In the absence of comparative assessments, and uncertainty over antiviral efficacy, national treatment guidelines vary widely across the world.</p><p>Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, considerable attention was focussed on available drugs that might have useful antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>). Notable and widely promoted repurposing candidates included hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and ivermectin. The macrocyclic lactone endectocide ivermectin was pursued after a laboratory study suggested antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caly et al., 2020</xref>). This in vitro activity, extensive experience in mass treatments for onchocerciasis, a well-established safety profile, and claims of clinical benefit, led to ivermectin being added to COVID-19 treatment guidelines in many countries, particularly in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mega, 2020</xref>). Several small clinical trials have reported a survival benefit for ivermectin, although the quality of these trials has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lawrence et al., 2021</xref>). Ivermectin’s relatively weak in vitro activity in relation to achievable blood levels in vivo has argued for the evaluation of maximum tolerated doses (c.600 µg/kg/day). The large TOGETHER platform trial excluded substantial clinical benefit with ivermectin in early COVID-19 infection. This was evaluated using a composite outcome of hospitalization or lengthy (&gt; 6 hr) emergency department visit (relative risk, 0.90; 95% Bayesian credible interval, 0.70–1.16), but the TOGETHER trial used a relatively low dose of ivermectin; 400 µg/kg/day for only 3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Reis et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To resolve the uncertainty over efficacy, we measured the in vivo antiviral activity of high-dose ivermectin in previously healthy adults with early symptomatic COVID-19 infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>PLATCOV is an ongoing open label, randomized, controlled adaptive platform trial designed to provide a standardized quantitative comparative method for in vivo assessment of potential antiviral treatments in early symptomatic COVID-19.

The trial was conducted in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok; Bangplee hospital, Samut Prakarn; and Vajira hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, Bangkok, all in Thailand (see Notes). The trial was approved by local and national research ethics boards in Thailand (Faculty of Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, Mahidol University, FTMEC Ref: TMEC 21-058) and the Central Research Ethics Committee (CREC, Bangkok, Thailand, CREC Ref: CREC048/64BP-MED34) and by the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC EC, Oxford, UK, OxTREC Ref: 24-21).

Previously healthy adults aged between 18 and 50 years were eligible for the trial if they had early symptomatic COVID-19 (i.e., reported symptoms for not more than 4 days), oxygen saturation ≥96%, were unimpeded in activities of daily living, and were willing to give fully informed consent and adhere to the study protocol. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was defined either as a nasal lateral flow antigen test which became positive within 2 min (STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, SD Biosensor, Suwon-si, Republic of Korea) or a positive PCR test within the previous 24 hr with a cycle threshold value (Ct) &lt;25 (all viral gene targets), both suggesting high viral loads. The latter was added on November 25, 2021 to include those patients with recent PCR results confirming high viral loads. This was the only change to the pretrial prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria included taking any potential antivirals or preexisting concomitant medications, chronic illness or significant comorbidity, hematological or biochemical abnormalities, pregnancy (a urinary pregnancy test was performed in females), breastfeeding, or contraindication or known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Randomization and interventions</title><p>Randomization was performed via a centralized web-app designed by MORU software engineers using RShiny, hosted on a MORU webserver.

Baseline investigations included a full clinical examination, rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody test (BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS IgM/IgG, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France), blood sampling for hematology and biochemistry, an electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph (following local guidance, but this was not a study requirement). After randomization, oropharyngeal swabs (two swabs from each tonsil) were taken as follows. A Thermo Fisher MicroTest flocked swab was rotated against the tonsil through 360<sup>o</sup> four times and placed in Thermo Fisher M4RT viral transport medium (3 mL). On subsequent days (days 1–7 and then after discharge on day 14), a single swab was taken from each tonsil (left and right, total of 2 swabs). Swabs were transferred separately at 4–8°C, and then frozen at –80°C within 48 hr. Thus, each patient had a total of 20 swabs.</p><p>The TaqCheck SARS-CoV-2 Fast PCR Assay (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to quantitate viral load (RNA copies per mL). This assay is a multiplexed real-time PCR method, which detects the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene and S-gene as well as human RNase P in a single reaction. RNase P was used to correct for variation in the sample human cell content. The viral load was quantified against known standards using the ATCC heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 VR-1986HK strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020. Viral genetic variants were identified using real-time PCR genotyping with the TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Panel. Plasma ivermectin concentrations were determined on days 3 and 7 using validated high-performance liquid chromatography linked with tandem mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tipthara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kobylinski et al., 2020</xref>). Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0 (CTCAE). Adverse event summaries were generated if the adverse event was grade 3 or higher and the adverse event was new, or increased in intensity from study drug administration until the end of the follow-up period. Serious adverse events were recorded separately and reported to the DSMB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Outcome measures, stopping rules, and statistical analysis</title><p>The primary measure was the rate of viral clearance, expressed as a slope coefficient and presented as a half-life. This was estimated under a Bayesian hierarchical linear model fitted to the daily log<sub>10</sub> viral load measurements between days 0 and 7 (18 measurements per patient. Each swab value was treated as independent and identically distributed conditional on the model). Viral loads below the lower limit of quantification (Ct values&gt;40) were treated as left-censored under the model with a known censoring value. The PCRs were done on 96-well plates, each of which included 12 standards of known viral density. The Ct values from the patient swabs were then converted to copies per mL under standard curves estimated using the control data from all available plates (a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random slope and intercept for each plate; each plate therefore has a slightly different left-censoring value). The main model used weakly informative priors (see Appendix 4). The viral clearance rate (i.e., slope coefficient from the model fit) is inversely proportional to the clearance half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>=log<sub>10</sub> 0.5/slope). The treatment effect is defined as the percentage change in the viral clearance rate relative to the contemporaneous no study drug arm (i.e., how much the treatment accelerates viral clearance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Watson et al., 2022</xref>). A 50% increase in viral clearance rate is thus equal to a 33% reduction in the viral clearance half-life. All-cause hospitalization for clinical deterioration (until day 28) was a secondary endpoint. For each studied intervention, the sample size is adaptive.</p><p>Under the linear model, for each intervention, the treatment effect β is encoded as a multiplicative term on the time since randomization: e<sup>βT</sup>, where T=1, if the patient was assigned the intervention, and 0 otherwise. Under this specification, β=0 implies no effect (no change in slope), and β&gt;0 implies increase in slope relative to the population mean slope. Stopping rules are then defined with respect to the posterior distribution of β, with futility defined as Prob[β&lt;λ]&gt;0.9; and success defined as Prob[β&gt;λ]&gt;0.9, where λ≥0. Larger values of λ imply smaller sample size to stop for futility but a larger sample size to stop for efficacy. λ was chosen so that it would result in reasonable sample size requirements, as determined previously using a simulation approach based on modeled serial viral load data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Watson et al., 2022</xref>). This modelling work suggested that a value of λ=log(1.05) (i.e., 5% increase) would require approximately 50 patients to demonstrate increases in the rate of viral clearance of ~50%, with control of both type 1 and type 2 errors at 10%. The first interim analysis (n=50) was prespecified as unblinded in order to review the methodology and the stopping rules (notably the value of λ). Following this, the stopping threshold was increased from 5% to 12.5% (λ=log(1.125)) because the treatment effect of casirivimab/imdevimab against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant was larger than had been expected and the estimated residual error was greater than previously estimated. Thereafter trial investigators were blinded to the virus clearance results. Interim analyses were planned for every batch of additional 25 patients’ PCR data, however, because of delays in setting up the PCR analysis pipeline, the second interim analysis was delayed until April 2022. By that time, data from 145 patients were available (29 patients randomized to ivermectin and 26 patients randomized to no study drug).</p><p>All analyses were done in a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, comprising patients who had &gt;3 days follow-up qPCR data. The safety population includes all patients who received at least one dose of the intervention. A series of linear and nonlinear Bayesian hierarchical models were fitted to the serial viral quantitative PCR (qPCR) data (Appendix 4). For the pharmacokinetic analysis, a previously developed two-compartment disposition model with four transit compartments adjusted for body weight was fitted to the plasma ivermectin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kobylinski et al., 2020</xref>).

There were no apparent differences in virus clearance rates across the different virus variants/subvariants; however, relative to the Delta variant, patients with the Omicron BA.2 subvariant had higher baseline viral loads (3.6-fold higher, 95% CI 1.4–9.4), and patients with the Omicron BA.1 subvariant had lower baseline viral loads (0.4-fold lower, 95% CI 0.1–1.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).</p><p>All analytical models of oropharyngeal virus clearance were in excellent agreement, giving near identical point estimates and credible intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Two patients had raised creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels (&gt;10 times ULN) attributed to COVID-19-related skeletal muscle damage. This improved with fluids and supportive management. The third patient was readmitted 1 day after discharge because of chest pain and lethargy. All investigations were normal and the patient was discharged the following day. Six patients reported transient visual disturbance after taking ivermectin (although not classified as grade 3 or above). Three of these withdrew from the treatment (Appendix 2). All visual symptoms resolved quickly after the drug was stopped. Ophthalmology review confirmed that no visual abnormality remained.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>These first data from the PLATCOV adaptive platform study show that ivermectin does not have a measurable antiviral effect in early symptomatic COVID-19 under our study methodology. In contrast, the preliminary results with casirivimab/imdevimab in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant showed an approximate 50% acceleration in the viral clearance rate. This confirmed that the study methodology identifies efficiently those treatments which have clinically relevant antiviral effects in vivo. It remains uncertain whether any of the proposed, and often recommended, repurposed potential antiviral treatments have significant in vivo antiviral activity in COVID-19. This continued uncertainty, after 3 years of the pandemic, highlights the limitations of the tools currently used to assess antiviral activity in vivo. Clinically effective monoclonal antibodies and specific antiviral drugs have been developed. It is increasingly accepted that they are most effective early in the course of COVID-19 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">O’Brien et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Jayk Bernal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Gottlieb et al., 2022</xref>) (whereas anti-inflammatory agents have life-saving benefit later in the disease process when severe pneumonitis has developed). Unfortunately, these efficacious antiviral medicines are not generally available outside high-income settings. Meanwhile repurposed therapeutics, which offered the prospect of affordable and generally available medicines, have been selected for clinical use based on in vitro activity in cell cultures, sometimes on animal studies, or based upon clinical trials which often had subjective or infrequent endpoints, or were conducted in late-stage infections in hospitalized patients. The majority of these trials have been underpowered. In a review of 1314 registered COVID-19 studies, of which 1043 (79%) were randomized controlled trials, the median (IQR) sample size was 140 patients (70–383) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">McLean et al., 2023</xref>). These uncertainties have created confusion and, for ivermectin, strongly polarized views.</p><p>The method of assessing antiviral activity in early COVID-19 reported here builds on extensive experience of antiviral pharmacodynamic assessments in other viral infections. It has the advantage of simplicity. It also avoids many of the limitations of unvalidated in vivo animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Muñoz-Fontela et al., 2022</xref>). Only a relatively small number of patients are needed to identify antiviral activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Watson et al., 2022</xref>). In this trial, with only 41 controls and 45 subjects receiving ivermectin, acceleration in viral clearance of more than 12.5% could be excluded with high certainty. Smaller numbers are required to show efficacy. These sample sizes are an order of magnitude smaller than required for the more commonly used endpoint of time to viral clearance (PCR negativity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Watson et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the procedures are well-tolerated: daily oropharyngeal swabbing is much more acceptable than frequent nasopharyngeal sampling. Oropharyngeal viral loads have been shown to be both more and less sensitive for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although rates of viral clearance are very likely to be similar from the two body sites, this should be established for comparison with other studies. Using less frequent nasopharyngeal sampling in larger numbers of patients, clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies, molnupiravir, and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, have each shown that accelerated viral clearance is associated with improved clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Weinreich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Jayk Bernal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>). These data suggest that reduction in viral load could be used as a surrogate of clinical outcome in COVID-19. In contrast, the PINETREE study, which showed that remdesivir significantly reduced disease progression in COVID-19, did not find an association between viral clearance and therapeutic benefit. This seemed to refute the usefulness of viral clearance rates as a surrogate for rates of clinical recovery. However, the infrequent sampling in all these studies substantially reduced the precision of the viral clearance estimates (and thus increased the risk of type 2 errors). Using the frequent sampling employed in the PLATCOV study, we have shown recently that remdesivir does accelerate SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Jittamala et al., 2023</xref>), as would be expected from an efficacious antiviral drug. This is consistent with therapeutic responses in other viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Natori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mellors et al., 1997</xref>). Taken together, the weight of evidence suggests that accelerated viral clearance does reflect therapeutic efficacy in early COVID-19, although more information will be required to characterize this relationship adequately.</p><p>The quantitative relationship between the antiviral effect and clinical response varies, as host factors and viral virulence are both important determinants of outcome. However, many of the studies showing improved clinical outcomes did so in high-risk, unvaccinated, and previously uninfected adult patients with SARS CoV-2 virus variants which are no longer prevalent. The magnitude of the effects measured is sensitive to study design and to temporal and epidemiological influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sigal et al., 2022</xref>). Direct comparisons between antiviral drugs using the clinical endpoints of the published phase III studies therefore leave much uncertainty.</p><p>This trial has several limitations. It set a futility threshold of &lt;12.5% acceleration of viral clearance, as currently available specific antiviral therapies provide approximately 30–50% acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Jayk Bernal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hammond et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Robinson et al., 2022</xref>). It does not exclude smaller antiviral effects, or benefit from a non-antiviral effect (e.g., an immunomodulatory effect). Whether a smaller antiviral effect would warrant recommendation in treatment is debatable, but it could still be very useful in prevention, which requires less potent viral suppression for a clinical benefit. It is also uncertain whether the daily sampling schedule is the optimal balance between statistical power and trial feasibility and acceptability. This could change as continued viral evolution and increasing vaccine coverage potentially affect viral clearance parameters. There is substantial variability in estimated serial viral loads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whether variability can be reduced by adjusting for extracellular fluid content or different sampling techniques is uncertain. The viral qPCR measures viral genomes and does not distinguish between live (potentially transmissible) and dead virus. Finally, although not primarily a safety study, the lack of blinding compromises safety or tolerability assessments.</p><p>In summary, high-dose ivermectin did not have measurable antiviral activity in early symptomatic COVID-19. This study provides no support for the continued use of ivermectin in COVID-19. Efficient characterization and comparison of potential antiviral therapeutics in COVID-19 will be important for policy recommendations, particularly while cost and availability limit access. Use of the rate of oropharyngeal viral clearance as a metric for antiviral efficacy has applicability beyond COVID-19 including other respiratory illnesses, notably influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), novel coronaviruses and future, as yet unknown, respiratory illnesses.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con26"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con27"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con28"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con29"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con30"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con31"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con32"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con33"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con34"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con35"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con36"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con37"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration NCT05041907.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The trial was approved by local and national research ethics boards in Thailand (Faculty of Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, Mahidol University, FTMEC Ref: TMEC 21-058) and the Central Research Ethics Committee (CREC, Bangkok, Thailand, CREC Ref: CREC048/64BP-MED34) and by the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC, Oxford, UK, OxTREC Ref: 24-21).

All models encode residual error as a t-distribution with degrees of freedom estimated from the data. The t-distribution was chosen for robustness as the residual error is clearly non-Gaussian. The t-distribution error model also makes the model robust against model mis-specification (particularly for the linear models) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lange et al., 1989</xref>). All models include correlated individual random effect terms for both the intercept (baseline viral load) and the slope. All changes to the slope are defined as multiplicative changes on the log scale (a value of 0 equals no change).</p><p>The treatment effect is defined as the proportional change (expressed as a multiplicative term) in the population slope of the daily change in log<sub>10</sub> viral load. The data are modeled on the log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL scale, after conversion from Ct values using the standard curve generated from the 12 control concentrations ( samples with known viral densities) from each 96-well plate. The standard curve transformation is done by fitting a linear mixed effects model (random slope and random intercept for each plate) to the control data: regressing the Ct values on the known log viral densities. This borrows information across plates and allows for batch effects.</p><p>For all models, we adjusted the intercept and slope for the enrolling site (three sites in total, the reference site is the Hospital of Tropical Diseases which recruited &gt;90% of patients) and for the variant called (Delta is reference: BA.1 and BA.2 are the two alternatives).

The main papers describing the efficacy of the specific monoclonal antibodies (notably casivirimab and imdevimab) and of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir (which we have referenced [1,4,5]) have noted that viral clearance was accelerated with these interventions, each of which was associated with therapeutic benefit (prevention of hospitalisation). Viral clearance was used as the pharmacodynamic end-point in the molnupiravir dose finding studies (Ref 1 below). However, in each of these studies, viral loads were assessed infrequently, which substantially reduced the precision of the estimate of viral clearance rate (rates were not specifically measured in these studies). In contrast, the PINETREE study [16] of remdesivir did not find a relationship between therapeutic efficacy (prevention of disease progression) and viral clearance, although again sampling was infrequent (increasing the possibility of a type 2 error). In contrast, using the more sensitive and precise methodology described in this paper, we have shown clearly that remdesivir does accelerate viral clearance, as would be expected from an efficacious antiviral drug. We have now made these points in the discussion (lines 377-382):</p><p>“Using less frequent nasopharyngeal sampling in larger numbers of patients, clinical trials of monoclonal antibodies, molnupiravir and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, have each shown that accelerated viral clearance is associated with improved clinical outcomes [1,4,5]. These data suggest reduction in viral load could be used as a surrogate of clinical outcome in COVID-19. In contrast the PINETREE study, which showed that remdesivir significantly reduced disease progression in COVID-19, did not find an association between viral clearance and therapeutic benefit. This seemed to refute the usefulness of viral clearance rates as a surrogate for rates of clinical recovery . However, the infrequent sampling in all these studies substantially reduced the precision of the viral clearance estimates (and thus increased the risk of type 2 errors). Using the frequent sampling employed in the PLATCOV study, we have shown recently that remdesivir does accelerate SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance [17], as would be expected from an efficacious antiviral drug. This is consistent with therapeutic responses in other viral infections [18, 19]. Taken together the weight of evidence suggests that accelerated viral clearance does reflect therapeutic efficacy”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarify the unblinding rules.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text explaining how the interim analyses were performed (frequency). The interim analyses were sent to the DSMB who reviewed the data and analysis and ratified the decision to stop a treatment arm once a stopping rule was met.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Describe in more detail how swabs from different sires are processed.</p></disp-quote><p>Swabs from all sites are taken and processed the same way. Identical swabs and viral transport media (VTM) were used in each site, and each person doing the swabbing was trained to use a standardised swabbing technique. Lines 161-165:</p><p>“A Thermo Fisher MicroTest flocked swab was rotated against the tonsil through 360<sup>o</sup> four times and placed in Thermo Fisher M4RT viral transport medium (3mL). On subsequent days (day 1 to day 7 and then after discharge on day 14), a single swab was taken from each tonsil (left and right, total of 2 swabs). Swabs were transferred separately at 4-8<sup>o</sup>C, aliquoted and then frozen at -80<sup>o</sup>C within 48hrs.”</p><p>The VTM was frozen at sites and then transported at -80<sup>o</sup>C to the central laboratory in the Faculty of Tropical Medicine (FTM), Mahidol University, Bangkok for further testing, whereby all the onward processing and testing was identical.</p><p>The only difference in the processing between sites was that the swab VTM in FTM was aliquoted prior to freezing at -80<sup>o</sup>C, whereas the swab VTM in other sites was frozen and aliquoted after defrosting, immediately prior to testing. As all samples had the same number of freeze-thaws prior to testing (i.e. one), the processing can be considered to be the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Describe allocation into the study arms.</p></disp-quote><p>The randomization was uniform across intervention arms with a minimum of 20% of patients allocated to no study drug. Lines 143-147:</p><p>“The no study drug arm comprised a minimum proportion of 20% and uniform randomization ratios were then applied across the treatment arms. For example, for five intervention arms plusthe no study drug arm, 20% of patients would be randomized to no study drug and 16% to each of the 5 interventions. Additional details on the randomization are provided in the Appendices.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Describe how the modeling accounts for viral rebound and undetectable viral load measures.</p></disp-quote><p>The models intentionally do not account for viral rebound which, if it occurs, usually does so after one week.</p><p>Undetectable viral loads are formally accounted for by treating them as left censored (the model likelihood is equal to cumulative density function).</p><p>We have added to the Methods. Lines 185-191:</p><p>“Viral loads below the lower limit of quantification (Ct values &gt;40) were treated as left-censored under the model with a known censoring value. The PCRs were done on 96 well plates, each of which included 12 standards of known viral density. The Ct values from the patient swabs were then converted to copies per mL under standard curves estimated using the control data from all available plates (a mixed-effects linear regression model with a random slope and intercept for each plate; each plate therefore has a slightly different left-censoring value).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Provide more precise language to discriminate clinical significance from statistical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This reviewer wishes to compliment the authors on this highly important collaboration, which is bringing innovative clinical science of global importance, with translatability across many settings, whether in high-income or low and middle-income countries with limited access to therapeutics.
