metastasis by serving as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac. The enzyme is synergistically activated by PIP<sub>3</sub> and heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, but mechanistic details remain poorly understood. While investigating the regulation of P-Rex1 by PIP<sub>3</sub>, we discovered that Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> (IP<sub>4</sub>) inhibits P-Rex1 activity and induces large decreases in backbone dynamics in diverse regions of the protein. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex revealed a conformation wherein the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain occludes the active site of the Dbl homology (DH) domain. This configuration is stabilized by interactions between the first DEP domain (DEP1) and the DH domain and between the PH domain and a 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain that extends from the C-terminal domain of P-Rex1. Disruption of the DH–DEP1 interface in a DH/PH-DEP1 fragment enhanced activity and led to a more extended conformation in solution, whereas mutations that constrain the occluded conformation led to decreased GEF activity. Variants of full-length P-Rex1 in which the DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interfaces were disturbed exhibited enhanced activity during chemokine-induced cell migration, confirming that the observed structure represents the autoinhibited state in living cells. Interactions with PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes led to disruption of these interfaces and increased dynamics protein-wide. Our results further suggest that inositol phosphates such as IP<sub>4</sub> help to inhibit basal P-Rex1 activity in neutrophils, similar to their inhibitory effects on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>RhoGEF</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>PIP<sub>3</sub></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>)-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) is a Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) abundantly expressed in neutrophils that mediates chemotaxis and the generation of reactive oxygen species via activation of Rac GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorseuil et al., 1992</xref>). The protein is comprised of a catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, two DEP domains (DEP1 and DEP2), two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2), and a C-terminal inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase-like (IP4P) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IP<sub>4</sub> binding causes dynamic changes in multiple domains of P-Rex1 and inhibits PIP<sub>3</sub>-induced activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Difference hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) data plotted onto the domain layout of P-Rex1.

Although relatively little is known about how P-Rex1 transitions to an activated state, recent structural studies have defined their docking sites. Gβγ engages a scaffold composed of an amalgamation of the DEP2-PDZ1-PDZ2-IP4P domains and likely helps recruit P-Rex1 to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, PIP<sub>3</sub> binds to the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2005</xref>) in a basic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>), but this is not necessary for its recruitment to the cell membrane, implying that PIP<sub>3</sub> instead induces a conformational change that activates the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). Because domains C-terminal to the catalytic DH domain are well known to be involved in autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chávez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Urano et al., 2008</xref>), the allosteric change induced by PIP<sub>3</sub> must defeat interdomain contacts and render the catalytic DH domain accessible to its substrate.</p><p>Here, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), single-particle analysis (SPA), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) along with functional studies and live cell experiments to show that activation of P-Rex1 involves disruption of two different inhibitory interfaces between domains across the length of the protein. Surprisingly, we found that the PIP<sub>3</sub> headgroup analog IP<sub>4</sub> can reduce P-Rex1 activity by stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of the enzyme at physiologically relevant concentrations, suggesting a previously unknown, additional mechanism of regulation. Our experiments further suggest that P-Rex1 binding to PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing membranes induces conformational changes that unwind P-Rex1 into a fully active state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IP<sub>4</sub> induces protection from deuterium incorporation on regions of P-Rex1 distal from the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site</title><p>Previous work suggested that PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to the PH domain activates P-Rex1 purely through an allosteric mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we anticipated that binding of the soluble headgroup of PIP<sub>3</sub>, IP<sub>4</sub>, to full-length P-Rex1 could also lead to conformational changes characteristic of the activated state. To test this, we analyzed P-Rex1 in the presence and absence of IP<sub>4</sub> using HDX-MS. We observed strong protection from deuterium incorporation in the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site on the PH domain in the presence of IP<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, we also observed strong protection in other regions of the protein: namely on the surface of the PH domain, particularly in the β5/β6 loop, and in several regions within an extension of the C-terminal IP4P domain that was not visualized in the P-Rex1–Gβγ complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). We speculated that these diverse regions form more stable long-range interactions in the presence of IP<sub>4</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IP<sub>4</sub> allosterically inhibits P-Rex1</title><p>Based on our HDX-MS data, we hypothesized that IP<sub>4</sub> could inhibit activity of full-length P-Rex1. Using an in vitro GEF activity assay on soluble Cdc42 in the presence of liposomes, we observed that IP<sub>4</sub> inhibits PIP<sub>3</sub>-mediated activation of P-Rex1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.4 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Competition was not observed with Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, indicating that inhibition is dependent on the 3-phosphate, which is critical for PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to the P-Rex1 PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). However, IP<sub>4</sub> did not affect the activity of the P-Rex1 DH/PH or DH/PH-DEP1 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Collectively, these results indicated that IP<sub>4</sub> inhibits P-Rex1 allosterically and that this inhibition is dependent on long-range interactions between the regions shown to be protected by IP<sub>4</sub> in the Gβγ-binding scaffold (DEP2-PDZ1-PDZ2-IP4P) and in the DH/PH-DEP1 module. Negatively charged liposomes (containing PC/PS), including those that also contain PIP<sub>3</sub>, inhibit the GEF activity of the DH/PH-DEP1 and DH/PH fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because full-length P-Rex1 is not affected by PC/PS liposomes, this suggests that the observed inhibition represents a non-productive interaction of the DH/PH-DEP1 and DH/PH fragments with negatively charged surfaces in our assay. The lack of activation of DH/PH-DEP1 by PIP<sub>3</sub> prevents us from testing in this assay whether IP<sub>4</sub> can inhibit via direct competition with PIP<sub>3</sub> at the PH domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IP<sub>4</sub> stabilizes long-range interactions mediated by the P-Rex1 DEP1 and PH domains</title><p>To understand the molecular basis of IP<sub>4</sub>-mediated stabilization and inhibition, we analyzed full-length P-Rex1 with and without IP<sub>4</sub> using cryo-EM SPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Initial datasets were collected using a Glacios transmission electron microscope and then processed through 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). In both datasets, most classes showed only the Gβγ-binding core of P-Rex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). A few classes contained particles with additional mass to the side of the core, close to the PDZ or DEP domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, orange boxes). This mass could represent either the N-terminal domains or another P-Rex1 particle in proximity. Only in the sample containing IP<sub>4</sub> could we observe class averages with additional mass next to the core opposite the side that binds Gβγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, green boxes). Based on its size, location, our HDX-MS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and low-resolution maps of P-Rex1 generated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>), this mass most likely corresponded to the N-terminal DH/PH-DEP1 domains interacting with an elongated subdomain extending from the IP4P domain.</p><p>We next collected much larger datasets on the P-Rex1·IP<sub>4</sub> complex using a Krios transmission electron microscope and determined the structure of this complex at an average resolution of 4.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar to the P-Rex1–Gβγ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>), this sample exhibited a preferred orientation on grids, necessitating the addition of data collected on a tilted sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>). The resulting 3D reconstruction clearly shows the Gβγ-binding core, composed of DEP2, PDZ1, PDZ2, and the majority of the IP4P domain, from which there are two extensions of density that contact one another to form a loop-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). One extension corresponds to a large insertion in the IP4P domain that contains IP<sub>4</sub>-stabilized regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and that was disordered in the P-Rex1–Gβγ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). The ordered elements of the insertion form a long 4-helix bundle (4HB) most similar in fold to focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2002</xref>), which are found in other peripheral membrane proteins involved in cell adhesion and migration. The other extension corresponds to the DH/PH-DEP1 domains. Based on its distinct shape, the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>) was fit into density along the side of the 4HB. Here, IP<sub>4</sub> is observed bound to the PH domain PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). The position of the DH domain was also obvious, but individual helices of the DH domain were lower in resolution and more dynamic relative to the rest of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The relative positions of the DH and PH domains mandate a severe bend in the helix connecting the DH and PH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), resulting in a jack-knifed configuration of the DH/PH module that blocks access to the GTPase binding site on the DH domain. The remaining mass, immediately adjacent to the end of the DH domain opposite its N-terminus, corresponds to DEP1. Using the required connectivity of its N- and C-termini to the PH and DEP2 domains, respectively, DEP1 was docked in a manner that complemented residues on the DH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Weak density corresponding to a long five-turn extension of the αC helix of the PH domain connects to the N-terminus of DEP1, but its C-terminal connection to DEP2 is disordered, likely explaining lower local resolution in the DEP1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

However, because different PH domain ligands uniquely perturb the conformation of these regions in the PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>), IP<sub>4</sub> could indirectly stabilize this interface by trapping the β1 and β2 strands and β5/β6 loop in a conformation with higher affinity for 4HB.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and cryo-EM data support the conclusion that IP<sub>4</sub> stabilizes a closed conformation of P-Rex1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Difference HDX-MS data plotted onto the structure of the P-Rex1 bound to IP<sub>4</sub>.

Leu173 and Leu177 were previously noted to be conspicuously exposed in structures of the DH/PH tandem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>).

Overall, the domain organization is very similar, but there is an ~3° rotation of the Gβγ-binding core in the IP<sub>4</sub> complex relative to the PH–4HB interface such that DEP1 and DEP2 move closer together. It is possible that the binding of IP<sub>4</sub> at this interface drives this conformational change. A caveat is that the protein used for the 7SYF structure contained a T4 lysozyme domain inserted into the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain. Although this domain was not visible in the reconstruction, its proximity to the IP<sub>4</sub> binding site may influence the global conformation of P-Rex1. The similarities between P-Rex1 ± IP<sub>4</sub> also suggest that the IP<sub>4</sub>-binding site in the PH domain is freely accessible in the autoinhibited state. PIP<sub>3</sub> would, however, not have access because the 4HB domain would block binding to a membrane surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The DH–DEP1 interface contributes to autoinhibition in vitro</title><p>To test the contribution of the observed DH–DEP1 interface to autoinhibition, the interface was disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment. This fragment is five- to tenfold less active (depending on assay conditions) than the DH/PH tandem alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>), confirming a specific role for DEP1 in autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Single-point mutations in the interface profoundly affected GEF activity on soluble Cdc42. The L173A variant had an ~2.5-fold higher activity, whereas L177E and L178E exhibited four- to fivefold higher activity, similar to the activity of DH/PH without the DEP1 domain. In the DEP1 domain, I409A and L466A mutations resulted in approximately two- and fourfold higher activity, respectively. The α1/α2 loop (residues 77–90) of the DH domain, although ordered in previous structures of DH/PH bound to GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lucato et al., 2015</xref>), is disordered in our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, modeling the DH domain from previous DH/PH crystal structures suggests that Lys89 and Arg78 would be close enough to form a bipartite ionic interaction with Glu456 in the DEP1 domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, the E456K variant was ~2.5-fold more active. Surprisingly, one of the intended disruptive mutations, A170K, instead inhibited GEF activity by ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Based on the available structures, Lys170 in the DH domain could form complementary electrostatic interactions with Glu411 along with additional non-polar interactions with the backbone and side chains of residues 409, 411, and 412 in the DEP1 domain, thereby stabilizing the DH–DEP1 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The DH–DEP1 interface stabilizes DH/PH-DEP1 and decreases flexibility</title><p>Because disruption of the DH–DEP1 interface led to increased activity, we predicted that these variants would have a more extended DH/PH module that is likely more dynamic. To test this, wild-type (WT) DH/PH-DEP1 and its variants were assessed using a ThermoFluor assay to determine their melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>). Indeed, variants with increased activity also had lower T<sub>m</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Conversely, A170K, which was less active than WT, showed a higher T<sub>m</sub>. We also analyzed these variants using size-exclusion chromatography coupled to small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

To this end, we started with the DH/PH-DEP1 A170K variant, which was more inhibited than wild-type but still dynamic, and then introduced S235C/M244C and K207C/E251C double mutants to completely constrain the hinge in the α6-αN helix via disulfide bond formation in a redox-sensitive manner. Single cysteine variants K207C and M244C were generated as controls. The S235C/M244C variant performed as expected, decreasing the activity of the A170K variant to nearly background in the oxidized but not the reduced state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the M244C single mutant exhibited similar effects, suggesting that it forms disulfide bonds with cysteine(s) other than S235C. Indeed, the side chains of Cys200 and Cys234 are very close to that of M244C. The K207C/E251C mutant was similar to S235C/M244C under oxidized conditions, but ~15-fold more active (similar to WT DH/PH levels, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) under reducing conditions. The K270C variant, on the other hand, exhibited higher activity than A170K on its own under oxidizing conditions, but similar activity to all the variants except K207C/E251C when reduced. These results suggest that K207C/E251C in a reduced state and K270C in an oxidized state favor a configuration where the DEP1 domain is less able to engage the DH domain and maintain the kinked state. The mechanism for this is not known. Regardless, these data show that perturbation of contacts between the kinked segments of the α6-αN helix can have profound consequences on the activity of the DH/PH-DEP1 core.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Interactions at the P-Rex1 DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interfaces contribute to autoinhibition in cells</title><p>To evaluate the roles of the P-Rex1 DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interfaces in living cells, we utilized SRE luciferase-gene reporter assays as a read out of full-length P-Rex1 activity in HEK293T cells.

To better understand the molecular consequences of PIP<sub>3</sub> binding, HDX-MS measurements were taken on P-Rex1 in the presence of liposomes ± PIP<sub>3</sub>. Without PIP<sub>3</sub>, the most notable changes in P-Rex1 in response to liposomes were increases in protection of the lipid binding elements of both DEP domains (primarily their β1/β2 loops; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which suggests that they directly interact with lipid bilayers. Indeed, the isolated DEP1 can independently bind negatively charged liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). Within the PH domain, there was deprotection of the αC helix, but there was no deprotection at the PH–4HB interface, suggesting that it remained intact. In contrast, membranes with PIP<sub>3</sub> caused deprotection of the entire DH domain, the α6-αN linker and the helices at the DH–DEP1 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although the core of the PH domain showed, as expected, an increase in protection in the presence of PIP<sub>3</sub>, the structural elements contacting 4HB became deprotected, as did the PH-binding regions of 4HB. Collectively, these data are consistent with loosening of interdomain contacts and unraveling of at least some fraction of P-Rex1 onto the surface of the liposome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) supports that P-Rex1 undergoes long-range conformational changes when binding PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HDX-MS of P-Rex1 in the presence of PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes.

DH–DEP1 and PH–4HB interactions are relieved upon P-Rex1 binding to PIP<sub>3</sub>-containing liposomes, leading to its activation. Canonically, PIP<sub>3</sub> signaling is negatively regulated by PIP<sub>3</sub> phosphatases such as PTEN. Additionally, inositol phosphates, including IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>4</sub>, can compete with PIP<sub>3</sub> binding to PH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jia et al., 2007</xref>), representing another form of negative regulation. Ins(1,3,4,5)P<sub>4</sub> is a major isoform of IP<sub>4</sub> in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stuart et al., 1994</xref>) where its concentration is estimated to be 4 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">French et al., 1991</xref>) and where P-Rex1 is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Welch et al., 2002</xref>). Because we can measure robust inhibition of P-Rex1 by IP<sub>4</sub> at &gt;1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), IP<sub>4</sub> may exert biologically relevant control of Rac activation, at least in neutrophils. Because P-Rex1 can bind membranes in the absence of PIP<sub>3</sub> or Gβγ, IP<sub>4</sub> may also serve to suppress P-Rex1 activity until a threshold concentration of PIP<sub>3</sub> is generated, allowing rapid activation of already membrane-associated P-Rex1. It is worth noting that such regulation by specific inositol phosphates may depend on the intracellular distribution of the enzymes responsible for their synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gokhale et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another key result of our study was to provide a molecular explanation for how the PH and DEP1 domains contribute to P-Rex1 regulation. Nearly two decades ago, it was first reported that domains located C-terminal to the DH domain contribute to P-Rex1 autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). Deletion of the PH domain in P-Rex1 resulted in a large increase in activity in the context of the full-length enzyme. However, the DH/PH fragment has higher activity than DH/PH-DEP1 and larger P-Rex1 fragments, indicating that the PH domain itself is not intrinsically inhibitory, as it is in some other RhoGEF DH/PH tandems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandekar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ravala and Tesmer, 2024</xref>). This apparent contradiction can now be explained by the fact that in DH/PH-DEP1 and larger fragments, the DH/PH module can jack-knife and position the PH domain in a manner that blocks GTPase binding. This model of regulation was corroborated by recent structural studies of P-Rex1 without IP<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). The isolated DEP1 domain was also shown to play an autoinhibitory role based on the relatively low activity of DH/PH-DEP1 relative to DH/PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). This can now be explained by its interaction with the DH domain, which, consequently, positions the PH domain to block access of GTPases. Because the PH and DEP1 domains can mediate inhibition in the contexts of both DH/PH-DEP1 and the full-length enzyme, and because there is little GEF activity when the DH–DEP1 interface is intact, the DH/PH-DEP1 module can be thought of as the core signaling circuit in P-Rex1. In support of this, our mutations in the DH–DEP1 interface were, in general, more activating than those in the PH–4HB interface in cells, although we note that our mutagenesis was not exhaustive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Using our functional data along with the known structures of P-Rex1, we assembled a model for the activation of P-Rex1 by PIP<sub>3</sub> and Gβγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). P-Rex1 in its basal state may be associated with IP<sub>4</sub> and exist in equilibrium between the membrane and the cytosol. Indeed, in our HDX-MS studies, the DEP1 and DEP2 domains show protection in the presence of liposomes without PIP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In its autoinhibited configuration, the known membrane anchoring elements (the GTPase binding site of the DH domain, the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site of the PH domain, the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain, the β1/β2 loops of DEP1 and DEP2, and the Gβγ-binding site in the C-terminal domains) cannot engage a common membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The clear outlier is the PH domain that would not be able to engage the membrane along with the other domains without unwrapping of the autoinhibited conformation. PIP<sub>3</sub> is not a major driver of membrane anchoring on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>), and nor is Gβγ, but they do so synergistically in combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber et al., 2007</xref>). In prior HDX-MS studies, Gβγ-binding did not have a large effect on the regions now known to be involved in autoinhibition and only caused protection in regions of direct contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>). This supports the idea that its role in activation may be primarily related to translocation. This is consistent with the observation that the <bold>Δ</bold>PH variant of P-Rex1 (which cannot form the DEP1–DH or PH–4HB interfaces or bind PIP<sub>3</sub>) is activated to the same extent by Gβγ as WT P-Rex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, in autoinhibited P-Rex1, the Gβγ-binding site is readily accessible whereas that of PIP<sub>3</sub> is sequestered.</p><p>We propose that, after stimulation of GPCRs in neutrophils, Gβγ likely binds first and, with the assistance of membrane binding elements in the DEP1 and 2 domains and possibly the β3/β4 loop of the PH domain, promotes loosening of the autoinhibited state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Generation of PIP<sub>3</sub> by PI3K then releases the DH/PH module from the 4HB and DEP1 domain, displacing any bound IP<sub>4</sub>. Because neither PIP<sub>3</sub> nor IP<sub>4</sub> can activate DH/PH-DEP1 GEF activity on a soluble GTPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we speculate that this unwrapping at the membrane with multiple points of engagement across the protein is necessary for full activation of P-Rex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Indeed, our HDX-MS and SAXS studies here support that fully activated P-Rex1 at the membrane will be more extended and dynamic, rendering the DH domain more accessible to Rac1. However, what remains unknown is the mechanism by which the PH domain is able to access PIP<sub>3</sub> at the membrane, even in a ‘loosened’ autoinhibited state.</p><p>Additional layers of P-Rex1 regulation exist that remain underexplored. For example, phosphorylation of the lipid binding loop of DEP1 by PKA is known to inhibit P-Rex1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chávez-Vargas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>). Also, a potential interaction may occur between the basic β3/β4 loop of the PH domain and the loop at the end of the 4HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both loops, consistent with their extended and dynamic nature, have predicted and confirmed phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2012</xref>) and thus could potentially modulate P-Rex1 activity if they interact. Phosphorylation of the basic β3/β4 loop might be expected to inhibit activity based on the fact that it binds and localizes the protein to the negatively charged plasma membrane, consistent with dephosphorylation of the loop leading to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Montero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Montero et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>Full-length human P-Rex1, Cdc42, and DH/PH-DEP1 expression constructs were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cash et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ravala et al., 2020</xref>).

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) is used to reveal how IP4 and PIP3 binding affect intramolecular interactions. While IP4 is found to stabilize autoinhibitory interactions, PIP3 does the opposite, leading to deprotection of autoinhibitory sites. Cryo-EM of IP4 bound P-Rex1 reveals a structure in the autoinhibited conformation, very similar to the unliganded structure reported previously (Chang et al. 2022). Mutations at observed autoinhibitory interfaces result in a more open structure (as shown by SAXS), reduced thermal stability and increased GEF activity in biochemical and cellular assays. Together their work portrays a dynamic enzyme that undergoes long-range conformational changes upon activation on PIP3 membranes. The results are technically sound and the conclusions are justified. The main drawback is the limited novelty due to the recently published structure of unliganded P-Rex1, which is virtually identical to the IP4 bound structure presented here. Novel aspects suggest a regulatory role for IP4, but the exact significance and mechanism of this regulation has not been explored.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use a multitude of techniques to describe the dynamic nature and conformational changes of P-Rex1 upon binding to IP4 and PIP3 membranes. The different approaches together fit well with the overall conclusion that IP4 binding negatively regulates P-Rex1, while binding to PIP3 membranes leads to conformational opening and catalytic activation. The experiments are performed very thoroughly and are technically sound. The results are clear and support the conclusions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The novelty of the study is compromised due to the recently published structure of unliganded P-Rex1 (Chang et al. 2022). The unliganded and IP4 bound structure of P-Rex1 appear virtually identical, however, no clear comparison is presented in the manuscript. In the same paper a very similar model of P-Rex1 activation upon binding to PIP3 membranes and Gbeta-gamma is presented.</p><p>(2) The authors demonstrate that IP4 binding to P-Rex1 results in catalytic inhibition and increased protection of autoinhibitory interfaces, as judged by HDX. The relevance of this in a cellular setting is not clear and is not experimentally demonstrated. Further, mechanistically, it is not clear whether the biochemical inhibition by IP4 of PIP3 activated P-Rex1 is due to competition of IP4 with activating PIP3 binding to the PH domain of P-Rex1, or due to stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation, or both.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92822.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this new paper, the authors used biochemical, structural, and biophysical methods to elucidate the mechanisms by which IP4, the PIP3 headgroup, can induce an autoinhibit form of P-Rex1 and propose a model of how PIP3 can trigger long-range conformational changes of P-Rex1 to relieve this autoinhibition. The main findings of this study are that a new P-Rex1 autoinhibition is driven by an IP4-induced binding of the PH domain to the DH domain active site and that this autoinhibit form stabilized by two key interactions between DEP1 and DH and between PH and IP4P 4-helix bundle (4HB) subdomain. Moreover, they found that the binding of phospholipid PIP3 to the PH domain can disrupt these interactions to relieve P-Rex1 autoinhibition.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study provides good evidence that binding of IP4 to the P-Rex1 PH domain can make the two long-range interactions between the catalytic DH domain and the first DEP domain, and between the PH domain and the C-terminal IP4P 4HB subdomain that generate a novel P-Rex1 autoinhibition mechanism. This valuable finding adds an extra layer of P-Rex1 regulation (perhaps in the cytoplasm) to the synergistic activation by phospholipid PIP3 and the heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits at the plasma membrane. Overall, this manuscript's goal sounds interesting, the experimental data were carried out carefully and reliably.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>The set of experiments with the disulfide bond S235C/M244C caused a bit of confusion for interpretation, it should be moved into the supplement, and the text and Figure 4 were altered accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92822.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report, Ravala et al demonstrate that IP4, the soluble head-group of phosphatiylinositol 3,4,5 - trisphosphate (PIP3), is an inhibitor of pREX-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 and related small G proteins that regulate cell cell migration. This finding is perhaps unexpected since pREX-1 activity is PIP3-dependent. By way of Cryo-EM (revealing the structure of the p-REX-1/IP4 complex at 4.2Å resolution), hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry and small angle X-ray scattering, they deduce a mechanism for IP4 activation, and conduct mutagenic and cell-based signaling assays that support it. The major finding is that IP4 stabilizes two interdomain interfaces that block access of the DH domain, which conveys GEF activity towards small G protein substrates. One of these is the interface between the PH domain that binds to IP4 and a 4-helix bundle extension of the IP4 Phosphatase domain and the DEP1 domain. The two interfaces are connected by a long helix that extends from PH to DEP1. Although the structure of fully activated pREX-1 has not been determined, the authors propose a &quot;jackknife&quot; mechanism, similar to that described earlier by Chang et al (2022) (referenced in the author's manuscript) in which binding of IP3 relieves a kink in a helix that links the PH/DH modules and allows the DH-PH-DEP triad to assume an extended conformation in which the DH domain is accessible. While the structure of the activated pREX-1 has not been determined, cysteine mutagenesis that enforces the proposed kink is consistent with this hypothesis. SAXS and HDX-MS experiments suggest that IP4 acts by stiffening the inhibitory interfaces, rather than by reorganizing them. Indeed, the cryo-EM structure of ligand-free pREX-1 shows that interdomain contacts are largely retained in the absence of IP4.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript thus describes a novel regulatory role for IP4 and is thus of considerable significance to our understanding of regulatory mechanisms that control cell migration, particularly in immune cell populations. Specifically, they show how the inositol polyphosphate IP4 controls the activity of pREX-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls the activity of small G proteins Rac and CDC42. In their clearly-written discussion, the authors explain how PIP3, the cell membrane and the Gbeta-gamma subunits of heterotrimeric membranes together localize pREX-1 at the membrane and induce activation. The quality of experimental data is high and both in vitro and cell-based assays of site-directed mutants designed to test the author's hypotheses are confirmatory. The results strongly support the conclusions. The combination of cryo-EM data, that describe the static (if heterogeneous) structures with experiments (small angle x-ray scattering and hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry) that report on dynamics are well employed by the authors</p><p>Manuscript revision:</p><p>The reviewers noted a number of weaknesses, including error analysis of the HDX data, interpretation of the mutagenesis data, the small fraction of the total number of particles used to generate the EM reconstruction, the novelty of the findings in light of the previous report by Cheng et al, 2022, various details regarding presentation of structural results and questions regarding the interpretation of the inhibition data (Figure 1D). The authors have responded adequately to these critiques. It appears that pREX-1 is a highly dynamic molecule, and considerable heterogeneity among particles might be expected.</p><p>While, indeed, the conformation of pREX presented in this report is not novel, the finding that this inactive conformational state is stabilized by IP4 is significant and important. The evidence for this is both structural and biochemical, as indicated by micromolar competition of IP4 with PI3-enriched vesicles resulting in the inhibition of pREX-1 GEF activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92822.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ravala</surname><given-names>Sandeep K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adame-Garcia</surname><given-names>Sendi Rafael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Sheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chun-Liang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cianfrocco</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Silvio Gutkind</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cash</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tesmer</surname><given-names>John JG</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough review of and overall positive comments on our manuscript.
