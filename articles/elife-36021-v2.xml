Recently, it has become clear that the life cycle of some proteins is substantially modified by lipid droplets (LDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welte, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Welte and Gould, 2017</xref>), cytoplasmic fat storage organelles with critical roles in energy storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hashemi and Goodman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kühnlein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pol et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sztalryd and Brasaemle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walther et al., 2017</xref>). For example, LDs are implicated in the refolding of certain damaged proteins in yeast and the assembly of viral protein complexes in mammalian cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, LDs store large amounts of specific histones for use later in development; and in mammals, LDs promote the degradation of certain ER proteins. Although the list of proteins controlled by LDs in some manner continues to expand, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we take advantage of the possibly best characterized example of protein handling via LDs, namely their role in histone metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Maintaining proper histone stoichiometry within nuclei is critical for cell viability: imbalanced histone deposition onto chromatin is deleterious, resulting in mitotic errors, altered gene expression, and ultimately cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Au et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meeks-Wagner and Hartwell, 1986</xref>). Control of proper histone levels is also crucial: both over-abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2010</xref>) and dearth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celona et al., 2011</xref>) of histones can have profound consequences on the cell. In most cells, histone availability is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptionally, post-transcriptionally, and post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister and Kouzarides, 2011</xref>). For example, in mammalian cultured cells, transcription of canonical histones is highly upregulated during S-phase, when replication occurs, and afterwards throttling of transcription and mRNA turnover bring messages back to very low levels. And in yeast, excess histone proteins are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>For early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, regulation of histones is particularly challenging. On the one hand, these embryos develop incredibly rapidly: during the first ~90 min after fertilization, nuclei divide near simultaneously every ~8 min, deep within the embryo (cleavage stages); a subset of these nuclei migrates to the surface and divides four more times over the next hour (syncytial blastoderm stages). All these divisions occur near simultaneously and in the absence of cytokinesis. As a result, histone demand goes up exponentially during this period, in a fluctuating manner, as S-phases and mitoses alternate on minute time scales (the entire interphase is dedicated to DNA replication during these cycles). On the other hand, zygotic transcription is minimal during these stages, being upregulated only in late syncytial blastoderm as part of the midblastula transition (MBT). Thus, early embryos cannot control histone expression transcriptionally. Instead, they draw on abundant histone proteins and mRNAs, produced by the mother during oogenesis. Newly fertilized embryos already contain sufficient histone proteins for thousands of nuclei, and they increase histone levels further by translation of the maternal mRNAs. Thus, histone proteins are consistently overabundant. How is chromatin assembly regulated under those conditions?</p><p>Previous work revealed that for three histones, the canonical histones H2A and H2B as well as H2Av, the single H2A variant in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, LDs play an important role in regulating histone availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>). These histones are bound to LDs via the protein anchor Jabba, and this binding allows embryos to accumulate high levels of maternally provided histones, possibly by protecting them from degradation. This histone storage function allows embryos to develop successfully even when new histone biosynthesis is impaired; without such storage, embryos die under these conditions, in cleavage or syncytial blastoderm stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this storage of maternal histones, histone recruitment to LDs also controls nuclear histone accumulation during the syncytial blastoderm. In <italic>Jabba</italic> mutants, embryos accumulate excessive H2Av in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, such over-accumulation does not occur with the other LD-associated histones, H2A and H2B, possibly because regulation of canonical histones and histone variants differs dramatically (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi and Becker, 2013</xref>). This finding led us to propose that LDs act as H2Av buffers, transiently sequestering H2Av produced in excess to prevent over-accumulation in nuclei. The mechanism of how this buffering is achieved remains unknown. Given how exquisitely many aspects of the histone life cycle are controlled, we hypothesized that the embryo somehow monitors production and usage of H2Av and adjusts release of H2Av from LDs according to the balance at any given moment. To gain insight into the regulation of this process, we set out to monitor transfer of H2Av from LDs to nuclei by live imaging and to quantify H2Av intracellular dynamics.</p><p>We find that during cleavage and syncytial blastoderm stages, H2Av is dynamically associated with LDs, constantly exchanging between droplets, with the vast majority of H2Av associated with LDs at any one moment. We propose that this set-up allows the embryo to maintain free H2Av at relatively low concentrations, despite an enormous H2Av pool overall. This small amount of free H2Av limits the availability for nuclear import and subsequent deposition onto chromatin. Thus, buffering is achieved by a passive mechanism that paces incorporation of H2Av into chromatin rather than release of histones from LDs via active feedback. Here, we develop and test a quantitative model for buffering, provide evidence that buffering by LDs is the main regulator of H2Av incorporation during early development, and find that buffering is developmentally regulated, undergoing a dramatic shift at the MBT. Taken together, we elucidate a novel mechanism of histone regulation through sequestration to LDs, providing a paradigm for LDs as key players in protein homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H2Av can rapidly translocate from LDs to nearby nuclei</title><p>Previous work demonstrated a role for LDs as histone stores: when new histone biosynthesis is compromised, histones on LDs are necessary for proper embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>), presumably to package chromatin because such embryos die with phenotypes reminiscent of severe lack of histones. A critical aspect of this model is that histones can translocate from LDs to nuclei. Although such transfer has been observed in transplantation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>), there is only indirect evidence that it occurs under endogenous conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To directly test for such transfer, we employed flies carrying a genomic transgene expressing the photoactivatable fusion protein H2Av-paGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Post et al., 2005</xref>). Embryos from such mothers are viable and exhibit normal chromosome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Post et al., 2005</xref>); a similarly engineered H2Av-eGFP fusion protein rescues an <italic>H2Av</italic> null allele and is a widely used in vivo marker of chromosome behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clarkson and Saint, 1999</xref>). To follow specifically the fate of LD-associated H2Av-paGFP, we focused on late syncytial blastoderm embryos, as here presumably demand for histones is the highest. The embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is in nuclear cycle 13 (NC13), that is in between mitosis 12 and mitosis 13, the last syncytial cycle. We photoactivated a region enriched for LDs and monitored fluorescent signal over time. Within minutes, signal disappeared from the photoactivated region and appeared in nuclei, specifically those directly adjacent to the activation region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This experiment demonstrates that histone H2Av can rapidly translocate from LDs to nearby nuclei under endogenous conditions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36021.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H2Av can translocate from lipid droplets (LDs) to nearby nuclei.</title><p>In NC13 embryos expressing H2Av-paGFP, a region enriched for LDs was photoactivated by exposure to 405 nm light (Dashed box, A’).

We hypothesized that this dramatic loss reflects the massive demand for histones in the thousands of nuclei of late blastoderm embryos. If this notion is correct, loss of H2Av from nuclei should roughly scale with the number of nuclei present in the syncytial embryo: slow to non-existent in embryos with few nuclei, and occurring increasingly rapidly with each nuclear division, with maximal rates in NC13 and 14 when thousands of nuclei simultaneously undergo S phase (such as in the embryo in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We therefore set out to compare the rate of loss of H2Av from LDs at different embryo ages.</p><p>This analysis is complicated by the fact that the spatial distribution of LDs across the embryo changes dramatically during embryogenesis.

However, even in these embryos, the bleached region moved largely as a unit and remained devoid of YFP signal, demonstrating that even large-scale movement within the embryo is not sufficient to explain the observed H2Av dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Previous transplantation experiments had found that exogenously provided H2Av can localize to LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In both photoswitching and FRAP experiments, signal that has spread to new regions is not uniformly distributed but displays a punctate appearance (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). When both photoswitched H2Av-Dendra2 (red) and non-photoswitched H2Av-Dendra2 (green) are monitored, colocalization to the same puncta increases with time after photoswitching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Since at steady state the vast majority of H2Av signal in early embryos is detected on LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>), these observations strongly suggest that H2Av lost from LDs are gained by other LDs. Indeed, at higher magnification, we detect colocalization of photoswitched and non-photoswitched H2Av-Dendra2 in the ring-pattern characteristic of LD proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G’</xref>). We conclude that H2Av constantly exchanges between LDs.</p><p>In early embryos, LDs are broadly distributed and show very little motion (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Thus, it seems unlikely that H2Av is exchanged between LDs via direct contact. We hypothesize that H2Av travels between LDs through the cytoplasm, although have not been able to unambiguously detect H2Av signal in the cytoplasm above background. We employed in vivo centrifugation to separate LDs from other embryonic components, including the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tran and Welte, 2010</xref>). When pre-cellular embryos are centrifuged, they become stratified, with cellular components sorting out by density; in particular, LDs accumulate at the end of the embryo pointing up, forming a distinct layer. When we induced photoswitching in the LD layer of centrifuged H2Av-Dendra2 embryos, we detected robust activation, demonstrating that photoswitching still works under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). When we performed photoswitching away from the LD layer, a weak, but specific, H2Av-Dendra2 signal was detected, indicating the presence of a potential non-LD associated H2Av pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I’</xref>). We have not noticed any particular spatial structure to this signal, and it does spread rapidly after activation (data not shown). Although these data do not completely rule out the involvement of other cellular compartments (including a potential small population of LDs of aberrant size or density), we propose that a small, non-LD pool of H2Av is present in the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Does H2Av exchange between LDs mediate the buffering role of LDs?</title><p>We had previously proposed that LDs serve as H2Av buffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>) because H2Av is likely produced in excess and when recruitment to LDs is abolished, it over-accumulates in nuclei of syncytial blastoderm embryos. The mechanism of buffering was unknown, but our working hypothesis had been that capture by or release from LDs depends on the overall need for H2Av at any particular moment: the embryo somehow monitors production and usage of H2Av and the balance between those two processes controls the H2Av dynamics at the LDs. This model proposes that capture or release are controlled by feedback regulation. For core histones, it has been shown that a plethora of mechanisms synergize to indeed carefully coordinate core histone production and deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, if in cultured mammalian cells DNA replication is inhibited during S phase, histone messages are prematurely degraded, suggesting that reduced demand for histones triggers a feedback loop that curbs histone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumbach et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to such a highly controlled process, our discovery of the dynamic and seemingly unregulated nature of H2Av association with LDs suggests a radically different alternative: newly produced H2Av can reversibly bind to LDs, which reduces the concentration of H2Av free in the cytoplasm and thus the rate of H2Av import into nuclei. In this view, nuclear H2Av levels are controlled kinetically, by slowing how fast H2Av enters nuclei, not by feedback control that adjusts H2Av release from LDs to demand.</p><p>Delivery of newly synthesized H2Av to chromatin must involve many molecular players, including histone chaperones in both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, the nuclear import machinery, and other histones (as H2Av forms heterodimers with H2B).

If no LDs are present, all H2Av is free in the cytoplasm and the rate of import into the nucleus is at its maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Briefly, we devised three rate equations describing changes in concentrations of free, LD-bound, and DNA-bound H2Av. We then solved these equations by making a number of simplifying assumptions (Appendix 1). The three most critical ones are graphically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> (bottom): First, we assumed that H2Av bound to DNA is significantly lower in energy than H2Av bound to LDs. This assumption is based on the observation that there is net flux from LDs to nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but not in the reverse direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Second, we assumed that H2Av bound to LDs is significantly lower in energy than H2Av free in the cytoplasm. In support of this notion, we find the concentration of H2Av bound to LDs is dramatically higher than in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Third, the on-rate of H2Av binding to LDs (<italic>k<sup>1</sup><sub>on</sub></italic>) is faster than its incorporation into nuclear DNA (<italic>k<sup>2</sup><sub>on</sub></italic>). This assumption is based on the observation that H2Av lost from LDs (and thus having passed through the cytoplasmic pool) efficiently accumulates on LDs again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G’</xref>). Thus, the model assumes that there is a rapid pre-equilibration of H2Av between the cytoplasm and LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, bottom, left).

We propose that this discrepancy is due to the maturation time of eGFP: within the short time scale of our experiments (i.e. several minutes), the most recently synthesized H2Av-GFP will not be visible, as eGFP maturation occurs with a time constant of ~30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heim et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, our measurements are blind to a fraction of total H2Av. The relative contribution of this ‘invisible’ fraction will be larger in 0x <italic>Jabba</italic> because here newly synthesized H2Av is not retained in the cytoplasm by LDs and thus does not have a chance to mature before being imported into nuclei. Therefore, measuring recovery of fluorescent H2Av-GFP will underestimate H2Av nuclear import compared to the other genotypes.

This midblastula transition (MBT) marks the transition from maternal to zygotic control of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). Major events of the MBT include cell-cycle remodeling, large-scale zygotic genome activation, and degradation of a subset of maternal transcripts. To determine whether the transition in H2Av dynamics is a consequence of genome activation, we injected embryos with the RNA Polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin to abolish new transcription. Inhibition was effective, as judged by lack of membrane invagination and failure of LDs to move away from the periphery, events known to require zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zolokar and Erk, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gutzeit, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arking and Parente, 1980</xref>). Photoswitching experiments revealed that the transition still occurred, on a normal time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s3">Figure 11—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The effects of these two clocks can be distinguished by using haploid embryos: these embryos undergo an additional division compared to diploid embryos in order to achieve the same N:C ratio prior to the onset of the MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>). Therefore, events controlled by the N:C ratio should be delayed in haploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We generated haploid embryos by crossing H2Av-Dendra2 females to males homozygous for the recessive male sterile mutation <italic>ms(3)K81</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasuda et al., 1995</xref>) and performed photoswitching experiments to monitor histone dynamics. H2Av continued to exchange rapidly between LDs in early NC15, corresponding to a time after fertilization when exchange has completely stopped in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). Yet, by 15 min into NC15, histones were stably associated with LDs, similar to the situation in NC14 diploid embryos; presumably the ongoing DNA replication at the beginning of these cycles pushes the N:C ratio above a threshold level to switch histone dynamics. Thus, the transition in histone dynamics is not controlled by developmental time, but rather by the N:C ratio. We conclude that the transition in the dynamics of H2Av association with LDs is a previously unrecognized part of the MBT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Lipid droplets are the main regulator of nuclear H2Av in early embryos</title><p>Assuring that chromatin contains the correct amount of histone proteins requires multiple steps, from production to chromatin deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For most histone species, histone incorporation is regulated by the abundance of histone proteins, via control of transcription, mRNA turnover, and protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marzluff and Duronio, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that for the variant histone H2Av in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos the dominant step for regulating histone incorporation is not histone abundance per se, but post-translational regulation of available H2Av protein via buffering by LDs: in these embryos, LDs transiently sequester excess H2Av, effectively depleting the H2Av pool that is readily available for nuclear import and chromatin deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Varying buffering capacity – via <italic>Jabba</italic> dosage changes – indeed modulates H2Av nuclear import rates and controls total nuclear H2Av levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that such a simplified system for histone regulation represents an adaptation necessary for controlling nuclear histone levels during periods of extremely rapid nuclear proliferation. During early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis, a modified cell-cycle program allows for a nuclear division every 8 min. Such rapid cell cycles may make it challenging to regulate histone levels via canonical pathways. In budding yeast, for example, non-chromatin bound histones are degraded with a half-life of ~30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with our findings that buffering is turned off in NC14, when a prolonged interphase, including the first gap phase, is introduced. In addition, some of the canonical pathways are simply not available: for the first ~2 hr, the zygotic genome is largely inactive, and thus transcription could at most make a minor contribution to <italic>H2Av</italic> mRNA abundance. Histone mRNAs are instead provided maternally and if they were degraded in early cycles, they would no longer be available later; indeed, they are largely stable until NC14. Abundant maternally provided H2Av protein is supplemented by newly synthesized H2Av translated from maternal <italic>H2Av</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>); however, there does not seem to be any feedback regulation to adjust levels to usage, as H2Av proteins scale with <italic>H2Av</italic> gene dosage, suggesting that neither translation nor degradation are tuned to achieve a particular H2Av abundance.</p><p>We found no evidence for substantial export or loss of H2Av from nuclei during the time frame of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>), and thus H2Av nuclear levels are indeed dominated by import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We speculate that H2Av imported into the nucleus quickly becomes chromatin-bound and is therefore stably retained. Although our experiments do not directly address chromatin association during interphase, at least in mitosis the vast majority of H2Av signal appears to localize to chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Because H2Av is typically present in chromatin ten-fold less abundantly than H2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leach et al., 2000</xref>), there should be lots of potential sites where H2Av could be incorporated into nucleosomes instead of H2A. Indeed, during an artificially elongated interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), nuclear H2Av continues to rise at a similar rate throughout, suggesting that H2Av incorporation is far from saturation.</p><p>Our data uncovers a role for LDs as H2Av buffers; at the moment, it remains unresolved whether other LD-associated histones (i.e. H2A and H2B) are regulated similarly.

As H2B is vastly more abundant on LDs than H2Av (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cermelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>), most of it can in principle be regulated independently of H2Av, even though H2Av is presumably present on LDs as an H2Av-H2B heterodimer. Core histones are generally regulated quite differently than histone variants, so the fact that differences exist in early embryos would not be surprising. Perhaps, the two functions of LDs in histone regulation are mutually exclusive: LDs store core histones, H2A and H2B, for later use (i.e. histone storage function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2012</xref>]) and dynamically sequester H2Av to reduce availability (i.e. histone buffering function). Future live-imaging of the core histones will be necessary to address this question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Jabba/LDs as a novel histone chaperone</title><p>Histone chaperones are broadly defined as a group of proteins that both bind histones and regulate nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess and Zhang, 2013</xref>). The ability of LDs to transiently sequester histones via the anchor protein Jabba, and its subsequent role in limiting histone deposition onto chromatin, argues that LDs have a previously uncharacterized role as histone chaperones. The function of LDs in regulating free H2Av levels is remarkably similar to other known histone chaperones. The H3-H4 histone chaperone nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein (NASP), for example, has been shown to regulate soluble H3-H4 levels in HeLa cells: non-chromatin bound H3-H4 pools are lost in NASP mutants, and NASP overexpression is sufficient to increase soluble H3 and H4 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the H2A/H2B chaperone nucleoplasmin (Npm) has been implicated in both histone storage and release, a functional transition that has been shown to be developmentally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Onikubo et al., 2015</xref>). Despite such similarities, however, our data reveals a key difference: histone storage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos is highly dynamic while, in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, storage is largely static. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of histone storage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> represents a necessary adaptation to cope with the rapid cell cycles, which are ~3 x shorter than in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Additionally, <italic>Xenopus</italic> cleavage divisions do not occur within a syncytium: therefore, dynamic buffering by LDs would, presumably, not be as robust, as each division would split the maternal H2Av pool. It is also possible, as alluded to above, that core histones are statically stored, while dynamic storage is employed for the histone variants.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Quantitative modeling of histone import</title><p>Our quantitative model of how LDs modulate the nuclear accumulation of H2Av (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, Appendix 1) reproduces key aspects of the behavior observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This correspondence is remarkable, given that the model takes into account just a few molecular players (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>); this suggests that many other regulatory mechanisms known to affect histone accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) play only limited roles in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. The next steps will be to refine this quantification in the future, by directly measuring the rate constants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> as well as the absolute concentrations of various histone pools. Together with resolving the contribution of not fully matured, ‘invisible’ H2Av-GFP, this will set the stage for defining if other molecular players need to be considered to fully account for the observed import rates. For example, the current model does not yet incorporate the modest, but detectable, increase in total H2Av levels over the course of cleavage and syncytial blastoderm stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>). On the minute time frame of individual import experiments, this rise due to new translation is likely irrelevant, but it might make a contribution to how import changes between nuclear cycles.</p><p>For simplicity, our model assumes that incorporation of histones into DNA is driven by the concentration of H2Av in the free cytoplasmic pool and the number of H2Av-binding sites on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, top, right). However, in principle, any other aspect of H2Av assembly onto chromatin might be the relevant step. We already have an indication that the concentration of H2Av-binding sites on DNA ([<italic>D</italic>]) does not influence the rate of formation of DNA-bound H2Av, because – when we compare across nuclear cycles – the rate of loss of H2Av from LDs is independent of the number of nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the rate of H2Av incorporation may not be limited by its interaction with DNA, but rather by its interactions with auxiliary factors such as histone chaperones that regulate nucleosome assembly. Like many other maternal proteins, histones chaperones are likely to present at constant levels in the early embryos. Systematic dosage changes for known chaperones should reveal whether any of these factors is rate-limiting in early embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Transition in H2Av buffering by LDs represents a previously unrecognized aspect of the mid-blastula transition (MBT)</title><p>The dramatic transition in H2Av dynamics observed during NC14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D–F</xref>) suggests that abolishing H2Av buffering may be an import aspect of the MBT. We hypothesize that this change is necessary to allow for canonical regulatory mechanisms to take over. Static sequestration of histones to LDs will immobilize the large pool of previously generated H2Av and thus prevent over-accumulation in nuclei during the extended interphase of NC14. Overabundance of histones in general can cause cytotoxicity, via multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2010</xref>); and over-accumulation of specifically H2Av in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos results in activation of a DNA damage pathway and reduced hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Later, the dramatic reduction in <italic>H2Av</italic> mRNA levels presumably limits new H2Av protein biosynthesis; if LDs were still able to bind H2Av and act as a sink, this might reduce effective H2Av concentrations below critical levels; dearth of histones is known to severely disrupt chromatin function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 1987</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Lipid droplets as general sites of protein sequestration/regulation</title><p>It has long been known that proteins from a myriad of cellular compartments can be recruited to LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welte, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welte, 2015</xref>). In particular, there is a growing list of instances where proteins partition between LDs and the nucleus in a controlled manner. First, histones are present on LDs not only in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, but also in many other cells, including in mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welte, 2015</xref>). For example, citrullinated H3 is present on LDs in early mouse oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kan et al., 2012</xref>); and H2A and H2B, were identified as high confidence LD proteins in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and human hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bersuker et al., 2018</xref>). Whether in these cases LD localization also modulates histone availability for chromatin assembly remains to be elucidated. Second, the Perilipin PLIN5 has dual roles at the LD surface and in the nucleus: at the LD surface it modulates lipase activity to regulate triglyceride breakdown while in the nucleus it increases expression of genes that promote mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallardo-Montejano et al., 2016</xref>). These two PLIN5 populations are connected: under well-fed conditions, all PLIN5 is present on LDs; under starvation conditions, a fraction of PLIN5 relocates to the nucleus to act as a transcriptional co-factor and the fraction that remains LD-associated promotes lipolysis. In that manner, a single protein coordinates both the generation of fatty acids from triglycerides and their efficient use by mitochondria. Third, the transcription factor NFAT5 can be sequestered on LDs, via tethering to the LD protein Fsp27/CIDEC; it has been proposed that this sequestration prevents its translocation to the nucleus and thus regulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ueno et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, CCT1 (Choline-phosphate cytidylyl transferase 1), a key enzyme in phospholipid metabolism is present at the surface of LDs during times of triglyceride synthesis and is critical for LD expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krahmer et al., 2011</xref>); however, under basal conditions, it relocates to the nucleus (although it is unclear if nuclear accumulation is functionally important).</p><p>These observations are part of the emerging evidence that – beyond their role in lipid metabolism – LDs have a broad function in protein handling for proteins destined for all kinds of compartments. Previously characterized roles include the maturation, sequestration, and turnover of select proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Welte and Gould, 2017</xref>). Our studies now reveal that sequestration can be dynamic, rather than static, and that this can result in a buffering role.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Lipid droplets as regulators of development</title><p>Our findings strongly suggest that LDs can modulate developmental progression: prior to the MBT, dynamic association of H2Av with LDs allows for rapid, but restrained nuclear import. This dynamic state quickly transitions to static sequestration during NC14, contributing to a dramatically reduced rate of nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B</xref>). The ability of LDs to differentially modulate H2Av import suggests an important function as regulators of embryogenesis. Of course, LDs can have profound effects on development as the source of hydrophobic signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Welte and Gould, 2017</xref>). But to our knowledge, this is the first example of LDs promoting proper developmental progression via their protein-handling function. Given that LDs are nearly ubiquitous and often are particularly abundant in oocytes and embryos, their potential as novel mediators of developmental regulation is vast. The tools to test this idea will become increasingly available for many experimental systems since our understanding of the basic cell biology and physiology of LDs is growing at an ever-increasing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Welte and Gould, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walther et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Welte, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross and Silver, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kory et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thiam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman and Hesselink, 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>His2Av</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>FBgn0001197</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>Jabba</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>FBgn0259682</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>halo</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>FBgn0001174</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>LSD-2</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>FBgn0030608</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>H2Av<sup>810</sup></italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:9264; <break/>FLYB: FBst0009264</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>H2Av-GFP</italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:24163; <break/>FLYB: FBst0024163</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>H2Av-mRFP</italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:23650; <break/>FLYB: FBst0023650</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>ms(3)K81</italic></td><td>Bloomington <break/>Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:53252; <break/>FLYB: FBst0005352</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>H2Av-paGFP</italic></td><td>other</td><td>FLYB: FBtp0020089</td><td>Described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Post et al., 2005</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster)</italic></td><td><italic>LSD2-YFP</italic></td><td>Kyoto Stock Center</td><td>DGRC:115301; <break/>FLYB: FBti0143786</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td><italic>Jabba<sup>DL</sup></italic>, <italic>Jabba<sup>zl01</sup></italic></td><td>other</td><td>FLYB: FBal0280317; <break/>FBal0280318</td><td>Previously generated <italic>Jabba</italic> <break/>null alleles.

All graphs were assembled using either Prism 7 or Mathematica 11 (Wolfram). All images were processed in Adobe Photoshop and assembled with Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Erick Wieschaus, the Bloomington Stock Center, and the Kyoto Stock Center for fly stocks.

We appreciate both the recognition of this novel aspect and the vote of confidence in the execution. Although the concept of LD-mediated histone buffering had previously been proposed, the mechanistic basis for buffering was unknown. As we point out in the text, the previously most appealing model of buffering (that the organism somehow monitors histone production and demand and releases/captures histones as needed for an appropriate supply) was disproven by our results. Here we demonstrate that buffering is based on the dynamic sequestration of histones and show that it is developmentally regulated. In addition, we discovered that H2Av is under minimal, simplified regulation that fails to include feedback control, starkly contrasting histone regulation in other systems i.e., we had previously hypothesized that LDs represent a regulator of H2Av, but now provide evidence that they are, essentially, the H2Av regulator in early embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is lacking mechanistically is quantitative data comparing the rates of binding to LDs with nuclear import, etc. Given that the paper is not entirely novel, more conclusive mechanistic data, i.e. kinetic data that support the model, is at minimal required.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this feedback, we have now developed a kinetic model for histone buffering and test it quantitatively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite the lack of novelty, the reviewers agreed that the paper could be acceptable if a quantitative model was proposed and rigorously tested.</p><p>Specifically, what is needed is an model that is explicit (mathematical), integrating biochemical measurements of abundances (of H2Av, other LD bound histones, Jabba and import machinery), as well as binding constants (e.g. between H2Av and Jabba).</p><p>If the authors think that they can substantially &quot;nail&quot; the testing of this model quantitatively, the reviewers agreed the paper could in principle be acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have developed a kinetic model (presented in Figure 8, Figure 8—figure supplement 1, Appendix 1, and detailed in the subsection “Devising a kinetic model for LD-mediated H2Av buffering”) to explain the buffering effects of lipid droplets on nuclear accumulation of H2Av. This model incorporates concentrations of the different H2Av pools (i.e., free, LD-bound, DNA-bound), in addition to concentrations of H2Av bindings sites on LDs (i.e., <italic>Jabba</italic>) and H2Av binding sites on DNA. Furthermore, we define rate constants for both the association and dissociation of H2Av with LDs and DNA. We deliberately do not include other molecular players because our goal is to understand to what extent a minimalist, stripped-down model is sufficient to explain H2Av nuclear accumulation in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, i.e. we are explicitly attempting to model a situation in which the nuclear import machinery and other histones are not limiting or regulated (see subsection “Does H2Av exchange between LDs mediate the buffering role of LDs?”, last paragraph and Figure 11A).</p><p>By incorporating a number of experimental observations, we were able to solve the differential rate equations described in Appendix 1. Our solution (Equation 1 in main text, Equation 6 in Appendix 1) relates the rate of formation of DNA-bound H2Av with total H2Av levels, as well as concentrations of H2Av bindings sites on LDs and DNA. We then tested key predictions of this model (predictions presented in Figure 8—figure supplement 1). To really “nail” the testing of this model quantitatively, we now include nuclear import rates of H2Av with varying <italic>Jabba</italic> dosage (including with <italic>Jabba</italic> over-expression), using FRAP, and find the relative rates of nuclear import of H2Av to match those predicted by our model for 1x, 2x, and 3x <italic>Jabba</italic> dosage (subsection “Nuclear H2Av levels depend on LD buffering capacity”, second paragraph, Figure 9E, F). For 0x <italic>Jabba</italic>, we find an intriguing discrepancy that provides additional insights into this experimental system (see the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection). The full derivation of our model is described in Appendix 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
