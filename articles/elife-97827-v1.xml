Radiation resistance hinders radiotherapy, a standard treatment for advanced CRC, leading to local recurrence and metastasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying radioresistance in CRC is critical to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Bioinformatic analysis and tumour tissue examination were conducted to investigate the <italic>CPT1A</italic> mRNA and protein levels in CRC and their correlation with radiotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors, along with in vitro and in vivo radiation experiments, were used to explore the effect of CPT1A on radiosensitivity. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing, molecular biology experiments, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CPT1A regulates radiosensitivity. CPT1A was significantly downregulated in CRC and negatively correlated with responsiveness to neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Functional studies suggested that CPT1A mediates radiosensitivity, influencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and DNA damage response. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses highlighted the involvement of the peroxisomal pathway. Mechanistic exploration revealed that CPT1A downregulates the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis, moderating cellular ROS levels after irradiation and enhancing radiosensitivity. CPT1A downregulation contributes to radioresistance in CRC by augmenting the FOXM1-mediated antioxidant response. Thus, CPT1A is a potential biomarker of radiosensitivity and a novel target for overcoming radioresistance, offering a future direction to enhance CRC radiotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer cells</kwd><kwd>CPT1A</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>radiosensitivity</kwd><kwd>FOXM1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82273564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32370139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Hongying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32300085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhenhui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Hongying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Science and Technology Brainstorm Project of Guangzhou</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202206010045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CPT1A downregulation enhances radioresistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) via FOXM1-mediated antioxidant response, making it a potential biomarker for radiosensitivity and a novel target for improving CRC radiotherapy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-highest cause of cancer-related mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Siegel et al., 2023</xref>). Radiotherapy is crucial for CRC management, especially in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT<sub>3-4</sub>N<sub>+</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glynne-Jones et al., 2017</xref>). Neoadjuvant therapies show clinical or pathological complete response in 16–30% of patients, realising downstaging in approximately 60% of patients, significantly enhancing local control, and facilitating curative surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cercek et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, radiotherapy is beneficial in initially unresectable and recurrent cases with limited metastasis to organs, such as the liver and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cervantes et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, the effectiveness of radiotherapy is affected by radioresistance, which precipitates tumour relapse and metastasis and currently lacks an efficacious clinical resolution. Unlocking the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC radioresistance will enhance outcomes and improve patient prognoses.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are byproducts of normal cellular metabolism occurring in organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>). Within mitochondria, 90% of cellular ROS are generated by complexes I, II, and IV of the electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glasauer and Chandel, 2014</xref>). Exogenous stimuli, including radiation, can cause significant, acute elevations in ROS levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hecht et al., 2024</xref>). ROS function ambivalently in the intracellular signalling and redox homoeostasis of tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shah et al., 2024</xref>). ROS amplify oncogenic phenotypes, such as proliferation and differentiation, hasten the accumulation of metastasis-inducing mutations, and aid tumour cell survival under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Palma et al., 2024</xref>). However, excess ROS precipitate apoptosis and other cell death types from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Palma et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, intracellular ROS generation is meticulously monitored and regulated by a comprehensive ROS-scavenging system encompassing antioxidants and antioxidative enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Palma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shah et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Radiation ionises water molecules, creating an intracellular surge of ROS, which indirectly cause two-thirds of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chio and Tuveson, 2017</xref>). Consequently, ROS scavenging inevitably influences cancer cell radiosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skvortsova et al., 2015</xref>). Increased expression and activity of antioxidative enzymes, such as peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, are correlated with radiosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hecht et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) is an outer mitochondrial membrane that catalyses the rate-limiting step of fatty acid oxidation and is absent in several tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Melone et al., 2018</xref>). The CPT1 family contains three isoforms: CPT1A, CPT1B, and CPT1C. Research on CPT1A has been detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schlaepfer and Joshi, 2020</xref>). CPT1A is critical to cancer cell growth, survival, and drug resistance, making it an attractive target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>). CPT1A also interacts with other key pathways and factors regulating gene expression and apoptosis in cancer cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Qu et al., 2016</xref>). However, its role in CRC and radiotherapy resistance is unclear.</p><p>Previously, we found that various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism, are closely related to tumour radioresistance. Therefore, this study mainly focused on CPT1A, which affects CRC radiosensitivity, to reveal novel therapeutic strategies to mitigate radiotherapy resistance and improve clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low expression of CPT1A in CRC tumours</title><p>Analysis of CRC mRNA sequencing arrays from GEO consistently indicated low <italic>CPT1A</italic> mRNA levels in CRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that low CPT1A-expressing patients had low overall survival (OS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Survival analysis of READ patients with low CPT1A using GEPIA also suggested a low OS; the difference was statistically close but not significant (p=0.061, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further investigate the correlation between CPT1A and radiotherapy efficacy, IHC staining and scoring for CPT1A were performed on samples from 43 patients with rectal cancer who received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Among patients with a tumour regression grade (TRG) score of 1, which indicates a minimal number of residual tumour cells, a high IHC score for CPT1A is often observed. Conversely, patients with a TRG score of 2, indicating more residual tumour cells, exhibited relatively lower IHC staining intensity and overall scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A comparison of groups with TRG 2–3 and TRG 1 revealed significantly higher IHC scores in the TRG 1 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

CPT1A is often downregulated in CRC, and low CPT1A expression can worsen OS and increase the probability of radiochemotherapy resistance. Low CPT1A expression increases FOXM1 activity, promoting the transcription and translation of downstream SOD1, SOD2, and CAT, thereby facilitating the scavenging of radiation-induced ROS. Our study establishes CPT1A as an effective biomarker to predict CRC prognosis and radiotherapy sensitivity and proposes the molecular mechanism by which it mediates radiosensitivity through the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis.</p><p>CPT1A is crucial to CRC initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mazzarelli et al., 2007</xref>). However, its role in CRC remains unclear. Using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to explore hub genes in CRC development, we found that CPT1A is expressed at low levels in CRC and acts as a central anticancer gene, exhibiting excellent prognostic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Sinomenine improves colitis-associated cancer by upregulating CPT1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, high CPT1A expression is associated with malignancy in CRC, and its inhibition ameliorates malignant phenotypes. CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation promotes CRC metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). DHP-B, a CPT1A inhibitor, disrupts CPT1A-VDAC1 interaction in the mitochondria, increasing mitochondrial permeability and reducing oxygen consumption and energy metabolism in CRC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). We observed significant downregulation of CPT1A expression in CRC, and low CPT1A expression was associated with worse prognosis and greater radiochemotherapy resistance, contrary to previous reports. This discrepancy may be related to the inherent heterogeneity of tumour tissue and differences in tumour stage.</p><p>The PGC1α/CEBPB/CPT1A axis, which enhances lipid β-oxidation, increases ATP and NADPH levels and promotes cellular radiation resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Tan et al. also discovered an interaction between CPT1A and Rab14, which transports fatty acids into the mitochondria, thereby facilitating lipid oxidation and cell survival under irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2019</xref>). The HER1/2-MEK-ERK1/2-CPT1A/CPT2 axis reportedly enhances cell proliferation and confers radiation resistance in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han et al., 2019</xref>). However, no studies have investigated the association between CPT1A and radiosensitivity in CRC. Our research revealed that CPT1A is a radiation sensitivity gene, contradicting previous literature, possibly due to differences in cancer types.</p><p>Transcriptomic sequencing revealed that CPT1A regulates multiple pathways, including the peroxisomal pathway, which is responsible for ROS scavenging. <italic>CPT1A</italic> knockdown upregulated FOXM1, which, in turn, stimulated the transcription and translation of crucial antioxidative enzymes, SOD1, SOD2, and CAT, thereby expediting ROS clearance. This contradicts previous findings that <italic>CPT1A</italic> overexpression accelerates ROS production by increasing fatty acid β-oxidation, thereby promoting ageing phenotypes or augmenting cancer cells’ oxidative defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings diverge from those of other studies for two main reasons: first, previous research into the effects of CPT1A on ROS largely centred around mitochondria rather than the peroxisome; second, previous studies did not account for radiation, which significantly increases ROS production above cellular oxidative processes.</p><p>Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a critical transcription factor for many cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalathil et al., 2020</xref>). Besides benefitting normal cell functions, it also regulates cancer processes, including growth, metastasis, and recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alimardan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khan et al., 2023</xref>). FOXM1 also affects radiotherapy outcomes in many cancer types, including CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takeshita et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiu et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we identified FOXM1 as a key regulator connecting CPT1A to ROS scavenging in CRC, exhibiting an inverse correlation with both CPT1A and ROS levels. FOXM1 is an essential transcription factor in intracellular redox, specifically in regulating the redox state of malignant mesothelioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunniff et al., 2014</xref>). FOXM1-dependent fatty acid oxidation-mediated ROS modulation is a cell-intrinsic drug resistance mechanism in cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>FOXM1</italic> knockdown increases intracellular ROS levels and decreases the transcription levels of SOD2, CAT, PRDX, and GPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smirnov et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, our findings align with existing literature, highlighting the crucial role of FOXM1 in orchestrating the interplay between CPT1A and ROS homoeostasis. We further revealed that FOXM1 participates in the transcriptional regulation of SOD1.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. We only conducted radiosensitivity investigations of CPT1A in nude mice, which only demonstrated its regulatory role in CRC cell radiosensitivity. It remains unclear whether CPT1A can regulate the radiosensitivity of the entire tumour microenvironment in immunocompetent mice. The cell lines used in our study have different genetic backgrounds; specifically, HCT116 is microsatellite instable, whereas SW480 is not. Additionally, FOXM1 primarily localises to the nucleus, whereas CPT1A is a cytoplasmic protein; there is no known physiological basis for their co-localisation. Therefore, the specific mechanism through which CPT1A regulates FOXM1 expression requires further investigation. The reasons for the decreased expression of CPT1A in tumour cells remain unclear. Future studies should explore this in greater detail.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and materials</title><p>The

infection</title><p>The CRC cell lines HCT-15, RKO, HCT 116, HT-29, Caco-2, SW480, and SW620 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). All cell lines were authenticated with STR profiling, using cell line authentication services offered by ATCC, to avoid misidentification and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To establish radiation-resistant strains, HCT-15-25F and HCT-15-5F cells were generated using both conventional fractionated irradiation (2 Gy/fraction, 25 fractions, 5 fractions/week over 5 weeks) and large-fractionated irradiation (5 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions, for 1 week).</p><p>The full-length lentiviral expression of <italic>CPT1A</italic> with puromycin was constructed by VectorBuilder. <italic>CPT1A</italic>-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors (hCpt1a[gRNA#1]: <named-content content-type="sequence">AAATCTCTACTACACGGCCGATGTTACGACAGGTACCGTCCTT</named-content>, hCpt1a[gRNA#2]: <named-content content-type="sequence">AGAAGGTAAGGACGGTACCTGTCGTAACATCGGCCGTGTAGTA</named-content>, hCpt1a[gRNA#3]: <named-content content-type="sequence">CTGAACACTCCTGGGCAGATGCGCCGATCGTGGCCCACCTTTG</named-content>) with RFP and Puro were constructed by VectorBuilder. Infection and in vitro transfection of cell lines were performed following the manufacturer’s protocol. The lentiviral full-length expression of <italic>FOXM1</italic> with G418 was constructed using VectorBuilder.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CFA and multi-target single-hit survival model</title><p>The radiosensitivity of all human CRC cell lines was determined using a CFA with a multi-target single-hit model to the surviving fractions. Cells were plated in six-well plates and irradiated at doses of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 Gy (6 MeV X-rays). The cells were then cultured for 10 days, stained with 1% crystal violet, and quantified using ImageJ version 1.8.0.</p><p>The surviving fraction for each dose was calculated using the following formula:</p><p>[(number of surviving colonies at dose X)/(number of cells seeded at dose X (average colonies arising from non-irradiated cells (0 Gy))/number of non-irradiated cells seeded)]. Survival curves were used to develop the multi-target single-hit model, SF = 1 − (1 − e<sup>−D/D0</sup>)×N, where SF is the surviving fraction, D is the radiation dose, and N is the extrapolation number. The multi-target single-hit model provides parameters related to radiation sensitivity and sensitisation ratios, thereby directly reflecting the cells’ radiation sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Comet assay</title><p>The comet assay is a classical technique for assessing cellular radiation sensitivity. Essentially, cells that are more susceptible to radiation damage exhibit more DNA fragmentation post-irradiation, leading to a greater proportion of DNA in the tail (with less in the head). The comet assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, slides were covered with 100 μL of pre-warmed normal melting point agarose (2%) and placed on ice to solidify the first gel layer. Cells irradiated with 6 Gy were digested to obtain a cell suspension. Ten microlitres of the cell suspension were mixed with 80 μL of pre-warmed low melting point agarose (0.75%) and poured onto the slides. The slides were dipped in a cold lysis solution for 2 hr. After cell lysis, the slides were placed in a horizontal electrophoresis chamber filled with cold TAE solution, incubated for 25 min in the dark, and electrophoresed (1 V/cm). The slides were then neutralised in PBS for 5 min and stained with propidium iodide (PI) or DAPI. Comet images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. The percentage of DNA in the tail was analysed using the CASP 1.2.3 beta 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Animal model</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanfang Hospital (IACUC-PROJECT-20221128-003). Male BALB/c nude mice (5 weeks of age) were purchased from the Southern Medical University Laboratory Animal Center, China, and raised under specific pathogen-free conditions. All in vivo experiments were performed following institutional guidelines. To develop the xenograft tumour model, 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells were subcutaneously injected into the left flank of mice. On reaching a volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, the tumours were irradiated twice at 8 Gy, and other parts of the mouse body were protected with a lead shield. The tumour volume was measured using Vernier callipers and calculated as 1/2×length×width×width. After the mice were euthanised with phenobarbital sodium, the tumours were excised, weighed, and embedded in paraffin for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transcriptomics</title><p>HCT 116-NC and HCT 116-KO cells were collected and sent to RIBOBIO (Guangzhou, China) for polyA-seq transcriptome sequencing. RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To identify the DEGs between the two groups, the expression level of each transcript was calculated according to the transcript per million reads method. RSEM was used to quantify the gene abundance. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Genes with |log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)|&gt;1 and q&lt;0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed. In addition, functional enrichment analysis, including using GO and KEGG, was performed to identify significantly enriched DEGs in GO terms and metabolic pathways at a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.05 compared with the whole-transcriptome background. The heatmap and volcano of mRNA sequencing were conducted on ImageGP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bic.ac.cn/ImageGP">https://www.bic.ac.cn/ImageGP</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).

Briefly, the probe was diluted in cell culture media at a 1:1000 ratio to yield a final concentration of 10 μmol/L. The culture medium was replaced with 1 mL of DCFH-DA solution. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. After incubation, the cells were washed thrice with serum-free medium to remove any excess DCFH-DA.</p><p>One hour after 6 Gy irradiation, the cells were digested into single-cell suspensions and washed once with PBS.

The process of fatty acid oxidation is initiated by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), and the function and targetability of CPT1A in cancer metabolism and biology has been heavily investigated. This includes studies that have found important roles for CPT1A in colorectal cancer growth and metastasis.</p><p>In this study, Chen and colleagues use analysis of patient samples and functional interrogation in animal models to examine the role CPT1A plays in colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors find that CPT1A expression is decreased in CRC compared to paired healthy tissue and that lower expression correlates with decreased patient survival over time, suggesting that CPT1A may suppress tumor progression. To functionally interrogate this hypothesis, the authors both use CRISPR to knockout CPT1A in a CRC cell line that expresses CPT1A, and overexpress CPT1A in a CRC cell line with low expression. In both systems, increased CPT1A expression decreased cell survival and DNA repair in response to radiation in culture. Further, in xenograft models CPT1A decreased tumor growth basally and radiotherapy could further decrease tumor growth in CPT1A expressing tumors. As CRC is often treated with radiotherapy, the authors argue this radiosensitization driven by CPT1A could explain why CPT1A expression correlates with increased patient survival.</p><p>Lastly, Chen and colleagues sought to understand why CPT1A suppresses CRC tumor growth and sensitizes the tumors to radiotherapy in culture. Antioxidant capacity of cells can increase cell survival, so the authors examine antioxidant gene expression and levels in CPT1A expressing and non-expressing cells. CPT1A expression suppresses expression of antioxidant metabolism genes and lowers levels of antioxidants. Antioxidant metabolism genes can be regulated by the FOXM1 transcription factor, and the authors find that CPT1A expression regulates FOXM1 levels and that antioxidant gene expression can be partially rescued in CPT1A expressing CRC cells. This leads the authors to propose the following model: CPT1A expression downregulates FOXM1 (via some yet undescribed mechanism) which then leads to decreased antioxidant capacity in CRC cells and thus suppressing tumor progression and increasing radiosensitivity. This is an interesting model that could explain suppression of CPT1A expression in CRC, but key tenets of the model are untested and speculative.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• Analysis of CPT1A in paired CRC tumors and non-tumor tissue using multiple modalities combined with analysis of independent datasets rigorously show that CPT1A is downregulated in CRC tumors at the RNA and protein level.</p><p>• The authors use paired cell line model systems where CPT1A is both knocked out and overexpressed in cells lines that endogenously express or repress CPT1A respectively. These complementary model systems increase the rigor of the study.</p><p>• The finding that a metabolic enzyme generally thought to support tumor energetics actually is a tumor suppressor in some settings is theoretically quite interesting.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>• The authors propose that CPT1A expression modulates antioxidant capacity in cells by suppressing FOXM1 and that this pathway alters CRC growth and radiotherapy response. However, key aspects of this model are not tested. The authors do not show that FOXM1 contributes to regulation of antioxidant levels in CRC cells and tumors or if FOXM1 suppression is key to inhibition of CRC tumor growth and radiosensitization by CPT1A. Thus, the model the authors propose is speculative and not supported by the existing data.</p><p>• The authors propose two mechanisms by which CPT1A expression triggers radiosensitization: decreasing DNA repair capacity (Fig. 3) and decreasing antioxidant capacity (Fig. 5). However, while CPT1A expression does alter these capacities in CRC cells, neither is functionally tested to determine if altered DNA repair or antioxidant capacity (or both) are the reason why CRC cells are more sensitive to radiotherapy or are delayed in causing tumors in vivo. Thus, this aspect of the proposed model is also speculative.</p><p>• The authors find that CPT1A affects radiosensitization in cell culture and assess this in vivo. In vivo, CPT1A expression slows tumor growth even in the absence of radiotherapy, and radiotherapy only proportionally decreases tumor growth to the same extent as it does in CPT1A non-expressing CRC tumors. The authors propose from this data that CPT1A expression also sensitizes tumors to radiotherapy in vivo. However, it is unclear that CPT1A expression causes radiosensitization in vivo or if CPT1A expression acts as independent tumor suppressor to which radiotherapy has an additive effect.

The authors propose that this mechanism of ROS homeostasis is regulated through FOXM1. CPT1A is known for its role in fatty acid metabolism via beta-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, making it important in many metabolic disorders and cancers.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that upregulation of CPT1A is essential for the tumor-promoting effect in colorectal cancers (CRC) (PMID: 32913185). For example, CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation promotes colorectal cancer cell metastasis (PMID: 29995871), and repression of CPT1A activity renders cancer cells more susceptible to killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (PMID: 37722058). Additionally, CPT1A-mediated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) sensitizes nasopharyngeal carcinomas to radiation therapy (PMID: 29721083). While this suggests a tumor-promoting effect for CPT1A, the work by Chen et al. suggests instead a tumor-suppressive function for CPT1A in CRC, specifically that loss or low expression of CPT1A confers radioresistance in CRC. This makes the findings important given that they oppose the previously proposed tumorigenic function of CPT1A.</p><p>The study has several strengths. The authors employ both in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate that low CPT1A levels lead to radioresistance in CRC cells. They use isogenic HCT15 CRC cell lines that are radioresistant and show that overexpression of CPT1A sensitizes these cells to radiotherapy. Interestingly, the radioresistant cells exhibit lower CPT1A levels, suggesting that downregulation of CPT1A may be involved in the acquisition of radioresistance. Throughout the manuscript, the authors acknowledge the limitations of their work and avoid overextending their conclusions.</p><p>However, there are some major limitations to the study:</p><p>(1) Unexplored Contradictions with Previous Studies</p><p>While the authors propose a tumor-suppressive function for CPT1A in CRC, they do not sufficiently address the contradiction with prior studies that indicate a tumor-promoting role for CPT1A. The discussion briefly mentions that this discrepancy may stem from heterogeneity or differences in tumor stages, but a more thorough exploration is needed. Delving deeper into the contexts and conditions under which CPT1A exhibits differing roles would be critical for reconciling these findings and guiding future research.</p><p>(2) Limited Patient Data Analysis</p><p>The authors demonstrate that CPT1A levels are significantly lower in COAD (colon adenocarcinoma) and READ (rectal adenocarcinoma) compared to normal tissues. However, data from TCGA indicate that CPT1A expression levels are lower in 26 out of 31 tumor types compared to COAD or READ (as noted in the authors' response to the previous review). It is possible that reduced CPT1A expression might be a common feature across various cancers, not just CRC. A more comprehensive analysis comparing matched normal and tumor tissues across different cancer types would clarify whether the observed phenomenon is unique to CRC or part of a broader pattern. This is particularly important since several studies have reported CPT1A overexpression in tumors.</p><p>(3) Limitations in Experimental Scope</p><p>The experimental design primarily involves CPT1A knockout in HCT116 cells and CPT1A overexpression in SW480 cells, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Utilizing additional cell lines would account for genetic heterogeneity and enhance the robustness of the conclusions. Moreover, while the authors suggest an opposing effect of CPT1A in CRC compared to other studies, they have not investigated this through pharmacological means. Previous studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of CPT1A can limit cancer progression (e.g., PMID: 33528867, PMID: 32198139) and sensitize cells to radiation therapy (PMID: 30175155). Testing whether pharmacological inhibitors like etomoxir or ST1326 replicate the effects observed with genetic knockout would provide valuable insights and have significant implications for therapeutic strategies in CRC patients.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>This study offers valuable insights into the role of CPT1A in CRC radioresistance, proposing a tumor-suppressive function that challenges previous findings of its tumor-promoting role. While the findings are interesting and could have significant implications for cancer therapy, the limitations in experimental scope and the lack of a thorough discussion reconciling contradictory evidence warrant caution. Expanding the research to include a wider range of CRC cell lines, conducting pharmacological inhibition studies, and performing more detailed analyses would strengthen the conclusions and enhance our understanding of CPT1A's complex role in cancer progression and treatment response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fats and lipids serve many important roles in cancers, including serving as important fuels for energy metabolism in cancer cells by being oxidized in the mitochondria. The process of fatty acid oxidation is initiated by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), and the function and targetability of CPT1A in cancer metabolism and biology have been heavily investigated. This includes studies that have found important roles for CPT1A in colorectal cancer growth and metastasis.</p><p>In this study, Chen and colleagues use analysis of patient samples and functional interrogation in animal models to examine the role CPT1A plays in colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors find that CPT1A expression is decreased in CRC compared to paired healthy tissue and that lower expression correlates with decreased patient survival over time, suggesting that CPT1A may suppress tumor progression. To functionally interrogate this hypothesis, the authors both use CRISPR to knockout CPT1A in a CRC cell line that expresses CPT1A and overexpress CPT1A in a CRC cell line with low expression. In both systems, increased CPT1A expression decreased cell survival and DNA repair in response to radiation in culture. Further, in xenograft models, CPT1A decreased tumor growth basally and radiotherapy could further decrease tumor growth in CPT1A-expressing tumors. As CRC is often treated with radiotherapy, the authors argue this radiosensitization driven by CPT1A could explain why CPT1A expression correlates with increased patient survival.</p><p>Lastly, Chen and colleagues sought to understand why CPT1A suppresses CRC tumor growth and sensitizes the tumors to radiotherapy in culture. The antioxidant capacity of cells can increase cell survival, so the authors examine antioxidant gene expression and levels in CPT1A-expressing and non-expressing cells. CPT1A expression suppresses the expression of antioxidant metabolism genes and lowers levels of antioxidants. Antioxidant metabolism genes can be regulated by the FOXM1 transcription factor, and the authors find that CPT1A expression regulates FOXM1 levels and that antioxidant gene expression can be partially rescued in CPT1A-expressing CRC cells. This leads the authors to propose the following model: CPT1A expression downregulates FOXM1 (via some yet undescribed mechanism) which then leads to decreased antioxidant capacity in CRC cells, thus suppressing tumor progression and increasing radiosensitivity. This is an interesting model that could explain the suppression of CPT1A expression in CRC, but key tenets of the model are untested and speculative.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Analysis of CPT1A in paired CRC tumors and non-tumor tissue using multiple modalities combined with analysis of independent datasets rigorously show that CPT1A is downregulated in CRC tumors at the RNA and protein level.</p><p>The authors use paired cell line model systems where CPT1A is both knocked out and overexpressed in cell lines that endogenously express or repress CPT1A respectively.

In this study, we employed Western blotting to assess the protein levels of the ROS scavenging enzymes CAT, SOD1, and SOD2 following FOXM1 overexpression.

In this study, we combined a colony formation assay, multi-target single-hit survival model, comet assay, and Western blotting (for γH2AX) to evaluate DNA damage and repair in cells. Additionally, we employed qPCR, Western blotting, and enzyme activity kits to assess the direct ROS-scavenging activities of the peroxisomal enzymes CAT, SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors find that CPT1A affects radiosensitization in cell culture and assess this in vivo.

As shown in Figure 4D, in the absence of CPT1A knockdown, radiotherapy reduced the percentage of Ki67-positive cells in the xenograft tumors by 32.9% (approximately 39.6% of the pre-irradiation baseline). In contrast, upon CPT1A knockdown, radiotherapy only led to a 14.5% reduction in the percentage of Ki67-positive cells (approximately 15.6% of the pre-irradiation baseline). Furthermore, as illustrated in Figures 4E and 4F, in the absence of CPT1A overexpression, radiotherapy resulted in a 0.10-g decrease in tumor weight (around 52.5% of the pre-irradiation weight), whereas with CPT1A overexpression, radiotherapy induced a more pronounced 0.12-g reduction in tumor weight (approximately 89.7% of the pre-irradiation weight). Collectively, these findings indicate that CPT1A exhibits a radiosensitising effect. We have incorporated these relevant details in the Results section (Lines 196-201 and 204-208).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose in Figure 3 that DNA repair capacity is inhibited in CRC cells by CPT1A expression.

In this study, we also employed a colony formation assay, multi-target single-hit survival model, and comet assay to elucidate the impact of CPT1A on DNA repair capacity. These methods all indicated that DNA repair capacity is inhibited in CRC cells by CPT1A expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are conflicting studies (PMID: 37977042, 29995871) that suggest that CPT1A is overexpressed in CRC and contributes to tumor progression rather than acting as a tumor suppressor as the authors propose. It would be helpful for readers for the authors to discuss these studies and why there is a discrepancy between them.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. We have expanded the discussion of these findings in the relevant section of the manuscript (Lines 317-318). We speculated that the differences between our observations and previous reports may be attributable to the inherent heterogeneity of tumor tissues as well as variations in tumor stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Chen et al. describes how low levels of CPT1A in colorectal cancer (CRC) confer radioresistance by expediting radiation-induced ROS clearance.

Additionally, inhibition of CPT1A-mediated fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) sensitizes nasopharyngeal carcinomas to radiation therapy (PMID: 29721083). While this suggests a tumor-promoting effect for CPT1A, the work by Chen et al. suggests instead a tumor-suppressive function for CPT1A in CRC, specifically that loss or low expression of CPT1A confers radioresistance in CRC. This makes the findings important given that they oppose the previously proposed tumorigenic function of CPT1A. However, the data presented in the manuscript is limited in scope and analysis.</p><p>Major Limitations:</p><p>(1) Analysis of Patient Samples</p><p>- Figure 1D shows that CPT1A levels are significantly lower in COAD and READ compared to normal tissues. It would be beneficial to show whether CPT1A levels are also significantly lower in CRC compared to other tumor types using TCGA data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. We assessed the expression levels of CPT1A across all cancer types in the TCGA dataset and found that the abundance of CPT1A in CRC was significantly lower compared to cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), kidney chromophobe (KICH), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (Author response image 1).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The mRNA level of CPT1A across all cancer types in the TCGA dataset.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97827-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The analysis should include a comparison of closely related CPT1 isoforms (CPT1B and CPT1C) to emphasize the specific importance of CPT1A silencing in CRC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. We further examined the mRNA expression levels of the CPT1 isoforms CPT1B and CPT1C in COAD and READ tumor samples and their respective normal tissue counterparts. The results showed that CPT1B was significantly upregulated in READ tumor samples compared to normal tissues. Similarly, CPT1C was significantly overexpressed in both READ and COAD tumor samples relative to their normal tissue controls (Author response image 2).</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The mRNA expression levels of CPT1B and CPT1C in rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) based on data from the TCGA database.</title><p>A.

This should be detailed in the text and figure legend.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. We have provided a detailed description of the methodology used to determine the IHC scores and criteria applied to categorise patients into CPT1A-high and CPT1A-low groups in the Materials and Methods section (Lines 418-426) as well as the legend of Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- None of Figure 2B or 2C show how many patients were assigned to the CPT1A-low and CPT1A-high groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. We have added the number of patients in the CPT1A-low and CPT1A-high groups to the legends of Figures 2B and 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Model Selection and Experimental Approaches</p><p>- The authors primarily use CPT1A knockout (KO) HCT116 cells and CPT1A overexpression (OE) SW480 cells for their experiments, which poses major limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The genetic backgrounds of the cell lines (e.g., HCT116 being microsatellite instable (MSI) and SW480 not) should be considered as they might influence treatment outcomes. This should be acknowledged as a major limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. Indeed, the genetic background differences among cell lines represent a significant limitation. We have addressed this issue in the discussion section (Lines 363-365).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Regardless of their CPT1A expression levels, for the experiments with HCT116 and SW480 cells in Figure 3C-F, it would be useful to see whether HCT116 cells can be further sensitized to radiotherapy in overexpression and whether SW480 cells can be desensitized through CPT1A KO.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. Due to the inherently high levels of CPT1A in the HCT116 cell line, we attempted to perform relevant experiments but were unable to achieve significant overexpression. Similarly, we faced challenges with the SW480 cell line, which has lower levels of CPT1A. We could thus not provide additional insights in this respect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The use of only two CRC cell lines is insufficient to draw broad conclusions. Additional CRC cell lines should be used to validate the findings and account for genetic heterogeneity. The authors should repeat key experiments with additional CRC cell lines to strengthen their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. To address this issue, we used a radiation-resistant variant of the HCT-15 cell line as a new approach to investigate whether CPT1A is associated with cellular radiation sensitivity. We believe that the data obtained from these acquired resistant cell lines are comparable to those from the ordinary cell lines mentioned in the reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Pharmacological Inhibition</p><p>Several studies have reported beneficial outcomes of using CPT1 pharmacological inhibition to limit cancer progression (e.g., PMID: 33528867, PMID: 32198139), including its application in sensitization to radiation therapy (PMID: 30175155). Since the authors argue for the opposite case in CRC, they should show this through pharmacological means such as etomoxir and whether CPT1A inhibition phenocopies their observed genetic KO effect, which would have important implications for using this inhibitor in CRC patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. The referenced literature has indeed attracted our attention. Our research group is concurrently investigating the role of CPT1A in tumor radiotherapy and immunology, utilising CPT1A inhibitors for experimental validation. We look forward to publishing these related studies to further support the conclusions presented in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Data Representation and Statistical Analysis</p><p>- The relative mRNA expression levels across the seven cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1C) differ greatly from those reported in the DepMap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>). This discrepancy should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. The observed differences in mRNA levels may be attributable to variations in cell culture density. For subsequent radiation sensitivity experiments, we maintained our cell culture density at approximately 70–80% confluence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The statistical significance of differences in mRNA and protein levels between RT-sensitive and RT-resistant cells should be shown (Supplementary Figure 1C, D).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included a statistical analysis of the differences in CPT1A mRNA levels between RT-sensitive and -resistant cells in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 1C. However, further analysis revealed no significant difference in CPT1A protein levels between these groups. This was attributed to the high variability in grayscale values observed between the groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusion</p><p>The study offers significant insights into the role of CPT1A in CRC radioresistance, proposing a tumor-suppressive function. However, the scope and depth of the analysis need to be expanded to fully validate these claims. Additional CRC cell lines, pharmacological inhibition studies, and a more detailed analysis of patient samples are essential to strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank Reviewer #2 for the comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study aims to elucidate the role of CPT1A in developing resistance to radiotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). The manuscript is a collection of assays and analyses to identify the mechanism by which CPT1A leads to treatment resistance through increased expression of ROS-scavenging genes facilitated by FOXM1 and provides an argument to counter this role, leading to a reversal of treatment resistance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The article is well written with sound scientific methodology and results. The assays performed are well within the scope of the hypothesis of the study and provide ample evidence for the role of CPT1A in the development of treatment resistance in colorectal cancer.

The work heavily relies on bioinformatics and in vitro work with little backing of in vivo and patient data.

Our research group is continuing to explore the role of CPT1A in colorectal cancer radiotherapy and immunotherapy. In a new study, we used a C57BL/6 mouse model to conduct <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments. Preliminary data suggest that CPT1A confers heightened radiosensitivity to immunocompetent mice. We look forward to the forthcoming publication of this ongoing research project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The manuscript was challenging to read and contained many typographical errors and tangents that were not logically relevant to the logic of the paper. For example, in lines 365-367 the authors talk about peroxisomes being important for redox balance and that they will target peroxisomal pathways. However, the authors do not perform any experiments targeting peroxisomal pathways. So, I found myself quite perplexed. Careful proofreading of the manuscript would improve the utility for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. We have made several additions throughout the manuscript to include more relevant information and experimental details, thereby improving the manuscript’s logical structure and readability. As described in the text, we used the DCFH-DA probe to measure ROS levels in cells, considering that regulation of intracellular ROS levels is a major function of peroxidases. We examined the transcriptional levels, protein expression, and enzymatic activities of peroxidases such as CAT, SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3 through qPCR, Western blotting, and specific assay kits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Clarification and Flow</p><p>Introduction Clarity: The introduction introduces several topics in succession without clearly connecting them. For example, the introduction of FOXM1 on Line 102 lacks clarity in its relationship to the study. Consider discussing these elements only in the discussion section to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We have moved the section on FOXM1 to the discussion to enhance readability (Lines 342-348).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explanation for Non-experts: Both the multi-target single-hit survival model and the comet assay require one sentence to explain their principles for non-experts in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included brief explanations of the multi-target single-hit survival model and the comet assay in the Materials and Methods section to clarify these concepts to readers not familiar with the subject (Lines 458-460 and 462-465).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Specific Text Revisions</p><p>- Line 302: &quot;We transfected the CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus into HCT 116 ... efficiency of the 2nd site was the highest&quot; - Clarify what is meant by &quot;second site.&quot; If you mean the second sgRNA, please use this term.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have revised ‘2nd’ to ‘second’ (Lines 151 and 152).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 358-359: For the results subsection &quot;Low CPT1A levels accelerate post-radiation ROS scavenging,&quot; include an introductory sentence, such as: &quot;To study the mechanism of low CPT1A expression in radiotherapy resistance, we conducted differential gene expression analysis between HCT116 CPT1A KO and NC cells.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added an introductory sentence in the section titled ‘Low CPT1A Levels Accelerate Post-Radiation ROS Scavenging’ (Lines 215-217).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 359: &quot;The gene expression heatmap showed high consistency among replicates for both HCT 116-NC and HCT 116-KO cells (Supplementary Figure 3A).&quot; If these are technical replicates performed on the same batch of KO or NC cells, please state this clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the suggested information to improve clarity (Line 218).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 360-362: &quot;With CPT1A knockdown, we found 363 upregulated and 1290 downregulated genes (|log2(fold change)|&gt;1 and P&lt;0.05).&quot; Ensure that the p-value is correct; it seems this should be q-value &lt; 0.05.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have revised ‘p’ to ‘q’ (Lines 220 and 496).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 363: Introduce the term &quot;DEGs&quot; as Differentially Expressed Genes in the main text, not just in the Materials and Methods (line 215).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have introduced the term &quot;DEGs&quot; as Differentially Expressed Genes in the main text (Lines 221-222).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Lines 364-365: &quot;Showing that the main enriched pathways were in peroxisomes, cell cycle nucleotide excision repair, and fatty acid degradation (Figure 5A).&quot; The data does not support this statement.
