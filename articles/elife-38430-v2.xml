of the drug thalidomide led to the birth of thousands of children with severe birth defects. Despite their teratogenicity, thalidomide and related IMiD drugs are now a mainstay of cancer treatment; however, the molecular basis underlying the pleiotropic biology and characteristic birth defects remains unknown. Here we show that IMiDs disrupt a broad transcriptional network through induced degradation of several C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factors, including SALL4, a member of the <italic>spalt</italic>-like family of developmental transcription factors. Strikingly, heterozygous loss of function mutations in <italic>SALL4</italic> result in a human developmental condition that phenocopies thalidomide-induced birth defects such as absence of thumbs, phocomelia, defects in ear and eye development, and congenital heart disease. We find that thalidomide induces degradation of SALL4 exclusively in humans, primates, and rabbits, but not in rodents or fish, providing a mechanistic link for the species-specific pathogenesis of thalidomide syndrome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38430.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Thalidomide was sold in the 1950s and 1960s as a sedative and anti-nausea medication for pregnant women suffering from morning sickness. Studies in mice and other animals had suggested thalidomide was safe and led some countries to allow the drug to be used in humans. By 1961, it became clear that thalidomide use by pregnant women led to serious birth defects, and the drug was removed from the market. By then, thalidomide had caused birth defects in over 10,000 babies, a tragedy that has been described as the biggest man-made medical disaster in human history. It led many countries to adopt tougher standards for drug safety.</p><p>Thalidomide and similar drugs are now used with great success to treat leprosy and various blood cancers. But questions remain about exactly how the drugs work and how they cause birth defects like shortened arms and legs. Previous studies have shown that thalidomide binds to a protein called cereblon, which marks other proteins for destruction and removal from the cell. Thalidomide hijacks cereblon and causes it to tag the wrong proteins.</p><p>To learn more about how thalidomide causes birth defects, Donovan et al. treated human embryonic stem cells and cancer cells with thalidomide and related drugs. Analyzing the proteins inside the cells revealed that the drugs caused dramatic reductions in the amount of a protein called SALL4, which is essential for limb development. It was already known that mutations in the gene that produces SALL4 cause two conditions called Duane Radial Ray syndrome and Holt-Oram syndrome. Both conditions can result in birth defects like those seen in babies exposed to thalidomide.</p><p>As well as showing that thalidomide-hijacked cereblon marks SALL4 for destruction, Donovan et al. also reveal why mice do not develop birth defects when exposed to thalidomide. This is because genetic differences make the mouse cereblon proteins unable to tag SALL4. Researchers could now build on these results to develop safer versions of thalidomide that do not target SALL4 while still successfully treating leprosy and cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemical biology</kwd><kwd>teratogenicity</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA214608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nowak</surname><given-names>Radoslaw P</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name><name><surname>Berry</surname><given-names>Bethany C</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRR-50-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Linde Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Eric S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Thalidomide and its derivates induce degradation of many C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger transcription factors, including SALL4, providing insight into a long-standing mystery in modern pharmacology, and starting points for future drug development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thalidomide was first marketed in the 1950s as a nonaddictive, nonbarbiturate sedative with anti-emetic properties, and was widely used to treat morning sickness in pregnant women. Soon after its inception, reports of severe birth defects appeared, but it was denied that these were linked to thalidomide. In 1961, two independent reports confirmed that thalidomide was causative to this, the largest preventable medical disaster in modern history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenz, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McBride, 1961</xref>). In addition to thousands of children born with severe birth defects, there were reports of increased miscarriage rates during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz, 1988</xref>). Despite this tragedy, thalidomide, and its close derivatives, lenalidomide and pomalidomide, known as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), continue to be used to treat a variety of clinical conditions such as multiple myeloma (MM) and 5q-deletion associated myelodysplastic syndrome (del(5q)-MDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Amato et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan and Lentzsch, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although a potentially transformative treatment for MM, the molecular mechanisms of thalidomide teratogenicity, and many of its biological activities remain elusive. It was only recently shown that thalidomide and analogs exert their therapeutic effect by binding to the Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL4-RBX1-DDB1-CRBN (CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamberlain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito et al., 2010</xref>) and promoting ubiquitination and degradation of key efficacy targets (<italic>neo-</italic>substrates), such as the zinc finger (ZnF) transcription factors IKAROS (IKZF1), AIOLOS (IKZF3), and ZFP91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandhi et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krönke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). IMiDs can also promote degradation of targets that lack a zinc finger domain, including Casein Kinase 1 alpha (CSNK1A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krönke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>) and GSPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matyskiela et al., 2016</xref>). CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> has further been implicated in the IMiD-independent turnover of GLUL, BSG, and MEIS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krönke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">;Fischer et al., 2014</xref>), and regulation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), processes potentially inhibited by IMiDs. Although no obvious sequence homology exists between the known IMiD-dependent CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> substrates, all share the characteristic β-hairpin loop structure observed in X-ray crystal structures of IMiDs bound to CRBN and CSNK1A1 or GSPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matyskiela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>), and a key glycine residue that engages the phthalimide moiety of IMiDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matyskiela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). Despite progress in understanding the therapeutic mechanism of action of thalidomide, the cause of thalidomide syndrome has remained unknown since its description in 1961. Over the last 60 years, multiple theories such as anti-angiogenic properties or the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by thalidomide, or specific metabolites of thalidomide have been linked to thalidomide-induced defects. However, rarely do they explain the full spectrum of birth defects caused by all members of the IMiD family of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vargesson, 2015</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that species such as mice, rats, and bush babies are resistant to thalidomide-induced teratogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heger et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingalls et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vickers, 1967</xref>), which suggests an underlying genetic difference between species, more likely to be present in a specific substrate rather than in a general physiological mechanism such as anti-angiogenic effects or ROS production. To date, IMiD target identification efforts have largely focused on elucidating the mechanism of therapeutic efficacy of these drugs in MM and del(5q)-MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gandhi et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krönke et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). However, these hematopoietic lineages may not express the specific proteins that are important in the developmental events disrupted by thalidomide during embryogenesis. In the absence of tractable animal models that closely resemble the human disease, we focused on human embryonic stem cells (hESC) as a model system that more likely expresses proteins relevant to embryo development, and set out to investigate the effects of thalidomide in this developmental context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IMiDs induce CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>-dependent degradation of multiple C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factors</title><p>We established a mass spectrometry-based workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to detect IMiD-induced protein degradation in hESC.

To minimize transcriptional changes and other secondary effects that often result from extended drug exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>), cells were treated for 5 h and protein abundance was measured in multiplexed mass spectrometry-based proteomics using tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods). From ~10,000 proteins quantified in H9 hESC, only the developmental <italic>spalt</italic>-like transcription factor SALL4 showed statistically significant downregulation across all three drug treatments with a change in protein abundance greater than 1.5-fold, and a p value &lt; 0.001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

As degradation is mediated through CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, and because CRBN expression levels are high in the central nervous system (CNS), we assessed the effects of IMiDs in two different neuroblastoma cell lines, Kelly and SK-N-DZ cells, as well as the commonly used multiple myeloma cell line, MM1s, as a control. Comprehensive proteomics studies across multiple independent replicates of hESC, Kelly, SK-N-DZ, and MM1s cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> for details), revealed multiple novel substrates for IMiDs (ZNF692, SALL4, RNF166, FAM83F, ZNF827, RAB28, ZBTB39, ZNF653, DTWD1, ZNF98, and GZF1). To validate these novel targets, we carried out a ‘rescue’ proteomics experiment, in which we treated SK-N-DZ cells with 1 µM pomalidomide or with a co-treatment of 1 µM pomalidomide and 5 µM MLN4924 (a specific inhibitor of the NAE1/UBA3 Nedd8 activating enzyme). Inhibition of the Cullin RING ligase (CRL) by MLN4924 fully abrogated IMiD-induced degradation of targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>), and thereby confirmed the CRL-dependent mechanism. This approach was confirmed by spot-checking IMiD-dependent degradation for novel targets for which antibodies were available by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). All targets that were found to be consistently degraded across multiple large-scale proteomics experiments were validated in those independent validation experiments, providing a high confidence target list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Eight of the 11 new targets found in the proteomics screen are ZnF proteins (SALL4, ZNF827, ZBTB39, RNF166, ZNF653, ZNF692, ZNF98 and GZF1), and except for RNF166, all contain at least one ZnF domain that has the characteristic features previously described as critical for IMiD-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We also observe a striking difference in substrate specificity among thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We find that thalidomide induces robust degradation of the zinc finger transcription factors ZNF692, SALL4, and the ubiquitin ligase RNF166 in cell lines expressing detectable levels of those proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Lenalidomide results in additional degradation of ZNF827, FAM83F, and RAB28 along with the lenalidomide-specific substrate CSNK1A1. Pomalidomide shows the most pronounced expansion of targets, and in addition induces robust degradation of ZBTB39, ZFP91, DTWD1, and ZNF653. It is interesting to note that DTWD1 is, as CSNK1A1 and GSPT1, another non zinc finger target that was found to be robustly degraded by pomalidomide. Although this expansion of substrates is interesting and may contribute to some of the clinical differences between lenalidomide and pomalidomide, a target causative for teratogenicity would need to be consistently degraded across all IMiDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SALL4, a key developmental transcription factor, is a bona fide IMiD-dependent CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> target</title><p>The robust down-regulation of SALL4, a <italic>spalt</italic>-like developmental transcription factor important for limb development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koshiba-Takeuchi et al., 2006</xref>), upon treatment with thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide prompted us to further investigate SALL4 as an IMiD-dependent target of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>. Strikingly, human genetic research has shown that familial loss of function (LOF) mutations in <italic>SALL4</italic> are causatively linked to the clinical syndromes, Duane Radial Ray syndrome (DRRS) also known as Okihiro syndrome, and mutated in some patients with Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS).

The penetrance of DRRS in individuals with heterozygous <italic>SALL4</italic> mutations likely exceeds 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohlhase, 2004</xref>), and thus partial degradation of SALL4 through IMiD exposure will likely result in similar clinical features observed in DRRS. All currently described <italic>SALL4</italic> mutations are heterozygous LOF mutations, and the absence of homozygous mutations indicates the essentiality of the gene. Accordingly, homozygous deletion of <italic>Sall4</italic> is early embryonic lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakaki-Yumoto et al., 2006</xref>).

Another genetic disorder with a related phenotype is Roberts syndrome, caused by mutations in the ESCO2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afifi et al., 2016</xref>). While ESCO2 similarly encodes for a zinc finger protein and is transcriptionally regulated by ZNF143 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishihara et al., 2010</xref>), ESCO2 (as well as ZNF143, SALL1, SALL2, and SALL3) protein levels were found to be unchanged in all of our mass spectrometry experiments despite robust and ubiquitous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata14">14</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38430.021</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Common phenotypes in thalidomide syndrome, Duane Radial Ray syndrome, and Holt-Oram syndrome.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th/><th>Thalidomide syndrome</th><th>Duane Radial Ray syndrome</th><th>Holt-Oram <break/>syndrome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>Upper limbs</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Thumbs</td><td>Thumbs</td><td>Thumbs</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Radius</td><td>Radius</td><td>Radius</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Humerus</td><td>Humerus</td><td>Humerus</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Ulna</td><td>Ulna</td><td>Ulna</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Fingers</td><td>Fingers</td><td>Fingers</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Lower limbs</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Mostly normal lower limbs</td><td>Mostly normal lower limbs</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Talipes dislocation</td><td>Talipes dislocation</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Hip dislocation</td><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Shortening of long bones</td><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Ears</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Absence or abnormal pinnae</td><td>Abnormal pinnae</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Deafness</td><td>Deafness</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Microtia</td><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Eyes</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Colobomata</td><td>Colobomata</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Microphthalmos</td><td>Microphthalmos</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Abduction of the eye</td><td>Abduction of the eye</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Duane anomaly</td><td>Duane anomaly</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Stature</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Short stature</td><td>Postnatal growth retardation</td><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Heart</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Ventricular septal defects</td><td>Ventricular septal defects</td><td>Ventricular septal defects</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td/><td>Atrial septal defects</td><td>Atrial septal defects</td><td>Atrial septal defects</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The remarkable phenotypic overlap of LOF mutations in <italic>SALL4</italic> with thalidomide embryopathy led us to further assess whether thalidomide and related IMiDs directly induce degradation of SALL4 in an IMiD and CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>-dependent manner.

Thus, we sought to test whether SALL4 binds to CRBN and to map the ZnF domain required for binding using purified recombinant proteins. Based on conserved features among IMiD-sensitive ZnF domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, C–x(2)-C-G motif within the canonical C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger motif), the second (SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub>) and fourth (SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub>) ZnF domains of SALL4 (aa 410–433, and aa 594–616, respectively) were identified as candidate degrons for IMiD-induced binding. We expressed, purified, biotinylated, and subjected these ZnF domains to in vitro CRBN binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). We observed dose-dependent binding between SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub> or SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub> and CRBN similar to that described for IKZF1/3 and ZFP91, albeit with reduced apparent affinity for SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). To estimate apparent affinities (<italic>K</italic><sub>D(app)</sub>) we titrated bodipy-FL labelled DDB1∆B-CRBN to biotinylated SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub>, or SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub> at 100 nM with saturating concentrations of IMiDs (50 µM) and measured the affinity by TR-FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), which confirmed the weak affinity of SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub>. However, we noticed that a construct spanning ZnF1 and ZnF2 of SALL4 (SALL4<sub>ZnF1-2</sub>) exhibited even tighter binding to CRBN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) and enhanced dose-dependent complex formation in TR-FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings suggest that multiple zinc finger domains of SALL4 contribute to binding, and may result in multivalent recruitment to CRBN in vivo. However, the strength of the interaction with ZnF4 is unlikely to be sufficient for degradation in cells, and moreover, the rank order of Pom &gt;Thal &gt;&gt; Len in binding observed with ZnF2 is in accordance with the cellular potency in degradation of SALL4, suggesting that ZnF2 is the critical ZnF domain for SALL4 degradation. We confirmed the specificity of the SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub> interaction by introducing a point mutation to glycine 416 (G416), the residue critical for IMiD-dependent binding to CRBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations to alanine (G416A) rendered SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub> resistant to IMiD-dependent binding to CRBN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Mutating glutamine 595 (Q595) in SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub>, another residue previously shown to be critical for IMiD-dependent CRBN binding in the ZnF domains of IKZF1/3, impaired IMiD-dependent binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), confirming the specificity of the interaction despite the weak binding affinity. As we observed increased affinity of the tandem-ZnF construct SALL4<sub>ZnF1-2</sub> compared with the single SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub>, we sought to test whether ZnF1 was sufficient for binding. We introduced the G416N mutation in ZnF2 or a S388N mutation in ZnF1 into the SALL4<sub>ZnF1-2</sub> construct (S388 is the ZnF1 sequence equivalent of ZnF2 G416; ZnF1-2: C-x-x-C-<underline>S/G</underline>) and performed CRBN binding assays. G416N, but not S388N, fully abrogated IMiD-dependent binding of SALL4<sub>ZnF1-2</sub> to CRBN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>), confirming the strict dependence on the ZnF2 interaction with CRBN. To test whether the second zinc finger of SALL4 is critical for IMiD-induced degradation in cells, we introduced G416A and G416N mutations into Flag-tagged full-length SALL4. When expressed in Kelly cells, the parental wild-type Flag-SALL4 was readily degraded by thalidomide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Similarly, Flag-tagged SALL4 with G600A or G600N mutations in ZnF4 were also shown to be readily degraded with thalidomide treatment, suggesting that SALL4<sub>ZnF4</sub> is dispensable for binding and subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Finally, the two conservative mutations in ZnF2 (G416A or G416N), both known to specifically disrupt binding to CRBN while maintaining the overall zinc finger fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>), rendered SALL4 stable under these treatment conditions, demonstrating that SALL4<sub>ZnF2</sub> is necessary for CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>-mediated degradation of SALL4 in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In vitro ubiquitination assays further confirm that SALL4<sub>ZnF1-2</sub> is ubiquitinated by CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> in an IMiD-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Together, our cellular and biochemical data establish SALL4 as a <italic>bona fide</italic> IMiD-dependent target of CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>, and demonstrate that the second zinc finger is necessary for IMiD-dependent degradation, while the tandem array of ZnF1-2 further strengthens the interaction in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38430.025</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SALL4 ZnF2 is the zinc finger responsible for IMiD-dependent binding to CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple sequence alignment of the validated ‘degrons’ from known IMiD-dependent zinc finger substrates, along with the two candidate zinc finger degrons from SALL4.

In contrast, many non-human primates exhibit phenotypes that mimic the human syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neubert et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vickers, 1967</xref>). These remarkable species-specific phenotypes have historically complicated studies of thalidomide embryopathies, and suggest a genetic difference between these species that would abrogate the detrimental effects of thalidomide. Mouse Crbn harbors a critical polymorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that prevents IMiD-dependent degradation of ZnF substrates and CSNK1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krönke et al., 2015</xref>), which could explain the absence of a SALL4-dependent phenotype in mice. Mice and rats (both insensitive to thalidomide embryopathies) harbor an isoleucine at CRBN position 388 (residue 388 refers to the human CRBN sequence). In contrast, sensitive primates have a valine in position 388 that is necessary for CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> to bind, ubiquitinate, and subsequently degrade ZnF substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with this concept, treatment of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) with increasing concentrations of thalidomide or pomalidomide does not promote degradation of mmSALL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and introducing a V388I mutation into hsCRBN renders the protein less effective to bind to SALL4 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We thus asked whether ectopic expression of hsCRBN in mouse cells would lead to IMiD-induced degradation of mmSALL4, similar to what had been observed for CSNK1A1, and could hence render mice sensitive to IMiD-induced birth defects. Expression of hsCRBN in mouse cells, while sensitizing cells to degradation of IMiD targets such as mmIKZF1/3, mmCSNK1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krönke et al., 2015</xref>), mmZFP91, or mmGZF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), does not result in degradation of mmSALL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To test whether a fully human CRBN in a human cell background would be sufficient to induce SALL4 degradation, we introduced hsSALL4, or mmSALL4 into human cells (Kelly cells) and found that while ectopically expressed hsSALL4 is readily degraded upon IMiD treatment, mmSALL4 is unaffected even at arbitrarily high doses of IMiDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Sequence analysis reveals that mice and zebrafish have critical mutations in the ZnF2 domain of SALL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which abrogate binding to hsCRBN in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), and render mmSALL4 and drSALL4 insensitive to IMiD-mediated degradation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We next sought to test whether exchange of the mmSALL4 ZnF2 domain for the hsSALL4 ZnF2 domain would be sufficient to enable mmSALL4 degradation in a human cell line (Kelly cells). Strikingly, through the five amino acid substitutions required to ‘humanize’ the mmSALL4 ZnF2 domain, we were able to induce thalidomide-mediated mouse SALL4 degradation in a human cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38430.028</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Identification of the sequence differences in the IMiD-dependent binding region of both CRBN and SALL4 in specific species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Close-up view of the beta-hairpin loop region of Ck1a (CSNK1A1) interacting with CRBN and lenalidomide (PDB: 5fqd) highlighting the additional bulkiness of the V388I mutation (PDB: 4ci1) present in mouse and rat CRBN.

The plasma concentration of thalidomide in humans is, however, unlikely to exceed 10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahut et al., 2009</xref>), a concentration that results in effective degradation of SALL4, but is 40 times below the dose found to be teratogenic in chicken and zebrafish embryos. While we do not observe degradation of mmSALL4 or drSALL4 upon high-dose exposure, we cannot rule out that such high doses will induce degradation of other ZnF targets in zebrafish or chicken, which could potentially result in the observed phenotypes. In fact, we show that IMiDs lead to degradation of multiple ZnF transcription factors, a class of proteins known to evolve very rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmitges et al., 2016</xref>), and it is likely that IMiDs will exhibit species-specific effects. Sequence analysis shows that IMiD-dependent ZnF targets such as SALL4, ZNF653, ZNF692, or ZBTB39, as well as other known genetic causes of limb defects in ZnF transcription factors, such as ESCO2, are highly divergent even in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We show that thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide all induce degradation of SALL4, which has been causatively linked to the most characteristic and common birth defects of the limbs and inner organs by human genetics. While other targets of thalidomide, such as CSNK1A1 for lenalidomide or GZF1, ZBTB39 for pomalidomide, may contribute to the pleiotropic developmental conditions observed upon thalidomide exposure, SALL4 is consistently degraded across all IMiDs and human geneticists associate heterozygous loss of SALL4 with human developmental syndromes that largely phenocopy thalidomide syndrome. Moreover, from the targets degraded across IMiDs, IKZF1/3 have been shown to be non-causative for birth defects, RNF166 is a ubiquitin ligase involved in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heath et al., 2016</xref>), and ZNF692 knock-out mice do not exhibit a teratogenic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium et al., 2016</xref>). While only genetic studies in non-human primates or rabbits can provide the ultimate molecular role of SALL4 and other targets in thalidomide embryopathies, the known functions of SALL4 are consistent with a potential role in thalidomide embryopathies.</p><p>The polypharmacology of IMiDs (most notably pomalidomide), together with the size and rapid evolution of the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> family of zinc finger transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which results in most C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factors being highly species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Najafabadi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmitges et al., 2016</xref>), help to explain the pleiotropic effects of IMiDs, which still remain largely understudied. Thalidomide embryopathies thus represent a case in which animal studies fall short, and it is likely that the clinical features of IMiD efficacy as well as adverse effects, are a result of induced degradation of multiple C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger transcription factors. For example, we see some degree of degradation for GZF1, another C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> transcription factor, while GZF1 is unlikely to cause the defining birth defects of thalidomide, mutations in GZF1 have been associated with joint laxity and short stature, which are both also found in thalidomide-affected children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). We also note that CRBN expression levels influence the efficacy of IMiDs in inducing protein degradation, and it is conceivable that these contribute to a certain degree of tissue selectivity of IMiD effects, which for example, could increase the therapeutic index in MM as hematopoietic lineages tend to have high levels of CRBN.</p><p>Thalidomide teratogenicity was a severe and widespread public health tragedy, affecting more than 10,000 individuals, and the aftermath has shaped many of the current drug regulatory procedures. Our findings that thalidomide and its derivatives induce degradation of SALL4, provide a direct link to genetic disorders of SALL4 deficiency, which phenocopy many of the teratogenic effects of thalidomide. While other effects of thalidomide, such as anti-angiogenic properties may contribute to birth defects, degradation of SALL4 is likely to contribute to birth defects. These findings can inform the development of new compounds that induce CRBN-dependent degradation of disease-relevant proteins but avoid degradation of developmental transcription factors such as SALL4, and thus have the potential for therapeutic efficacy without the risk of teratogenicity, a defining feature of this class of drugs. This is further relevant to the development of thalidomide-derived bifunctional small molecule degraders (commonly referred to as PROTACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raina and Crews, 2017</xref>), as we show that IMiD-based PROTACs (and novel IMiD derivatives such as CC-220) can be effective inducers of ZnF targets including SALL4 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Lastly, the surprising expansion in substrate repertoire for pomalidomide, suggests that IMiDs exhibit a large degree of polypharmacology contributing to both efficacy and adverse effects. Transcription factors, and specifically C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc fingers are highly divergent between species, and hence IMiDs and related compounds are likely to exhibit species-specific effects by virtue of their mode of action. In turn, the discovery that IMiDs target an unanticipated large set of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins with significant differences among thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and CC-220, suggests that this chemical scaffold holds the potential to target one of the largest families of human transcription factors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th colspan="2">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CRBN</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al.

The homogenized sample was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. A micro-BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine the final protein concentration in the cell lysate. 200 µg protein for each sample were reduced and alkylated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2017</xref>). Proteins were precipitated using methanol/chloroform. In brief, four volumes of methanol were added to the cell lysate, followed by one volume of chloroform, and finally three volumes of water. The mixture was vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to separate the chloroform phase from the aqueous phase. The precipitated protein was washed with three volumes of methanol, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the resulting washed precipitated protein was allowed to air dry. Precipitated protein was resuspended in 4 M urea, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, followed by dilution to 1 M urea with the addition of 200 mM EPPS pH 8 for digestion with LysC (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 12 h at room temperature. The LysC digestion was diluted to 0.5 M urea, 200 mM EPPS pH 8, and then digested with trypsin (1:50; enzyme:protein) for 6 h at 37°C. Tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile (ACN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Anhydrous ACN was added to each peptide sample to a final concentration of 30% v/v, and labeling was induced with the addition of TMT reagent to each sample at a ratio of 1:4 peptide:TMT label. The 10-plex labeling reactions were performed for 1.5 h at room temperature and the reaction quenched by the addition of 0.3% hydroxylamine for 15 min at room temperature. The sample channels were combined in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, desalted using C<sub>18</sub> solid phase extraction cartridges (Waters) and analyzed by LC-MS for channel ratio comparison. Samples were then combined using the adjusted volumes determined in the channel ratio analysis and dried down in a speed vacuum. The combined sample was then resuspended in 1% formic acid, and acidified (pH 2−3) before being subjected to desalting with C18 SPE (Sep-Pak, Waters).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Thalidomide caused one of the most dramatic, yet almost entirely preventable, catastrophes in human biomedical history. Decades after it had been understood that thalidomide induced severe birth defects, such as phocomelia, thalidomide and related IMiDs are being used as powerful agents in treating multiple myeloma and myodysplastic syndrome. While the mechanism of action of IMiDs in cancer therapy, i.e. induction of degradation of two Zn-finger transcription factors or CK1, respectively, are beginning to be understood, the cause for thalidomide-induced birth defects remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, Fischer, Ebert, and colleagues used a proteomic approach to search for proteins that are being degraded in the presence of IMiDs in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), as a model for human developmental disease. Notably, they identify the transcription factor SALL4 as a key new target of IMiDs that is degraded in the presence of thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide. In addition, the authors identify a set of additional Zn-finger transcription factors as targets of more potent IMiDs, the degradation of which was dependent on the CRL4<sup>CRBN</sup> machinery.</p><p>The findings of this study are important and deserve publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Counter to what had been published before, they indicate that thalidomide also acts during development by inducing neo-substrate degradation, rather than by inhibiting the CRL4 machinery. This will spur research aimed at identifying the true developmental substrate of CRBN, a target which may be controlled by a small molecule related to IMiDs. Further, this work explains the previous species specificity of the IMiDs, a key issue that had contributed to the historic tragedy as mouse experiments did not reveal any noticeable toxicity (i.e. mouse SALL4 is not getting degraded by IMiDs). While this work does not prove that SALL4 is the key target, the genetics of human developmental diseases caused by heterozygous deletion of SALL4 provides a very strong argument for SALL4 being at least a strong contributor to IMiD-based birth defects.</p><p>While most experiments were performed at a high level, a few issues need to be carefully addressed before this manuscript can be officially accepted.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3H and 3I are nice, but below the required quality for <italic>eLife</italic>. These need to be repeated, and Figure 3I needs the positive control on the same blot.</p><p>2) Figure 3J is also of fairly poor quality – it is also quite misleading, as it appears that the authors have used a no-lysine ubiquitin for these assays (which should be stated more directly in the legend or text). I would strongly recommend to repeat this assay with wildtype ubiquitin and enrich for ubiquitylated species (if they can't be detected directly) through TUBEs. This is a central figure for the paper, and it needs to be more convincing.</p><p>3) A critical experiment is missing for the argument of the authors that SALL4 represents a key substrate that might explain the teratogenic effects of thalidomide. They claim that both mutations in CRBN and the murine SALL4 degron prevent IMiD-dependent degradation. While one cannot expect to make a mouse that expresses both humanized CRBN and SALL4, it would be interesting to test whether mouse SALL4 with a human ZnF2 is degraded in a thalidomide-dependent manner in Kelly cells. This would provide stronger evidence for the authors' arguments, and given the genetics of DRRS, it would provide a very strong case for SALL4 being the key target of thalidomide in causing birth defects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38430.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Required revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 3H and 3I are nice, but below the required quality for eLife.
