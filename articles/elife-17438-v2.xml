strength of these interactions has been challenging. Studying dimerization of ClC-type transporters offers a new approach to the problem, as individual subunits adopt a stable and functionally verifiable fold that constrains the system to two states – monomer or dimer. Here, we use single-molecule photobleaching analysis to measure the probability of ClC-ec1 subunit capture into liposomes during extrusion of large, multilamellar membranes. The capture statistics describe a monomer to dimer transition that is dependent on the subunit/lipid mole fraction density and follows an equilibrium dimerization isotherm. This allows for the measurement of the free energy of ClC-ec1 dimerization in lipid bilayers, revealing that it is one of the strongest membrane protein complexes measured so far, and introduces it as new type of dimerization model to investigate the physical forces that drive membrane protein association in membranes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17438.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17438.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17438.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are encapsulated by membranes that form a barrier between the inside of the cell and the outside world. These membranes primarily consist of fatty molecules called lipids, but they are also packed with proteins such as ion channels and transporters that control which molecules pass in and out of the cell. It is proposed that membrane proteins fold spontaneously inside of the cell membrane to adopt the structures that allow them to carry out their function. While it is generally understood why proteins fold spontaneously when they are in water, it is less clear why this occurs for membrane proteins in the oily cell membrane.</p><p>Proteins fold into specific shapes because of favorable interactions between different surfaces of the molecule and because the folded structure increases the number of states available to the protein and the surrounding environment. Measuring a quantity known as the “free energy” reports the net balance between these thermodynamic factors and is the first step towards understanding why a membrane protein adopts its particular stable structure in the cell membrane. However, few experimental systems are suitable for studying this reaction in membranes.</p><p>One important group of membrane proteins that offers a new approach to studying this question is the CIC family of channels and transporters. These are large proteins that in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria and other organisms have only been observed as a “dimer” made up of two identical CIC molecules (or “monomers”). It is however possible that within cell membranes, the CIC transporter proteins switch between their dimer and monomer forms. Reducing the number of proteins in the membrane could reveal these monomers, and allow the free energy associated with forming a dimer from two monomers to be measured.</p><p>Chadda et al. diluted <italic>E. coli</italic> CIC protein from natural cell membranes into large synthetic membranes to reduce the number of proteins far below the amount normally seen in cells. Examining the membranes using a technique called single molecule fluorescence microscopy revealed that CIC does exist as monomers when present in low amounts in a membrane. Furthermore, measuring the free energy associated with forming a dimer showed that ClC is one of the strongest membrane protein dimers measured so far.</p><p>Chadda et al. also found that CIC is more likely to be in its monomer form if a bulky amino acid called tryptophan is added to the interface at which two CIC molecules bind to each other. Future studies will investigate the mechanism that underlies this change in stability. Ultimately, CIC could serve as a model system to study the forces associated with protein assembly in membranes and answer fundamental questions about membrane protein folding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17438.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17438.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>TIRF</kwd><kwd>equilibrium</kwd><kwd>lipid bilayer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM101016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnamani</surname><given-names>Venkatramanan</given-names></name><name><surname>Mersch</surname><given-names>Kacey</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>Janice L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001024</institution-id><institution>Roy J.

Surprisingly, the thermodynamic forces driving this assembly remain poorly understood, due to a shortage of experimental systems where reversible equilibrium association can be observed in membranes. Dimerization models of single-pass transmembrane (TM) helices have provided a tractable system for free-energy measurements in detergent micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fleming et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacKenzie and Fleming, 2008</xref>), and recently, in lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">North et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yano et al., 2011</xref>). However, the relatively small change in solvent accessible surface area upon dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacKenzie et al., 1997</xref>) limits their potential to study protein-specific van der Waals interactions and lipid-solvent-dependent effects, the two driving forces hypothesized to be major players within the membrane environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Popot and Engelman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">White and Wimley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowie, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, studying the dimerization of multi-TM helix membrane proteins offers a new approach, as these interfaces are much larger, and each subunit is expected to adopt a stable, functional fold that could constrain the reaction to a two-state equilibrium. One example that appears particularly well suited is the homodimeric ClC-ec1 Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter native to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maduke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dutzler et al., 2002</xref>). This is a 50-kDa membrane protein that dimerizes via a membrane embedded, non-polar interface lined mainly by isoleucines and leucines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our previous work showed that insertion of bulky tryptophans at the interface destabilized the dimer in detergent, while preserving functional 2:1 Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport and structural fold as ascertained by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a distant ClC homologue, ClC-F, shows equilibrium exchange in detergent micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Last and Miller, 2015</xref>), raising the possibility of free-energy measurements of ClC dimerization in membranes.</p><p>Here, we measure the equilibrium dimerization free energy of ClC-ec1 in lipid bilayers by diluting the protein into large membranes and measuring the change in the monomer vs. dimer population. If the system is in a state of dynamic equilibrium, then diluting the protein in the lipid bilayer will shift the population to the monomeric state. To measure the proportion of monomers and dimers as a function of density, we incubated Cy5-labeled ClC-ec1 in large 10 μm diameter multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), then measured the probability that 1, 2, or more Cy5-labeled subunits are captured into extruded liposomes by single-molecule photobleaching analysis using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. This approach measures the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the MLV state at the point of extrusion, and as such reports the statistical mechanical dimerization free energy in the lipid bilayer.</p><p>The sensitivity of the single molecule approach allows for inspection of the protein at sub-biological densities, i.e. less than one subunit per typical cell membrane. With this technical development in hand, we determined that equilibrium ClC-ec1 subunit exchange occurs on a laboratory timescale and that the reaction follows an equilibrium dimerization isotherm as a function of protein density in the membrane. This allows for the measurement of the free energy of ClC-ec1 dimerization in lipid bilayers and the change in free energy due to tryptophan substitutions at the dimerization interface. This work introduces ClC-ec1 as an ideal platform for investigating thermodynamic driving forces underlying membrane protein assembly in membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-molecule co-localization microscopy of ClC-ec1 in 2:1 POPE/POPG liposomes</title><p>In a previous study, we showed that tryptophan substitutions I201W and I422W at the dimerization interface of ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) yield a functionally folded, monomeric form of the transporter in lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>). To set up the system for fluorescence studies, we moved a partially buried cysteine to a more accessible position, C85A/H234C that allows for quantitative labeling by Cy5-maleimide without impacting stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For simplicity, we will refer to this single-exposed cysteine construct as WT, and tryptophan substitutions as W (I422W) and WW (I201W/I422W).</p><p>To measure the dimerization reaction of ClC-ec1 in lipid bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we reconstituted Cy5-labeled protein in 2:1 POPE/POPG lipids at different mole fractions (<italic>χ</italic> subunit/lipid) and freeze/thawed the proteoliposomes to produce ~10 µm diameter multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pozo Navas et al., 2005</xref>). This creates a model of an infinite bilayer where subunits can exchange with one another, even at low dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After equilibration, the membranes are fractionated by extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), forming small liposomes that are then imaged on a TIRF microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) for single-molecule photobleaching analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). With single-molecule sensitivity, we can count the number of subunits captured into each liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and determine the probability distribution of fluorescent protein occupancy in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This approach extends another single-vesicle fluorescence method that examines the behavior of membrane proteins in individual liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathiasen et al., 2014</xref>). However, in our case, we are not studying the state of the protein in the final proteoliposome. For example, a spot that bleaches in two steps could represent a dimer or two independent monomers trapped in the same vesicle. Our approach ignores this ambiguity as it measures the probability that two fluorescent subunits were captured in the same vesicle, reporting the proximity of subunits at the point of extrusion of the large membranes. Therefore, the liposome extrusion step captures the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the prior MLV membrane state and ignores any changes in protein density or lipid composition that might arise during the extrusion process.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17438.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantifying ClC-ec1-Cy5 monomers vs. dimers in lipid bilayers by subunit capture into liposomes and single-molecule photo-bleaching analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting the equilibrium dimerization reaction of ClC-ec1 in lipid bilayers.

ideal experimental conditions, i.e. dilute conditions and 100% fluorescent labeling yield, a single or a double photobleaching step corresponds to a monomer or dimer respectively. In reality, labeling is imperfect, so and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> include additional states such as singly labeled dimers or two monomers, respectively. In addition, to quantify the dimerization reaction, one must examine the liposome occupancy as a function of increasing protein density in the membrane, a condition that increases the chance of randomly trapping independent subunits in the same liposome, whether associated as dimers or not. The probability for fluorescent subunit capture follows an apparent Poisson distribution that depends on: (i) the size distribution of the liposomes, (ii) the mole fraction subunit density in the lipid bilayer, (iii) Cy5 labeling yields and (iv) the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the membrane at the time of extrusion. The first three factors must be known and corrected for in order to properly extract information about the monomer-dimer reaction across a wide range of mole fraction densities.</p><p>To calculate this correction, we used the cryo-EM liposome size distribution reported by Walden et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walden et al., 2007</xref>) and spectrophotometrically determined Cy5 labeling yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to simulate the capture of non-interacting monomer into the extruded liposome population, i.e. the ideal monomer photobleaching probability distribution <italic>P<sup>M</sup><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), where n refers to the number of observed photobleaching steps. Measurement of the subunit/lipid mole fraction after freeze/thaw and extrusion show that the experimental mole fraction is 50% of the original reconstituted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). From here on, χ refers to the observed mole fraction, and it is this value that is considered in all of the simulations. At dilute conditions, i.e. densities less than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 2 × 10<sup>–6</sup> subunit/lipid (0.2 μg/mg reconstitution density, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), <italic>P<sup>M</sup><sub>1</sub></italic> is constant and close to one, reflecting single subunit occupancy in the liposomes. The simulation also predicts a non-zero <italic>P<sup>M</sup><sub>2</sub></italic> that arises from the small amount of non-specific labeling at sites other than the cysteine, resulting in the occasional double-labeled subunit.

This has been described before as 'artifactual togetherness' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanford and Reynolds, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fleming et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stanley and Fleming, 2005</xref>) and must be corrected for to extract the true dimerization reaction. Next, we simulated a population of non-interacting dimers to obtain the ideal dimer photobleaching probability distribution <italic>P<sup>D</sup><sub>n</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>P<sup>D</sup><sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>P<sup>D</sup><sub>2</sub></italic> are comparable across the entire protein density range, arising from the fact that our experimental labeling yield is ~70%, leading to an equal probability of dimers labeled with one Cy5 vs. two Cy5 in the single-molecule range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To assess the dynamic range for this approach, we performed a chi-squared analysis of the monomer vs. dimer probability distributions at each mole fraction value.

In 2:1 POPE/POPG, we find that ClC-ec1 is a high-affinity dimer with Kχ<sup>WT ClC-ec1</sup> ~10<sup>8</sup> lipids/subunit, second in stability to GpA in POPC, which has a reported equilibrium constant of Kχ<sup>GpA</sup> ~10<sup>9</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2010</xref>). The strength of GpA dimerization is remarkable considering its small 200 Å<sup>2</sup> interface, but it has been shown that this stability involves the GxxxG helix-packing motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lemmon et al., 1992</xref>), which allows for backbone flexibility that maximizes VDW packing and hydrogen bonding inside the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). ClC-ec1 lacks this specialized motif, so why then is the dimer so stable in lipid bilayers?</p><p>To compare between these two very different proteins, we normalize the free energies by the total buried surface area, to obtain a binding efficiency per Å<sup>2</sup> of the dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Day et al., 2012</xref>). In this manner, GpA in POPC is highly efficient, contributing -30 cal/mole per Å<sup>2</sup>, whereas wild-type ClC-ec1 only exhibits -5 cal/mole per Å<sup>2</sup> stability. When GpA dimerization was measured in <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid membranes, similar to our 2:1 POPE/POPG bilayers, the equilibrium constant shifted to ~5 × 10<sup>5</sup> lipids/subunit due to electrostatic destabilization by negatively charged lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Bowie, 2011</xref>). Even though GpA is slightly weaker than ClC-ec1 in these lipids, its efficiency is still higher, with -20 cal/mole per Å<sup>2</sup>. Even though ClC-ec1 and GpA reach similar stabilities in the membrane, the dramatic differences in the dimerization efficiencies suggest they do so by different physical mechanisms.</p><p>In contrast, dimerization efficiencies of transmembrane helices that do not contain GxxxG motifs have values comparable to ClC-ec1. For example, the Serine Zipper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">North et al., 2006</xref>) is -8 cal/mole per Å<sup>2</sup> and poly-LEU-ALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yano et al., 2002</xref>) is -5 cal/mole per Å<sup>2</sup>, assuming a dimerization interface of 300 Å<sup>2</sup>. These are often referred to as models of inert helix dimerization, and it is expected that there is minimal conformational change in the helices upon association. In that respect, ClC-ec1 follows an inert surface model with relatively weak interaction efficiency, but it achieves an overall stability comparable to GpA by virtue of its large dimerization interface. The dimer state buries a remarkable 2400 Å<sup>2</sup> of protein surface area that would otherwise be interacting with lipids.

Since n will be relatively large for ClC-ec1 then it is predicted that membrane dependent driving forces, such as hydrophobic mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen, 2007</xref>) and changes in lipid entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagüe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katira et al., 2016</xref>) could play a larger role in ClC dimerization compared to smaller, single TM-helix dimerization models.</p><p>The tryptophan mutagenesis acts as a starting point for quantifying the physical forces associated with protein assembly in membranes. Since the dimerization interface is highly complementary in shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>), addition of a single tryptophan is expected to act as a steric wedge and disrupt many of the VDW interactions between the protein side-chains. However, this ~2 kcal/mole destabilization likely overestimates the VDW contribution since tryptophans will also stabilize the monomeric state by interacting with lipids at this surface. Therefore, this amounts to a relatively small change in dimer stability, indicating that we either maintain many of the VDW contacts in the dimer complex, or that protein-protein VDW interactions are not the major driving force for dimerization. Further investigation of tryptophans as a function of number and position, as well as other residue substitutions, will surely inform on the underlying relationship. In any case, identifying the driving forces that govern ClC-ec1 dimerization will require further experiments that quantify enthalpic and entropic changes while varying protein and lipid dependent variables. Fortunately, the structural integrity and stability of the individual subunits makes investigation of the protein and membrane at different temperatures possible.</p><p>The method of single-molecule counting of subunit capture into liposomes addresses many of the challenges previously encountered when studying membrane protein association. Membrane proteins are prone to non-equilibrium aggregation when reconstituted at high densities. Thus, the single-molecule approach enables us to explore low densities where the two-state reaction is expected to dominate. This technique is particularly well suited for studying high-affinity membrane protein complexes that may only show dissociation behavior at sub-biological densities. Our lowest experimental density corresponds to 1 subunit per 50 <italic>E. coli</italic> inner membranes, assuming a 4 µm<sup>2</sup> surface area consisting of ~10<sup>7</sup> lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prats and de Pedro, 1989</xref>). Note that the lower limit of the biological mole fraction for <italic>E. Coli</italic> is <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 2 × 10<sup>–7</sup> subunit/lipid, assuming 2 subunits are expressed in the cell. Based on the dimerization isotherm in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, at this mole fraction, 90% of subunits will be found in the dimer form. This means that any reasonable level of expression (10–100 copies per cell) will drive the reaction into a density range where the protein will exist as associated dimers, with negligible probability of observing the dissociated monomeric state. An additional benefit of the photobleaching approach is that it provides checks on the fidelity of reconstitution, as aberrant behavior such as aggregation would skew the photobleaching distribution toward exceptionally large occupancies. Furthermore, we expect that this method will be useful in the study of other membrane protein systems, even if the structure is unknown, as long as the protein can be purified, quantitatively labeled with fluorophores, and tested for proper function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stockbridge et al., 2013</xref>). By combining single molecule approaches with robust membrane protein systems like ClC-ec1, we expect that the measurement of membrane protein association reactions in membranes will no longer be considered a technical challenge, but instead lead to discoveries about fundamental physical driving forces within the lipid bilayer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ClC-ec1 constructs</title><p>All isoforms were inserted into a pASK vector containing a hexa-histidine tag at the C-terminus.

While these cysteines can be mutated to yield a ‘cys-less’ form of ClC-ec1 (C85A/C302A/C347S) that maintain transport function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguitragool and Miller, 2007</xref>), we found that the ‘cys-less’ substitution on I201W/I422W expresses but results in aggregated protein upon purification. Examining the structure, C85 is partially accessible to the aqueous solution while C302 and C347 are buried within the protein core. We tested whether substituting C85 with alanine alone would be sufficient to minimize background labeling for our fluorescent experiments. We made a construct C85A/H234C, which introduces an aqueous solvent exposed cysteine near the dimerization interface, for specific labeling by Cy5-maleimide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A cysteine accessibility assay was used to measure the reactivity of –SH groups present in ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ellman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Riddles et al., 1983</xref>). A 10 mM master stock of Ellman’s reagent (DNTB, 5,5’-Dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Sigma-Aldrich) was freshly prepared in reaction buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) then diluted to 5 mM with SEB. Reaction of the thiolate anion with DTNB produces 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate (TNB<sup>-</sup>) that ionizes to TNB<sup>2-</sup> and absorbs light at 412 nm. A<sub>412</sub> was monitored by UV-VIS spectroscopy (Nanodrop 2000c, Thermo-Fisher Scientific) for the protein at 10 μM (300 μL) for 5 min to establish a baseline. Following this, 20 μl of the Ellman’s reagent working stock was added ([protein] = 9.4 μM, [DNTB] = 313 μM), and the reaction monitored for ten minutes. To estimate the total number of cysteines in the protein, 40 μl of 2% SDS in SEB was added to denature the protein, exposing the buried cysteines C302 and C347 ([protein] = 8.3 μM, [DNTB] = 278 μM, 0.2% SDS), and the reaction was monitored for 45 min, until a steady saturation of A<sub>412 nm</sub> was reached. Absorbance at 412 nm was background subtracted by the absorbance at 750 nm to correct for baseline drift during the measurement. An extinction coefficient of 14,150 M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> was used to calculate [TNB<sup>2-</sup>]. Addition of Ellman’s reagent to C85A/H234C in 5 mM DM shows an instantaneous increase in A<sub>412nm</sub> signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) indicating rapid and specific conjugation with H234C. Addition of 0.2% SDS shows that the internal cysteines are reactive in the SDS denatured state. We calculated the molar ratio of TNB<sup>2-</sup> produced per ClC-ec1 subunit in DM, and found that there is little reactivity in C85A. All constructs on the C85A/H234C background shows a single reactive thiol in 5 mM DM and a total of three reactive thiols in 5 mM DM + 0.2% SDS, indicating that introduction of tryptophan substitutions do no affect the fold of C85A/H234C in DM micelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescent labeling of protein</title><p>Cy5-maleimide dye was obtained as lyophilized powder as either 1 mg (GE Healthcare) or 50 mg (Lumiprobe, Hannover, Germany), stored as 10 mM master stocks (50 μl each) in anhydrous DMSO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at -80°C. Single-use 5 μl working stocks of 10 mM strength were also prepared and stored at -80°C to avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles of the fluorophores. Both master and working stocks were stored in boxes in the presence of anhydrous CaSO<sub>4</sub> (Drierite, W A Hammond Drierite Co Ltd., Xenia, OH). The fluorophore conjugation reaction was carried out in SEB with 10 μM ClC-ec1 subunits and 50 μM Cy5-maleimide for 12–15 min at room temperature in dark. At the end of the reaction, 100-fold molar excess of cysteine was added to quench the maleimide reaction (from freshly prepared 100 mM stock in SEB, pH adjusted to ~7.5). The ‘free’ dye was separated from the labeled protein by binding the reaction mixture to a 250 μL cobalt affinity resin column equilibrated with 15 CV CoWB (no TCEP) in a Micro-Bio spin chromatography column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA), washed 15 CV with CoWB and then eluted with 400 mM imidazole in CoWB, manually collecting only the fluorescently labeled protein. To remove the interfering absorbance of imidazole at 280 nm, the labeled protein was added to a 3 mL Sephadex G50 size exclusion column (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated in CoWB (no TCEP).

AF488 was selected as it is spectrally removed from the protein labeling Cy5 channel, and it does not partition into membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>).

AF488 SDP ester was added to the lipid-CHAPS suspension at a final 0.3% mole fraction of total lipids, an amount that allows for visualization of all liposomes as measured by protein co-localization as a function of dye mole fraction. Roughly, the smallest liposomes in the population (r = 10 nm) are estimated to have five dyes assuming a labeling efficiency of 50%. The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 4 hr and then was stopped with 1.5 M Tris (pH 8.0). The lipids were stored at room temperature, in the dark, until fluorescently labeled protein was ready for reconstitution (1–3 hr), and then combined with the Cy5-labeled protein as described in the next section.

The lasers were focused onto the back focal aperture of a high numerical aperture 60X objective lens (Olympus TIRF 60X 1.49 NA, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) via a 3 mm diameter micro-mirror (MicroMirrorTIRF platform from Mad City Labs Inc., Madison WI). The illuminated area on the coverslip is ~2500 µm<sup>2</sup>. Emitted fluorescence was filtered and focused onto the CCD chip of iXon3 888 EM/CCD camera (Andor Technology Ltd., Belfast, Nothern Ireland).</p><p>Glass slides (Gold-seal, 24 × 60 mm no.1.5 thickness) and coverslips (Gold-seal, 25 × 25 mm no. 1.0 thickness) were prepared as follows: slides and cover slips were placed in slide mailers, 5 at a time, then sonicated in presence of 0.1% Micro-90 detergent (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) for 30 min. After sonication, slides and coverslips were rinsed with MilliQ water 10 times to remove all traces of detergent, and then sonicated in presence of absolute ethanol for 30 min followed by rinsing 10 times with MilliQ water. Finally, glass coverslips and slides were sonicated in 0.2 M KOH for 5 min to render the surface hydrophilic. After final rinsing with water the coverslips and slides were stored in MilliQ water in a clean air hood for a period of 7–10 days.</p><p>Proteoliposomes harvested after dialysis were freeze-thawed seven times by incubating the samples in a dry ice/ethanol bath for 15 min, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. At this step, the membranes fuse to form large multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) on the order of 10 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pozo Navas et al., 2005</xref>), i.e. 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> lipids per lamella. The samples were stored at room temperature with 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub> until imaging, 1–95 days post freeze/thaw (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> for specific time points of imaging). The formation of large membranes allows for the investigation of the protein state across a wide span of protein density ( = 7.5 × 10<sup>–10</sup> to 3.8 × 10<sup>–4</sup> subunits/lipid), with the lowest value representing roughly two subunits in a liposome lamella of ~300 µm<sup>2</sup> – i.e., close to infinite dilution. Prior to imaging, the membranes were extruded (LiposoFast-Basic; Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) 21 times through a 0.4 µm Nuclepore membrane to form liposomes for TIRF microscopy with a defined size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Between samples, the extruder apparatus was dismantled, flushed profusely with hot tap water, then sonicated in presence of dilute detergent (0.5% Dial dish soap) followed by sonication in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O water to maintain extremely low background. After washing, buffer was passed through the extruder and loaded onto the microscope to confirm that there was no contamination between samples. Liposomes were diluted in low-adhesion tubes and allowed to passively bind to glass slide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>). The density of fluorescent spots on the glass slide was maintained at 0.02 to 0.09 spots/µm<sup>2</sup> to minimize overloading (~50–200 spots per field). For experiments at low protein density, the slide was loaded with a high number of liposomes since the probability of protein occupied liposomes was rare. At higher mole fractions, liposomes were serially diluted before loading onto coverslips. Images were acquired at the rate of ~1 frame per second (fps), EM gain set to 300 and laser incident power typically set to 15 µW for AF488 imaging and 240 µW for Cy5 imaging in order to obtain long photo-bleaching traces while maintaining good signal to noise for single molecule spots. In each field, Cy5 imaging was carried out before AF488 imaging as we observed the 488 nm laser convert Cy5 to a dark state. After initial liposome-protein co-localization experiments to measure <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> and reconstitution efficiency, samples for protein photobleaching experiments were typically reconstituted with regular POPE/POPG mixture without any fluorescent label on the lipids. All imaging was carried out in RB-F buffer, filtered three times through a 0.22 µm filter (Millex-GS MCE, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Photobleaching analysis</title><p>Cy5 blinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ha and Tinnefeld, 2012</xref>) was avoided by imaging the proteoliposomes in the absence of oxygen scavengers. Depletion of oxygen results in longer dwell time in the triplet state which often leads to fluorescent blinking. Triplet-state quenchers, such as Trolox, are often added to the imaging solutions that contain oxygen scavengers to reduce blinking behavior. However, Trolox has been shown to alter lipid bilayer properties by partitioning into membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alejo et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, we found that avoiding oxygen scavengers altogether allowed us to observe long-lived photobleaching intensity traces of Cy5 without blinking behavior. In addition, the removal of the oxygen scavengers helps to reduce background contamination as we are working with non-passivated clean slides, and we have observed components of the glucose oxidase/catalase oxygen scavenger system demonstrate autofluorescence when bound to the slide. No filtering of images was necessary, as laser power was adjusted for optimal signal to noise while ensuring relatively long photobleaching traces. Photobleaching data was collected in both unlabeled and AF488-labeled liposomes, showing no significant difference in probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Image files were analyzed in a MATLAB-based CoSMoS analysis program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman and Gelles, 2015</xref>). Fluorescent spots were auto-detected based on intensity thresholds selecting 4 × 4 pixel areas of interest (AOIs) around the peak fluorescence. The AOIs were integrated over time; typically 300 frames were acquired at 1 frame per second (fps). Integrated intensity trajectories extracted from these AOIs were manually classified by counting the number of steps before complete photo-destruction of Cy5. To test for subjectivity of counting, 2–3 individuals analyzed the same data set in a blinded approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For probabilities calculated from an individual population, we report fraction ± standard deviation (SD), calculated as the binary uncertainty <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf67"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where p is the probability of a Cy5 spot bleaching in n steps and N is the total number of Cy5 spots in the sample, typically 200–500.

Therefore, the probability of observing a certain number of Cy5 fluorophores, <italic>N<sub>Cy5</sub></italic> = 1, 2, 3,... in a liposome is related to the Poisson distribution. However, under experimentally realistic conditions, the actual distribution will differ due to the following reasons: (1) extruded liposome sizes are heterogenous, (2) microscopy visualizes Cy5 and not the protein itself, so un-labeled subunits or subunits with bleached fluorophores are not counted, and (3) there are multiple labeling possibilities for monomers and dimers due to site-specific and non-specific labeling.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior editor and three reviewers, including Karen Fleming (Reviewer #3) and Olga Boudker (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months, so please let us know if you have any questions first.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript, Robertson et al. describe a method designed to measure association energy of ClC dimer. The method is based on exceptionally high dilution of the dimers in model membranes, partitioning of membranes into vesicles and protein counting in the vesicles using single molecule TIRF microscopy. Coupled with careful statistical considerations, the method allows for the determination of self-association isotherms and thus, free energies. This method can now be applied to better understand thermodynamics of protein:protein interactions in the bilayer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The protein-to-lipid molar ratio (χ) or protein density appears to represent their initial mixing ratio before reconstitution (dialysis). However, the multiple steps towards final extruded samples (i.e., dialysis, gel filtration, and freeze/thaw cycles) may lead to a significant deviation of the actual χ values from the initial numbers due to a loss of lipids and protein aggregation/denaturation in aqueous/lipid phases. The valid χ values for obtaining DG should be those after freeze/thaw cycles and before extrusion (i.e., the equilibration step). Therefore, the reliability of the χ values needs to be validated.</p><p>2) In the subsection “ClC-ec1 follows a monomer to dimer reaction as a function of protein density in the membrane” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and D</xref>: To verify the equilibration of the samples, the authors used W-Cy5, the result of which was very convincing. However, it is also possible that WT-Cy5 dimers may have a high kinetic barrier to dissociation (related reference: Jefferson, Blois and Bowie, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2013, 135, 15183-15190). It is desirable that the equilibration is confirmed for WT-Cy5 as well.</p><p>3) In the last paragraph of the Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The isotherm data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> look very good. Why did the authors not estimate the errors in ΔG? The free energy changes should be presented and discussed as a number with error bars. Stating that the free energy of dimerization is ~-11 kcal/mole diminishes the significance of the work and makes it impossible to know if the W mutants that are 2 kcal/mole destabilized is a significant difference or not. Even if the error bar is derived from the error of the fit (because each point has a counting error), this should still be information on the precision of the measurement. Because the investigators have a method of directly knowing the stoichiometry, they know the curve shape, and we think it is fine to only access only a part of the isotherm (as in the WW data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and still derive some kind of uncertainty on the measurement. One type of analysis that could be implemented is a bootstrap with replacement method to clarify the error space?</p><p>4) One aspect that seems worth additional discussion is conversion of equilibrium constants expressed in terms of subunit/lipid density χ into standard Gibbs free energy of interaction.

Is this not the state where monomers and dimers are imaged and counted? This needs to be better explained. Also, if all ClC proteins will be dimers in <italic>E. coli</italic> as stated in the Discussion, it is an apparent contradiction to find monomers in vesicles with such favorable dimerization energy. An alternative explanation is that the kinetics of monomer/dimer rearrangement in the small vesicles is so slow as to be frozen. And if that is the case, why is that and will that be true for other lipids?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17438.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The protein-to-lipid molar ratio (χ) or protein density appears to represent their initial mixing ratio before reconstitution (dialysis).

Therefore, the reliability of the χ values needs to be validated.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We measured the subunit/lipid mole fraction for samples (old and newly prepared) after freeze/thaw and extrusion and have included these results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. We measured the mole fraction as 0.50 ± 0.02 of the mole fraction set during reconstitution, independent of protein density or construct. We have adjusted all of the results in relation to the observed mole fraction measured by this analysis. A section has been added to the Methods (” Protein/lipid quantification”) describing our method of protein quantification (comparing absolute fluorescence of denatured protein to a standard curve), and lipid quantification by measurement of phosphate.</p><p><italic>2) In the subsection “ClC-ec1 follows a monomer to dimer reaction as a function of protein density in the membrane” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and D</xref>: To verify the equilibration of the samples, the authors used W-Cy5, the result of which was very convincing.

It is desirable that the equilibration is confirmed for WT-Cy5 as well.</italic> </p><p>The data for the WT-Cy5 dilution experiment is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. As was observed for W-Cy5, 10X and 100X dilutions of WT shows a complete shift to their reconstituted distribution 1 day after freeze/thaw. We also carried out a 1000X dilution that is expected to significantly shift the WT population towards the monomeric state. While the diluted distribution showed a shift towards monomer, it was significantly different from the dialysis samples reconstituted at the same mole fraction density. We measured the time course of the 1000X WT dilution over the course of 25 days showing that this sample converges to the probability distribution of samples reconstituted at χ = 3.8 x 10<sup>-9</sup> subunit/lipid, with a mid point of 13 days. This indicates that the reconstituted WT samples do reflect the protein population at equilibrium in the membrane, and that WT has high kinetic stability compared to W, as the reviewers indicated.</p><p><italic>3) In the last paragraph of the Results section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: The isotherm data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> look very good.

These represent best-fit values ± standard error of the fits from direct fitting of each parameter, as well as the 95% confidence intervals, obtained from non-linear weighted regression implemented in MATLAB. We have also added a column where the mole fraction scale has been converted to an area density scale, for easy comparison with literature. We have also elaborated on these values in the last paragraph in the Results section.</p><p><italic>4) One aspect that seems worth additional discussion is conversion of equilibrium constants expressed in terms of subunit/lipid density χ into standard Gibbs free energy of interaction. It would be helpful if the authors provided a brief discussion on the subject and included relevant references.</italic> </p><p>A section has been added to the methods titled “Determining the dimerization equilibrium constant and standard state free energy from the experimental photobleaching data”. In this section, we describe the describe the derivation of the dimerization isotherm for determination of the equilibrium constant, choice of mole fraction vs. area density reaction scales and calculation of the standard state free energy with the conventional standard states.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>: To verify the functional integrity of labeled and mutated samples, the functional assay result for WT-Cy5 should be presented.</italic> </p><p>This data is now reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.

Is this not the state where monomers and dimers are imaged and counted? This needs to be better explained.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. This is a key point of the paper and so we would like this to be clear to the readers. We have modified the text throughout the paper to clarify this, including the following paragraph at the beginning of the Results section:</p><p>“With single-molecule resolution, we can count the number of subunits captured into each liposome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and determine the photobleaching probability distribution of fluorescent protein occupancy in liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). […] Therefore, the liposome extrusion step captures the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the prior MLV membrane state, and ignores any changes in protein density or lipid composition that might arise during the extrusion process.”</p><p><italic>Also, if all ClC proteins will be dimers in E. coli as stated in the Discussion, it is an apparent contradiction to find monomers in vesicles with such favorable dimerization energy.</italic> </p><p>The following paragraph in the Discussion has been modified for clarification:</p><p>“Our lowest experimental density corresponds to 1 subunit per 50 <italic>E. coli</italic> inner membranes, assuming a 4 µm<sup>2</sup> surface area consisting of ~10<sup>7</sup> lipids (Prats &amp; de Pedro 1989). […] This means that any reasonable level of expression (10-100 copies per cell) will drive the reaction into a range where the protein will exist mainly as dimers, with negligible probability of observing the dissociated monomeric state.”</p><p><italic>An alternative explanation is that the kinetics of monomer/dimer rearrangement in the small vesicles is so slow as to be frozen. And if that is the case, why is that and will that be true for other lipids?</italic> </p><p>Since our method does not report on the actual state of the protein in the small, extruded vesicles – only the number of fluorescently labeled subunits captured into these vesicles – we cannot comment on the kinetics of subunits in the liposomes. This would be something that would require a different approach, such as dynamic FRET, and does not pertain to our measurements of the protein in a large bilayer at equilibrium. In addition, we will not comment on the impact of other lipid compositions as this is something that must be measured directly and is outside the scope of the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
