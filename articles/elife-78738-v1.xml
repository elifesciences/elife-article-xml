Here, we reveal that nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) controls naïve and effector Treg cell states. Upon NCOR1 deletion in T cells, effector Treg cell frequencies were elevated in mice and in in vitro-generated human Treg cells. NCOR1-deficient Treg cells failed to protect mice from severe weight loss and intestinal inflammation associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis, indicating impaired suppressive function. NCOR1 controls the transcriptional integrity of Treg cells, since effector gene signatures were already upregulated in naïve NCOR1-deficient Treg cells while effector NCOR1-deficient Treg cells failed to repress genes associated with naïve Treg cells. Moreover, genes related to cholesterol homeostasis including targets of liver X receptor (LXR) were dysregulated in NCOR1-deficient Treg cells. However, genetic ablation of LXRβ in T cells did not revert the effects of NCOR1 deficiency, indicating that NCOR1 controls naïve and effector Treg cell subset composition independent from its ability to repress LXRβ-induced gene expression. Thus, our study reveals that NCOR1 maintains naïve and effector Treg cell states via regulating their transcriptional integrity. We also reveal a critical role for this epigenetic regulator in supporting the suppressive functions of Treg cells in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T lymphocyte

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Treg cells expressing the transcription factor Forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) play a crucial role in mediating immune tolerance to self-antigens, regulating the interaction between the host and its commensal flora, and promoting tissue repair. Deficiency or aberrant function of Treg cells triggers autoimmunity and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakaguchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sumida et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, the development of these cells, as well as their effector functions, must be tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Josefowicz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Zheng, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitagawa and Sakaguchi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Savage et al., 2020</xref>). The transcription factor FOXP3 is required for the generation, maintenance, and suppressive function of Treg cells, and loss of FOXP3 leads to fatal systemic autoimmunity in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hori et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khattri et al., 2003</xref>). Upon stimulation, naïve Treg cells (also known as resting Treg cells) undergo differentiation into effector Treg cells (also known as activated Treg cells) thereby acquiring distinct phenotypes and effector molecules expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cretney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Contreras-Castillo et al., 2024</xref>). Effector Treg cells exhibit enhanced suppressive function compared to naïve Treg cells and maintain immune tolerance and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liston and Gray, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buszko and Shevach, 2020</xref>). The conversion of naïve Treg cells into effector Treg cells is accompanied by metabolic reprogramming including relatively higher engagement of aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation. This cellular change is necessary to support the function of effector Treg cells and to supply the biosynthetic material needed for their proliferation and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi and Chi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carbone et al., 2024</xref>). However, the transcriptional pathways involved in effector Treg cell generation remain poorly understood.</p><p>The nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCOR1) is a transcriptional regulator that bridges chromatin-modifying enzymes and transcription factors. NCOR1 mediates transcriptional repression of nuclear receptors (NRs) such as thyroid hormone (TR), retinoic acid receptors (RAR), and liver X receptor (LXR) in the absence of their ligands, via its interaction with members of the HDAC family, in particular, HDAC3. NCOR1 is part of larger multi-subunit complexes and also interacts with several other transcription factors unrelated to NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hörlein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). We and others have recently identified NCOR1 as an important regulator of T cell development, as T cell-specific deletion of NCOR1 resulted in impaired survival of positively selected NCOR1-null TCRβ<sup>hi</sup>CD69<sup>+/−</sup> thymocytes. Furthermore, NCOR1 deficiency also leads to reduced numbers of peripheral T cells including Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, it was shown that NCOR1 represses the pro-apoptotic factor BIM in double-positive thymocytes post-signaling, thereby affecting thymocyte survival during positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These data indicate that NCOR1 is essential for positive and negative selection during T cell development, as well as for the generation of the peripheral T cell pool. Additionally, NCOR1 was shown to regulate the transcriptional programs and effector functions of activated Th1 and Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hainberger et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether NCOR1 controls the function of immunosuppressive Treg cells has yet to be investigated.</p><p>Here, we employed conditional gene targeting approaches to study the role of NCOR1 in Treg cells. NCOR1 was deleted either in all peripheral T cells using <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice crossed with <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice (<italic>Ncor</italic>1<sup>f/f</sup><italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre, designated as NCOR1-cKO) or selectively in Treg cells using <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice crossed with <italic>Foxp3</italic>-YFP-Cre mice (<italic>Ncor</italic>1<sup>f/f</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic>-YFP-Cre; designated as NCOR1-cKO<sup>Foxp3</sup>). Using these mouse models, we analyzed Treg cell generation, Treg cell transcriptomes, and Treg cell function in vitro as well as in adoptive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis. Moreover, we assessed whether NCOR1 is essential for human Treg cell differentiation in vitro using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout approaches. Finally, since a pathway analysis indicated alterations in LXR/RXR activation pathways, we generated T cell-specific NCOR1 and LXRβ double-deficient mice to address whether NCOR1 requires LXRβ to repress effector Treg cell differentiation. Using these experimental strategies, we identified NCOR1 as a key regulatory molecule in mice and humans that controls the ratio of naïve to effector Treg cells by ensuring transcriptional integrity of Treg cell states, revealed that NCOR1 restrains effector Treg cell generation independently of LXRβ, and uncovered a positive role for NCOR1 in controlling the suppressive function of Treg cells in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased frequencies of effector Treg cells in NCOR1-cKO mice</title><p>To investigate whether NCOR1 activity is important for FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell subset differentiation and function, we characterized Treg cells in <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice crossed with <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice (NCOR1-cKO).

Moreover, we detected higher percentages of ICOS-expressing Treg cells in NCOR1-cKO mice, and NCOR1-deficient Treg cells expressed elevated levels of GITR in LN and mLN. There was no significant difference in the expression of CTLA4 between WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). However, the total numbers of naïve and effector Treg cells were reduced in NCOR1-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This is due to the overall reduction in Treg cell numbers, caused by the drop in total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as the relative reduction of Treg cells within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in NCOR1-cKO mice, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hainberger et al., 2020</xref>). We also tested whether alterations in the proliferation and/or survival of NCOR1-cKO Treg cells contribute to the relative reduction in the frequency of Treg cells within the peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population. The percentage of Treg cells expressing Ki67, a marker associated with cell proliferation, as well as the expression levels of Ki67 (gMFI) in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, was similar between splenic WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>).

Therefore, we defined an ‘effector Treg gene set’ based on our RNA-seq data that contained the top 100 genes upregulated (based on FC differences, FDR ≤0.05) in effector WT Treg cells compared to naïve WT Treg cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref> for the list of genes). GSEA with this pre-defined gene list revealed enrichment of the ‘effector Treg gene set’ in naïve NCOR1-cKO Treg cells compared to naïve WT Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This indicates that <italic>Ncor1</italic> deletion leads to an upregulation of an effector gene signature in naïve NCOR1-cKO Treg cells. Moreover, GSEA also revealed an enrichment of a ‘naïve Treg gene set’ (i.e. the top 100 genes upregulated in WT naïve Treg cells compared to WT effector Treg cells) in effector NCOR1-cKO Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Taken together, our RNA-seq analysis indicates that naïve CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> Treg cells lacking NCOR1 inherently display an effector Treg signature and vice-versa. Thus, NCOR1 is essential for establishing and/or maintaining transcriptional programs that define and potentially regulate naïve and effector Treg cell states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>NCOR1 regulates naïve and effector Treg cell states in a LXRß-independent manner</title><p>The nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) acts as a cholesterol sensor and is a crucial regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao and Dahlman-Wright, 2010</xref>). Two isoforms of LXR, namely LXRα (encoded by the <italic>Nr1h3</italic> gene) and LXRβ (encoded by <italic>Nr1h2</italic>) are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shinar et al., 1994</xref>).

In the absence of LXR ligands, NCOR1 interacts with LXR and inhibits the expression of LXR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mottis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Upon LXR ligand binding, NCOR1 dissociates from LXR leading to its activation and the expression of LXR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2003</xref>). Due to the observed upregulation of hallmark gene sets ‘Cholesterol homeostasis’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) and LXR/RXR activation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>) in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells, we investigated whether a disrupted LXRβ-NCOR1 interaction in Treg cells results in enhanced effector Treg differentiation using two experimental strategies based on pharmacological and genetic approaches. First, to test whether LXR activation contributed to the relative increase in effector Treg cell subsets, we differentiated naïve WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into in vitro induced Treg cells (iTreg cells) in the presence of the LXR agonist GW3965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2002</xref>). GW3965 treatment did not alter the percentage of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells, however, resulted in a small but significant increase in the fraction of CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). GW3965 treatment mildly affected cell viability and proliferation at low concentrations (up to 4 µM), but showed more severe effects at a higher concentration (8 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Next, to dissect a potential functional interaction between NCOR1 and LXRβ in the induction of effector Treg cells in vivo, we employed a genetic approach and intercrossed NCOR1-cKO mice with LXRβ-cKO (<italic>Nr1h2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>) to generate NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO double-deficient mice. To obtain a sufficiently high number of mice for the analysis, we established independent breeding colonies for NCOR1-cKO, LXRβ-cKO as well as for NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO mice and used the corresponding <italic>Cre</italic>-negative littermates as WT controls (i.e. <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, designated as WT<sup>Ncor1</sup>; <italic>Nr1h2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, as WT<sup>Lxrb</sup>; and <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>,<italic>Nr1h2</italic><sup>f/f</sup> as WT<sup>Ncor1/Lxrb</sup>, respectively). In agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>), we observed a strong reduction in the frequencies of splenic T cells in the absence of LXRβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). Within the TCRβ<sup>+</sup> population, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were slightly reduced, while the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Of note, NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO mice also exhibited a severe reduction of T cell numbers and slightly lower frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as observed in LXRβ-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2a, b and c</xref>). Interestingly, the Treg cell frequency within the LXRβ-cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in the spleen was higher compared to WT littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>), in contrast to NCOR1-cKO mice where a twofold relative decrease was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>). NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO mice also exhibited a higher representation of Treg cells amongst the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>), suggesting that deletion of LXRβ is sufficient to rescue the low Treg cell frequency phenotype seen in NCOR1-cKO mice. Within the LXRβ-cKO Treg cell population, there was a tendency of a mild increase in CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector cell frequencies (p=0.058), while CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> naïve Treg cells were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and d</xref>). This suggests that LXRβ deletion (using CD4-<italic>Cre)</italic> had only a small effect on the ratio of naïve to effector Treg cells. In contrast, splenocytes from NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO mice displayed a strong increase in the frequency of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector Treg cells along with a severe decrease in naïve Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and d</xref>), similar to NCOR1-cKO mice. This indicates that loss of LXRβ did not revert alterations in the ratio of naïve to effector Treg cells induced by NCOR1 deletion. On the contrary, within the Treg cell population of some splenocytes from NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO mice more than 50% of effector Treg cells were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and d</xref>), a frequency not reached in NCOR1-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7d</xref>).

In contrast, LXRß restrains Treg cell differentiation, since deletion of LXRß results in increased Treg cell frequencies among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Deletion of LXRß on top of NCOR1 deletion reverts the NCOR1-cKO Treg differentiation phenotype, indicating that NCOR1 controls Treg differentiation in an LXRß-dependent manner. NCOR1 might directly suppress LXRβ or counteracts LXRβ-controlled pathways, which are enhanced in the absence of NCOR1. Furthermore, the deletion of NCOR1 alters the ratio of naïve to effector Treg cells and leads to a blurring of the transcriptional separation of naïve and effector Treg cell lineages. In addition, NCOR1 might control Treg cell function. The deletion of LXRβ in the T cell lineage did not recapitulate the increase in CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector Treg cells in the spleen as observed in NCOR1-cKO mice. The combined deletion of NCOR1 and LXRβ resulted in a strong increase in LXRβ-NCOR1 effector Treg cells and a corresponding severe reduction in naïve Treg cells, similar to the phenotype observed in NCOR1-cKO mice. This strongly suggests that NCOR1 controls the ratio of naïve to effector Treg cells in a LXRß-independent manner.

NCOR1 also has been shown to cooperate with MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>). We observed an induction of Myc target genes (V1 and V2 gene sets) in the absence of NCOR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) and our RNA-seq data revealed that <italic>Myc</italic> expression was upregulated both in naïve and in effector NCOR1-cKO Treg cells in comparison to the corresponding WT subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Therefore, in the next step, we investigated whether MYC protein expression levels were affected by the absence of NCOR1, LXRβ, or both. Intracellular staining revealed no difference in MYC protein levels between WT<sup>Ncor1</sup> and NCOR1-cKO naïve Treg cells and slightly lower MYC levels in effector Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3a</xref>), contrasting with the observed upregulation of <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA levels and MYC target genes. MYC protein expression was significantly increased in naïve CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> LXRβ-cKO and NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in comparison to the respective WT<sup>Lxrb</sup> and WT<sup>Ncor1/Lxrb</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3a</xref>), suggesting that loss of LXRβ has a dominant effect on MYC levels in this Treg cell subset. However, elevated MYC protein levels in LXRß-deficient Treg cells were not sufficient to induce an increase in effector Treg cells. This suggests that NCOR1 might restrain MYC activity, which in turn might contribute to the observed increase in effector Treg cells upon NCOR1 deletion. Of note, while LXRβ-cKO mice also displayed higher MYC protein levels in effector Treg cells relative to their WT counterparts, this was reverted in NCOR1-LXRβ-cDKO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3a</xref>). We also assessed how CRISPR-Cas9 mediated-knockout of NCOR1 affected MYC expression levels in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells cultured in Treg cell-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Deletion of NCOR1 led to an increase in the fraction of human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing high levels of MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3b and c</xref>).

We, and others, have previously reported that loss of NCOR1 in T cells using <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre results in developmental alterations during positive/negative selection, as well as in reduced survival of single-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2017</xref>). The Treg-specific deletion of <italic>Ncor1</italic> using the <italic>Foxp3</italic>-Cre deleter strain resulted in an increase in effector Treg cells as observed in mice with a pan T cell-specific deletion using <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre. However, in contrast to <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2017</xref>), there was no overall decrease in the percentage of the FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cell population in NCOR1-cKO<sup>Foxp3</sup> mice compared to WT<sup>Foxp3</sup> mice at steady state. This suggests that Treg cell survival is not dependent on NCOR1 once Treg cell lineage differentiation has been initiated. These data, therefore, rule out the possibility that changes in the frequencies of naïve and effector subsets within the Treg cell population are due to positive/negative selection defects or due to the reduced survival of single-positive cells in NCOR1-cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, our data indicate that NCOR1 controls the establishment of Treg cell subset homeostasis once <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression, and thus Treg cell lineage differentiation, has been induced.</p><p>Effector Treg cell subsets have a higher suppressive activity and are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liston and Gray, 2014</xref>). Therefore, one might have expected that the increase in effector Treg cells results in an enhanced suppressive function of the NCOR1-deficient Treg cell population. Interestingly, there was no difference in the suppressive activity between WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells in vitro. In addition, in an adoptive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis model, co-transferred NCOR1-cKO Treg cells even failed to protect recipient mice from weight loss and intestinal tissue damage in comparison to co-transferred WT Treg cells. We observed an overall decrease of NCOR1-deficient Treg cells in recipient mice, although the extent of the reduction varied among various lymphoid tissues. This might indicate either that NCOR1 is part of a regulatory network that integrates lymphoid tissue-specific signals for tissue-specific Treg cell maintenance, or that NCOR1 controls the ability of Treg cells to home to different tissues, at least in an adoptive transfer setting. We detected a strong decrease in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells in mLNs after transfer. Since it has been shown that Treg cells home to mLNs early after transfer and proliferate there until colon inflammation is resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mottet et al., 2003</xref>), one might speculate that the failure of NCOR1-cKO Treg cells to prevent colitis is caused by the reduction in Treg numbers in gut-draining LNs. However, intestinal NCOR1-cKO Treg cell numbers were not altered within the SI-IEL population and SI-LP cells, suggesting that the disease was aggravated (at least in part) due to an impaired suppressive function of Treg cells in the absence of NCOR1. Further evidence that effector Treg cells might not be fully functional comes from our RNA-Seq analysis. Our GSEA data indicated an upregulation of an ‘effector Treg gene set’ in naïve Treg cells, thus potentially a ‘priming’ of naïve NCOR1-deficient Treg cells towards the acquisition of an effector phenotype. However, a ‘naive Treg gene set’ was enriched in NCOR1-deficient effector Treg cells. Thus, NCOR1-cKO Treg cells that upregulated CD44 (CD44<sup>hi</sup>) and downregulated CD62L (CD62L<sup>–</sup>), and hence are classified as effector Treg cells, still have transcriptional features of naïve Treg cells in comparison to WT effector Treg cells. Consequently, NCOR1-cKO CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> Treg cells might not represent fully functional effector Treg cells. This suggests that NCOR1 is essential in establishing naïve and effector Treg cell states.</p><p>Another important finding of our study is that NCOR1 controls naïve and effector Treg states in a LXRβ-independent manner. LXRβ is a key transcription factor of the nuclear receptor family regulating the expression of genes required for cholesterol and lipid metabolism. In the absence of activating ligands, LXRβ target genes are repressed due to the interaction of LXRβ with NCOR1 and NCOR1-associated repressor complexes that contain chromatin-modifying molecules such as HDAC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao and Dahlman-Wright, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mottis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>). LXRβ regulates T cell proliferation and function and is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bensinger et al., 2008</xref>). The observed upregulation of several pathways associated with cholesterol biosynthesis in NCOR1-deficient Treg cells pointed to an activation of LXRβ-mediated transcriptional circuits and hence to the induction of (some) LXRβ target genes. This might be linked to the enhanced effector Treg differentiation, substantiated by the observation that LXR agonist GW3965 treatment of WT iTreg cells phenocopied the increased expression of CD44 as observed in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells and in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with an NCOR1 knockout. However, our genetic data demonstrated that deletion of LXRβ in the T cell lineage did not recapitulate the increase in CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector Treg cells in the spleen observed in NCOR1-cKO mice. The combined deletion of NCOR1 and LXRβ resulted in a strong increase in LXRβ-NCOR1 effector Treg cells and a corresponding severe reduction in naïve Treg cells, similar to the phenotype observed in NCOR1-cKO mice. This strongly suggests that NCOR1 controls the relative composition of naïve and effector Treg cell subsets in a LXRß-independent manner. On the other hand, some LXRβ-NCOR1 mice displayed more than 50% of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector cells among the Treg cell population, which was not observed in NCOR1-cKO mice. This suggests that LXRβ might have a minor role in these processes, at least in the absence of NCOR1. Of note, and as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>), LXRβ deficiency resulted in a relative increase in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells among the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population, while FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineage was reduced in the absence of NCOR1. LXRβ deletion on top of NCOR1 deletion reverted the relative decrease in Treg cells, which suggests that NCOR1 controls the generation of Treg cells in an LXRβ-dependent manner. NCOR1 suppresses LXRβ or counteracts LXRβ-induced pathways, which itself restrains the generation of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells. Loss of NCOR1 potentially enhances LXRβ activity or LXRβ-induced pathways, thereby reducing Treg cell frequency. In contrast, deletion of LXRβ (in the presence or absence of NCOR1) abolishes the restraining activity of LXRβ-induced pathways, resulting in increased frequencies of Treg cells among the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our RNA-seq also revealed an upregulation of MYC target genes in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells which correlated with increased <italic>Myc</italic> gene expression, and we even observed an upregulation of MYC protein expression by flow cytometry in LXRβ and NCOR1/LXRβ-deficient T cells. MYC is an essential driver for the differentiation of naive Treg cells into effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saravia et al., 2020</xref>). However, elevated MYC protein levels in LXRß-deficient Treg cells were not sufficient to induce an increase in effector Treg cells. This suggests that NCOR1 might restrain MYC activity and that a dysregulated MYC activity might be one of the contributing factors leading to a relative increase in effector Treg cells in the absence of NCOR1.</p><p>It must be acknowledged that our study has some limitations. Further investigations are needed to understand to which extent NCOR1 controls effector Treg differentiation in an LXRβ-independent and LXRβ-dependent manner. It has also been reported that LXRβ-deficient Treg cells, in a bone marrow chimeric setting, exhibit decreased expression of CD44 and increased expression of CD62L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>). However, this decrease in effector Treg cells (based on CD44 and CD62L expression) might be an indirect effect, since LXRβ also controls fitness and functionality of activated Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>). Additional studies are warranted to determine how NCOR1 and LXRβ containing complexes control Treg homeostasis, naive to effector Treg cell ratios as well as effector Treg differentiation and function. These might include experiments to determine NCOR1 and LXRβ target binding sites in order to elucidate which target genes are (co-)regulated by NCOR1 and LXRβ during FOPX3<sup>+</sup> Treg cell differentiation, and whether T cell activation disrupts NCOR1 and LXRβ interaction. Moreover, it has not been addressed whether NCOR1 modulates the activity of other nuclear receptors and transcription factors in Treg cells or how this might contribute to naïve and effector Treg cell states. In addition, NCOR1 controls Th1 and Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hainberger et al., 2020</xref>), however, it remains to be determined whether NCOR1 is essential for maintaining T cell function in general or whether Th cell subset specific functions exist.</p><p>In summary, here we report that NCOR1 is a key member of the transcriptional network that controls FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell subset differentiation and function. NCOR1 antagonizes LXRß-induced pathways that restrain the generation of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, while NCOR1 controls the relative abundance of naïve and effector Treg cell subset independently of LXRß. Moreover, NCOR1 is essential for the proper suppressive function of Treg cells. We propose that NCOR1 is essential for maintaining naïve and effector Treg cell states by ensuring the integrity of naïve and effector transcriptional programs in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells, as well as linking their proper differentiation with their functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models</title><p>Animal experiments were evaluated by the ethics committees of the Medical University of Vienna and approved by the Austrian Federal Ministry for Education, Science and Research (GZ:BMBWF-66.009/0039 V/3b/2019, GZ:BMBWF-66.009/0326 V/3b/2019).

Based on the previous reports, NCOR1-deficiency might affect cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, phenotype, and function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including Tregs. The authors should examine possible effects of NCOR1-deficiency on Tregs. For example, in vitro Treg suppression assay, their in vitro proliferation/cell death after CD3/CD28 stimulation, Treg marker gene expression, their cytokine expression, and their possible effects on interacting APCs, should be examined with NCOR1-deficient Tregs. In particular, since TCR stimulation is a key factor for driving T cells from naive to effector, TCR-mediated changes including signaling pathways, phenotypical changes, cell proliferation, and transcriptional regulations, should be addressed with NCOR1-deficient Tregs.</p><p>2) The authors claim that the LXR-NCOR1 axis regulates effector Treg differentiation. Can Foxp3+ T cells be generated under the NCOR1-deficient condition? In the colitis model (Figure 6), NCOR1-deficient Tregs did not show Treg suppressive function, and also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including Tregs were dramatically reduced under NCOR1-deficiency (Figure 1). The results suggest that NCOR1 can be concerned with maintaining T cell function, rather than Treg conversion from naive to effector, and that NCOR1-deficiency does not exhibit a specific effect on Tregs.</p><p>3) To claim the role of the LXR-NCOR1 axis in effector Treg differentiation, the authors need to address the following issues. Does LXR deletion cancel the effects? Does LXR and NCOR1 directly bind to the promoter/enhancer of MYC? Does T cell activation break the interaction of LXR and NCOR1? Does the phenotype of NCOR1 loss show a correlation with the phenotype of Treg activation? How about LXR loss?</p><p>4) Tfr cells are presented as one example of effector Treg cells. However, there is evidence that Tfr cells themselves can be found as immature (the ones in circulation are notably immature), and at different stages of maturation (the most mature Tfr cells lose CD25 expression). The different impact of IL-2 on the maturation of effector Treg cells and Tfr cells (the differentiation is suppressed by IL-2) also makes this issue less clear. This possibility regarding Tfr cells needs to be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

Based on the expression of CD44 and CD62L, the authors claim that NCOR1 deficiency enhances a conversion from naive to effector in Tregs. The development of functionally mature effector Treg cells should not be simply defined by the expression of two markers. Does NCOR1-deficiency induce effector-type epigenetic status, cytokine secretion, cell growth, cell morphology, and especially Treg suppressive function?</p><p>3. The authors claim that the LXR-NCOR1 axis regulates effector Treg differentiation. Can Foxp3+ T cells be generated under the NCOR1-deficient condition? In the colitis model (Figure 6), NCOR1-deficient Tregs did not show Treg suppressive function, and also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including Tregs were dramatically reduced under NCOR1-deficiency (Figure 1).

Although the authors claim that LXR-NCOR1 axis regulates effector Treg differentiation, the results presented here are insufficient for their claim. To claim the role of the LXR-NCOR1 axis in Treg differentiation, the authors need to address the following issues. Does LXR deletion cancel the effects? Does LXR and NCOR1 directly bind to the promoter/enhancer of MYC? Does T cell activation break the interaction of LXR and NCOR1? Does the phenotype of NCOR1 loss show a correlation with the phenotype of Treg activation? How about LXR loss?</p><p>5. Furthermore, NCOR1 has been shown to interact with a variety of nuclear receptors. Have the authors checked transcriptional control by other nuclear receptors that can bind to NCOR1 in NCOR1-deficient Tregs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes a well-designed set of experiments that are very conclusive in supporting the authors' conclusions. In particular, the major findings are convincingly demonstrated by the experimental results. There are, however, two issues that still require the authors' attention.</p><p>1. Tfr cells are presented as one example of eTreg cells. However, there is evidence that Tfr cells themselves can be found as immature (the ones in circulation are notably immature), and at different stages of maturation (the most mature Tfr cells lose CD25 expression). The impact different impact of IL-2 on the maturation of eTreg cells and Tfr cells (the differentiation is suppressed by IL-2) also makes this issue less clear. It is likely that the authors' assessment takes into consideration the mature tissue CD25+ Tfr cells. However, this issue should be discussed with greater attention to the different maturation states of Tfr cells.</p><p>2. The evidence supporting the role of NCOR1 in maintaining the suppressive function of Treg cells is not as strong as the evidence supporting other claims. This claim is a particular concern as one anticipated that eTreg cells would have a greater suppressive function than non-effector Treg cells. The fact that NCOR1 deficiency in Treg cells prevented their ability to protect mice from colitis may be due to other reasons beyond the suppressive function alone. A direct assessment of the suppressive function of NCOR1-deficient Treg cells under in vitro assays could provide conclusive evidence regarding this claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78738.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) While this manuscript provides various results from animal studies, it lacks basic information about NCOR1-deficiency in Tregs.

We previously showed that NCOR1 is essential for positive selection as well as for setting up the transcriptional landscape in Th1 and Th17 cells. It was not our intention to convey the view that NCOR1 specifically regulates the Treg cell lineage only. However, our data clearly demonstrate that NCOR1 also has an essential function in the Treg cell lineage, which in part is different to its function in other Th lineages. We have addressed this comment by including this point in the Discussion section (page 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To claim the role of the LXR-NCOR1 axis in effector Treg differentiation, the authors need to address the following issues. Does LXR deletion cancel the effects? Does LXR and NCOR1 directly bind to the promoter/enhancer of MYC? Does T cell activation break the interaction of LXR and NCOR1? Does the phenotype of NCOR1 loss show a correlation with the phenotype of Treg activation? How about LXR loss?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to investigate the link between LXRb and NCOR1 in more detail. We also are thankful for this comment, since the experiments in response to this comment provided a better and more detailed insight whether the phenotype observed in NCOR1-cKO Tregs is linked with LXRß. For the revised manuscript we decided to use a genetic approach and generated LXRb single and NCOR1/LXRb double knockout mouse mice. It took us some time and efforts to generate this data, since we had to import LXRb knockout animals into our animal facility via embryo transfer followed by intercrossing with NCOR1-cKO mice. We describe our results in detail on page 11 of this reply letter and we inserted a new sub-chapter (page 13) as well as a new main figure 7 (and a new Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 3a) in our revised manuscript. The generation of the new mouse lines resulted in three novel findings:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Loss of LXRb did not revert alterations in naïve to effector Treg cell frequencies induced by NCOR1 deletion. Based on these data we propose that NCOR1 controls naïve and effector Treg cell state and subset composition in an LXRb-independent manner.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intracellular MYC staining revealed that MYC protein level were significantly elevated in naïve LXRb-cKO and NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells compared to WT Treg cells. In contrast, NCOR1-cKO Treg cells (after including additional samples in the analysis) did not show an upregulation of MYC protein despite an upregulation of MYC target genes. However, elevated MYC protein levels in LXRß-deficient Treg cells were not sufficient to induce an increase in effector Treg cells. This suggest that NCOR1 might restrain MYC activity, which might contribute to the observed increase in effector Treg cells upon NCOR1 deletion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The generation of DKO mice also provided novel insight into the generation of Treg cells. The Treg cell frequency within the LXRb-cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in the spleen was higher compared to WT littermate controls (as also previously reported in PMID: 33373442), while FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineage were reduced in the absence of NCOR1. Since LXRb deletion on top of NCOR1 deletion reverted the relative decrease in Treg cells, this suggests that NCOR1 controls the generation of Treg cells in an LXRb-dependent manner.</p></list-item></list><p>We therefore propose a model that NCOR1 suppresses LXRb or counteracts LXRb-induced pathways, which itself restrains the generation of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells. However, NCOR1 maintains naïve and effector cell states independently of LXRß. This model is shown as graphical abstract and as Figure 7—figure supplement 4. See also page 19 (Discussion section) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The following data have been added to address the essential revisions described in comment #13: T cell phenotype of LXRb-cKO and LXRb/NCOR1-double KO mice: Figure 7; Figure 7—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 3a.</p><p>We also agree with the Editor (and with Reviewer #1) that it would be very interesting to identify NCOR1 and/or LXRb binding sites at a genome-wide level (also in the absence of either one or the other) and to study whether the interaction between NCOR1 and LXRb is disrupted upon T cell activation. We first focused on assessing the impact of LXRb deletion on top of NCOR1-deficiency using genetic (i.e. gene targeting) approaches. This uncovered that NCOR1-regulates naïve and effector Treg cell states and subset composition in an LXRb-independent manner. Therefore, we did not follow-up a potential interaction between NCOR1 and LXRß. In addition, we also did not have established protocols in the lab to perform LXRb ChIP assays in WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to determine LXRb binding sites. Moreover, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is severely reduced in NCOR1-cKO and in LXRb-cKO mice, this also would make it technically challenging to identify NCOR1 or LXRb binding sites in the absence of either one or the other. We are very sorry that we therefore were not able to address the issue concerning binding of NCOR1 and LXRb to target sites. This was the only comment that we didn’t address in the revised manuscript. In order to acknowledge the importance of such a dataset, we introduced a short “limitation of our study” paragraph in our discussion where this issue is mentioned (page 20). We hope that the Editor and the Reviewers nevertheless appreciate our efforts in comprehensively revising our manuscript, including the generation of LXRb single and NCOR1/LXRb double knockout mice which provided novel insight into the potential interplay of these two factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Tfr cells are presented as one example of effector Treg cells.

Does NCOR1-deficiency induce effector-type epigenetic status, cytokine secretion, cell growth, cell morphology, and especially Treg suppressive function?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments raised by this Reviewer #1 and the suggestion for additional experiments. These are all important questions and we also agree with the comment that additional Treg cell features (besides CD44 and CD62L expression) should be included in the characterization. For the revised manuscript we added an in-depth characterization of NCOR1-deficient Treg cells. We performed many additional experiments and provide new data on the following topics:</p><p>Cytokine expression: We investigated whether NCOR1 controls the expression of the cytokine TGFb. Ex vivo PMA/ionomycin stimulation of isolated Treg cells revealed an increase in TGFb expression in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells compared to WT Treg cells. These data have been added in the revised manuscript on page 10 and as Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and 1b.</p><p>Suppressive function: We performed in vitro suppression assays and tested the proliferation (assessed by Cell trace violet dye) of WT responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by dendritic cells (DC) in the presence of increasing amount of WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells. There was no difference in the suppressive activity of splenic NCOR1-deficient FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells compared to WT Treg cells. In the revised manuscript, this is described on page 10 and added as Figure 4—figure supplement 1c and 1d.</p><p>Effects on interacting APCs: Treg cells can control the co-stimulatory function of DCs by modulating CD80/CD86 expression, as nicely shown e.g. in PMID:18635688. In this publication, the authors used DO11.10 TCR transgenic Treg cells and co-cultured DC and Treg cells in the presence of OVA. Since we didn’t have NCOR1-cKO mice on a TCR tg background, we tried to adapt the assay and used anti-CD3-stimulation (instead of OVA) and compared the impact of WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells on co-cultured DCs in vitro<italic>.</italic> There was no difference in the expression of CD80, CD86 and MHCII on CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs co-cultured with WT or NCOR1-cKO Treg cells after 24h. In fact, the presence of WT Treg cells had no impact on CD80, CD86 and MHCII expression on DCs, indicating that the assay didn’t work with anti-CD3 stimulation. We therefore decided to focus our revision experiments on the other experiments described in this point-to-point reply.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>a</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of CD4 and CD11c expression in co-cultures of splenic dendritic cells (DCs) with either WT of NCOR1-cKO Treg cells after 24 hours.</title><p>DC and Treg cells were cocultured in the presence of anti-CD3.

The percentage of Treg cells expressing Ki67, a marker associated with cell proliferation, as well as the expression levels of Ki67 (gMFI) in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells was similar between ex vivo analyzed splenic WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells (shown in the revised manuscript on page 5 and in Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and 2b). Similarly, there was also no difference in cell viability between ex vivo analyzed WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells (timepoint 0h; Figure 1—figure supplement 2c). These data suggest that Treg cell proliferation and survival at steady state are not controlled by</p><p>NCOR1.</p><p>Treg cell marker gene expression: We hope that we understood the comment concerning Treg cell marker gene expression in the way meant by Reviewer #1. A comprehensive ex vivo analysis of marker expression (KLRG1, CD69, CD25, ICOS and GITR) on Treg cells was already included in the initially submitted manuscript. However, for the revised version, we included CTLA-4 expression data. Although there was a slight tendency that CTLA-4 expression (MFI) is reduced in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells isolated from the spleen and LNs compared to their WT counterparts, the difference did not reach statistical significance. The data were added as a panel in Figure 1—figure supplement 1c and 1d and are mentioned in the text on page 5.</p><p>In case Reviewer #1 suggested that we should determine marker mRNA expression (instead of protein expression by flow cytometry) in Treg cells, we re-analyzed our RNA-seq data of naïve and effector WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells and made a graph showing the expression of the abovementioned marker genes. <italic>Ctla4</italic>, <italic>Il2ra</italic> and <italic>Tnfrsf18</italic> were down-regulated in splenic naïve NCOR1cKO Treg cells, while there was no difference in <italic>Klrg1</italic>, <italic>Cd69</italic>, <italic>Icos</italic>, <italic>Cd44</italic> and <italic>Sell</italic>. In splenic effector Treg cells, there was no difference in the expression levels of these genes. Therefore, differences observed with respect to Treg cell marker expression as show in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 were rather due to changes in the percentages of naïve and effect Treg cell subsets and not due to gene expression differences in the respective subsets. We didn’t add the gene expression data in the revised manuscript, since we already have included many additional figure panels. However, we display them in the point-to-point reply as a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>.

We assessed the expression of phospho-ERK <sup>T202/Y204</sup>, phospho-AKT<sup>S473</sup> and phospho-S6<sup>S240/244</sup> in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 after 10 minutes, 2 hours and 24 hours. Despite a trend for higher levels of phospho-ERK<sup>T202/Y204</sup>, phospho-AKT<sup>S473</sup> and phospho-S6<sup>S240/244</sup> in NCOR1-cKO Treg cells at several early time points, we only observed a significant difference for phospho-AKT<sup>S473</sup> at the 2 hours timepoint, which might indicate altered mTORC2 activation <sup>29, 30</sup>. Overall, these data suggest that NCOR1-cKO Treg cells might display a slightly higher transient degree of activation after TCR triggering. These data are briefly discussed in the revised manuscript on page 7 and have been added as Figure 1—figure supplement 2h.</p><p>Treg cell viability: In response to the comments of Reviewer #1, we also assessed Treg cell viability upon activation. For this, we isolated WT and NCOR1-cKO splenocytes and cultured them in the presence of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 over a time period of 72 hours. While there was no significant difference in the viability between WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells after 0, 4 or 24 hours of activation, we observed a significant decrease in the percentage of viable NCOR1-cKO Treg cells after 72 hours. In the revised manuscript we added this data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2c and mention the data on page 7.</p><p>FoxP3 stability: It was shown that iTreg cells downregulate FOXP3 expression upon restimulation with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in the absence of TGFb (PMID: 17298177). To test whether NCOR1 is important for the maintenance of FOXP3 expression, we first generated WT and NCOR1-cKO iTreg cells and restimulated the cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 4 days. Although we observed a decrease in the percentage of FOXP3-expressing cells during the 4-day restimulation culture period, there was no difference in the percentage of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells between WT and NCOR1-cKO Treg cells, indicating that NCOR1 function is dispensable for the physiological maintenance of FOXP3 expression in iTreg cells. These data have been added as Figure 2c and briefly mentioned on page 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors claim that the LXR-NCOR1 axis regulates effector Treg differentiation. Can Foxp3+ T cells be generated under the NCOR1-deficient condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that we correctly understood the point raised. FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells can be generated in the absence of NCOR1, both in vivo as well as in vitro from naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, although at reduced frequencies. For the revised manuscript, we analyzed Treg cell differentiation in the thymus in more detail. Thymic Treg cells develop from CD4SP CD25<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells which start to express FOXP3 (PMIDs: 18199417, 18199418) although FOXP3 can also be induced in CD4SP cells before CD25 expression (PMID: 23746651). Both CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>–</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> subsets were reduced within the NCOR1-cKO CD4SP population in comparison to the corresponding WT CD4SP population. However, the fraction of thymic CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> NCOR1-cKO Treg cells was increased (both within the CD25<sup>–</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup> subsets). These data indicate that the relative reduction of Treg cells within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population as well as the change in the relative abundance of naïve and effector Treg cells in NCOR1-cKO mice is (in part) already established during Treg cellgeneration in the thymus. We have added these data in a new Figure 1—figure supplement 2e, 2f and 2g and describe the data on page 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the colitis model (Figure 6), NCOR1-deficient Tregs did not show Treg suppressive function, and also CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells including Tregs were dramatically reduced under NCOR1-deficiency (Figure 1). The results suggest that NCOR1 can be concerned with maintaining T cell function, rather than Treg conversion from naive to effector, and that NCOR1-deficiency does not exhibit a specific effect on Tregs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that NCOR1 function is not restricted to Treg cells. We previously showed that NCOR1 is essential for setting up the transcriptional landscape in Th1 and Th17 cells. It was not our intention to convey the view that NCOR1 specifically regulates the Treg cell lineage only. We added a few sentences in the Discussion section to provide a more balanced view about this topic (page 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Although the authors claim that LXR-NCOR1 axis regulates effector Treg differentiation, the results presented here are insufficient for their claim. To claim the role of the LXR-NCOR1 axis in Treg differentiation, the authors need to address the following issues. Does LXR deletion cancel the effects? Does LXR and NCOR1 directly bind to the promoter/enhancer of MYC? Does T cell activation break the interaction of LXR and NCOR1? Does the phenotype of NCOR1 loss show a correlation with the phenotype of Treg activation? How about LXR loss?</p></disp-quote><p>We also are thankful for this comment, since the experiments in response to this comment provided a better and more detailed insight whether the phenotype observed in NCOR1-cKO Tregs is linked with LXRß. We generated LXRb single- and NCOR1/LXRb double-knockout mice to address (some) of these questions. It took us some to time to generate this data, since we had to import LXRb knockout animals into our animal facility (via embryo transfer). To obtain a sufficiently high number of mice for the analysis, we established independent breeding colonies for NCOR1cKO, LXRb-cKO as well as for NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO mice and used the corresponding <italic>Cre</italic>-negative littermates as WT controls (i.e. <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, designated as WT<sup>Ncor1</sup>; <italic>Nr1h2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, as WT<sup>Lxrb</sup>; and <italic>Ncor1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>,<italic>Nr1h2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, as WT<sup>Ncor1/Lxrb</sup>, respectively). In agreement with a previous study, we observed a strong reduction in the frequencies of splenic T cells in the absence of LXRb (Figure 7—figure supplement 2a and 2b). Within the TCRb<sup>+</sup> population, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were slightly reduced, while the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not altered (Figure 7—figure supplement 2b and 2c). Of note, NCOR1LXRb-cDKO mice also showed a severe reduction of T cell numbers and slightly lower frequencies of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as observed in LXRb-cKO mice (Figure 7—figure supplement 2a, 2b and 2c). Interestingly, the Treg cell frequency within the LXRb-cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in the spleen was higher compared to WT littermate controls (Figure 7a and 7b), in contrast to NCOR1-cKO mice where a 2-fold relative decrease was observed (Figure 7a and 7b). NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO mice also showed a higher representation of Treg cells amongst the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population (Figure 7a and 7b), suggesting that loss of LXRb is sufficient to rescue the low Treg cell frequency phenotype seen in NCOR1 cKO mice. Within the LXRb-cKO Treg cell population, there was a tendency of a mild increase in CD44<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector cell frequencies (P=0.058), while CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> naïve Treg cells were not changed (Figure 7c and 7d). This suggests that LXRb deletion using CD4-<italic>Cre</italic> only had a small effect on naïve and effector Treg cell composition. In contrast, splenocytes from NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO mice displayed a strong increase in the frequency of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>–</sup> effector Treg cells along with a severe decrease in naïve Treg cells (Figure 7c and 7d), similar to NCOR1-cKO mice. This indicates that loss of LXRb did not revert alterations in naïve to effector Treg cell frequencies induced by NCOR1 deletion. Within the Treg cell population of some splenocytes from NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO mice more than 50% of effector Treg cells were detected (Figure 7c and 7d), a frequency not reached in NCOR1cKO mice (Figure 1b and 7d). This might suggest a minor contribution of LXRb in the generation of effector Treg cells, at least in the absence of NCOR1.</p><p>We also investigated whether MYC protein expression levels were affected by the absence of NCOR1, LXRb or both. After including additional samples, intracellular staining revealed no difference in MYC protein levels between WT<sup>Ncor1</sup> and NCOR1-cKO naïve Treg cells and slightly lower MYC levels in effector Treg cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 3a), contrasting with the observed upregulation of <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA levels and MYC target genes. MYC protein expression was significantly increased in naïve CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD62L<sup>+</sup> LXRb-cKO and NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells in comparison to the respective WT<sup>Lxrb</sup> and WT<sup>Ncor1/Lxrb</sup> controls (Figure 7—figure supplement 3a), suggesting that loss of LXRb has a dominant effect on MYC levels in this Treg cell subset. However, elevated MYC protein levels in LXRß-deficient Treg cells were not sufficient to induce an increase in effector Treg cells. This suggest that NCOR1 might restrain MYC activity, which might contribute to the observed increase in effector Treg cells upon NCOR1 deletion. Of note, while LXRb-cKO mice also displayed higher MYC protein levels in effector Treg cells relative to their WT counterparts, this was reverted in NCOR1-LXRb-cDKO animals. Taken together, these data indicate that:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>NCOR1 controls naïve and effector Treg cell states and the relative distribution of Treg cell subsets in an LXRb-independent manner.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moreover, our data suggest that NCOR1 restrains MYC activity, which might contribute to the observed increase in effector Treg cells upon NCOR1 deletion.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The generation of DKO mice also provided novel insight into the generation of Treg cells. The Treg cell frequency within the LXRb-cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in the spleen was higher compared to WT littermate controls (as also previously reported in PMID: 33373442), while FOXP3<sup>+</sup> T cells within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineage were reduced in the absence of NCOR1. Since LXRb deletion on top of NCOR1 deletion reverted the relative decrease in Treg cells, this suggests that NCOR1 controls the generation of Treg cells in an LXRb-dependent manner.</p></list-item></list><p>All data have been included in a new Figure 7, in a new Figure 7—figure supplement 2 and new Figure 7—figure supplement 3a panel and are described in the revised manuscript from page 13 on. We also included a model of how NCOR1 regulated Treg cell differentiation and naïve and effector Treg cell states (Figure 7—figure supplement 4).</p><p>We also agree with Reviewer #1 that it would be very interesting to identify NCOR1 and/or LXRb binding sites at a genome-wide level (also in the absence of either one or the other) and to study whether the interaction between NCOR1 and LXRb is disrupted upon T cell activation. Our new data revealed that NCOR1-regulates naïve and effector Treg cell states and subset composition in an LXRb-independent manner. Therefore, we did not follow-up a potential interaction between NCOR1 and LXRß. Furthermore, we didn’t have established protocols in the lab to perform LXRb ChIP assays in WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to determine LXRb binding sites. Moreover, the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is severely reduced in NCOR1-cKO and in LXRb-cKO mice, thus making this technically challenging to identify NCOR1 or LXRb binding sites in the absence of either one or the other. We are very sorry that we therefore were not able to address the issue concerning binding of NCOR1-LXRb to target sites. This was the only comment that we didn’t address in the revised manuscript. In order to acknowledge the importance of such a dataset, we introduced a short “limitation of our study” paragraph in our discussion where this issue is mentioned (page 20). We hope that Reviewer #1 nevertheless appreciates our efforts in addressing the role of the interaction between NCOR1 and LXRb by generating LXRb single- and LXRb/NCOR1 double-knockout mice. This resulted in novel insights into the potential interplay of these two factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We therefore re-analyzed the expression of other NCOR1-interacting nuclear receptors in NCOR1-deficient Treg cells compared to WT Treg cells. We detected dysregulated expression of some, but not all nuclear receptors in the absence of NCOR1, including LDLR, PPARg, VDR, REV-ERBa, THRa, and RARa. This data might indicate that other nuclear receptors might be affected by NCOR1 in Treg cells. Since the handling Editor decided that it wasn’t part of the essential revisions, we didn’t follow up whether they display altered transcriptional control. However, we included a sentence in the discussion (page 20) to mention that the activity of other nuclear receptors might be affected by loss of NCOR1.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Summary showing the expression levels (values showing as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; FPKM) of the indicated genes in naïve and effector WT and NCOR1cKO Treg cells as determined by RNA-seq.</title><p>Each symbol represents one sample (2 mice per sample, 3 independent sample preparations steps).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78738-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript describes a well-designed set of experiments that are very conclusive in supporting the authors' conclusions.

Tfr cells are presented as one example of eTreg cells. However, there is evidence that Tfr cells themselves can be found as immature (the ones in circulation are notably immature), and at different stages of maturation (the most mature Tfr cells lose CD25 expression). The impact different impact of IL-2 on the maturation of eTreg cells and Tfr cells (the differentiation is suppressed by IL-2) also makes this issue less clear. It is likely that the authors' assessment takes into consideration the mature tissue CD25+ Tfr cells. However, this issue should be discussed with greater attention to the different maturation states of Tfr cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great comment referring to the study by Wing et al. (PMID:28698369). We therefore reanalyzed our Tfr data and assessed CD25 expression (CD25 was included in our Ab panel). This revealed that the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup> cells within the Tfr population (defined as CD44<sup>hi</sup>PD1<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) is reduced in NCOR1-cKO mice compared to WT counterparts. Thus, loss of NCOR1 results in an increase in the fraction of the most mature CD25<sup>–</sup> Tfr cells. This supports our finding that NCOR1 controls naive to effector Treg cell conversion. We have included this data in the revised manuscript on page 6/7 and show them as Figure 1h and 1i.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The evidence supporting the role of NCOR1 in maintaining the suppressive function of Treg cells is not as strong as the evidence supporting other claims. This claim is a particular concern as one anticipated that eTreg cells would have a greater suppressive function than non-effector Treg cells. The fact that NCOR1 deficiency in Treg cells prevented their ability to protect mice from colitis may be due to other reasons beyond the suppressive function alone. A direct assessment of the suppressive function of NCOR1-deficient Treg cells under in vitro assays could provide conclusive evidence regarding this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer #2 that it is important to determine the in vitro suppressive activity of NCOR1-deficient Treg cells.
