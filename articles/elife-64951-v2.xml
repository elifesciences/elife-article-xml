The cell cycle can also act as a transcriptional filter to control the expression of long gene transcripts, which are partially transcribed in short cycles. Using mathematical simulations of cell proliferation, we identify an emergent property that this filter can act as a tuning knob to control gene transcript expression, cell diversity, and the number and proportion of different cell types in a tissue. Our predictions are supported by comparison to single-cell RNA-seq data captured over embryonic development. Additionally, evolutionary genome analysis shows that fast-developing organisms have a narrow genomic distribution of gene lengths while slower developers have an expanded number of long genes. Our results support the idea that cell cycle dynamics may be important across multicellular animals for controlling gene transcript expression and cell fate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eukaryotes</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd><kwd>cell cycle duration</kwd><kwd>transcriptional filter</kwd><kwd>fate decisions</kwd><kwd>early development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010785</institution-id><institution>Canada First Research Excellence Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>Gary D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>Gary D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mathematical model predicts that cell cycle duration acts as a transcriptional filter and directly affects cell diversity in early eukaryotic development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental question in biology is how a single eukaryotic cell (e.g., zygote, stem cell) produces the complexity required to develop into an organism. A single cell will divide and generate many progeny, diversifying in a controlled and timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2015</xref>) to generate cells with very different functions than the parent, all with the same genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilmut et al., 1997</xref>). Many regulatory mechanisms coordinate this process, but much remains to be discovered about how it works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zoller et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we explore how cell cycle regulation can control gene transcript expression timing and cell fate during tissue development.</p><p>The canonical view of the cell cycle is a timely stepwise process. Typically, the complete cell cycle is divided into four phases: first gap phase (G1), synthesis phase (S), second gap phase (G2), and mitotic phase (M). The length of each phase determines how much time a cell allocates for processes associated with growth and division. However, the amount of time that is spent in each phase frequently differs from one cell type to another within the same organism. For example, some cells experience fast cell cycles, especially in early embryogenesis. Organisms such as the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) and the worm (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) exhibit cell cycle durations as short as 8–10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foe, 1989</xref>). Cell cycle duration also changes over development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For example, it increases in mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) brain development from an average of 8 hr at embryonic day 11 (E11) to an average of 18 hr by E17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Furutachi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takahashi et al., 1995a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell cycle duration changes during mouse development.</title><p>The data was curated from several publications (PubMed identifiers: 5859018, 14105210, 5760443, 5542640, 4041905, 7666188, 12151540, 18164540), shown in the legend as authors and (year).

In particular, if the cell cycle progresses relatively fast, transcription of long genes will be interrupted. In typical cells, the gene transcription rate is between 1.4 and 3.6 kb per minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</xref>). Thus, an 8 min cell cycle would only allow transcription of the shortest genes, on the order of 10 kb measured by genomic length, including introns and exons, whereas a 10 hr cell cycle would allow transcription of genes as long as a megabase on the genome.</p><p>Cell cycle-dependent transcriptional filtering has been proposed to be important in cell fate control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryant and Gardiner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Swinburne and Silver, 2008</xref>). Most multicellular eukaryotic animals start embryogenesis with short cell cycle durations and a limited transcription state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Farrell et al., 2004</xref>) with typically short zygotic transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>). These cells allocate the majority of their cycle time to S-phase (synthesis), where transcription is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>), and M-phase (division), with little to no time for transcription in the gap phases. However, as the cell cycle slows down, time available for transcription increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newport and Kirschner, 1982b</xref>), enabling longer genes to be transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djabrayan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shermoen and O'Farrell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We asked what effects cell cycle-dependent transcriptional filtering may have over early multicellular organism development. Through extensive mathematical simulations of developmental cell lineages, we identify the novel and unexpected finding that a cell cycle-dependent transcriptional filter can directly influence the generation of cell diversity and can provide fine-grained control of cell numbers and cell-type ratios in a developing tissue. Our computational model operates at single-cell resolution, enabling comparison to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data captured over development, supporting our model by showing similar trends. Our model also predicts genomic gene length distribution and gene transcript expression patterns that are consistent with a range of independent data. Our work provides new insight into how cell cycle parameters may be important regulators of cell-type diversity over development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Computational model of multicellular development</title><p>We model multicellular development starting from a single totipotent cell that gives rise to many progeny, each with its own transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We developed a single-cell resolution agent-based computational model to simulate this process (see Materials and methods). Each cell behaves according to a set of rules, and cells are influenced solely by intrinsic factors (e.g., number of genes in the genome, gene length, transcript levels, and transcription rate). We intentionally start with a simple set of rules, adding more rules as needed to test specific mechanisms. Our analysis is limited to pre-mRNA transcript expression, and we do not consider other gene expression-related factors, such as splicing, translation, or gene-gene interactions.

We conducted simulations for a single-cell division step for simplicity, but these were repeated thousands of times to model cell population effects. We compute cell diversity in two ways; first, as the number of distinct transcriptomes in the cell population (transcriptome diversity); and second, as the number of distinct transcriptomic clusters, as defined using standard single-cell transcriptomic analysis techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satija et al., 2015</xref>) (see Materials and methods). Both measures model real cell types and states that are distinguished by their transcriptomes, with transcriptome diversity as an upper bound on cell-type number, and cluster number approximating a lower bound. We first ran simulations with an active transcriptional filter by varying only the cell cycle duration, Γ, for a genome with 10 genes, with genes ranging in size from 1 to 10 kb, such that it satisfies <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Interestingly, cell cluster diversity peaks at intermediate cell cycle duration parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, brown line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) because new genes are introduced with increasing cell cycle lengths, but eventually long cell cycles provide sufficient time for cells to make all transcripts, which leads to reduced variance between the progeny.

Cell cycle duration changes dramatically during development, generally starting out fast to generate cells quickly and slowing down over time as the organism matures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farrell and O'Farrell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Farrell et al., 2004</xref>). Clearly, cells with short cell cycles generate more progeny compared to those with longer cell cycles. However, we propose that a tradeoff exists, balancing the generation of diversity (longer cell cycle durations) with the fast generation of cells (shorter cell cycle durations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To study this tradeoff, we simulated cell propagation under a ‘mixed lineage’ scenario where, after the first division, one child cell and its progeny maintains a constant cell cycle duration (Γ<sub>1</sub> = 1 hr) and the second child cell and its progeny maintains an equal or longer constant cell cycle duration over a lineage with 20 cell division events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, gray and blue lineages, respectively). We initialize the starting cell with no prior transcripts (naïve theoretical state) and a genome containing five genes ranging from length 1 to 2 kb (gene<sup>1</sup>, gene<sup>1.25</sup>, gene<sup>1.5</sup>, gene<sup>1.75</sup>, gene<sup>2</sup>), setting cell cycle duration in the second lineage to range between 1 and 2, controlling the transcriptional filter threshold in this lineage only. We considered three scenarios: (1) both cell lineages cycle at the same rate (Fast-Fast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>); (2) the first (blue) lineage is slower than the second (gray) (Slow-Fast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); and (3) both slow and fast lineages divide asymmetrically, producing one slow and one fast cell (Slow-Fast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cell cycle duration can control the generation of cell proportions and cell types within a population.</title><p>Simulations start with two cells and run for 18 divisions (generating 2<sup>19</sup> cells when cell cycles are the same). Cell<sub>1</sub> is initialized with cell cycle duration Γ<sub>1</sub> = 1 hr, Cell<sub>2</sub> has cell cycle duration, Γ<sub>2</sub>, ranging from 1 to 2 hr. All progeny are tracked based on their cell cycle duration (lineage Γ<sub>1</sub> = 1 cell cycle duration, gray, or lineage Γ<sub>2</sub> cell cycle duration, blue).

Scenario 2 captures a situation when the cell cycle is determined by the parental lineage, while scenario 3 captures a situation when a cell splits asymmetrically into a fast and slow cell, resulting with the fast lineage having just one cell. (<bold>D–F</bold>) Müller visualizations show that when the cell cycle duration is the same, both cells contribute the same number of progeny and cell proportions (%) are 50:50 (bottom left panel). The visualization is stacked, down-scaling the blue lineage slightly to reduce occlusion of the gray lineage. Cells with longer cell cycle duration (blue lineage) generate fewer progeny with respect to the cells with a short cell cycle duration of 1 hr (gray lineage). However, the slower cells contribute more to the diversity observed in the population, shown as the blue and gray transcriptome diversity bars. Thus, increasing cell cycle duration increases cell diversity, but also limits the number of progeny generated. The system can overcome the limit on cell number by using scenario 3, where more slow cells can be generated (other parameters G = 5, gene lengths (gene<sup>L</sup><sub>1</sub><sup>-L</sup><sub>2</sub>), genome = {1,1.25,1.5,1.75,2} and ploidy = 1, RNA polymerase II re-initiation, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.25</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64951-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the simulation where both cell lineages cycle at the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), both lineages generate the same number of progeny with the same level of diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). When cell cycle duration for the second (blue) lineage is increased across simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), the transcriptional filter acts to generate more diverse progeny, but with fewer cell numbers and progressively smaller population proportions due to the slower cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, blue bars). Meanwhile, the short cell cycle lineage maintains a steady, low level of diversity generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, gray bars). When a fast cell can divide asymmetrically, generating one slow and one fast cell at each division, the number of slow cells in the population can increase; however, this comes with a reduction of the number of fast cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

In our analysis of the mouse cortex scRNA-seq data, we find that genes with increasing transcript expression across the time course (E11.5 &lt; E13.5 &lt; E15.5 &lt; E17.5) are associated with neural developmental (maturing cell) pathways, whereas the genes with decreasing transcript expression across time (E11.5 &gt; E13.5 &gt; E15.5 &gt; E17.5) are associated with transcription and proliferation (stem and progenitor cell) pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Cell cycle duration measurements are not widely available, which makes directly testing this hypothesis difficult. Instead, we explored related questions. We started by asking if organisms with longer genes would also take longer to develop. We analyze gene length distributions for 12 genomes spanning budding yeast to human with a diverse range of developmental durations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbert and Barresi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jukam et al., 2017</xref>). Non-mammalian species that we analyze are relatively fast developing, ranging from approximately 2 hr (e.g., <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) to a few days (e.g., <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>D. rerio</italic>), while mammals (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>, <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, and <italic>Home sapiens</italic>) are relatively slow developing (20, 114, 168, and 280 days, respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These species also have different gene length distributions; to illustrate this quantitatively, using a typical transcription rate of 1.5 kb/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardehali and Lis, 2009</xref>), a cell cycle duration of 1 hr can exclude up to 20% total genes found in relatively slow developers and not exclude any genes in fast developers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Early experiments using embryos suggested that cell cycle duration has a role in transcription initiation; however, these experiments lacked the temporal resolution necessary to dissociate the effects of cell cycle duration and transcriptional control from other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edgar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimelman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newport and Kirschner, 1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>). It is also well known that cell cycle length changes can control cell fate and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mummery et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singh et al., 2013</xref>); however, this has remained observational and not linked to a mechanism. To help address these limitations, we developed an in silico cell growth model to directly study the relationship between cell cycle duration and gene transcription in a developmental context. The new discovery we make is that a transcriptional filter can be controlled by cell cycle duration and used to simultaneously control the generation of cell diversity, the overall cell growth rate, and cellular proportions during development (defining an emergent property of our computational model – see Appendix 1). Genomic information (gene number and gene length distribution) and cell cycle duration are critical parameters in this model. Across evolutionary time scales, cell diversity can be achieved by altering gene length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keane and Seoighe, 2016</xref>); however, in terms of developmental time scales, we propose that cell cycle duration is an important factor that may control cell diversity and proportions within a tissue.</p><p>We predict that increasing the gene length distribution across a genome over evolution can provide more cell cycle-dependent transcriptional control in a developing system, leading to increased cellular diversity. Examining a range of genomes and associated data provides support for this novel idea. We observe that fast-developing organisms have shorter median gene lengths relative to the broad distributions, including many long genes, exhibited by slow developers (mammals). This aspect of genome structure may help explain the observed rates of cell diversity and organism complexity, as measured by number of different cell types, over a wide range of species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Valentine et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vogel and Chothia, 2006</xref>).</p><p>While we hypothesize that a cell cycle-dependent transcriptional filter is a fundamental regulatory mechanism operating during development (because gene length is fixed in the genome and transcription rate is expected to lie in a narrow range), multiple other regulatory mechanisms could modulate its effects. Furthermore, exploring these mechanisms may even result in similar conclusions as it can be evolutionary advantageous to have multiple paths to the same outcome; these include, but are not limited to, silencing or deactivating genes, gene regulatory networks, blocking gene clusters, for example, Hoxd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodríguez-Carballo et al., 2019</xref>) changing the transcription or re-initiation rate of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), or inheriting long transcripts maternally at the zygote stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our current model only explores the effects of transcription and re-initiation rates of RNA polymerase II, mRNA transcript degradation rates, and maternally introduced transcripts. For the latter mechanism, we expect longer transcripts to be major contributors during the early maternal phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jukam et al., 2017</xref>), which agrees with zebrafish (<italic>D. rerio</italic>) experiments showing that maternal transcripts are longer and have evolutionary conserved functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heyn et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, if we add maternal transcript inheritance to our model, we see the same pattern of a small number of long transcripts present early, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Future work would entail curating experimental data about more regulatory mechanisms in cell systems and testing their association with cell cycle duration.</p><p>Our analysis raises interesting directions for future work. We focus on development, but transcriptional filtering may be important in any process involving cell cycle dynamics, such as regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant and Gardiner, 2018</xref>), wound repair, immune activation, and cancer. We must also more carefully consider cell cycle phase as transcription mainly occurs in the gap phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newport and Kirschner, 1982b</xref>). Experiments indicate that a cell will have different fates depending on its phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vallier, 2015</xref>). This agrees with our model as a cell at the start of its cell cycle will have a different transcriptome in comparison to the end of the cell cycle. Induced pluripotent cell state is also associated with cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalton, 2015</xref>), and efficient reprogramming is only seen in cell subsets with fast cell cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Our model could explain these observations as slower cycling cells could express long genes that push a cell to differentiate rather than reprogram. However, our model is limited to total transcription duration for interphase (G1, S, and G2), thus a future direction would be to explore different durations for each cell cycle phase. Collecting more experimental data about cell phase in developing systems will help explore these effects. Further, it will be important to explore how cell cycle duration is controlled. Molecular mechanisms of cell cycle and cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) control could be added to our model to provide a more biochemically realistic perspective on this topic. Ultimately, a better appreciation of the effects of cell cycle dynamics will help improve our understanding of a cell’s decision-making process during differentiation and may prove useful for the advancement of tools to control development, regeneration, and cancer. Finally, it is important to note that we have not provided experimental model support, only analyses that do not disagree with model predictions.

mathematical model is agent and rule-based. A single cell behaves and interacts according to a fixed set of rules. Our major rule involves a gene length mechanism, where each cell is defined by a genome and a cell cycle duration. The cell cycle duration determines which gene transcripts are expressed within the cell, based on the transcription rate. All decisions are based on a cell’s autonomous information, and we omit external factors. We deliberately choose to consider this simple baseline setup to clarify the contribution of cell cycle duration to overall cell population growth.</p><p>Each cell is defined by a genome G (containing a set of genes), cell cycle duration in hours, and the transcripts inherited or recently transcribed. In the genome, each gene is defined by a length, gene<sup>Length</sup>. For example, in a genome with three genes, (gene<sup>1</sup>, gene<sup>2</sup>, gene<sup>3</sup>) represents genes of length 1, 2, and 3 kb, respectively.</p><p>Each cell can divide and make two progeny cells. This process can continue many times to simulate the growth of a cell population, and we keep track of the entire simulated cell lineage. For each cell division (one time step in the simulation): each Cell<sub>i</sub> will transcribe its genes based on the time available, defined by the cell cycle duration. We assume that the time it takes to transcribe a gene depends on its length and a fixed transcription rate; although a simplification, there are examples where this occurs, for instance, the human dystrophin gene is 2,241,765 bp long and takes about 16 hr to transcribe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tennyson et al., 1995</xref>). Once a cell cycle is finished, the cell divides. When cells are synchronized, the first cell division T = Γ<sub>i</sub>. When the cells are asynchronized, then the algorithm identifies the time allocated as the shortest cell cycle duration in the population as the time step and each cell division will have a different duration. In this case, we keep track of the exact duration such that cells with short cell cycles, for example, Γ = 1 hr, will register 10 divisions in 10 hr while cells with long cell cycles, for example, Γ = 10 hr, will register one division in over the same time. We limited the model to two modes of division, symmetric (where the cell gives rise to identical cells, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and asymmetric (where the cell gives rise to a fast and slow cell, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We do not consider mechanisms that reduce cell numbers (cell death). For certain experiments (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the cell cycle duration for each progeny is allowed to diverge from the parental duration using a monotonic function (increasing or decreasing) and a stochastic variable based on a Gaussian distribution with a mean equal to Γ<sub>i</sub> (parental cell cycle duration). This models a more realistic noisy distribution of cell cycle durations in the simulated cell population. The cell cycle and division rules are repeated for all cells in the population until a set number of cell divisions have been reached.</p><p>During a cycle, each cell contains a certain number of transcripts. The number of transcripts for each gene is calculated by a function of cell cycle duration, Γ, transcription rate, λ, re-initiation distance, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and gene length, L:<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The transcriptome data resemble a scRNA-seq matrix to aid comparison between simulation and experimental data. We allow cells without any transcripts, for example, (0,0,0) to exist – due to the low numbers of genes considered in our simplified model and results, and that parental transcripts are distributed between progeny, there is a probability of 2/(the total number of transcripts) that all the transcripts will end up in only one of the new cells, leaving the other one empty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Theoretically we have no reason to omit these cells, and they may represent the most naïve theoretical state of a cell without any prior information.

FindVariableFeatures was used with loess.span set to 0.3 unless the number of genes was less than 5, then (0.4, 0.7, and 1 were used for simulations with 4, 3, and 2 genes, respectively). Cells were clustered using a shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-based ‘Louvain’ algorithm implemented in Seurat with reduction set as ‘pca.’ The clustering resolution was set to 1 for all experiments, and all calculated PCs were used in the downstream clustering process using the Louvain algorithm accessed via Seurat.

Here, authors propose that a very simple model can produce results that qualitatively echo single-cell RNA seq data published by other labs. Overall, this study suggests that the slowing down of the cell cycle during development can act to allow longer genes to be transcribed and more cell types to be generated. Experimental test of this hypothesis are needed for future work.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Control of tissue development by cell cycle dependent transcriptional filtering&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Wenying Shou as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David M Suter (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although there was some support for your work, the amount of time required for revision will likely exceed two months. It is the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> that a manuscript requiring substantial revision should be rejected. We do invite you to resubmit if you feel that you have addressed reviewers comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Abou Chakra et al. posed the hypothesis that cell cycle transcriptional filtering – the transcribing of long genes only when cell cycle slows down – might help control tissue development and the generation of diverse cell fates. This study is based on simple math modeling and comparing model predictions to single-cell RNA seq data.</p><p>From an outsider's point of view, the article is interesting, although very speculative. Thus, I suggest softening your statements throughout. For example, the current title can be changed to &quot;Cell cycle dependent transcription filtering can potentially contribute to tissue development&quot;.</p><p>Scientifically, I would like to see an analysis of whether transcripts specific to development (e.g. neuronal development) tend to be longer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study addresses the important and exciting topic of how the cell cycle duration gates gene expression diversity at the single cell level by limiting the expression of long genes. This work intersects between genetics, gene expression, developmental and evolutionary biology, and should therefore be of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript is well written and structured, and the findings are interesting. I have some technical and conceptual concerns about the causality links made by the authors.</p><p>1. In general the authors should provide more details about the implementation of their method in the manuscript. While Figure 1 is very clear and allows non-specialists to grasp the concept, a more detailed explanation of the model would be useful.</p><p>In particular, how is transcription re-initiation modelled ? This is important for the following reason. If a gene takes 10 hours to be transcribed and the cell cycle is 10 hours, only 1 transcript can be made. However, if the cell cycle is longer, the maximum number of transcripts will depend on the distance between successive polymerases (thus depending on initiation rate), and could thus rapidly increase. The number of transcripts generated in 11 hours will thus scale with initiation rate, or inversely with the distance between polymerases on the gene. Also, how does transcriptional bursting affect their modelling ?</p><p>2. The authors show that short genes tend to be expressed at higher levels than long genes. They use this data to support that elongation rates * cell cycle duration limits the expression of long genes. In this scenario, one would expect that long genes are more depleted in pol II at the end of the gene, while short genes would not. The authors could look into Pol II footprinting/ChIP-seq datasets to confirm this, and also to exclude that short genes are expressed at higher levels because of their higher initiation rates.</p><p>3. The authors mention that cell cycle duration should be broadly correlated with development time. But cell sizes and organism size will also impact this correlation. Why do the authors not consider these parameters ?</p><p>4. The authors should provide an analysis of which classes of genes are enriched into different genes length bins. According to their results, more specialised genes, i.e. expressed in terminally differentiated, non-dividing cells should be longer on average.</p><p>5. Figure 6A: How can the average cell cycle duration become higher than the max cell cycle duration at the single cell level (shown as color code) ?</p><p>6. What is the relative contribution of introns vs exons in long vs short genes ? Could the longer cell cycle of some species allow to accumulate more/longer introns to increase splice isoform diversity/regulatory potential ?</p><p>7. Linked to 5., one challenge here is to understand causality links. The cell cycle could be used by organisms to gate cell diversity during development, but longer cell cycles could also allow to accumulate longer genes on evolutionary time scales. The authors should comment on this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>We've known for a very long time that cells in many animal embryos have very fast cell cycles, and that the duration of cell cycle increases as cells differentiate into progeny with specialized function. However, whether cell cycle duration directly impacts cell fate decisions via filtering transcriptional activity is not clear. Certainly it has been proposed on multiple occasions, and the ability of mitosis and DNA replication to interrupt and abort transcription has been demonstrated. This study presents an interesting attempt to address this topic via mathematically modeling the relationship of cell cycle length and the diversity of transcriptome. The authors utilized a simplified model to simulate how cell cycle length, gene length, number of genes and transcription rate affect resulting transcriptomes in cell populations. Not unexpectedly, the simulations show that increasing the length of the cell cycle can increase the proportion of mRNAs from long genes, and also the complexity of the transcriptome and (more interestingly) the diversity of transcriptomes between different cells in a population. The model is clever and the demonstration is useful, if highly over-simplified. Importantly the authors also analyze some real transcriptome data to see if it supports their conclusions. At some levels there is support, but overall the real data from single cell sequence don't align well with their hypothesis and fall short of a compelling experimental validation. Overall we felt the study was interesting in concept and could be a valuable addition to the literature devoted to cell cycle and development, but that it could be much better with comprehensive revisions as discussed below.</p><p>1. The simulations in Figure 2A show that increasing cell cycle duration will allow more relative transcription of longer genes. Unfortunately the real data from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and Danio (Figure 2B, S2) don't appear to show this same trend. The authors should check this more carefully by comparing proportions of transcripts of different lengths at the different developmental times. If there is not change in proportions then the real data may not validate the simulation's predictions. At issue might be the &quot;contamination&quot; of the real data with maternal transcripts. Perhaps the authors should try to remove maternal transcripts and analyze only zygotic transcripts. Furthermore, the timepoints shown for <italic>Xenopus</italic> in Figure 2B are probably too late and too closely spaced to see a trend. They should compare transcripts for very early and very late in development.</p><p>2. I was not convinced by the simulations and arguments about the generation of cell diversity. It seems that this might only occur with very low numbers of transcripts per cell; i.e. when stochastic variation came into effect. This may not be the case for real cells.</p><p>3. Figure 6AB really baffled me. Transcriptome diversity seems not to be graphed at all (check the axis labels and key), even though diversity is the point of the figure. Either it is mis-labeled or it needs more explanation. Figure 6C also requires more explanation, both within the figure and in the text (lines 219-227), which is opaque.</p><p>4. Figure 5 states that slower cell cycles would increase cell type diversity at the price of fewer progeny number. However, the real data in Figure 6 don't support this idea. Slower cell cycle actually increased differentiated progenies, this suggests that the authors' simulation settings failed to capture a critical aspect of the regulation of transcription.</p><p>5. We suggest that the authors also look into the Oikopleura dioica genome (see Danks et al. 2012 &quot;OikoBase: a genomics and developmental transcriptomics resource for the urochordate Oikopleura dioica&quot;). This could be very interesting because this organism develops exceptionally fast (embryogenesis last 4-5 hours before hatching a tadpole), and they have an incredibly compact genome (most introns are no longer than 100 bp). There is also good transcriptome data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> that could be informative, especially if maternal transcripts could somehow be subtracted out. Overall, the analysis of real transcriptome data is superficial, and much more could be done here, that might support the authors' conclusions much better that what is presented.</p><p>6. In the introduction (line 47), the authors should state how they envision the &quot;transcriptional filter&quot; works. By abortion of transcription at M phase? Or during S phase? There is data on both mechanisms and these should be cited and described explicitly. This also comes up in the discussion (line 269). The authors should be aware that the attenuation of transcription during S-phase is limited to interactions with replication forks. In fact there is a great deal of transcription in most S phases.</p><p>7. We were uncomfortable with the assumption that appears to be made on lines 86-92 and Figure 2, where the number of transcripts made during a period of time equals: synthesized transcripts=time/time to make one transcript. Does this assumption fail to take into account that multiple RNA transcription bubbles may exist on the same gene once transcription starts, thus speeding up transcript production once the first transcript in finished? If so it is inaccurate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents a theoretical model that explains potential contribution of cell cycle, as a transcription filter, to organism development. The hypothesis is not entirely new. The main contribution is that the authors defined a math/simulation framework and compared it with some real data (gene size distribution in various organisms and single-cell transcriptomic data obtained from several organisms/processes) for justification. Overall, I do not feel this work adds much new to current understanding. Real data did not strongly validate the proposed model, nor led to refinement in knowledge/hypotheses.</p><p>1. Page 4. Algorithms and parameters used in simulation were not described in sufficient detail. For example, how were single-cell RNA-seq data simulated? Was noise considered?</p><p>2. Figure 2, the trends between A and B are similar but the actual distributions are not: either mean average transcript count per cell, or the extent of spread look quite different. One could also argue the dissimilarity between the two figures. Does it reveal that the model lacks necessary accuracy? This needs to be further discussed/explained.</p><p>3. Figure 3A. The authors should be able to derive analytical solutions for the transcriptome diversity, directly from the model defined in Figure A. Not sure why they need to show these relations indirectly from simulation (Page 5). Perhaps it is the order/logic of the presentation.</p><p>4. Figure 3C. Unclear how many cells are there under each condition (when does the simulation stop?) and how do #cell affect the clustering results. Also, #cluster, as a metric is quite misleading (not comparable across conditions) without specifying the total #cell and the clustering algorithms/parameters used.</p><p>5. Page 6, the authors stated that &quot;we expect faster developing organisms to have short cell cycles and genes whereas slower developing organisms will have longer cell cycles and genes&quot;. This is very rough. Can it be quantified and then supported by the proposed model?</p><p>6. Figure 4. How were the 11 genomes selected? Why not select more? Are there genomes that do not follow the trend, i.e., having large genome but relatively shorter genes? Also, it is unclear in what order the organisms are listed. Particularly, Fugu and zebra-fish did not follow the monotonic trend in means. Some distributions do not look statistically significantly different.</p><p>7. Figure 6. E15.5 and E17.5 has a slightly reversed trend.</p><p>In general, there needs to be more real data used to back up the theoretical models.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Control of tissue development and cell diversity by cell cycle dependent transcriptional filtering&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I would suggest to use this as a first assumption rather than &quot;We assume RNA polymerase II re-initiation occurs once a transcript is complete&quot;. To me the latter one is not supported by what we know about transcription that occurs in bursts that can generate large number of RNA molecules within minutes. Also see Tantale et al., Nature Communications 2016, who show evidence of RNA Pol II convoys on actively transcribed genes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors use mathematical modeling to address whether cell cycle length determines cell fate using a correlation of gene transcript length. Since a longer cell cycle time, allows transcription of longer genes, it could affect the cell fate of the progeny. If longer transcripts are needed for highly differentiated cells, there would be a need for longer cell cycle times. Since it has been shown in stem cells that lengthening of the G1 phase is correlated with increased differentiation of cells, this hypothesis could make a lot of sense.</p><p>Using mathematical modeling is a great approach to answer this question and is definitely one of the strengths of this manuscript. This manuscript is trying to address an important and fundamental question that has been on the minds of scientists for a long time.</p><p>The drawback of the manuscript is that validation of the hypothesis is only partially or poorly confirmed by the experimental data. Essentially, the data does not contradict the hypothesis of the authors. This is great but is it good enough? Should the data not univocally prove that the hypothesis is correct? One of the major issues is that the authors use publicly available data, which originates from different organisms, different developmental time points, and have been acquired using different platforms. Therefore, the underlying data may not be solid enough.</p><p>Rather than trying to find universal rules that apply to all organisms, tissues, and developmental time points, it may be more useful to stick to one organism. If the authors could prove that their hypothesis is correct even in only one specific cell types, this would be an important step. Sometimes taking a small step can be more important than making a giant leap that is not well supported by the data.</p><p>This manuscript is interesting and contains good hypotheses but for sure the authors had to use a number of simplifications. Whether this still allows to generalize the conclusions of this manuscript is up for debate.</p><p>I am not a mathematician and therefore I am not able to check the mathematical models that were used. Nevertheless, I will assess if the conclusions make sense in real biology.</p><p>My conclusion after reading this manuscript is that of interest but remains speculative. What I mean by this is that the mathematical predictions would need to be verified by experiments. Although the authors use a number of datasets, they are assembled from different organisms and different developmental timepoints. As the authors mention, the data does not contradict their hypotheses. This is ok but maybe not good enough? Should the data not univocally support the mathematical hypotheses in order that the readers will buy them?</p><p>Here are the main reasons:</p><p>1. Line 128: &quot;in general, cells express more short genes than longer genes over multiple developmental time points.&quot; Although there may be a trend, I am not entirely convinced of this statement. There seems to be a lot of noise (variation), which may not support this conclusion.</p><p>2. Line 223: &quot;While cell cycle duration measurements are not widely available, we instead ask if organisms with longer genes would also take longer to develop.&quot; Although this is understandable, I am not sure that this is a correct surrogate. The duration of development must not necessarily be dependent on cell cycle length. Nevertheless, I agree the cell cycle duration measurements are not widely available.</p><p>3. The authors use data from different organisms and from different developmental time points. Of course, the idea is that there are universal rules that apply across species. This would be ideal but is there any proof of that? The unwanted side effect is that it becomes really confusing and the authors may compare apples to oranges.</p><p>4. Then there is the issue of splicing and introns. It is not surprising that larger genes contain more introns. To some degree splice isoforms could also explain the differences between stem cells and differentiated cells. Nevertheless, I feel this is a distraction. Therefore, analyzing organisms that contain few introns would be more useful. Budding yeast is such an organism.</p><p>5. The pathway analysis of the short and long genes is not thorough enough. In addition, the authors should use random sets of genes (same number) from the intermediate genes, which are the majority of genes.</p><p>6. The time it takes to transcribe a gene is not only dependent on its size and a fixed speed. This is an oversimplification.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Control of tissue development and cell diversity by cell cycle dependent transcriptional filtering&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is important for the following reason. If a gene takes 10 hours to be transcribed and the cell cycle is 10 hours, only 1 transcript can be made. However, if the cell cycle is longer, the maximum number of transcripts will depend on the distance between successive polymerases (thus depending on initiation rate), and could thus rapidly increase. The number of transcripts generated in 11 hours will thus scale with initiation rate, or inversely with the distance between polymerases on the gene. Also, how does transcriptional bursting affect their modelling ?</p></disp-quote><p>In our original manuscript, we assumed that a transcript must be fully transcribed before another copy can be made. That is, we didn’t allow a transcript to be transcribed by multiple polymerases at the same time. Including an initiation rate would act to increase the number of transcripts as the reviewer points out. To show how this affects our results, we performed a simulation with re-initiation, re-initiation distance is the kb distance an rnaPol complex can reinitiate along the gene, (Figure S2A, e.g. if it is set to 1, a new rnaPolII can initiate 1 kb apart from the first) or a random transcription rate (Figure S2B, random rate means a new rate is assigned to each gene from a Gaussian distribution around a set rate, λ). We show that changing initiation distance and transcription rate doesn’t affect the trend that short genes are expressed more than long genes (Figure S2 A-B). Furthermore, we test under which condition the transcriptional filter can be suppressed. We conducted simulations for a genome with genes of the same length (e.g. L<sub>G</sub>=9) and the cell cycle duration is short Γ=1 hour (Figure S2 C-D). In this case the long genes do not have enough time to be transcribed and changing initiation distance cannot overcome the limiting effects of the cell cycle. Only by increasing the transcription rate sufficiently high (e.g. λ=4) do we see the genes completely transcribed. On the other hand, simulation for a genome with genes of the same length (e.g. L<sub>G</sub>=9) with a long cell cycle duration (Γ=10 hours) (Figure S2 E-F ) shows that re-initiation distance and transcriptional rate help make cell cycle duration more important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors show that short genes tend to be expressed at higher levels than long genes. They use this data to support that elongation rates * cell cycle duration limits the expression of long genes. In this scenario, one would expect that long genes are more depleted in pol II at the end of the gene, while short genes would not. The authors could look into Pol II footprinting/ChIP-seq datasets to confirm this, and also to exclude that short genes are expressed at higher levels because of their higher initiation rates.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to do this by analyzing a series of Pol II footprinting data sets (we tried GSE34301 (Gaertner et al., 2012), GSE81521 (Li et al., 2016), and GSM565202 (Saha et al., 2011)), but the data did not distinguish between an elongating versus a poised RNA pol II. There were very few data sets of this type available for organism development and we couldn’t find any for early development to better match the context of our study. Also, we couldn’t be sure what phase of the cell cycle the cells were in when measured. Overall, the reviewer makes an interesting point and there do seem to be a number of technologies that may be able to support this line of inquiry (e.g. GRO-seq and related methods), so we will be watching for these data in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mention that cell cycle duration should be broadly correlated with development time. But cell sizes and organism size will also impact this correlation. Why do the authors not consider these parameters ?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that cell size will impact the decision of when the cell will divide, however the data on how cell size is influenced by cell cycle duration is still unclear, and current work suggests that S-phase is important in cell size decision (Kafri et al., 2013).

We have generally assumed that gene lengths and cell cycle duration dynamics coevolved across evolutionary time scales; our hypothesis is that a cell cycle dependent transcriptional filter is a fundamental regulatory mechanism operating during development (because gene length is fixed in the genome). We have now included a comment about this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>We've known for a very long time that cells in many animal embryos have very fast cell cycles, and that the duration of cell cycle increases as cells differentiate into progeny with specialized function. However, whether cell cycle duration directly impacts cell fate decisions via filtering transcriptional activity is not clear. Certainly it has been proposed on multiple occasions, and the ability of mitosis and DNA replication to interrupt and abort transcription has been demonstrated. This study presents an interesting attempt to address this topic via mathematically modeling the relationship of cell cycle length and the diversity of transcriptome. The authors utilized a simplified model to simulate how cell cycle length, gene length, number of genes and transcription rate affect resulting transcriptomes in cell populations. Not unexpectedly, the simulations show that increasing the length of the cell cycle can increase the proportion of mRNAs from long genes, and also the complexity of the transcriptome and (more interestingly) the diversity of transcriptomes between different cells in a population. The model is clever and the demonstration is useful, if highly over-simplified.</p><p>Importantly the authors also analyze some real transcriptome data to see if it supports their conclusions. At some levels there is support, but overall the real data from single cell sequence don't align well with their hypothesis and fall short of a compelling experimental validation.</p><p>Overall we felt the study was interesting in concept and could be a valuable addition to the literature devoted to cell cycle and development, but that it could be much better with comprehensive revisions as discussed below.</p><p>1. The simulations in Figure 2A show that increasing cell cycle duration will allow more relative transcription of longer genes. Unfortunately the real data from <italic>Xenopus</italic> and Danio (Figure 2B, S2) don't appear to show this same trend. The authors should check this more carefully by comparing proportions of transcripts of different lengths at the different developmental times. If there is not change in proportions then the real data may not validate the simulation's predictions. At issue might be the &quot;contamination&quot; of the real data with maternal transcripts. Perhaps the authors should try to remove maternal transcripts and analyze only zygotic transcripts. Furthermore, the timepoints shown for <italic>Xenopus</italic> in Figure 2B are probably too late and too closely spaced to see a trend. They should compare transcripts for very early and very late in development.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a number of good points, but unfortunately, it seems we confused the presentation by including multiple developmental time points. We intended for this figure to just show that short genes are more expressed than long genes – irrespective of developmental time point or difference in cell cycle duration. Since we don’t know parameters such as mRNA degradation rate and how these change over time, we didn’t feel comfortable making more precise statements, such as comparing the ratio of short/long gene expression values between time points. We have simplified this figure using new data that shows one time point per species for a wider range of species. The overall message of Figure 2 is that short genes are more expressed than long genes. As the reviewer mentions, this is not unexpected, but is important to show to validate this aspect of our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I was not convinced by the simulations and arguments about the generation of cell diversity. It seems that this might only occur with very low numbers of transcripts per cell; i.e. when stochastic variation came into effect. This may not be the case for real cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We created additional simulations with more genes in the genome (10,100, 1000) per cell and show we get the same results. As shown in Figure S4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 6AB really baffled me. Transcriptome diversity seems not to be graphed at all (check the axis labels and key), even though diversity is the point of the figure. Either it is mis-labeled or it needs more explanation. Figure 6C also requires more explanation, both within the figure and in the text (lines 219-227), which is opaque.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out and we apologize for the confusion. The point of this figure (now Figure 5) is not about transcriptome diversity. It is that when you allow the cell cycle duration to slow down over time and more naturally (randomly) vary, closer to what we understand happens in a real developing organism, the model generates a diverse set of cell proportions (represented by pie charts). So it is the diversity of the pie charts (the cell proportion patterns) generated that we want to highlight. This is interesting because it suggests cell cycle duration could help control cell type proportions during tissue development. We have completely redesigned this figure, which we hope shows this more intuitively. In particular, we show how the cell duration parameters/cell division events that vary over time generate in a diverse set of cells (cycling at different rates) shown in pie charts. We also compared these results to real mouse brain development data where we know how cell cycle changes (lengthens) over time, showing a similar trend.</p><p>The novel idea here is that just changing cell cycle dynamics can influence the proportion of fast to slow cycling cells (which we can think of as stem and differentiated cells, especially in the neural context). We have updated the text to clarify our idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5 states that slower cell cycles would increase cell type diversity at the price of fewer progeny number. However, the real data in Figure 6 don't support this idea. Slower cell cycle actually increased differentiated progenies, this suggests that the authors' simulation settings failed to capture a critical aspect of the regulation of transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion between figures 5 and 6. Figure 5 (original manuscript) investigates simulations involving two cell lineages with two different, but constant cell cycle durations. This illustrates that asynchronous cell cycle duration can select a mix of cell diversity programs (not allowing cell cycle duration to increase over time).</p><p>Figure 6 (original manuscript) shows the results of a simulation where the cell cycle duration of all cells is increasing over time. This illustrates that changing cell cycle duration over time affects the proportion of cells generated with various cycling rates.

However, we do note that our simulations show that cell type diversity increases and then decreases as cell duration increases (see Figure 3B) and interestingly, we do see the same trend of gradual increase, then decrease in the real mouse brain development data (scRNA-seq) across the four time points (8 cell types at E11.5, 11 at E13.5, 16 at E15.5 and 9 at E 17.5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The hypothesis is not entirely new. The main contribution is that the authors defined a math/simulation framework and compared it with some real data (gene size distribution in various organisms and single-cell transcriptomic data obtained from several organisms/processes) for justification. Overall, I do not feel this work adds much new to current understanding. Real data did not strongly validate the proposed model, nor led to refinement in knowledge/hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>The novel aspect of our work is the proposal that a cell cycle dependent transcriptional filter can control cellular diversity within a tissue over development. However, some of the concepts that we build on are known and are recognized in the community to varying degrees. We bring these together for the first time to support the model and generate predictions. In particular, we list these concepts in the Appendix and clarify our novel contribution.</p><p>Our work is the first to tie these diverse ideas together into one unified model. Further, our model enabled us to uncover a novel emergent property, that a cell cycle controlled transcriptional filter can be used as a mechanism to control generation of diversity of cells within a developing system (one formed by successive rounds of cell division). Finally, we are the first to apply mathematical modeling to this topic, which enables us to propose testable predictions that we hope will interest experimental biologists to investigate.</p><p>Our comparison to real data cannot prove our model, and this is not used to justify, prove or validate our results. Instead, it serves to show that real data does not refute our predictions. In discussions with diverse experimental biologists, we have found comparison with real data in this way necessary to move forward with discussions about our predictions, and that is what we hope to accomplish by including it here.</p><p>We have edited the text to clarify the novelty and we have included the information in the Appendix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We have extensively revised the pathway themes and reanalysed genes based on their length. For example, we separated olfactory, eye, auditory and brain related pathways. This more careful assignment of pathways to themes helps clean up our results.

To me the latter one is not supported by what we know about transcription that occurs in bursts that can generate large number of RNA molecules within minutes.

Since a longer cell cycle time, allows transcription of longer genes, it could affect the cell fate of the progeny. If longer transcripts are needed for highly differentiated cells, there would be a need for longer cell cycle times. Since it has been shown in stem cells that lengthening of the G1 phase is correlated with increased differentiation of cells, this hypothesis could make a lot of sense.</p><p>Using mathematical modeling is a great approach to answer this question and is definitely one of the strengths of this manuscript. This manuscript is trying to address an important and fundamental question that has been on the minds of scientists for a long time.</p><p>The drawback of the manuscript is that validation of the hypothesis is only partially or poorly confirmed by the experimental data. Essentially, the data does not contradict the hypothesis of the authors. This is great but is it good enough? Should the data not univocally prove that the hypothesis is correct? One of the major issues is that the authors use publicly available data, which originates from different organisms, different developmental time points, and have been acquired using different platforms. Therefore, the underlying data may not be solid enough.</p><p>Rather than trying to find universal rules that apply to all organisms, tissues, and developmental time points, it may be more useful to stick to one organism. If the authors could prove that their hypothesis is correct even in only one specific cell types, this would be an important step. Sometimes taking a small step can be more important than making a giant leap that is not well supported by the data.</p><p>This manuscript is interesting and contains good hypotheses but for sure the authors had to use a number of simplifications.

Should the data not univocally support the mathematical hypotheses in order that the readers will buy them?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more explicit statements that address the limitation of the data used. We truly hope that publishing this work can help move us to be able to perform the experiments that are needed to test the model, by raising awareness of this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here are the main reasons:</p><p>1. Line 128: &quot;in general, cells express more short genes than longer genes over multiple developmental time points.&quot; Although there may be a trend, I am not entirely convinced of this statement. There seems to be a lot of noise (variation), which may not support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have applied a statistical test and found that all of the comparisons of short gene expression to longer gene expression are highly significant (p-values &lt;10-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

Line 223: &quot;While cell cycle duration measurements are not widely available, we instead ask if organisms with longer genes would also take longer to develop.&quot; Although this is understandable, I am not sure that this is a correct surrogate. The duration of development must not necessarily be dependent on cell cycle length. Nevertheless, I agree the cell cycle duration measurements are not widely available.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the confusion, we agree that duration of development does not necessarily imply cell cycle length. We changed the sentence accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors use data from different organisms and from different developmental time points. Of course, the idea is that there are universal rules that apply across species. This would be ideal but is there any proof of that? The unwanted side effect is that it becomes really confusing and the authors may compare apples to oranges.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that comparing patterns across species may be like comparing apples to oranges, though it does support the generality of the conclusion. On the other hand, comparing results within species is a more appropriate comparison, but may lack generality. We have thus included results for both complementary situations where possible. For instance, in Figure 3, we show results across species and 2—figure supplement 4 shows results within species for three different species. However, in general, we cannot say that all patterns are universal, so we have added phrasing in the discussion/future direction section about this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Then there is the issue of splicing and introns. It is not surprising that larger genes contain more introns. To some degree splice isoforms could also explain the differences between stem cells and differentiated cells. Nevertheless, I feel this is a distraction. Therefore, analyzing organisms that contain few introns would be more useful. Budding yeast is such an organism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that splice isoforms can add to the differences seen among the cells. The model proposed is directed at total gene length, irrespective of whether introns are present or absent. However we reviewed over 380 genomes in the Ensembl database and identified 3 additional species with genomes that contain few introns (&gt;85% of intronless genes in their genome) – these happen to all be fungi. We now include these (<italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic>, <italic>Komagataella pastoris</italic>, and <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic>) in our analysis (figure 9). These genomes do show gene length dependent effects, similar to budding yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The pathway analysis of the short and long genes is not thorough enough. In addition, the authors should use random sets of genes (same number) from the intermediate genes, which are the majority of genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now analyse all the genes in the system, including the intermediate genes. We have divided the human genome into 20 gene sets based on gene length as shown in new Figure 8—figure supplement 2. Our conclusions remain the same, that there are strong patterns of change in proportion of pathways annotated to genes depending on the gene length. We have also included additional plots that show how gene length is distributed among the top most gene-length-dependent pathways, shown in author response image 3, and new Figure 8—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The time it takes to transcribe a gene is not only dependent on its size and a fixed speed. This is an oversimplification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is a simplified assumption, however there are examples where length and the speed of the transcript define the time it takes. For instance, the human Dystrophin gene takes 16hrs to transcribe and this does not appear to vary between measurements (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7719347/). We now include this reference in the paper. We also include a relaxation of this assumption in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, where the transcription rate is allowed to vary (following a normal distribution) and this does not affect our conclusions.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the third round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please revise your writing to address Reviewer 1 and 3's critiques.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Authors have mainly addressed my comments.</p><p>Figure 9: I wonder whether you can make further statements. For example, if immune cells have short cell cycle, then its enrichment for short genes will make more sense.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried this, but found it is difficult to make further statements about immune cells for three main reasons. First, they seem to have diverse cell cycle dynamics. For example, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can divide as fast as 2 hours, with most averaging 6 hours with very little G1, though this changes after 5 divisions where the cell cycle slows down (PMID: 21079741). On the other hand, macrophages can have a ~19 h cell cycle (PMID: 3622537). Second, it is challenging to collect comprehensive immune system information to support general statements because most papers with cell cycle duration information don’t usually measure or report it, but instead report related values (such as mitotic rate or doubling time of cell culture) that may or may not be possible to infer cell cycle duration from (e.g. the reported values may be an average over a large population of different cell types). Third, most cell cycle studies examine the regenerating hematopoietic system in adults, rather than immune system development, and these likely have different cell cycle dynamics. In the regenerative case, hematopoietic stem cells are slow dividers and speed up as you go down the lineage (PMID:30084312). For instance in (PMID:30084312), LSK (Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+) cells, which contain adult bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), have a cell cycle of 47.0 +/-4.9 hrs and give rise to LSK- (Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit-), which have a cell cycle of 23.4+/-2.3 hrs. This also happens for other hematopoietic cell types (PMID:30084312). We are currently working on modeling hematopoiesis to help study the differences between development and regenerative contexts as part of a future project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, might olfactory short genes be related to environmental sensing genes which in turn involve signal transduction pathways also used in fast-growing cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The genes contributing to this pattern are almost all olfactory receptors, which are generally very short (e.g. in human, the family of over 500 genes has an average length of around 7000bp, with many in the 1000bp range).

In several figures (for example Figure 6—figure supplement 2 but there are others), the authors use a representation (word clouds) that are not very helpful. The authors should find a better way to bring across the point that they are trying to make.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried many ways to visualize the large amount of data we have considered, but each had different advantages and disadvantages and we couldn’t find a single best representation, while maintaining a consistent analysis across all species. For example, representing the data using the typical bar and pie charts has the advantage of being familiar, but these plots were unreadable when all the information was displayed. There is a trade off between the amount of detail that can be shown and the ability to summarize many details in a large data set. We thus decided to include multiple representations in the revision. We kept word clouds to summarize information about gene annotation for thousands of genes per species, and included a pathway enrichment analysis visualization made using the Cytoscape analysis software (Figure 8 supplementary 1), a linear plot with a moving average across bins (Figure 8 supplementary 2) and a matrix plot displaying frequencies of gene annotation themes (Figure 8 supplementary 4) as alternative perspectives and approaches to the same data. Since we wanted to incorporate all Gene Ontology biological processes (pathways) with more than two genes for all species we needed to digest the large data set (13 species, range of 4,700 to 26,000 genes per species, biological pathway annotation range of 2,000 to 12,000 pathways per species, which is millions of data points) and have our message accessible to the readers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
