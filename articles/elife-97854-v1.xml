As open-type enteroendocrine cells, whether L cells can sense mechanical stimuli caused by chyme and thus regulate GLP-1 synthesis and secretion is unexplored. Molecular biology techniques revealed the expression of Piezo1 in intestinal L cells. Its level varied in different energy status and correlates with blood glucose and GLP-1 levels. Mice with L cell-specific loss of Piezo1 (<italic>Piezo1</italic> IntL-CKO) exhibited impaired glucose tolerance, increased body weight, reduced GLP-1 production and decreased CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway under normal chow diet or high-fat diet. Activation of the intestinal Piezo1 by its agonist Yoda1 or intestinal bead implantation increased the synthesis and secretion of GLP-1, thus alleviated glucose intolerance in diet-induced-diabetic mice. Overexpression of Piezo1, Yoda1 treatment or stretching stimulated GLP-1 production and CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway, which could be abolished by knockdown or blockage of Piezo1 in primary cultured mouse L cells and STC-1 cells. These experimental results suggest a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for GLP-1 production in L cells, which could offer new insights into diabetes treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Piezo1</kwd><kwd>glucagon-like peptide 1</kwd><kwd>intestinal L cells</kwd><kwd>CaMKKβ</kwd><kwd>CaMKIV</kwd><kwd>mechanistic target of rapamycin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82170818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Geyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81770794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Geyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024A1515010686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Geyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21620423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Geyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Project Funding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202201011353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental results suggest a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for GLP-1 production in L cells, which could offer new insights into diabetes treatments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents the largest endocrine organ in the human body. The enteroendocrine cells (EECs) located throughout the GI tract secrete a large number of gastrointestinal hormones to regulate a variety of physiological processes and are key regulators for energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bany Bakar et al., 2023</xref>). GLP-1 is one of the gut-derived peptide hormones essential for postprandial glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2019</xref>). It is produced from Proglucagon (Gcg) by proprotein convertase in the intestinal L cells, a group EECs predominantly situated in the distal gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rouillé et al., 1997</xref>). The circulating GLP-1 levels rapidly increase after meal and reduce postprandial blood glucose fluctuations by augmenting insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion and slowing gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drucker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Willms et al., 1996</xref>). Nowadays, GLP-1-based therapy is well-recognized and commonly used in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saxena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). Elucidation of the mechanism that regulates GLP-1 production is essential for the development of new drug targets for the treatment of diabetes.</p><p>EECs can be divided into two categories according to their morphology: open type and closed type. The open type EECs possess microvilli protruding into the gut lumen and have direct contact with the luminal contents. In contrast, the closed type EECs are located basolaterally without direct contact with the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gribble and Reimann, 2016</xref>). Both types of EECs synthesize and store peptides or hormones in secretory granules and release them by exocytosis at the basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atanga et al., 2023</xref>). As open-type EECs, L cells received both chemical and mechanical signals from the luminal contents, and neural signals from the nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furness et al., 2013</xref>). It has been well-documented that nutrients such as glucose, lipids, and amino acids in the intestinal lumen can stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 from L cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diakogiannaki et al., 2012</xref>). GLP-1 secretion can also be stimulated by intrinsic cholinergic nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anini et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drucker, 2006</xref>). However, whether and how L cells coordinate mechanical stimuli from intestinal lumen to regulate GLP-1 production remain poorly understood.</p><p>Piezo channels, including Piezo1 and Piezo2 have recently been identified as mechanosensitive ion channels involved in the sensation of multiple mechanical stimuli, such as shear stress, pressure, and stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gudipaty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romac et al., 2018</xref>). They allow the influx of cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in response to mechanical tension and converts mechanical stimuli into various electrical and chemical signals. Piezo1 plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation, red blood cell volume regulation, bone homeostasis, pulmonary and cardiac functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have reported that Piezo1 is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, regulating gut peristalsis, barrier function, mucus secretion, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugisawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, accumulating evidence demonstrates the regulation of insulin and ghrelin secretion by Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deivasikamani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>). Recent studies have also reported that Piezo2 is expressed in a population of EECs and convert force into serotonin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcaino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Treichel et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggest a critical role of Piezo channels in the mechano-regulation of hormone production. However, whether Piezo channels are expressed L cells and play a role in GLP-1 production remain unknown.</p><p>The current study has shown that Piezo1 channels on intestinal L cells mediate mechanosensing of intestinal contents and regulate glucose homeostasis by triggering GLP-1 synthesis and secretion via the CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway. This finding provides new insights into the treatment of T2DM and lays a theoretical foundation for the development of antidiabetic drugs targeting Piezo1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assessment of Piezo1 in human and mouse intestine in different energy status</title><p><italic>Piezo1</italic> mRNA was found to be highly expressed in both mouse ileal mucosa and STC-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, Piezo1 was co-localized with GLP-1 in immunofluorescent staining on NCD fed mouse ileal sections, indicating its expression in L cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, increased body weight and impaired glucose tolerance were observed in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice, while Piezo1 and Proglucagon expression levels in the ileal mucosa of diabetic mice were significantly lower than that in mice feed with normal chow diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Moreover, ileal mucosal <italic>Piezo1</italic> mRNA levels were positively correlated with <italic>Gcg</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), but negatively correlated with the AUC of glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Obese T2DM patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery showed decreased BMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and increased Piezo1 and GLP-1 in ileal mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J, K</xref>) compared to that before surgery. These findings indicated that Piezo1 is expressed in intestinal L cells and its level varies in different energy status.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation and characterization of <italic>Piezo1</italic> IntL-CKO mice</title><p>To investigate the potential role of Piezo1 in GLP-1 production, we tried to knockout <italic>Piezo1</italic> in L cells by Cre-loxP system driven by an L cell-specific promoter. Proglucagon (encoded by <italic>Gcg</italic> gene) is mainly expressed in both L cells and pancreatic α cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin, 2008</xref>). Villin-1 (encoded by <italic>Vil1</italic> gene) is expressed in gastrointestinal epithelium, including L cells, but not in pancreatic α cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maunoury et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rutlin et al., 2020</xref>). Since neither Gcg nor Villin are specific markers for L cells, we tried to generate a new line of mice enabling loss of Piezo1 expression specifically in the intestine L cell by combination of FLP-Frt and Cre-loxP system. We inserted a Flippase (FLP) expression cassette in the 3’UTR of <italic>Vil1</italic> to generate a <italic>Vil1</italic> promoter-driven FLP mice (<italic>Vil1<sup>FLP</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Then, we generated Flippase-dependent <italic>Gcg</italic> promoter driven-Cre (<italic>Gcg<sup>Cre</sup></italic>) mice by inserting an Frt-flanked Cre expression cassette in reverse orientation within the 3’- UTR of <italic>Gcg</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We further crossed the <italic>Vil1<sup>FLP</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Gcg<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice to obtain L-cell-specific Cre mice (<italic>Vil1<sup>FLP</sup>::Gcg<sup>frtCre</sup></italic>), in which <italic>Vil1</italic> promoter-driven Flippase flipped the reverse Cre cassette into a correct orientation in Villin-positive cells (including L cells, but not pancreatic α cells), and thus Cre can only be expressed under the <italic>Gcg</italic> promoter in L cells. The genotypes of the <italic>Vil1<sup>FLP</sup></italic>, <italic>Gcg<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Vil1<sup>FLP</sup>::Gcg<sup>frtCre</sup></italic> mice were identified by PCR with specific primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The flipping of the reverse Cre cassette was validated by PCR, which confirmed that the flipping only occurred the intestine, but not in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm the cell type specificity of Cre activity, we crossed <italic>Vil1<sup>FLP</sup>::Gcg<sup>frtCre</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Rosa26<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic> reporter mice.

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of GLP-1 production is not completely understood. One of the problems that impeded the investigation of regulation mechanism of GLP-1 is the lack of an L-cell-specific genetically engineered animal model. Here, an L-cell-specific Cre mouse line was generated for the first time through the combination of the FLP-Frt and Cre-LoxP systems. This enables genetic manipulation specifically in the L cells and creates a valuable tool for investigating molecular mechanisms in L cells.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that L cells are able to sense nutrients in the intestinal lumen such as glucose and other carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids, which induce GLP-1 secretion through different mechanisms, including membrane depolarization-associated exocytosis, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tolhurst et al., 2011</xref>), cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu and Jin, 2010</xref>), mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), and AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) signaling pathways. However, it is innegligible that as open type endocrine cells, L cells not only receive the chemical stimulations from the nutrients, but also mechanical stimulation when the chyme passing through the intestine, including stretching, pressure and shear force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sensoy, 2021</xref>). While the food needs to be digested and nutrients absorbed before L-cells can detect the nutritive signals, mechanical stimulation may be more direct and faster. The expression of Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, was demonstrated in human and mouse intestinal sections, primary mouse L cell culture, and intestinal neuroendocrine cell line STC-1, indicating the mechanosensing ability of L cells and the potential regulatory effect of GLP-1 on mechanical stimulation. The results showed a significant increase in GLP-1 secretion by implantation of intestinal beads, stretching of intestinal tissue, or stretching of STC-1 cells, providing further evidence that mechanical regulation of GLP-1 secretion does exist. In addition, the selective deletion of Piezo1 (<italic>Piezo1</italic> IntL-CKO) mice showed reduced circulating GLP-1 level, increased body weight, and impaired glucose homeostasis, while pharmacological activation of Piezo1 in mice, primary L cells, and STC-1 cells showed opposite effects. More importantly, <italic>Piezo1</italic> IntL-CKO mice was unable to response to the tension-induced GLP-1 production. These further suggested a Piezo1-mediated mechanical sensing mechanism in L cells that regulates GLP-1 production and glucose metabolism by sensing the stimulation of intestinal luminal contents.</p><p>Interestingly, this intestinal Piezo1-mediated mechanical sensing mechanism may severely impaired in diabetic patients and rodents. Reduced expression of Piezo1 was demonstrated in the ileal mucosa of diet-induced diabetic mice, along with reduced GLP-1 production. When challenged with high-fat diet, <italic>Piezo1</italic> IntL-CKO mice exhibited more severe symptoms of diabetes which was mitigated by Ex-4. These findings suggest that the impairment of Piezo1-mediated mechanical sensing function in the intestine is an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of T2DM. It is noteworthy that RYGB, a commonly performed weight-loss and hypoglycemic surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings et al., 2004</xref>), significantly increased Piezo1 expression in L cells of obese diabetic patients. Yoda1 treatment or intestinal bead implantation enhanced GLP-1 production and improved glucose metabolism in the diet-induced diabetic mouse model, suggesting that restoring the mechano-sensing or enhancing the function of Piezo1 either pharmacologically or mechanically, may be a new strategy to improve the secretion of GLP-1 and alleviate T2DM. However, various data suggest that Piezo1-mediated regulation of GLP-1 production has only been demonstrated in transgenic mice, mouse primary L cells, and enteric neuroendocrine cell lines derived from mice. Whether Piezo1 plays the same role in human L cells awaits to be investigated. A number of studies have generated L cells culture from human intestinal organoid culture or human intestinal stem cell monolayer culture by manipulating the growth factors in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldspink et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Villegas-Novoa et al., 2022</xref>). It is worthy to validate our finding in human L cells in order to prove its translational potential in T2DM treatment.</p><p>The intragastric balloon is a current clinical weight loss measure that involves placing a space-occupying balloon in the stomach to reduce food intake and generate satiety signals, thus maintaining satiety. Investigations illustrated that intragastric balloon alter the secretion of hormones such as cholecystokinin and pancreatic polypeptide, delay the emptying of food in the stomach and reduce the appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mathus-Vliegen and de Groot, 2013</xref>). Intragastric balloon provides a feasible weight loss intervention for obese people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, a new intestinal implantation surgery of beads was adopted, which may offer a novel approach for weight loss and glucose control by activating the intestinal Piezo1-GLP-1 axis in the future.</p><p>Mechanistically, cellular and mouse models revealed that Piezo1 regulates GLP-1 production through the CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling pathway. CaMKKβ/CaMKIV has been reported to mediate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in many metabolic processes, including liver gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis, adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and β cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2022b</xref>). mTOR plays a central role in nutrient and energy sensing and regulates cellular metabolism and growth in response to different nutrient and energy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howell and Manning, 2011</xref>). Here, the data suggest that mTOR can also response to mechanical stimuli through a mechano-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated CaMKKβ/CaMKIV activation. Although it has not been demonstrated that CaMKIV directly phosphorylates mTOR or S6K in L cells, a previous study reported that CaMKKβ could serve as a scaffold to assemble CaMKIV with key components of the mTOR/S6K pathway and promote liver cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2015</xref>), which lended support to the CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling in our study. Recently, Knutson et. al. found that ryanodine and IP3-triggered calcium release from intracellular calcium store could amplified the initial Peizo2 - Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal triggered by mechanical stimulation, and was required for the mechanotransduction in the serotonin release from enterochromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knutson et al., 2023</xref>). Primary L-cell and STC-1 cell results showed a persistent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase triggered by Yoda1, which also suggests that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> relay. Beside Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cyclic AMP (cAMP) is another signaling molecule that active <italic>Gcg</italic> gene expression and GLP-1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drucker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simpson et al., 2007</xref>). cAMP was found to play a critical role in nutrients-induced GLP-1 secretion, including glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ong et al., 2009</xref>), lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hodge et al., 2016</xref>), and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tolhurst et al., 2011</xref>). Previous study reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> can activate soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) to increase intracellular cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaiswal and Conti, 2003</xref>). Whether sAC-cAMP can be activated by Piezo1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and whether it is an alternative signaling pathway that mediates the Piezo1-regulated GLP-1 production remain to be explored.</p><p>Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the role of Piezo1 in enhancing insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deivasikamani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ye et al., 2022</xref>), while inhibiting ghrelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>) and glucagon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2024</xref>), as well as reducing intestinal nutrient absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tao et al., 2024</xref>). The diverse functions of Piezo1 across various cell types can be attributed to several factors, including cellular context, specific signaling pathways, and the microenvironment surrounding the cells. The current study reveals Piezo1-mediated mechanosensory properties of intestinal L cells that play an important role in regulating GLP-1 production and glucose metabolism. This finding suggests the existence of a new mechanoregulatory mechanism in enteroendocrine cells in addition to chemical and neural regulation, which may provide new ideas for the treatment of metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

The study describes Piezo1 expression by L-cells and using an exciting intersectional mouse model (villin to target epithelium and Gcg to target GLP-1 producing cells and others like glucagon producing pancreatic endocrine cells), which allows L-cell specific Piezo1 knockout. Using this model, they find an impairment of glucose tolerance, increased body weight, reduced GLP-1 content, and changes to the CaMKKbeta-CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway using normal diet and then high fat diet. Piezo1 chemical agonist and intestinal bead implantation reversed these changes and improved the disrupted phenotype. Using primary sorted L-cells and cell model STC-1, they found that stretch and Piezo1 activation increased GLP-1 and altered the molecular changes described above.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an interesting study testing a novel hypothesis that may have important mechanistic and translational implications. The authors generated an important intersectional genetics mouse model that allowed them to target Piezo1 L-cells specifically, and the surprising result of impaired metabolism is intriguing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, there are several critical limitations that require resolution before making the conclusions that the authors make. (1) A potential explanation for the data, and one that is consistent with existing literature [see for example, PMC5334365, PMC4593481], is that epithelial Piezo1, which is broadly expressed by the GI epithelium, impacts epithelial cell density and survival, and as such, if Piezo1 is involved in L-cell physiology, it may be through regulation of cell density. Thus, it is critical to determine L-cell densities and epithelial integrity in controls and Piezo1 knockouts systematically across the length of the gut, since the authors do not make it clear which gut region contributes to the phenotype they see. Current immunohistochemistry data are not convincing. (2) Calcium signaling in L-cells is implicated in their typical role of being gut chemosensors, and Piezo1 is a calcium channel, so it is not clear whether any calcium-related signaling mechanism would phenocopy these results. (3) Intestinal bead implantation, while intriguing, does not have clear mechanisms - and is likely to provide a point of intestinal obstruction and dysmotility. (4) previous studies, some that are very important, but not cited, contradict the presented results (e.g., epithelial Piezo1 role in insulin secretion) and require reconciliation.</p><p>Overall, this study makes an interesting observation but the data are not currently strong enough to support the conclusions.</p><p>- There needs to be data localizing Piezo1 to L-cells and importantly, this needs to be quantified - are all L-cells (small bowel and colon) Piezo1 positive? This is because several studies show Piezo1 affecting epithelial cell densities. If there are changes in L-cell or other EEC densities in Piezo1 knockout, that shift can potentially explain the changes that the authors see in glucose metabolism and weight.</p><p>- The intersectional model for L-cell transduction needs a deeper validation. Images in Fig 1e are not convincing for transduction of GFP in L-cells. The co-localization studies are not convincing, especially because Piezo1 labeling is very broad. There needs to be stronger validation of the intersectional Gcg-Villin-Piezo1 KO model. It is important to determine whether L-cell Piezo1 localization epithelium in small bowel and colon is present (above) and affected specifically in the knockout.</p><p>- The authors state that &quot;Villin-1 (encoded by Vill1 gene) is expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium, including L cells, but not in pancreatic α cells&quot; (line 378-379). However, Villin is highly expressed in whole mouse islets (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2016.05.015, Figure 1A).</p><p>- There needs to be quantification of L-cells in Piezo1 knockout. This is because several studies show Piezo1 affecting epithelial cell densities. If there are changes in L-cell or other EEC densities in Piezo1 knockout, that shift can potentially explain the changes that the authors see in glucose metabolism and weight.</p><p>- L-cells are classically considered to be chemosensors. Do nutritive signals, which presumably also increase calcium compete or complement or dominate L-cell GLP1 synthesis regulation?</p><p>- The mechanism of Glp1 synthesis vs release downstream of Piezo1 is not clear. The authors hypothesize that &quot;Piezo1 might regulate GLP-1 synthesis through the CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling pathway&quot;. However, references cited suggest that Ca2+ or cAMP lead to GLP-1-release, while mTOR primarily acts on the regulation of gene expression by promoting Gcg gene expression. These pathways do not clearly link to Piezo1 GLP-1 production. These mechanisms need to be reconciled.</p><p>- Previous study PMID 32640190 (not cited here) found that Villin-driven Piezo1 knockout, which knocks out Piezo1 from all epithelial intestinal cells (including L-cells), showed no significant alterations in blood glucose or body weight. This is opposite of the presented findings and therefore the current results require reconciliation.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed several comments that were common to the reviewers - specificity and validity of the intersectional model, mechanism of signaling downstream of Piezo1 and reconciliation of the results with previous studies. The authors have provided extensive experiments and revisions which have made the manuscript stronger. However, many important questions remain, and unfortunately, the intersectional mouse model and mechanisms remain unclear.</p><p>- I appreciate the authors quantifying the density of L cells in the intersectional Piezo knockout. There is a very clear &gt;50% drop-off in GLP-1+ cells with the Piezo1 knockout (Supp fig 7c, d). Interestingly, there was not a decrease in PYY+ cells, which is curious because GLP1 and PYY are co-expressed in L cells. The mechanism of regulation of one hormone but not the other in the same cell requires clarification and would be relevant for this work. To begin with, co-labeling PYY and GLP1 and showing that one hormone can be found without the other would be useful.</p><p>- Piezo1 immunofluorescence has very high background and overall poor specificity (Fig supp 5 and Fig supp 6B are good examples of poor Piezo1 immunofluorescence). Another method for labeling Piezo1 (e.g. via RNAscope) is required - and where tried (e.g., Fig 1L), the results are not convincing.</p><p>- The intersectional mouse model requires further validation. The data presented in Fig 1E do not help - the GFP positive cells do not look like L-cells and there appear to be GFP positive cells in the muscle and submucosa.</p><p>- Since Piezo1 is known to affect epithelial cell life span, barrier function maybe compromised. While I appreciate that the authors have obtain some images and measured zonular and occluded, this is unfortunately a suboptimal evaluation of barrier function.</p><p>- The mechanisms of calcium signaling that will presumably lead to GLP1 release due to Piezo1 activation and mTOR which authors link to GLP1 synthesis remain unreconciled.</p><p>- Intestinal bead implantation may provide an important area of obstruction, in addition to potential mechanical stimulation. Unfortunately whole gut transit time and fecal weight do not assay these functions well.</p><p>- I believe that the explanation regarding lack of previous findings connecting Piezo1 in the epithelium and glucose tolerance remain poorly reconciled with the current findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97854.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors proposed that the mechano-gated ion channel Piezo1 enhances GLP-1 production and secretion possibly through stimulating Ca2+-CaMKKbeta-CaMKIV-mTORC1 signaling pathway.

However, the data is not convincing.

In a recent work, the authors found that piezo1 in enterocytes suppresses nutrient absorption. Why an ion channel has these various effects in different cells? What is the fundamental and common mechanism underlying its metabolic functions? Its value as a drug target? These questions need to be discussed in more details.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

Nowadays, GLP-1-based therapy is well-recognized and commonly used in treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, elucidation of the mechanism that regulates GLP-1 production is essential for the development of new drug targets for the treatment of diabetes. We have revised the relevant wording in the manuscript.</p><p>In our previous studies, we have elucidated the role of mTOR/S6K pathway in regulating GLP-1 production in L cells. Using STC-1 cell line and different mouse models, including <italic>Neurog3-Tsc1−/−</italic> mice, rapamycin or L-lucine treatment to stimulate mTOR activity, we have demonstrated that mTOR stimulates proglucagon gene expression and thus GLP-1 production (Diabetologia 2015;58(8):1887-97； Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2015 Nov 15:416:9-18.). Based on our previous studies, we found that Piezo1 regulated mTOR/S6K pathway and thus proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production through a Ca2+/CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV pathway in our present study. Although we could not exclude involvement of other signaling pathways downstream of Piezo1 in regulating the cleavage of proglucagon, granule maturation and the final release of GLP-1, our present study provided evidence to support the involvement of the Ca2+/CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV/mTOR pathway in mediating the role Piezo1 in proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production.</p><p>The reviewer also expressed concerns on the use of western blot to detect proglucagon expression. Proglucagon is encoded by the <italic>GCG</italic> gene and is cleaved by PC1/3 in L cells to form mature GLP-1. In fact, measurement of intestinal proglucagon protein is a common approach for assessing GLP-1 production in the intestine. Here are some examples from other researchers: Diabetes. 2013 Mar;62(3):789-800. Gastroenterology. 2011 May;140(5):1564-74. 2004 Jul 23;279(30):31068-75. The proglucagon antibody used in our study was purchased from abcam (Cat#ab23468), which can detect proglucagon at 21 kDa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Huang and colleagues focuses on GLP-1 producing entero-endocrine (EEC) L-cells and their regulation of GLP-1 production by a mechano-gated ion channel Piezo1.

Current immunohistochemistry data are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment and agree that Piezo1 may impact L-cell density and epithelial integrity. To address this, we have incorporated quantification of L-cell density in new Figure Supplement 7. The quantitative results demonstrate that the specific deletion of the piezo1 gene in L cells did not significantly impact L-cell density.</p><p>Regarding epithelial integrity, we assessed the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin). As demonstrated in new Figure Supplement 8, the expression of tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 and Occludin did not show significant changes in <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice compared to littermate controls.</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted double immunofluorescence of Piezo1 and GLP-1 in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of control and <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice. As illustrated in new Figure Supplement 5, Piezo1 is expressed in GLP-1-positive cells of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of control mice, but not in <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Calcium signaling in L-cells is implicated in their typical role of being gut chemo-sensors, and Piezo1 is a calcium channel, so it is not clear whether any calcium-related signaling mechanism would phenocopy these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Piezo1 is a calcium channel (validation of the Ca2+ influx-mediated Piezo1 in primary L cells and STC-1 cells are shown in figure 4A-C and figure 5A-C). According to our study, calcium-related signaling mechanism such as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKKβ) -Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase IV (CaMKIV) may contribute the phenotype seen in the _IntL-Piezo1-/_mice. In addition, we also discussed other potential calcium-related signaling mechanisms in the article's discussion section (lines645-656).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Intestinal bead implantation, while intriguing, does not have clear mechanisms and is likely to provide a point of intestinal obstruction and dysmotility.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. To ascertain if intestinal bead implantation led to intestinal obstruction and dysmotility, we conducted a bowel transit time test and detected the postoperative defecation (As shown in new Figure Supplement 9). The results revealed no difference in bowel transit time and fecal mass between the sham-operated mice and those implanted with beads. Furthermore, to assess whether the animals were in pain or under any discomfort after intestinal bead implantation, we performed abdominal mechanical sensitivity test three days after the surgery. As indicated in Figure Supplement 9C, no difference in abdominal pain threshold was observed between sham and bead-implanted mice. These results suggest that the mice did not experience discomfort during the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Previous studies, some that are very important, but not cited, contradict the presented results (e.g., epithelial Piezo1 role in insulin secretion) and require reconciliation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for the point. We have cited more previous studies. The lack of changes in blood glucose seen in <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice reported by Sugisawa et. al. is not surprising (Cell. 2020 Aug 6;182(3):609-624.e21.). Actually, in another recent study from our group, we found similar results when the <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice <italic>Piezo1fl/fl</italic> control mice were fed with normal chow diet. Since Villin-1 is expressed in all the epithelial cells of the gut, including enterocytes and various types of endocrine cells, the effect of L-cell Piezo1 loss may be masked by other cell types under normal condition. However, impaired glucose tolerance was seen in <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice compared to the <italic>Piezo1fl/fl</italic> control mice after high fat diet for 8 weeks. We further found that Piezo1 in enterocytes exerted a negative effect on the glucose and lipid absorption. Loss of Piezo1 in enterocytes led to over-absorption of nutrients under high-fat diet. （Tian Tao, Qing Shu, Yawen Zhao, Wenying Guo, Jinting Wang, Yuhao Shi, Shiqi Jia, Hening Zhai, Hui Chen, Cunchuan Wang*, Geyang Xu*, Mechanical regulation of lipid and sugar absorption by Piezo1 in enterocytes, Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B , Accepted, 2024.

This comes from nowhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback. The incorrect label has been corrected in the new Figure 1L. As suggested, we have performed additional experiments to demonstrate tissue-specific knockout of Piezo1 in gut GLP-1-producing cells exclusively, excluding other cell lineages or locations.</p><p>As shown in Figure Supplement 6, Piezo1 remains expressed in ileal ghrelin-positive cells and pancreatic glucagon-positive cells of IntL-Piezo1-/mice, suggesting that Piezo1 was specifically knocked out in L cells, but not in other endocrine cell types. Furthermore, the decrease was only observed in GLP-1 levels, but not PYY levels, in L cells of <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice compared to controls, suggesting that the loss of Piezo1 in L cells affects GLP-1 levels specifically, but not the secretion of other hormones produced by L cells (Figure Supplement 7A-D).</p><p>In our previous studies, we have elucidated the role of mTOR/S6K pathway in regulating GLP-1 production in L cells. Using STC-1 cell line and different mouse models, including <italic>Neurog3-Tsc1−/−</italic> mice, rapamycin or L-lucine treatment to stimulate mTOR activity, we have demonstrated that mTOR stimulates proglucagon gene expression and thus GLP-1 production (Diabetologia 2015;58(8):1887-97； Mol Cell Endocrinol. 2015 Nov 15:416:9-18.). Based on our previous studies, we found that Piezo1 regulated mTOR/S6K pathway and thus proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production through a Ca2+/CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV pathway in our present study.</p><p>Although we could not exclude involvement of other signaling pathways downstream of Piezo1 in regulating the cleavage of proglucagon, granule maturation and the final release of GLP-1, our present study provided evidence to support the involvement of the Ca2+/CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV/mTOR pathway in mediating the role Piezo1 in proglucagon expression and GLP-1 production.</p><p>The reviewer also expressed concerns on the use of western blot to detect proglucagon expression. Proglucagon is encoded by the <italic>GCG</italic> gene and is cleaved by PC1/3 in L cells to form mature GLP-1. In fact, measurement of intestinal proglucagon protein is a common approach for assessing GLP-1 production in the intestine. Here are some examples from other researchers: Diabetes. 2013 Mar;62(3):789-800. Gastroenterology. 2011 May;140(5):1564-74. 2004 Jul 23;279(30):31068-75. The proglucagon antibody used in our study was purchased from abcam (Cat#ab23468), which can detect proglucagon at 21 kDa.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 2, the LFD control mouse group was missing. Again, I don't understand the detection of proglucagon by Western blotting in this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments. The figure 1 presents the phenotypic changes of transgenic mice under low-fat diet feeding, while figure 2 focuses on the phenotypic changes of transgenic mice under high-fat diet feeding. As we mentioned before, western blot is often used in detection of the precursor of GLP-1 named proglucagon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Why show body weight change but not body weight itself? How are the changes compared (which one serves as the control)? Again, how to do Western blotting on pro-glucagon detection?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments. Body weight has been added in new figure3. Proglucagon is the precursor of GLP-1. Intestinal proglucagon protein measurement is commonly used to assess GLP-1 production in the intestine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) After reading the whole manuscript, this reviewer cannot get a clear picture of how the claimed CaMKKbeta-mTORC1 pathway mediates the function of Pieo1 activation (via the utilization of Yoda1 or intestinal bead implantation) on Gcg expression (at the transcription level or mRNA stability level?), hormone production, the genesis of GLP-1 producing cells, and the secretion of the hormone.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments. Figure 7 showed that overexpression of CaMKKbeta and CaMKIV enhanced mTOR and S6K phosphorylation, proglucagon expression and GLP-1 secretoin, while CaMKKbeta inhibitor STO609 inhibited mTOR and S6K phosphorylation, proglucagon expression and GLP-1 secretoin, suggesting CaMKKbeta and CaMKIV was involved in GLP-1 production. Moreover, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibited Yoda1-induced proglucagon expression and GLP-1 secretion. These results suggested that CaMKKbeta/CaMKIV/mTOR mediated the effect of Piezo1 on GLP-1 production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I strongly suggest that authors focus on more solid findings and dissect the mechanistic insight on something more meaningful, but not on everything (hormone coding gene expression, hormone production, and hormone secretion).</p></disp-quote><p>GLP-1 production involves multiple steps, including proglucagon expression, protein cleavage, granule packaging and final release. In our present study, we focused on how mechanical signals regulated proglucagon expression in L-cells and thus promote GLP-1 production. We did not exclude the possibility that mechanical signals could also affect other step of GLP-1 production and we discussed this possibility in the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns</p><p>(1) Figure S1A. STC-1 is a Gcg expression cell line, which shows less amount of Peio1 mRNA when compared with most primary tissue samples tested. This does not support the fundamental role of Peio1 in regulating Gcg expression. Maybe qRT-PCR will be more helpful for establishing the correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for the comments. As suggested, the results of qRT-PCR have been added in new Figure S1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There are numerous scientific presentation problems in the written manuscript. Necessary literature citations are missing especially for key methods (such as bean implantation).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. We have made every effort to enhance the scientific presentation and have included the necessary literature citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, this study makes an interesting observation but the data are not currently strong enough to support the conclusions.</p><p>(1) There needs to be data localizing Piezo1 to L-cells and importantly, this needs to be quantified - are all L-cells (small bowel and colon) Piezo1 positive?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. We performed double immunofluorescence of Piezo1 and GLP-1 in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of control and <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice. As shown in new Figure Supplement 5, Piezo1 is expressed in about 90% of GLP-1-positive cells in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon of control mice, but not in <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The intersectional model for L-cell transduction needs deeper validation. Images in Figure 1e are not convincing for the transduction of GFP in L-cells. The co-localization studies are not convincing, especially because Piezo1 labeling is very broad. There needs to be stronger validation of the intersectional Gcg-Villin-Piezo1 KO model. It is important to determine whether L-cell Piezo1 localization epithelium in the small bowel and colon is present (above) and affected specifically in the knockout.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for the comments. In our study, we conducted a double immunofluorescence analysis for Piezo1 and GLP-1 across various segments of the gastrointestinal tract, including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon, in both control and <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice. As illustrated in the newly incorporated Figure Supplement 5, it was observed that Piezo1 is indeed expressed within the cells of the aforementioned gastrointestinal segments in control mice, which are also positive for GLP-1 expression. In stark contrast, no evidence of Piezo1 expression was detected in the <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice. Consistent with these findings, in situ hybridization experiments corroborated the absence of Piezo1 expression within GLP-1 positive cells in the <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice, offering evidence for the successful knockout of Piezo1 in the L cells of these knockout mice. (Figure 1L and M).</p><p>In Figure 1E, IntL-Cre mice were bred with mT/mG reporter mice to further validate Cre recombinase activity and specificity. All tissues and cells of mT/mG mice express red fluorescence (membrane-targeted tdTomato; mT) at baseline, and switch to membrane-targeted EGFP in the presence of cell-specific Cre. EGFP expression was only observed scatteredly in the intestine, but not in the pancreas, indicating the intestinal-specific Cre activity in the IntL-Cre mice (Figure 1E). We have revised the relevant expressions in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors state that &quot;Villin-1 (encoded by Vill1 gene) is expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium, including L cells, but not in pancreatic α cells&quot; (lines 378-379). However, Villin is highly expressed in whole mouse islets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2016.05.015">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2016.05.015</ext-link>, Figure 1A).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for the comments. Although Hassan Mziaut et al. reported that Villin is highly expressed in whole mouse islets, in that article, only the co-localization of insulin cells with Villin is mentioned, while the co-localization of glucagon and Villin is lacking.</p><p>According to our research (refer to Author response image 1 below) and previous study (Rutlin, M. et al, 2020, The Villin1 Gene Promoter Drives Cre Recombinase Expression in Extraintestinal Tissues. Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol, 10(4), 864-867.e865.), Villin is sparsely expressed in pancreatic tissue but not highly expressed in islets. We did not observed co-localization of glucagon and Villin in the pancreas (see Author response image 1A and B below). The same antibody was used to stain intestine, which show specific expression on the apical side of the intestinal villi (see Author response image 1C below).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97854-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There needs to be quantification of L-cells in Piezo1 knockout. This is because several studies show Piezo1 affecting epithelial cell densities. If there are changes in L-cell or other EEC densities in Piezo1 knockout, that shift can potentially explain the changes that the authors see in glucose metabolism and weight.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We agree that Piezo1 may affect L-cell density and epithelial integrity.</p><p>To assess epithelial integrity we examined the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin). As shown in new Figure Supplement 8, the expression of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1 and Occludin, remained unchanged in <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice when compared to littermate controls.</p><p>To assess the L-cell density, we stained PYY, another hormone mainly secreted by L cells, in both control and <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice. As shown in new Figure Supplement 7A and B, the percentage of PYY positive cells were not significantly different between control and <italic>IntL-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice, suggesting that the L-cell density was not affected by Piezo1 knockout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) L-cells are classically considered to be chemosensors. Do nutritive signals, which presumably also increase calcium compete or complement or dominate L-cell GLP1 synthesis regulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer ’ s comment and agree that L-cells are traditionally considered to be chemosensors. It is also recognized that nutritive signals regulate L-cell GLP1 synthesis. We have addressed these points in lines 568-595. Both nutritive and mechanical signals regulate GLP-1 production. While the food needs to be digested and nutrients absorbed before L-cells can detect the nutritive signals, mechanical stimulation provides a more direct and rapid response. However, determining whether nutritive signals compete, complement with mechanical signals or dominate in L-cell GLP-1 production will require to be further explored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The mechanism of Glp1 synthesis vs release downstream of Piezo1 is not clear. The authors hypothesize that &quot;Piezo1 might regulate GLP-1 synthesis through the CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR signaling pathway&quot;. However, references cited suggest that Ca2+ or cAMP leads to GLP-1-release, while mTOR primarily acts on the regulation of gene expression by promoting Gcg gene expression. These pathways do not clearly link to Piezo1 GLP-1 production. These mechanisms need to be reconciled.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for the point. The effect of Piezo1-mediated Ca2+ increase on GLP-1 production may be two-fold: promote Gcg gene expression through CaMKKβ/CaMKIV-mTOR and promote GLP-1 release by degranulation. Both gene expression and release are important to sustained GLP-1 production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Previous study PMID 32640190 (not cited here) found that Villin-driven Piezo1 knockout, which knocks out Piezo1 from all epithelial intestinal cells (including L-cells), showed no significant alterations in blood glucose or body weight. This is the opposite of the presented findings and therefore the current results require reconciliation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited PMID 32640190 in our revised manuscript. The lack of changes in blood glucose seen in <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice reported by Sugisawa et. al. is not surprising (Cell. 2020 Aug 6;182(3):609-624.e21.). Actually, in another recent study from our group, we found similar results when the _Villin-Piezo1-/_mice <italic>Piezo1fl/fl</italic> control mice were fed with normal chow diet. Since Villin-1 is expressed in all the epithelial cells of the gut, including enterocytes and various types of endocrine cells, the effect of L-cell Piezo1 loss may be masked by other cell types under normal condition. However, impaired glucose tolerance was seen in <italic>Villin-Piezo1-/-</italic> mice compared to the <italic>Piezo1fl/fl</italic> control mice after high fat diet for 8 weeks. We further found that Piezo1 in enterocytes exerted a negative effect on the glucose and lipid absorption. Loss of Piezo1 in enterocytes led to over-absorption of nutrients under high-fat diet (Tian Tao, Qing Shu, Yawen Zhao, Wenying Guo, Jinting Wang, Yuhao Shi, Shiqi Jia, Hening Zhai, Hui Chen, Cunchuan Wang, Geyang Xu, Mechanical regulation of lipid and sugar absorption by Piezo1 in enterocytes, Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, Accepted, 2024, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2024.04.016">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2024.04.016</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Your paper - while innovative in concept and interesting - has many flaws that in my opinion need to be corrected before the paper and pre-print should be published or uploaded as pre-print.
