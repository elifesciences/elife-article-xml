exhibit collective motion on a solid surface commonly known as swarming. As a natural example of active matter, swarming is also an essential biological phenotype associated with virulence, chemotaxis, and host pathogenesis. Physical changes like cell elongation and hyper-flagellation have been shown to accompany the swarming phenotype. Less studied, however, are the contrasts of collective motion between the swarming cells and their counterpart planktonic cells of comparable cell density. Here, we show that confining bacterial movement in circular microwells allows distinguishing bacterial swarming from collective swimming. On a soft agar plate, a novel bacterial strain <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SM3 in swarming and planktonic states exhibited different motion patterns when confined to circular microwells of a specific range of sizes. When the confinement diameter was between 40 μm and 90 μm, swarming SM3 formed a single-swirl motion pattern in the microwells whereas planktonic SM3 formed multiple swirls. Similar differential behavior is observed across several other species of gram-negative bacteria. We also observed ‘rafting behavior’ of swarming bacteria upon dilution. We hypothesize that the rafting behavior might account for the motion pattern difference. We were able to predict these experimental features via numerical simulations where swarming cells are modeled with stronger cell–cell alignment interaction. Our experimental design using PDMS microchip disk arrays enabled us to observe bacterial swarming on murine intestinal surface, suggesting a new method for characterizing bacterial swarming under complex environments, such as in polymicrobial niches, and for in vivo swarming exploration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Enterobacter sp.</italic> SM3</kwd><kwd>mucosal</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA222469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mani</surname><given-names>Sridhar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES030197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mani</surname><given-names>Sridhar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>For the same bacterial strain, the swarming phenotype can be biophysically discerned from swimming phenotype based on the motion pattern under circular confinement on a soft agar.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motility is an essential characteristic of bacteria. Although energy-consuming, it provides high returns, enabling cells to uptake nutrients efficiently and escape from noxious environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webre et al., 2003</xref>). In a host environment, bacterial motility is an essential phenotype that intimately relates to virulence through complex regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Josenhans and Suerbaum, 2002</xref>). Swimming and swarming are two common motility phenotypes mediated by flagella. Whereas the planktonic phenotype defines individual bacteria’s motility, a collective movement powered by rotating flagella on a partially solidified surface defines swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Partridge and Harshey, 2013</xref>). In swarming, bacteria utilize their flagella to navigate through a thin layer of medium and uptake necessary molecules to maintain homeostasis and overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnton et al., 2010</xref>). Morphological changes such as cell elongation and hyperflagellation may occur during swarming for some bacterial strains (e.g., <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morgenstein et al., 2010</xref>), but not others (e.g., <italic>Photorhabdus temperata)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michaels and Tisa, 2011</xref>). Although concentrated swimming bacteria are often called ‘a swarm of bacteria’ without adhering to precise identification of swarming motility, most microbiologists believe that swarming and swimming are fundamentally different motility types. For instance, studies show that compared with swimming cells, the requirement for flagella torque is higher for swarming <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hall et al., 2018</xref>); swarming <italic>E. coli</italic> remodel their chemotaxis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Partridge et al., 2019</xref>); and in swarming <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, both the production of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Overhage et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study has demonstrated a medically relevant distinction between swarming and swimming: a particular strain of swarming <italic>Enterobacter</italic> protects against mice intestinal inflammation while its swarm-deficient counterpart does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De et al., 2021</xref>). The evidence to date that shows swarming to be different from swimming comes mostly from biological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>). However, reliable characterization and quantitation of these differences are lacking. In this report, using <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SM3, which is a novel strain that possesses both swimming and swarming motilities, we show distinct biophysical characteristics between these two types of motility under confined, circular geometry in a particular confinement size range.</p><p>Studies have shown that geometric constraints have a profound influence on patterns of microswimmers’ collective motion. For example, these constraints may create mesoscopically or macroscopically coherent structures such as swirls and jets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Theillard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wioland et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wioland et al., 2016b</xref>). Circular confinement, in particular, could stabilize a suspension of motile bacteria into a spiral vortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beppu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lushi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishiguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wioland et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we compare the behaviors of bacteria in swarming and planktonic states under quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) circular confinement. This new technical approach may be taken to detect bacterial swarmers from a given clinical sample. Such a new method of detection might lead to diagnostic applications since there are established associations between bacterial swarming and virulence pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Overhage et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Swarming <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SM3 forms large single swirls</title><p>A novel bacterial strain <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SM3 (NCBI BioProject PRJNA558971), isolated in 2014 from mice with colitis induced with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), has been previously studied for motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araujo et al., 2019</xref>) and host phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De et al., 2021</xref>). SM3 expands rapidly on 0.5% agar with the collective motion of multilayers of cells at the edge. We mounted a PDMS chip containing circular microwells on agar surface. This technique allows us to observe bacterial motility for more than 3 hr (details with illustration in Materials and methods). Under confinement in circular wells in the diameter range of 31–90 μm, swarming SM3 cells form single swirls. In contrast, SM3 planktonic cells concentrated from the liquid medium form mesoscale vortices (multiple swirls) in the same size range, except for the smallest well diameter of 31 μm. A clear difference is shown at the well diameter of 74 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). This striking difference persists in several well depths, except that the concentrated cells yield small but non-zero vortex order parameters (VOPs, defined as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) in deeper wells, instead of nearly zero VOPs in shallow wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Swirls of <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp SM3 under circular confinement.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Motion patterns of concentrated planktonic (<bold>A</bold>) and swarming (<bold>B</bold>) SM3 in the PDMS microwells of 74 μm in diameter.

Video plays in real-time.</p></caption></media><p>The confinement diameter has a strong influence on the motion pattern in the wells. In smaller wells such as ones of 31 μm in diameter, even concentrated planktonic SM3 forms a single vortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas in larger wells, such as ones of 112 μm in diameter, swarming SM3 also breaks into mesoscale vortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The phase diagram shows a single swirl in small confinement for both phenotypes of SM3. As the confinement size increases, the VOP of planktonic SM3 drops as the motion pattern breaks into multiple vortices. The drop of VOP and occurrence of multiple vortices occur to swarming SM3 at much larger sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further compare the dynamics of the confined swarming and planktonic SM3, the spatial correlation of the velocity field was calculated for d = 90 μm (where the motion patterns differ for swarming and planktonic SM3) and for d = 500 μm (where both motilities show mesoscale vortices) (see Materials and methods). We computed the correlation function for an inscribed square within a well (e.g., a square of 60 μm × 60 μm for d = 90 μm confinement), which shows the extent to which the velocity at an arbitrary location correlated with the velocity at a distance of Δ<italic>r</italic> away from that location. In 90 μm wells, swarming SM3 velocity correlates positively or negatively throughout the whole well (negative values have resulted from the opposite sides of a single swirl). In contrast, the swimming velocity of planktonic cells of comparable concentration does not correlate once Δ<italic>r</italic> &gt; 25 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, in a large open space where both swarming and swimming SM3 break into small vortices, the correlation functions fall into similarly low values. The velocity correlation length as the curve first crosses <italic>C<sub>r</sub></italic>(Δ<italic>r</italic>)=0, which represents the size of the mesoscale vortices, is 23 μm and 28 μm for planktonic and swarming SM3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The effect of well diameter on confined <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp SM3 motility patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Motion pattern of concentrated planktonic SM3 confined in 31 μm (<bold>A</bold>) and swarming SM3 confined in 112 μm (<bold>B</bold>) diameter microwells.

First, we ruled out cell density difference as the reason for the difference in the confined motion patterns by concentrating planktonic cells to a comparable density of a naturally expanding swarm on agar (see Materials and methods) before mounting the PDMS chip. Second, we noticed that SM3 tends to get elongated when they swarm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that elongated bacteria may enhance the local alignment of the rod-shaped cells and increase the vortex size in mesoscale turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doostmohammadi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peruani et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, we treated SM3 planktonic cells with cephalexin (CEP) which has been shown to elongate <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamby et al., 2018</xref>). This treatment indeed caused the cell length of SM3 to reach that of swarming cells on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, we found no significant change in swimming speed or VOP when confined in comparably high cell density following the centrifugation and CEP treatment of the planktonic SM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Although CEP-treated planktonic SM3 has similar cell length, cell density, and cell speed as swarming SM3, we could not restore the single-swirl pattern in 74 μm confinement wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Third, noticing a surfactant rim on the swarming SM3 colony edge, we conjectured that surfactants secreted by swarming SM3 might help align the swarmers in confinement. As a prototypical surface wetting agent, surfactin was added in several concentrations to planktonic SM3 to test whether it could promote a single-swirl motion pattern. However, it did not establish a stable single-swirl pattern. Finally, we found that adding lyophilized swarming supernatant to swimming SM3 did not increase the VOP either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Factors that possibly influence the bacterial motion pattern in the well.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bacterial cell length of planktonic, swarming, and cephalexin (CEP) treated planktonic SM3, n = 500 for each group.

Initially, we tried to physically ‘disrupt’ the swarming colony by rubbing the swarming colony gently with a piece of PDMS offcut roughly 0.5 cm × 1 cm in size. This operation did not break the single-swirl pattern in the wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Then, 0.2% D-mannose was added to the swarming colony to de-cluster bacteria bundles due to cells’ sticking to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamby et al., 2018</xref>). However, this treatment could not alter the single-swirl pattern either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tried replacing the swarm fluid by diluting the swarming cells in Lysogenic Broth (LB) by 100-fold and then reconcentrated the cells in order to test if the single swirl pattern would still form. This was done by centrifuging at 1500 g for 10 min and then removing extra LB to recover the initial cell density. These ‘rinsed’ swarming SM3 cells were pipetted back on the agar plate. This process was expected to wash away some extracellular matrix polymers, including perhaps those weakly adhered on the bacterial surface but that would unbind upon dilution. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, this fluid replacement treatment did not alter the cell motility significantly. However, after this treatment, we observed multiple swirls under the confinement that previously produced single swirls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that these ‘rinsed’ cells behave much like planktonic cells. These results suggest that the single swirl pattern depends on extracellular materials removable by matrix dilution. These extracellular materials act to affect matrix rheology and, perhaps more directly, cell–cell interaction, causing changes in the swirl pattern.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Diluted swarming SM3 show unique dynamic clustering patterns</title><p>We suspected that specific interactions between the neighboring swarming cells were weakened or diminished upon dilution with the LB medium. A 50 μL water droplet was applied to the swarming and the concentrated planktonic SM3 colony edges to investigate intercellular interaction at a microscopic scale within the bacterial colony. In the diluted swarming colony, groups of cells formed bacterial rafts, a characteristic feature previously associated with gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Be'er and Ariel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>). Those cells within a polar cluster are moving in the same direction in a cohesive pack at the same speed (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In contrast, upon dilution of the concentrated planktonic SM3, the cells disperse uniformly, and their moving directions appear random (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Swarming SM3 cells tend to move together near the agar surface, while planktonic SM3 cells swim freely in the bulk fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We used the MATLAB PIV toolkit to track the moving bacteria in the image sequences of diluted swarming and planktonic SM3 for comparison. We found that swarming SM3 formed clusters with more than 20 cells on average, while we did not see such clusters of planktonic SM3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The lingering clusters of cells in the swarming phase upon dilution point to a more substantial cell–cell interaction than between planktonic cells.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution of swarming and swimming SM3 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Snapshots showing diluted swarming SM3 (<bold>A</bold>) and planktonic SM3 (<bold>B</bold>) on a soft agar surface, respectively.

The interactions among the moving particles (short-range repulsion, velocity alignment, and anti-alignment) are considered, all as functions of the particle–particle distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the particles’ swimming speed is fixed to 37 (μm/s), but the initial particle positions and initial moving directions are randomized. In the simulations, we interpret the rafting as due to a more substantial alignment among the swarmers, which is captured through a larger alignment interaction range (described in Materials and methods and in Appendix 2). This treatment results in longer correlation length of swarmer cells in the velocity auto-correlation plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>. This longer correlation length persists in all confinement sizes, even at the largest domain size of 500 μm, where the correlation length of swarmer cells is approximately 5 μm longer than planktonic cells, that is, ~28 μm vs. ~23 μm. This notable difference prompted us to differentiate swarmer and planktonic cells using two different alignment interaction ranges, i.e., 20 μm and 15 μm for swarmer and planktonic cells, respectively (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref> for a complete list of simulation parameters). The number of particles in our 2D simulations is calculated from the average number of cells found in microwells of different sizes. It was assumed based on the bulk cell density estimate that cells form pseudo two-dimensional layers of 4–5 μm thickness in each 22 μm deep cylindrical microwell (See Appendix 2 for detailed explanation).</p><p>We simulated the motion of confined swarmers and planktonic cells in different sizes of circular confinement similar to those in the experiments. By solely assigning an enhanced alignment interaction range for swarming cells, the simulation results mirror the experimental results. Both swarmers and planktonic cells start with a single-swirl pattern at the smallest disk size of 31 μm; as the confinement size increases to 38 μm, the planktonic cells break into a multi-swirl motion pattern, whereas the swarmers remain in single swirls until more than twice the disk diameter. At the confinement size of 90 μm, disks filled by swarmer cells transition into multi-swirls. At large enough size, multi-swirl patterns occur to samples of both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The velocity auto-correlation of simulation data for confinement sizes of 90 μm and 500 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>) shows quantitative agreements with corresponding experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Consistent with experiments, velocity correlation length of multi-swirl patterns formed by swarmer cells is a few microns larger than those in planktonic cells. We then performed the ‘dilution’ simulation for both states, finding that swarming cells form dynamic polar clusters at the cell densities smaller than the concentrated case in the confined system. In contrast, the planktonic cells form a ‘gas’ phase without clustering at all comparable densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). This result supports the experimental observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. In short, the simulation captured the motion pattern features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and predicted the experimental results in both confinement and dilution experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Numerical simulations of planktonic and swarming SM3 in confinement and open space.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) VOP of swarming and concentrated planktonic SM3 as a function of well diameter.

Unlike experiments on an agar surface, there are considerable technical challenges in dealing with uneven or more complex surfaces. The mouse intestinal tissue, for instance, is more than 1 mm thick and non-transparent. Since light cannot penetrate the tissue, observing bacteria directly on the inner surface through the tissue is not feasible. Staining or fluorescence labeling may alter the bacterial swarming motility (e.g., we found that SM3 becomes non-swarming once GFP labeled). If the bacterial cells are labeled biochemically, the fluorescence signal weakens when the cells reproduce. As an alternative strategy, using PDMS chips coated with fluorescent beads and then mounted on SM3 inoculated C57BL6 mouse intestine tissue, we detected swarming motility based on the ‘collective’ swirling motion of the beads (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>). This experiment on the mouse intestine tissue confirms that bacterial swarming indeed occurs on a physiologically relevant surface, much like on the commonly observed agar surface.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Motion of fluorescent beads in microwells mounted on murine tissues.</title><p>PDMS chips were coated with 0.5 μm fluorescent beads and mounted on SM3 inoculated colitic (<bold>A</bold>) or non-colitic (<bold>B</bold>) mice intestinal tissue surfaces.

(<bold>A</bold>) On colitic tissue, wells with VOP &gt; 0.7 were found and marked with yellow squares. In these wells, the single swirl motion pattern of the beads was powered by the confined swarming bacteria.

(<bold>B</bold>) On a normal tissue lacking swarming bacteria, the average velocity of the beads in the wells due to random motion was close to zero, giving rise to uniformly small VOP values.

SM3 in the size range of 40 μm ≤ d ≤ 90 μm. Compared with previous work, our experimental setup has the advantage of ensuring stable and sustainable patterns. First, PDMS material does not harm living bacteria cells and is permeable to oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Turner et al., 2010</xref>), thus ensuring continued oxygen exposure required for swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De et al., 2021</xref>). Second, we mounted the microchip on a soft agar containing over 97% water by mass, which automatically fills the wells via permeability and capillary flow. Finally, the LB agar also provides the necessary nutrients to fuel the bacterial growth and movement in the wells. Therefore, bacterial cells confined in the microwells remain motile for hours, much longer than in droplets surrounded by mineral oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wioland et al., 2013</xref>) or in microfluidic chambers with glass surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beppu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wioland et al., 2016a</xref>), where bacterial movement typically lasted no more than 10 min.</p><p>One interesting observation is that the rotation direction of the single swirls in our system is clockwise biased (85%). We interpret this bias of swirl direction as a consequence of flagellar handedness. When confined between the agar and PDMS surfaces, bacteria tend to swim closer to the porous agar surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiLuzio et al., 2005</xref>). For a bacterium swimming near the agar surface, there is a sideway component of drag force experienced by the rotating cell body. Similarly, there is a sideway component acting on the flagella bundle at the tail end of the cell in the opposite direction. These two sideway forces result in a net torque on the bacterium, causing it to make gradual right turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araujo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiLuzio et al., 2005</xref>). In our case, the agar surface is the bottom surface, and the bacteria tend to follow a clockwise curved trajectory near the bottom (when viewed from the top). This effect may persist in collective cell motion for the single swirls to appear as clockwise more often than counterclockwise. The effect in the concentrated swirls is notably weak, in view of the exceptions occurring in nearly 15% cases. The bias in handedness must be abrogated in cases of multiple swirls, or when another dynamic effect becomes dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Prior studies have proposed different models to explain the circularly confined motion of rod-shaped swimmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lushi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsang and Kanso, 2015</xref>). In our case, we adopt the Zonal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2015</xref>) in order to explain the motion pattern difference observed for confined swarming and planktonic SM3. Noticing that swarming SM3 washed in LB lost the single-swirl pattern, we hypothesize that other than cell length or cell speed, the strong cell–cell interaction may be a key factor responsible for the persistence of single swirls in the wells. The mechanism of the rafting phenomenon of swarming cells has not been fully deciphered yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>). It might be due to cohesive interaction among neighboring cells and/or hydrodynamic effects among 2D-confined peritrichous flagellated bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The cell–cell interaction may be attributable to biochemical changes of cell envelope during swarming (e.g., more long sidechain lipopolysaccharides) or secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armitage et al., 1979</xref>). Once these surrounding matrix or polymers are washed away by ~100-fold dilution, the cohesive interactions may diminish, resulting in a loss of dynamic clusters upon 100× dilution. After being concentrated back to comparable cell density and subjected to the same confinement, these rinsed swarming bacteria formed multi-swirl motion patterns as opposed to the more coherent single swirls. However, it is also possible that local viscosity drops dramatically in the environment of the swarmers after being washed. Then, the momenta of nearby cells could not be passed to each other as efficiently as previously, resulting in the absence of dynamic clusters and the loss of single-swirl motion pattern. Indeed, a recent publication shows that augmenting the viscoelasticity of dense swimming <italic>E. coli</italic> alone (by adding purified genomic DNA) can turn bacterial turbulence into a giant, single vortex in circular confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In multi-swirl patterns, we consistently observed that velocity correlation length of swarmer cells is a few microns longer than in planktonic cells in all sizes of confinement. We incorporate this observation in our simulation by assigning a larger alignment interaction range <italic>r<sub>a</sub></italic> for swarmer cells. We confirm that enhanced alignment is a key factor that differentiates swarmers from planktonic cells. The simulation results show that enhanced alignment in swarmer cells is not only responsible for delayed transition from a single swirl to multi-swirls in confinement with respect to confinement size, but it also reproduces dynamic polar clusters in the dilution experiment. Future work is called upon to explore the rafting phenomenon further, including in other species of bacteria, and to investigate whether or not there is a molecular basis for enhanced cell–cell alignment interaction among the swarming cells in rafts.</p><p>Our experiments on SM3 confirm the prediction made by Beppu et al. that a single vortex occurs when the confinement diameter d is smaller than a critical length <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beppu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, we found that the critical length for swarming SM3 is ~98 μm, whereas for concentrated planktonic SM3, it is ~34 μm. Interestingly, the same bacterial strain manifests different threshold sizes for the transition from single swirl to multiple swirls, corresponding to the two motility states. In particular, we were able to use this property to identify the motility types on mouse mucosal surfaces. The beads’ motion is not a perfect swirl in every well on the colitic tissue because the mucosal surface is not as smooth as the agar surface. There are sags and crests on the inflamed mucosal surface due to the disrupted mucin layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De et al., 2021</xref>). We conjectured that this unevenness hindered the swirl formation to a certain extent. Indeed, intact swirl patterns were spotted only on limited locations where the mucosal surface was relatively flat. Nevertheless, capturing only a few wells where beads showed single-swirl motion was sufficient to show that swarming occurred on a mucosal surface.</p><p>Evidence of genetic and epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daniels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morgenstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tremblay and Déziel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), as well as cell morphology changes (e.g., cell elongation and hyper-flagellation), indicates that swarming is a different phenotype from swimming. Lacking comparison under the same experimental conditions, bacterial swarming might be perceived as merely a dense group of cells swimming on a surface. Here, through geometry confinement, we show that <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp. SM3 swarming manifests different characteristics from swimming planktonic cells at comparably high concentration. Furthermore, we found that not only SM3, but several other species of gram-negative swarming bacteria have shown similar properties based on our limited additional experiments (see Appendix 1), which implies that strong alignment interaction among the swarmer cells might commonly exist in swarming bacteria.</p><p>The key experimental method of mounting PDMS micro-disk array on agar differentiates swarming motility from swimming motility at mesoscopic or even macroscopic scales, providing a visual assay to detect swarming behavior on agar and tissue surfaces. This study’s findings provide the rationale for developing applications such as isolating bacterial swarmers from a polymicrobial environment and developing diagnostics for the presence of in vivo swarming (e.g., detecting urinary or fecal swarming bacteria in catheter infections or intestinal inflammation, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arikawa and Nishikawa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lane et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, the sensitivity to confinement size indicates that a quantitative ranking system for different species of swarmers could be established based on the characteristic upper bound well size that stabilizes the confined motion pattern into a single swirl. Such a ranking system may prove useful in future investigations on the implications of swarming bacteria in host physiology and pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Enterobacter sp</italic>.

On the edge of the swarming colony, a chunk of swarming SM3 (~1 mm wide) was picked by an 8 mm-wide square spatulate containing a small chunk of agar at the bottom to ensure all the cells in that region were sampled. The 1 mm × 8 mm chunk of swarming SM3 was then mixed into 1 mL LB for CFU determination.

Particles of baby powder (~several micrometers in diameter) were spread on the surface of either swarm colony or agar in order to aid in the microscope focus. The thickness of the swarming colony was calculated based on the calibration of the fine adjustment knob tick readings. Then the cell density was estimated by CFU/mL. CFU was calculated for both swarming and swimming SM3 to ensure the densities of live cells in these two cases were comparable inside the wells.

After 9–12 days, when the average weight loss reached 20%, mice were euthanized using isoflurane anesthesia and large intestines were harvested. For controls, conventional 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice exposed to drinking water with DSS-vehicle added were also sacrificed and the intestines were collected. This study was approved by the Institute of Animal Studies at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Inc (IACUC # 20160706 and 00001172). Intestinal tissue was surgically exposed, cleansed with 35% (v/v) ethanol, and rinsed with PBS twice. The mucosal surface of the tissue was cultured (on agar streaks) for any residual bacteria and only used when there were no bacterial colonies on aerobic or anaerobic cultures. Prior to experiments, a portion of the mucosal tissue was also harvested after ethanol cleansing for histology and to validate its histologic integrity with respect to non-cleansed DSS-exposed tissue. Tissues were spread on a 1% agar plate with the inner side facing up, and overnight SM3 bacterial culture was inoculated on one end of the tissue. The agar plate was incubated under 37°C for 4.5 hr to allow SM3 bacteria to duplicate and move on the tissue surface. PDMS chips (d = 38 µm) were coated with 0.5 µm fluorescent beads (Dragon green; Bangs Laboratory, IN) and cut into strips to fit the tissue’s size. The PDMS strip was mounted on and covered the tissue surface. Bead motion was observed under the fluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX41) with a 20× objective.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Daniel B Kearns from Indiana University at Bloomington for providing the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3610 bacteria strain, and Cori Bargmann at Rockefeller University for gifting us the bacteria strain <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> Db10.

For well diameter d ≤ 90 μm, both swarming and swimming <italic>B. subtilis</italic> form single swirls while for well diameter d ≥ 112 μm, they both break into mesoscale vortices. <italic>B. subtilis</italic> is a gram-positive bacterium, whereas SM3, SM1, H6, H3, and Db10 are all gram-negative. We speculate that swarming <italic>B. subtilis</italic> does not have either as strong cell–cell interaction as SM3 and its gram-negative cohort we tested, or as significantly enriched extracellular matrix materials to sustain stronger cell–cell alignment in its swarm state as among its planktonic swimmers when concentrated to comparable concentration. Indeed, the interaction is not so different between the swarming and planktonic <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 3610 cells since we found the diluted swarming cells to disperse uniformly, and with no clustering behavior, much like diluted planktonic cells. The swarming colony thickness for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> also differs from the other strains. It is known that swarming <italic>B. subtilis</italic> produces abundant surfactant, resulting in a widespread, monolayer, non-compact colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Be'er and Ariel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeckel et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, swarming SM3 and the other tested bacteria all form multilayer colonies that are as thick as 20–40 μm at the edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). The thickness of SM3 swarm and that of its gram-negative cohort on agar enabled them to extend strong cell–cell alignment through the entire depth of PDMS wells of 22 μm depth and of disk diameters between 40 and 90 μm. In contrast, the cell–cell alignment is notably weaker among planktonic cells of comparable concentration.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><boxed-text><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Mathematical modeling and computer simulation</title><sec id="s9-1"><title>A simplified treatment of swarming bacteria</title><p>Most particle-based models for self-propelled microswimmers incorporate detailed hydrodynamics of elongated rods in a low Reynolds number environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lushi and Peskin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lushi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saintillan and Shelley, 2007</xref>). However, the dynamics of bacterial swarming comprise a complex interplay between several physical and chemical interactions that go beyond hydrodynamic and steric effects. Cell interactions with the extracellular polymeric network, mechanical locking and intertwining of flagella including formation of intercellular flagellar bundles between adjacent swimming cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Copeland and Weibel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kearns, 2010</xref>) are a few examples whose underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In the absence of a comprehensive model that captures many interactions among swarming bacteria, we seek a simplified description of active particles interacting via competing interactions that capture the essential dynamics of both swarming and planktonic bacteria. Our focused aim in connection with the experimental study in this report is to discern the distinct, collective behaviors of swarming bacteria from their planktonic, swimming counterpart, in comparable concentration, and under the same extent of spatial confinement.</p><p>There are numerous approaches for incorporating the relevant physical interactions between active particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wensink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wensink and Löwen, 2012</xref>) (readers are referred to Bär et al. for a recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar et al., 2020</xref>), for example, on models for dry and wet interacting self-propelled rods). Here, we choose the binary interaction model introduced by Großmann et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grossmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grossmann et al., 2015</xref>) based on the fact that hydrodynamic couplings among the swimmers can induce both alignment and anti-alignment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baskaran and Marchetti, 2009</xref>). The simplified model we employ also allows us to implicitly embed unknown interactions of cells with extracellular polymeric network and possibly, mechanical locking of flagella between adjacent cells in alignment, anti-alignment, and repulsion torque terms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>Numerical model and simulation</title><p>The dynamics of <italic>N</italic> interacting active particles have been modeled in a two-dimensional space using the overdamped Langevin-based equations, assuming that inertia is negligible in a low Reynolds number environment.

They found swarming bacteria exhibit a &quot;single-swirl&quot; motion pattern and concentrated planktonic bacteria exhibit &quot;multi-swirls&quot; motion pattern in the diameter range of 31-90 μm. The phase diagram shows that in smaller wells concentrated planktonic SM3 forms a single vortex and in larger wells swarming SM3 also breaks into mesoscale vortices.</p><p>In addition, they conducted systematic experiments to explore parameters defining the divergence of motion patterns in confinement including cell density, cell length, cell speed and surfactant. They concluded that the single-swirl pattern depends on cohesive cell-cell interaction mediated by biochemical factors removable through matrix dilution.</p><p>This paper gives a new method to discern swarmers from planktonic bacteria and carefully studies the factors that influence the formation of bacterial vortices under restriction.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While generally supportive of the paper, the reviewers found that major revisions are necessary to clarify aspects of the experiments and the connection between experimental findings and numerical simulations, the modeling approach and the interpretation of numerical results.</p><p>1. When the authors put the PDMS chip mounting on the edge of the swarming colony, the PDMS chip is completely attached to agar or suspended in a bacterial solution. The distance between PDMS chip and agar surface should be quantified. It is better to have a schematic diagram of the experimental device.</p><p>2. Are the bacteria still expanding outward after a PDMS chip was mounted on agar surface? The effect of PDMS chips on the expansion of bacteria on the agar surface needs to be discussed.</p><p>3. &quot;Diluted swarming SM3 show unique dynamic clustering patterns&quot;. In the diluted bacteria experiment, the authors found that the diluted swarming bacteria can form bacterial rafts and the concentrated planktonic SM3 disperse uniformly and move randomly. Hence, when bacteria expand and gradually fill up new empty microwells, is there a process of transition from raft to single vortex state?</p><p>4. In the experiment of altering the conditions of swarming SM3, the authors diluted the swarming cells in Lysogenic Broth (LB) by 20-fold, re-concentrated the cells by centrifugation and removed extra LB to recover the initial cell density. After these operations, they found the previous single swirl turned to multiple swirls and concluded that matrix dilution can affect single-swirl pattern. The authors conjecture that centrifugation may wash away some surrounding matrix or polymers on the surface of bacteria. Therefore, the steps of centrifugation need to be presented and the effect of centrifugation on the physiological behavior of bacteria should be discussed.</p><p>5. This work covers the PDMS chip directly on the agar surface and finds that swarm and planktonic bacteria have different spatial correlation scales in the restricted microwells. The authors have done many experiments to prove the difference between clusters and planktonic bacteria and explain the reason for the single vortex. However, the conclusion is not clear. Therefore, the authors should focus more on the analysis of this new experimental phenomenon, such as critical length and vortex phase diagram, rather than just describing the experiments they did.</p><p>6. The authors mentioned the critical length for swarming SM3 is ~49 μm, whereas, for concentrated planktonic SM3, it is ~ 17 μm. Does this quoted data match that which they obtain from their experimental method? I do not see any follow-up discussion and evidence.</p><p>7. As shown in Figure 1 and Video S1 mp4, the direction of the single vortex motion of bacteria is clockwise. However, the article simply ignores that the single vortexes of bacteria all present the same direction, and there is no analysis and reasonable explanation on the vortex direction. As shown in Video S5 mp4 on the numerical simulations of circularly confined SM3, simulated bacteria vortex counterclockwise in completely opposite directions. The influence of the microwell boundary on the direction of the vortex should be clearly explained at the level of bacterial movement and preferentially with a numerical simulation.</p><p>8. Swarming and concentrated planktonic <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3610 show the same motion pattern across different confinement sizes. However, the authors did not give definitive conclusions and evidence. As shown in Figure S1, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3610 show completely different cluster behavior. Therefore, the discussion of 3601WT may cause readers' confusion on the article. It may be better to put it in the supporting material.</p><p>9. A central finding of the present study is that the number of vortices/swirls as a function of the well diameter differs for swarming vs. swimming bacteria. The authors argue and show experimentally (Figure 2) that the behavior is identical for small and large diameters. For intermediate values, however, they report that a single swirl is observed for swarming bacteria whereas swimming bacteria show multiple swirls.</p><p>The fact that the behavior is identical for large wells suggests that the bulk behavior is identical. This is also confirmed by Figure 2E which shows that the spatial correlation function of the velocity is identical in large wells. That suggests that the boundary conditions play a central role in understanding how the observed phenomenology emerges. [Indeed, it was shown in the past that the interaction of bacteria with boundaries crucially determines the formation of swirls in confinement (Lushi, Wieland and Goldstein PNAS 111 9733 2014). The authors of this work assume reflecting boundary conditions, which – to my knowledge – contradicts the finding of Lushi et al.].</p><p>The authors, however, explain the difference of the observed patterns within their modeling study in a different way, namely by a different strength of the (anti-)alignment interactions. Changing the interaction at the level of individual cells will, however, change the bulk behavior too. Accordingly, the numerically observed bulk behavior (Figure 5B ) is very different in both cases (at a qualitative level). It is difficult to judge the difference in detail because the correlation function was not calculated for the simulations.</p><p>In short:</p><p>– The model (Figure 5A) reproduces the experimental results partially (Figure 2C), but the modeling analogue to Figure 2E is missing;</p><p>– The line of arguments seems not to be entirely consistent.</p><p>10. Inferring the interactions of active particles from observations of the emergent patterns is a highly non-trivial task. In view of this the reviewers are not entirely convinced by the arguments put forward by the authors that &quot;more substantial cell-cell cohesive interaction(s)&quot; are the reason why the swirling patterns formed by swarming/swimming bacteria differ.</p><p>In this context, we call attention to Ref. [Peruani, Deutsch and Bär: Phys. Rev. E 74 030904(R) 2006]. In this work, a clustering transition of self-propelled rods was described. &quot;Rafts&quot;, referred to as clusters by Peruani et al., are observed as the aspect ratio of rods is increased. Notably, a kinetic transition towards clustering can emerge even in the absence of any attractive interactions.</p><p>In short, the observation that cells move in parallel (polar clusters) next to each other does not allow to conclude that cohesive interactions are present.</p><p>The Videos S3 and S4 provided by the authors show that the particle shape of swarming and swimming particles is clearly different. In particular, the elongated swarming bacteria show pronounced clusters (Video S3) whereas the shorter planktonic cells (Video S4) do not. The difference in aspect ratio does indeed suggest that swarming and swimming bacteria differ in their alignment interaction. However, this contradicts the observation that spatial correlations in large wells are indistinguishable (see comment 1 and Figure 2E).</p><p>Side remark: in the main text, the authors argue that changes of the aspect ratio are not the reason for an increased alignment interaction, however, in the Discussion section cell morphology changes (e.g. cell elongation and hyper-flagellation) are mentioned as an indicator that swarming is a different phenotype from swimming.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64176.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While generally supportive of the paper, the reviewers found that major revisions are necessary to clarify aspects of the experiments and the connection between experimental findings and numerical simulations, the modeling approach and the interpretation of numerical results.</p><p>1.

When the PDMS chip was mounted on the swarm edge, an area of the microwells initially did not have bacteria in contact. It was above the agar surface directly. These empty microwells were up with water due to capillary effect within minutes. The swarm front continually expanded and entered new microwells. We repeated the experiments and observed the filling process in search of rafts the reviewer was wondering about. Initially, only a few cells entered the empty microwell and they dispersed rapidly. As more swarmers came in, some of them tended to swim along the circular boundary of the microwell and others swam freely in the bulk. When the cell density kept increasing, collective motion showed up (initially as 2-3 unstable vortices). Finally, the dense swarmers stabilized into a single-swirl motion pattern. The whole process took place in a few minutes. We conjecture that rafts do not form in the microwell but only in open space maybe because the confinement diameter is comparable to the size of the raft and the circular boundary forces the bacteria to form transient vortices instead of rafts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Therefore, the authors should focus more on the analysis of this new experimental phenomenon, such as critical length and vortex phase diagram, rather than just describing the experiments they did.</p></disp-quote><p>Taking other valuable comments by both reviewers into consideration, We have made substantial changes in the results and discussion part to quantify the experimental phenomenon. Specifically, we discussed that swarming SM3 have a larger characteristic length than the planktonic cells which is an important distinction between patterns formed by these two cell types. This new insight helped us revise the numerical simulation and confirm that the alignment range holds the key for the larger critical length of swarming SM3 and a delayed transition to a multi-swirl motion pattern in the vortex phase diagram. In addition, we also provided a mechanistic explanation on the emergence of the biased chirality of the single swirl motion pattern in confinement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors mentioned the critical length for swarming SM3 is ~ 49 μm, whereas, for concentrated planktonic SM3, it is ~ 17 μm. Does this quoted data match that which they obtain from their experimental method? I do not see any follow-up discussion and evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. The critical size of single swirl to multi-swirl transition for SM3 were obtained from the experiments. According to Figure 2C, the critical diameters were determined as the VOP data plot in the experimental phase diagram crosses the dotted line “VOP = 0.7” (Figure 2C). For swarming SM3, it is ~ 98 μm, whereas for planktonic SM3, it is ~ 34 μm. We initially quoted radius rather than diameter in the manuscript. Now, it has been corrected to diameter so that readers are clearer when we refer those obtained from experiments (see Line 283 – 285).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. As shown in Figure 1 and Video S1 mp4, the direction of the single vortex motion of bacteria is clockwise. However, the article simply ignores that the single vortexes of bacteria all present the same direction, and there is no analysis and reasonable explanation on the vortex direction. As shown in Video S5 mp4 on the numerical simulations of circularly confined SM3, simulated bacteria vortex counterclockwise in completely opposite directions. The influence of the microwell boundary on the direction of the vortex should be clearly explained at the level of bacterial movement and preferentially with a numerical simulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation directions were seen for the single vortexes of SM3. However, it is in favor of clockwise direction. In one experiment, we counted the number of single swirls with either direction. In a total of 99 single swirls, 85 of them were clockwise and 14 of them were counterclockwise. We interpret this bias of swirl direction as a consequence of flagellar handedness based on our experience from previous studies, including a recent work on the same bacterium (Araujo, Chen, Mani, and Tang, 2019). When confined between the agar and PDMS surfaces, bacteria tend to swim closer to the porous agar surface (DiLuzio et al., 2005). For bacteria swimming near the agar surface, the rotating cell body experiences a drag force opposite to the rotating direction, which results in torque on the bacteria to turn right (Araujo et al., 2019; DiLuzio et al., 2005). In our case, the agar surface is the bottom surface, and the bacteria tend to have a clockwise curved trajectory which breaks the symmetry of the global motion pattern to in favor of clockwise swirl (look from the top). This symmetry breaking may not occur if we replace the agar surface with a glass surface or confine bacteria within two glass slides because in that case the effects of the upper and lower surface will cancel out. A brief discussion has been added to the manuscript as a separate paragraph (Line 236 – 249). In simulations, however, clockwise and counter-clockwise vortexed occur with equal probability. Our simulation effort mainly focuses on investigating the key factors leading to a VOP difference and the corresponding velocity auto-correlations, not the swirl direction, thus we did not incorporate the known effect that would bias the swirl rotating direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Swarming and concentrated planktonic <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3610 show the same motion pattern across different confinement sizes. However, the authors did not give definitive conclusions and evidence. As shown in Figure S1, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> 3610 show completely different cluster behavior.

We agree that the discussion of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in contrast with other species of bacteria in the main manuscript may be distracting and confusing. Now, we have moved the part of reporting similar findings of other bacteria and pertinent discussion into the Appendix 1. Presenting data exclusively on SM3 in the main manuscript indeed makes the paper more focused.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. A central finding of the present study is that the number of vortices/swirls as a function of the well diameter differs for swarming vs. swimming bacteria. The authors argue and show experimentally (Figure 2) that the behavior is identical for small and large diameters. For intermediate values, however, they report that a single swirl is observed for swarming bacteria whereas swimming bacteria show multiple swirls.</p><p>The fact that the behavior is identical for large wells suggests that the bulk behavior is identical. This is also confirmed by Figure 2E which shows that the spatial correlation function of the velocity is identical in large wells. That suggests that the boundary conditions play a central role in understanding how the observed phenomenology emerges. [Indeed, it was shown in the past that the interaction of bacteria with boundaries crucially determines the formation of swirls in confinement (Lushi, Wieland and Goldstein PNAS 111 9733 2014). The authors of this work assume reflecting boundary conditions, which – to my knowledge – contradicts the finding of Lushi et al.].</p><p>The authors, however, explain the difference of the observed patterns within their modeling study in a different way, namely by a different strength of the (anti-)alignment interactions. Changing the interaction at the level of individual cells will, however, change the bulk behavior too. Accordingly, the numerically observed bulk behavior (Figure 5B ) is very different in both cases (at a qualitative level). It is difficult to judge the difference in detail because the correlation function was not calculated for the simulations.</p><p>In short:</p><p>– The model (Figure 5A) reproduces the experimental results partially (Figure 2C), but the modeling analogue to Figure 2E is missing;</p><p>– The line of arguments seems not to be entirely consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that sufficiently quantitative comparison between simulation and experiment was lacking in our initial submission. Toward this end, we identified the correlation lengths L<sub>Cv</sub> from the experimental velocity auto-correlation plots (Figure 2D-E), defined as the point where the velocity correlation (Cv) curve crosses the zero line. It turns out that the correlation length of Cv for swarmer cells is a few microns longer than in planktonic case. This discrepancy persists in all confinement sizes, even at the largest domain size of 500 μm, where L<sub>Cv</sub> of swarmer cells is ~ 5μm longer than planktonic cells, i.e., ~ 28 μm vs. ~ 23 μm. Guided by this insight and informed by the observation of polar clusters of swarmer cells in dilution experiments, we expanded the simulation work using a new set of simulation parameters (Appendix table 1). We differentiate swarmer cells from planktonic ones by assigning a larger alignment interaction range r<sub>a</sub> (as defined in Appendix figure 2). The rationale is that stronger interaction between swarmer cells manifests itself as enhanced alignment interaction. The underlying origin for the enhancement of alignment interaction in swarmer cells can be sought in, for example, micro-rheology experiments of the extracellular polymeric network surrounding the swarming bacteria. Such experimental work may be challenging. Nonetheless, the simulation results based on this new set of parameters not only capture the transitional behavior in the experimental VOP diagram, but also provide quantitative agreement between velocity auto-correlation of simulations (new Figure 5B-C) and experiments (Figure 2D-E). Furthermore, it successfully predicts dynamic polar clusters of swarmer cells in dilution experiments (new Figure 5D-E).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the type of boundary condition determines the formation of swirls in confined systems. Through using a different set of parameters while keeping reflective boundary condition, we found that the present simulation model can reproduce counter-rotating vortices under circular confinement. Therefore, reflective boundary condition per se does not disrupt the formation of counter-rotating swirls in our simulations. However, our extensive PIV analysis does not reveal counter-rotating swirls as those reported in Lushi, Wioland and Goldstein PNAS 111 9733 (2014). Therefore, while we have acknowledged the experimental and simulation results of Lushi et al., we use reflective boundary condition and have focused in this report on the aspect of bacterial collective motion that is caused by differences in alignment interaction range between swarming and planktonic SM3 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Inferring the interactions of active particles from observations of the emergent patterns is a highly non-trivial task. In view of this the reviewers are not entirely convinced by the arguments put forward by the authors that &quot;more substantial cell-cell cohesive interaction(s)&quot; are the reason why the swirling patterns formed by swarming/swimming bacteria differ.</p><p>In this context, we call attention to Ref. [Peruani, Deutsch and Bär: Phys. Rev. E 74 030904(R) 2006]. In this work, a clustering transition of self-propelled rods was described. &quot;Rafts&quot;, referred to as clusters by Peruani et al., are observed as the aspect ratio of rods is increased. Notably, a kinetic transition towards clustering can emerge even in the absence of any attractive interactions.</p><p>In short, the observation that cells move in parallel (polar clusters) next to each other does not allow to conclude that cohesive interactions are present.</p><p>The Videos S3 and S4 provided by the authors show that the particle shape of swarming and swimming particles is clearly different. In particular, the elongated swarming bacteria show pronounced clusters (Video S3) whereas the shorter planktonic cells (Video S4) do not. The difference in aspect ratio does indeed suggest that swarming and swimming bacteria differ in their alignment interaction. However, this contradicts the observation that spatial correlations in large wells are indistinguishable (see comment 1 and Figure 2E).</p></disp-quote><p>The criticism here is profound and insightful. After reading the suggested ref and thinking over the reviewer suggestion, we agree that the formation of the “rafts” does not allow us to conclude that cohesive interactions are present. Thus, we revised the manuscript where we made cohesive interaction statements before and only refer to the interaction as alignment among the swarmers now. In the videos, we agree that planktonic cells appear shorter, and we actually measured their length in Figure 3A. However, we found that CEP treated planktonic cells (Figure 3B-C) and rinsed swarmer cells both with the same average cell length as natural swarmers did not form dynamic clusters at comparable cell density and could not form large single swirls like natural swarmers. Based on these results, we exclude the cell length to be the dominant factor in strengthening the alignment among the swarmers. We also acknowledge that, as a secondary effect, the cell length change may influence the size of the confinement that planktonic SM3 can hold a single swirl within.</p><p>On the other hand, we think one possible reason for the alignment decrease of the washed swarmer cells is that after washing, polymers are diluted and the viscosity decreases dramatically in the culture environment of the swarmers, then the momentum of the cells could not be passed as efficiently as previously, resulting in the loss of dynamic clusters and single swirl motion pattern. A recent publication shows that changing the viscoelasticity (by adding purified genomic DNA) of dense swimming <italic>E. coli</italic> alone can turn multi-swirl motion pattern into single swirl motion pattern (Liu, Shankar, Marchetti, and Wu, 2021). We have added reference to this latest report, as it provides a dramatic case consistent with our findings and our own thoughts on matrix viscoelasticity affecting swarm patterns.</p><p>Indeed, the spatial correlation in large wells is not totally indistinguishable but shows certain distinction (for swarmers r = 28 um, planktonic cells r = 23 um) and we revised the numerical simulation showing that the difference in alignment interaction range of this magnitude indeed leads to the global motion pattern differences in confinement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Side remark: in the main text, the authors argue that changes of the aspect ratio are not the reason for an increased alignment interaction, however, in the Discussion section cell morphology changes (e.g. cell elongation and hyper-flagellation) are mentioned as an indicator that swarming is a different phenotype from swimming.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell morphology is another aspect of comparison between swarming and swimming phenotypes. The correlation may not necessarily hold, however, between increased alignment and the increase in cell length. Also, these two features are not necessarily to happen simultaneously.</p></body></sub-article></article>
