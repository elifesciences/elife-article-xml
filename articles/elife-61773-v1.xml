However, kinetochores initially bind to microtubules indiscriminately, resulting in errors that must be corrected. While the Aurora B protein kinase destabilizes low-tension attachments by phosphorylating kinetochores, low-tension attachments are intrinsically less stable than those under higher tension in vitro independent of Aurora activity. Intrinsic tension-sensitive behavior requires the microtubule regulator Stu2 (budding yeast Dis1/XMAP215 ortholog), which we demonstrate here is likely a conserved function for the TOG protein family. The human TOG protein, chTOG, localizes to kinetochores independent of microtubules by interacting with Hec1. We identify a chTOG mutant that regulates microtubule dynamics but accumulates erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are not destabilized by Aurora B. Thus, TOG proteins confer a unique, intrinsic error correction activity to kinetochores that ensures accurate chromosome segregation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>chTOG</kwd><kwd>error correction</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>Aurora B</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biggins</surname><given-names>Sue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM064386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biggins</surname><given-names>Sue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Matthew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The conserved chTOG protein is required to destabilize incorrect kinetochore-microtubule attachments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cell division requires the duplication and accurate segregation of up to hundreds of chromosomes. In most species, chromosome segregation is carried out by a conserved network of dozens of kinetochore factors that assemble into a megadalton protein complex on centromeres to link chromosomes and dynamic microtubule polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hara and Fukagawa, 2018</xref>). During mitosis, the microtubule cytoskeleton is organized into a bipolar spindle such that each and every pair of duplicated sister chromosomes becomes bioriented (attached to microtubules anchored to opposite spindle poles). In this state, coordinated depolymerization of all kinetochore-bound microtubules results in the accurate segregation of every chromosome. However, the biorientation process is error-prone, as early in mitosis both the mitotic spindle and the chromosomes lack organization, yet kinetochores begin forming attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cimini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapoor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maiato et al., 2017</xref>). While some kinetochore pairs become properly bioriented, others attach to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole and must be destabilized. It is well appreciated that tension generated by depolymerizing microtubules pulling across a pair of bioriented kinetochores is a key signal that attachments should be stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King and Nicklas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salmon and Bloom, 2017</xref>). This biochemical error correction system is primarily known to be regulated via the Aurora B protein kinase and its downstream targets, which specifically <italic>destabilize</italic> low-tension kinetochore-microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biggins and Murray, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). However, we recently demonstrated that the protein Stu2 (yeast member of the Dis1/XMAP215 family) confers tension-sensitive binding behaviors to reconstituted yeast kinetochore-microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, this intrinsic tension-dependent activity functioned completely independent of Aurora B activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that cells have multiple mechanisms to destabilize incorrect attachments.</p><p>Stu2 and the entire Dis1/XMAP215 family are well-characterized microtubule regulators that contribute to the nucleation, polymerization, and organization of the cytoskeleton and spindle in both developing and somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gard and Kirschner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kosco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milunovic-Jevtic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roostalu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shirasu-Hiza et al., 2003</xref>). This protein family is thought to accomplish these diverse forms of microtubule regulation through two regulatory regions. First, these proteins contain an array of 2–5 TOG domains that are each capable of binding an α/β tubulin dimer. Second, an unstructured ‘basic patch’ enriched for Lysine and Arginine residues appears to contribute to a non-specific electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>). In vitro, these two regulatory regions catalyze the nucleation and elongation of microtubule polymers. However, Stu2's ability to confer tension-dependent binding behavior to reconstituted yeast kinetochore-microtubule attachments appears to be independent of its role in regulating microtubules, as all measures of dynamicity remained unchanged when Stu2 was absent from reconstitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Thus far, reconstitution experiments have been the only means to specifically study Stu2/XMAP215 regulation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments as in vivo depletion studies result in dominant defects in mitotic spindle organization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kosco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). We recently described a Stu2 mutant that supported spindle formation in yeast cells, but not biorientation, which provided in vivo evidence that Stu2 functions as an error correction factor independent of its role organizing the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). However, this mutant does not function as a microtubule polymerase in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility that these two activities are connected in cells.</p><p>Similarly, depletion of the human ortholog, chTOG (TOG/TOGp/CKAP5), results predominantly in multipolar spindle assembly defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassimeris and Morabito, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>). Chromosome biorientation is possible with partial depletion, and these kinetochores exhibit dampened oscillations and decreased inter-kinetochore tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr and Gergely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cassimeris et al., 2009</xref>). Although these data suggest chTOG regulates kinetochore-microtubule attachments, it is not clear if this role is related to regulating microtubule dynamics. Separation of these activities in human cells has also been limited by the ability to express mutant chTOG proteins. These large proteins (225 kDa) are inefficient to transduce through chemical and viral means, and negatively affect proliferation when overexpressed. Therefore, it has been assumed that TOG proteins regulate kinetochore-microtubule attachments via secondary effects on microtubule polymerization rates and it has been unclear if this protein family has a direct function in mitotic error correction in multicellular eukaryotes.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that the Stu2-dependent error correction process observed in budding yeast is a conserved process in human cells. Similar to the yeast proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2016</xref>), we found that chTOG associates with and requires the conserved microtubule binding factor Hec1 for kinetochore localization. Additionally, we show that a pair of point mutations in chTOG’s ‘basic linker’ domain inhibits error correction activity but does not compromise its ability to regulate the microtubule cytoskeleton. Together, this work reveals that chTOG functions in an evolutionarily conserved manner to destabilize erroneous, low-tension attachments. Moreover, we find that Aurora B phosphoregulation of its key kinetochore substrate, Hec1/Ndc80, cannot compensate for loss of chTOG-mediated error correction. Our work further elucidates a largely uncharacterized, intrinsic mechanism by which kinetochores sense and respond to biomolecular forces in order to prevent errors in chromosome segregation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A pool of chTOG resides at kinetochores, independent of microtubule plus ends</title><p>Previous microscopy studies suggested that chTOG localizes to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutiérrez-Caballero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan et al., 2020</xref>), similar to the budding yeast ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>); however, it was unclear if this population was simply bound to microtubule tips. To address this, we used engineered HCT116 cells where the endogenous chTOG genes were epitope tagged with EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherry et al., 2019</xref>) to determine whether chTOG specifically localizes to kinetochores throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We found that chTOG is largely excluded from the nucleus until prometaphase, when it appeared on kinetochores as assayed by co-localization with anti-centromere antibody (ACA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As cells progress through mitosis, its kinetochore localization increased 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). To determine what fraction of this signal is specifically interacting with kinetochores and not microtubule tips, we treated cells with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules. At least 60% of chTOG recruited to prometaphase kinetochores and 30% recruited to anaphase kinetochores is independent of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). This trend was also observed in HeLa cells overexpressing exogenous chTOG-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To determine whether microtubule attachment delivers chTOG to kinetochores, we arrested cells in S phase with thymidine and released them into the cell cycle in the presence of nocodazole so that kinetochore-microtubule attachments never occurred. In this experiment, chTOG was still detected on kinetochores, consistent with a kinetochore-bound pool that is separate from microtubule tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). chTOG and its budding yeast ortholog, Stu2, physically interact with the Ndc80 kinetochore complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zahm et al., 2020</xref>). To test whether they associate in human cells, we immunopurified FLAG-tagged chTOG from HEK-293T cells under conditions refractory to microtubule formation and found that the endogenous Hec1 protein co-purifies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We therefore tested whether the kinetochore-bound pool of chTOG depends on Hec1 by depleting Hec1 from cells and quantifying the chTOG-EGFP intensity proximal to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–e</xref>). We observed a 70% reduction in chTOG-EGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). However, because Hec1 depletion ablates kinetochore-MT attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>), this result was again confounded by chTOG’s localization to both kinetochores and microtubule tips. Thus, we performed the same experiment in the presence of nocodazole to separate the two chTOG populations, and again observed a 70% reduction in chTOG-EGFP signal at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). We confirmed that total protein levels of chTOG were unaffected by Hec1 siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). These data are consistent with the Ndc80 complex serving as the primary receptor for chTOG. Therefore, a pool of chTOG localizes to kinetochores in a Hec1-dependent manner that is distinct from the chTOG at the microtubule plus-ends, suggesting a function for chTOG on kinetochores.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>chTOG localizes to kinetochores during mitosis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunofluorescence images of chTOG subcellular localization during mitosis, as visualized in HCT116 cells expressing endogenously epitope-tagged chTOG-EGFP.

However, chTOG is an extremely large, multidomain protein consisting of 2032 residues, making it difficult to identify a separation of function mutant. It regulates microtubule dynamics using an array of five TOG domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charrasse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charrasse et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spittle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Additionally, chTOG contains a flexible ‘basic linker’ region that in vitro experiments suggest provides a non-specific, electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged microtubule lattice to facilitate diffusion to the plus-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, there is a small domain within the C-terminus of chTOG that serves as a protein interaction hub to mediate its various intracellular localization patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutiérrez-Caballero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van der Vaart et al., 2011</xref>). All these protein elements are present in the budding yeast ortholog Stu2, which contains just two TOG domains but homodimerizes through a coiled-coil (CC) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We therefore took advantage of yeast genetic tools to identify mutants that potentially inactivate its kinetochore function. Previous cross-linking mass-spectrometry with yeast proteins revealed that both the Stu2 basic linker and C-terminus interact with the Ndc80 complex, but only the C-terminus was required for kinetochore association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zahm et al., 2020</xref>).

To understand the role of this previously unidentified conserved patch, we ectopically expressed various <italic>stu2</italic> mutants under their native promoter in a strain where the endogenous allele was fused to an auxin-inducible degron (<italic>stu2-AID</italic>). With serial dilution growth assays, we analyzed the viability of the various mutant cells in the presence of auxin, which degrades the endogenous Stu2-AID protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). These complementation studies confirmed that the basic linker is essential (<italic>stu2<sup>∆BL</sup></italic>) and further demonstrated that the conserved patch is also required for budding yeast viability (<italic>stu2<sup>∆Patch</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, this patch (flanked by small flexible peptides) was sufficient to replace the entire 98 residue basic linker (<italic>stu2<sup>∆BL+Patch</sup></italic>), despite a 75% reduction in total length and an 83% reduction in positive residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To determine if this patch is conserved from yeast to primates, we aligned the basic linkers among commonly studied Ophistokonts and found the sequence of this patch was poorly conserved outside Ascomycota and appeared to be centered on a pair of basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We tested if the region identified in the human protein was functionally orthologous to the conserved patch in Ascomycota by generating chimeric Stu2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). To start, we replaced the yeast basic linker with the orthologous human sequence (<italic>stu2<sup>hBL</sup></italic>) and found it partially complemented the loss of endogenous Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). This partial rescue could be attributed to the non-specific positive charge of this region as has been previously suggested, or to the presence of a conserved sequence motif. We therefore tested whether the 14 amino acids from chTOG that aligned to the Stu2 conserved patch were sufficient for the partial rescue of yeast cell viability (<italic>Stu2<sup>hPatch</sup></italic>). Cells expressing this chimeric protein (<italic>stu2<sup>hPatch</sup></italic>) were as proliferative as those containing the entire basic linker from the human protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), suggesting sequence elements in this small region are more important than the overall net charge of the basic linker. To further test the role of net positive charge, we replaced the yeast basic linker with the sequence between TOG2 and TOG3 in chTOG (<italic>Stu2<sup>h2-3 Linker</sup></italic>). This region and the basic linker between TOG4 and TOG5 have similar lengths, propensities for disorder, and isoelectric points, yet this chimera did not rescue yeast viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the region we identified in the basic linker of chTOG is orthologous to the one we found in yeast Stu2.</p><p>Our discovery that a 15 amino acid conserved patch is sufficient for viability strongly suggested that the sequence of the region is more important than overall charge. We found a pair of basic residues in this region in both the yeast and human proteins, so we tested their function. We mutated Stu2 K598 and R599 to alanine as a pair (<italic>stu2<sup>KR/AA</sup></italic>) or separately and found that despite normal mutant protein levels (data not shown), the loss of either residue was lethal to yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). These data show that two conserved residues, rather than the net charge of the basic linker, are essential for cell viability. While the in vitro microtubule polymerase activity is regulated by net charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>), our data suggest that in vivo there is a different essential role for the basic linker that is mediated by a small patch in this region.</p><p>We set out to determine whether these conserved residues are required for chTOG function in human cells. Past studies of chTOG have primarily focused on its binding partners or RNAi depletion phenotypes due to its large size and multiple cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutiérrez-Caballero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hood et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the constitutive overexpression of chTOG is toxic, making it difficult to study in mammalian cells. To overcome these technical challenges, we generated HeLa cell lines that harbor doxycycline-inducible, siRNA-resistant alleles of chTOG-EGFP (chTOG<sup>WT</sup>) or chTOG[K1142, 1143A]-EGFP (chTOG<sup>KK/AA</sup> or basic pair mutant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Gorman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>).

Expression of the WT chTOG protein restored viability, indicating that there were no major off-target siRNA effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, the chTOG basic pair mutant was not able to support cell proliferation after depletion of endogenous chTOG, despite expressing similarly to WT chTOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The failure to proliferate after chTOG depletion was previously shown to arise from a mitotic delay and resulting chromosome segregation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassimeris and Morabito, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>). To determine if chTOG<sup>KK/AA</sup> induced similar defects, we stained DNA and determined both the mitotic index and incidence of chromosome segregation errors. After chTOG depletion, we observed a fourfold increase in mitotic cells (20% of the population) as expected, which was significantly reduced when chTOG<sup>WT</sup> was expressed, but not when chTOG<sup>KK/AA</sup> was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The mitotic delays observed in chTOG-depleted and chTOG<sup>KK/AA</sup>-expressing cells were dependent on Mps1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that they are the result of erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments that appropriately trigger the spindle assembly checkpoint. Consistent with this interpretation, the populations enriched for mitotic cells also displayed an increased incidence of chromosome segregation errors like anaphase bridges and micro or multiple nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). These data suggest that chTOG depletion or mutation leads to defects in kinetochore-microtubule attachments that trigger the spindle assembly checkpoint, yet cells eventually exit mitosis in the presence of these defects, causing lethal chromosome segregation errors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutating the basic pair does not alter dynamics or structure of the microtubule cytoskeleton</title><p>The apparent kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects giving rise to observed chromosome segregation errors could arise from defects in a number of chTOG’s activities including: (i) regulating cytoskeletal dynamics by nucleating and polymerizing microtubules, (ii) organizing the mitotic spindle into a bipolar structure, or (iii) regulating kinetochore microtubule binding activity. To understand if the basic linker contributed to these activities, we first analyzed the mutant by live cell TIRF microscopy on adherent interphase cells expressing EB1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tirnauer et al., 2002</xref>). chTOG requires functional TOG domains to bind microtubule plus-ends and elongate the polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>), thus we verified that mutating the basic linker did not prevent the protein from localizing to growing plus-ends near EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). To determine whether microtubule assembly rates were affected, we next measured the velocity of EB1 comets after depletion of chTOG and observed an increase in microtubule assembly rates that was similarly suppressed by the expression of either chTOG<sup>WT</sup> or chTOG<sup>KK/AA</sup> in siRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Although this differs from other studies that reported either normal or decreased microtubule assembly rates upon chTOG knock down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cassimeris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ertych et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van der Vaart et al., 2011</xref>), these discrepancies are likely due to technical differences (Appendix 1). Regardless, expression of the WT and basic pair mutant chTOG proteins restored microtubule dynamics equivalently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), suggesting that the essential function of the basic pair mutant is not related to regulating microtubule dynamics. chTOG depletion also leads to multipolar spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassimeris and Morabito, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gergely et al., 2003</xref>), so we next analyzed spindle morphology. As expected, nearly 50% of mitotic cells had multipolar spindles after chTOG depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). However, expression of the WT and basic pair mutant proteins fully supported bipolar spindle formation when the endogenous chTOG protein was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Because unperturbed prometaphase cells have many unaligned chromosomes, there is high error correction activity that destabilizes these erroneous attachments and generates an average of 36 Mad1-positive kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, chTOG-depleted cells with unaligned chromosomes only average 13 Mad1-positive kinetochores, and this can be rescued by expression of WT chTOG but not the basic pair mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). To ensure that this assay was reflecting attachment state rather than a defect in Mad1 recruitment, we treated chTOG<sup>WT</sup> and chTOG<sup>KK/AA</sup>-expressing cells with nocodazole and found that ~ 50 kinetochores were Mad1 positive in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These data demonstrated that more kinetochores were attached to microtubules after chTOG depletion or mutation, which could arise from attachments being prematurely stabilized. To directly test this, we asked if erroneously attached microtubules were resistant to cold-induced depolymerization. Cells were incubated in ice-cold growth medium for 8 min prior to fixation and immunostaining, then cells with bipolar spindles but unaligned chromosomes were imaged. This revealed that in untreated cells, kinetochores on the astral side of the mitotic spindle rarely formed cold-stable attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). However, in chTOG-depleted cells or those expressing the basic pair mutant, many of the erroneously attached kinetochores on the astral side of the spindle remained attached to microtubules after cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We confirmed the stability of these microtubules by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of a region on the astral side of the spindle that encompassed all kinetochores and subtracting the background signal. These data suggest chTOG <italic>destabilizes erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments</italic>, and erroneous attachments persist when it is depleted or mutated. This would result in kinetochores bound to microtubules but lacking tension, which is consistent with our observation of a mitotic delay but eventual exit with chromosome segregation errors.</p><p>To further test if chTOG is required to correct low-tension, syntelic attachments, we treated cells with a reversible Eg5/KIF11 inhibitor (STLC) to arrest them in a monopolar state, which enriches for these attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapoor et al., 2000</xref>). We then assayed the relative number of microtubules bound by each kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudka et al., 2018</xref>). After chTOG depletion, kinetochore attached fibers contained 1.5x more microtubules per kinetochore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

To test this in human cells, we analyzed recovery from STLC when both pathways were inhibited. Because the complete inhibition of Aurora B with ZM447439 (ZM) prevents cells from forming bipolar spindles after STLC washout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeLuca et al., 2011</xref>), we partially inhibited Aurora B with a lower dose (500 nM). Cells expressing WT chTOG, while Aurora B was inhibited, exhibited the same phenotype as ZM treatment alone. However, when the basic pair mutant was expressed in the presence of ZM, we observed an additive phenotype where essentially no cells formed an organized metaphase plate after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) despite the ability to form a bipolar spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These data suggested that chTOG and Aurora B pathways function through separate mechanisms.</p><p>While chTOG and Aurora B appear to act on kinetochores through unique mechanisms, they both respond to the same signal of low-tension kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This leads to the question of why cells lacking chTOG or expressing the basic pair mutant can accumulate low-tension kinetochore-microtubule attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We wondered whether these errors were unable to trigger Aurora B activity, or whether Aurora B was activated but insufficient to destabilize these attachments. To examine this, we measured the phosphorylation status of the Aurora B substrate Hec1 upon chTOG depletion. We assayed cells containing unaligned chromosomes and found that chTOG depletion causes an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser55 on Hec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). We confirmed that the signal depends on Aurora B activity by partially inhibiting it and observing an expected ~50% decrease in signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The increased phosphorylation in the absence of chTOG only occurred at 10% of kinetochores in each cell (likely those stable erroneous attachments on the astral side of the spindle), making it imperceptible if kinetochore signals were averaged on a per cell basis. Together, these data suggest that Aurora B is activated when the chTOG error correction pathway is defective, but that it cannot fully compensate to destabilize these attachments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have identified a previously unknown mitotic error correction pathway in human cells, where chTOG localizes to kinetochores and destabilizes erroneous, low-tension attachments. Without this activity, erroneous low-tension attachments persist and appropriately activate the spindle assembly checkpoint to generate a mitotic arrest. However, attached but low-tension kinetochores cannot maintain the checkpoint indefinitely and cells exit mitosis in the presence of kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors, resulting in lethal chromosome segregation defects. While numerous proteins have been implicated in selectively stabilizing bioriented attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaitanos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girão et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maiato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ortiz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raaijmakers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Welburn et al., 2009</xref>), less is known about the mechanisms that recognize and destabilize errors. This activity of chTOG was likely not previously elucidated due to the pleiotropic effects of chTOG depletion on spindle structure and dynamics. By arresting cells with monopolar spindles and identifying a targeted mutation of the basic linker, we were able to specifically assay chTOG error correction functions independent of its regulation of the cytoskeleton.</p><p>Although the basic linker regulates polymerase activity in vitro via non-specific electrostatic interactions with the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>), yeast viability was normal when the entire basic linker (pI = 10.4; 18 positive residues) was replaced with just 15 conserved residues (pI = 8.7; three positive residues). Most strikingly, yeast proliferation was partially maintained when the Stu2 basic linker was replaced with the chTOG basic linker (pI = 9.7), but not maintained when replaced with the chTOG linker between TOG2 and TOG3 (pI = 10.1). Moreover, mutation of one or two positive residue rendered yeast and human cells completely inviable. Therefore, while the basic linker net charge is a determinate for in vitro polymerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>), it does not correlate with cell viability. We therefore propose that the essential function of the basic linker is to mediate error correction rather than regulate microtubule dynamics.</p><p>While the basic linker of many TOG orthologs contributes to microtubule lattice binding in vitro, it has also been proposed that the most C-terminal TOG domain in metazoan TOG proteins evolved to interact with the microtubule lattice rather than tubulin dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes and Slep, 2017</xref>). In particular, the crystal structure of TOG5 from the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> TOG protein, Msps, revealed an extra helix pair at its N-terminus that could make contacts with a lateral tubulin dimer within the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes and Slep, 2017</xref>). The basic pair is 20 amino acids upstream of this unique helix pair, making it possible that they may contribute to TOG5 lattice binding activity. However, mutation of the unique N-terminal helices or the canonical tubulin binding residues in TOG5 caused defects in microtubule dynamics and spindle organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byrnes and Slep, 2017</xref>), while the basic pair mutant does not appear to compromise any of these activities. Thus, the basic pair is unlikely to contribute to TOG5 lattice binding, but in the future it will be important to determine if and how the tubulin-/microtubule-binding capacity of each TOG domain contributes to mitotic error correction.</p><p>We also found that the conserved process of chTOG-based error correction is most likely independent of Aurora B phosphorylation of Hec1, similar to budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, our data suggest that Aurora B is active at the low-tension attachments observed when chTOG error correction is inhibited, yet this phosphorylation is not sufficient to compensate for loss of chTOG-mediated error correction. Thus, we envision two error correction pathways that respond to overlapping input signals but leverage unique molecular strategies to destabilize erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Currently, it is difficult to understand why cells would utilize multiple non-redundant mechanisms of error correction. One possibility is that Aurora B and chTOG error correction normally function in a more redundant manner, but the aneuploid and transformed nature of HeLa cells has broken this redundancy. Despite the lack of redundancy, both pathways seem to converge their activities at chTOG’s direct binding partner, the Ndc80 complex. While the molecular mechanism of chTOG error correction is still unknown, it is more likely to inhibit Hec1 microtubule binding activity than to directly modulate microtubules. We suggest this because the basic pair mutant retains the ability to bind to kinetochores and microtubule tips, yet it fails to destabilize erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, similar to depletion of chTOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Thus, we suggest a model where the C-terminus of Stu2/chTOG is required for stable association with the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zahm et al., 2020</xref>) while the basic linker modulates Hec1’s microtubule-binding behavior through competitive or allosteric means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While it is also possible the basic linker inhibits the recruitment of other microtubule-binding factors to the Nc80 complex, this is less likely because many of these factors are unique to budding yeast (Dam1/DASH complex) or metazoans (SKA and Astrin-SKAP complexes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Hooff et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Hooff et al., 2017b</xref>), yet the basic linker functions similarly in both species. Understanding the relationship between the Ndc80 complex and the basic linker in the context of microtubule attachment will be a key area of future research. chTOG error correction activity also provides new perspectives for cancer biology. RNAi screens for cancer vulnerabilities suggested that some tumors grow dependent or ‘addicted’ to elevated levels of chTOG, making it a therapeutic target. However, chTOG depletion is reminiscent of microtubule poisons that are universally toxic, but particularly potent in specific cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martens-de Kemp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tiedemann et al., 2012</xref>). Dose-limiting toxicities are a common challenge for developing anti-mitotic therapies, but preclinical studies indicate that they can be overcome through precision inhibition of single functions within multifunctional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2013</xref>). Future analyses of the basic pair mutant will reveal if specifically inhibiting chTOG-mediated error correction, rather than degrading the entire protein, is therapeutically advantageous.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Possible model for chTOG-mediated error correction, independent of Aurora B kinase activity.</title><p>Possible models of chTOG-mediated error correction (top) where chTOG kinetochore localization depends on the C-terminus while the TOG domains are still capable of binding tubulin at the microtubule tip in the ‘bent’ conformation. This may position the basic linker near the Ndc80/Hec1 CH domain to regulate Ndc80 complex activity. We favor the basic linker directly modulating Hec1 microtubule binding behavior, but chTOG could also prevent recruitment of other microtubule binding proteins. This activity is independent of Aurora-B-mediated error correction (bottom) that also recognizes low-tension attachments in the absence of chTOG, phosphorylates the Ndc80 tail domain, but on average cannot fully destabilize the bond.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61773-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4"

Slides imaged on the Elite were collected with a Photometrics HQ2 CCD 12-bit camera, while those imaged on the Ultra were equipped with a 16-bit sCMOS detector. On both microscopes, cells were imaged in Z-stacks through the entire cell using 0.2 µm steps. All images were deconvolved using standard settings. Softworx Explorer 2.0 was used to quantify kinetochore intensities by identifying the maximal ACA intensity within a Z-stack and collecting pixel intensity with a 16-pixel region of interest for the appropriate wavelength, as well as a 36-pixel region encompassing the first region for background subtraction. This region is large enough to capture both inner and outer kinetochore signals. Background intensity was found by subtracting the intensity of the 16-pixel region from the 36-pixel region. This background intensity was then divided by the difference in area (20 pixels) to give background intensity per pixel. This was then multiplied by 16 and subtracted from the initial intensity of the 16-pixel region. Representative images displayed from these experiments are projections of the maximum pixel intensity across all Z images. Intensity of cold-stable astral microtubules was quantified from maximum projections of Z-stacks. A rectangular region containing all kinetochores on the astral side of the mitotic spindle was drawn and measured, then background tubulin signal was measured in three small regions near but outside the astral region. Background signal was multiplied by the ratio of area between the two rectangles and then directly subtracted. Photoshop was used to crop, make equivalent, linear adjustments to brightness and contrast, and overlay images from different channels.</p><p>Live-cell TIRF microscopy was performed on a Nikon widefield fluorescence and TIRF microscope equipped with an 100x/1.49 CFI Apo TIRF oil immersion objective (Nikon) and an Andor iXon X3 EMCCD camera.

TIRF images for quantification were collected every 300 ms over a 90 s period using only the 561 nm laser to monitor EB1-mCherry.

While cells tolerate EB1 over-expression relatively well, high levels of expression and the length of the linkage between EB1 and EGFP have both been shown to alter MT polymerization rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geisterfer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skube et al., 2010</xref>). Because of these differences, we believe the increase in polymerization rates we observe is a result of changes in the cellular pool of free tubulin that increases because chTOG no longer contributes to MT nucleation or the sequestration of free dimers. In addition, altered tubulin homeostasis has been observed with siRNA depletion of numerous kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wordeman et al., 2016</xref>) and could contribute to our results.</p></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61773.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Hauf</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Virginia Tech</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>NIH</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Warwick Medical School</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Correcting erroneous chromosome attachments during cell division is crucial for proper chromosome segregation. Elegant genetic and cell biological experiments in this paper convincingly demonstrate that human chTOG contributes to correcting chromosome attachments. The data suggest that this is a conserved function of the TOG family of proteins, thus complementing the well-known – and equally conserved – Aurora-B dependent error correction pathway.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;chTOG is a conserved mitotic error correction factor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.

This is a high quality study that will be of wide interest to cell biologists studying mitosis and cell division in cancer.</p><p>Prior work has established a role for Stu2, the budding yeast chTOG ortholog, in correcting improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. This study expands this concept from budding yeast to human cells, and therefore potentially to other eukaryotes as well. Importantly, the authors identify critical residues in both Stu2 and chTOG. Mutation of these residues in chTOG (KK/AA) yielded an interesting separation of function mutant. While cells depleted of chTOG have major defects in spindle formation, cells expressing chTOG-KK/AA had specific defects in chromosome attachment. The type of defects are consistent with a failure in correcting improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The Aurora B kinase has a conserved role in correcting improper kinetochore-microtubule attachments, and the authors provide evidence that Aurora B and chTOG act in distinct pathways, which prior work suggested is also the case in budding yeast. The identification of the two important basic residues is an important step forward in understanding the biophysics that underly Stu2/chTOG's function in error correction.</p><p>Overall, this story is an impressive contribution to the field, as it demonstrates that Stu2/chTOG plays a conserved role in error correction and suggests that chTOG works independently of Aurora B.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the basic residues identified in Stu2 are indeed homologous with those identified in chTOG, nor what role they are playing in error correction. Some further clarification is required.</p><p>The authors suggest the basic residues act through an interaction with HEC1/Ndc80 in both budding yeast and human cells, but no evidence is presented that the identified basic residues in chTOG interact with HEC1/NUF2, or that the stu2-KR/AA mutant indeed has a defect in error correction. In their previous paper (Miller et al., 2019), crosslinking/MS identified connections between Stu2 and Ndc80/Nuf2. We suggest that the authors use crosslinking/MS or other assays to demonstrate an interaction between the chTOG region around the critical KK residues and HEC1/Ndc80. These experiments would strengthen and support the model drawn in Figure 5C.</p><p>2) Unlike in Stu2, the &quot;patch&quot; in chTOG is just N-terminal to the TOG5 domain. A previous study on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> chTOG homolog (Byrnes and Slep, 2017) identified part of this patch region forming a unique N-terminal extension of the TOG5 domain that is conserved in human chTOG, and mutation of TOG5 had similar defects in mitotic delay and chromosome alignment as observed with the chTOG KK/AA mutations used here. This raises the possibility that the KK/AA mutation is perturbing TOG5 function, which was proposed to interact with the microtubule lattice. To help address this, the authors could mutate the core TOG5 domain and assay whether or not it plays a role in error correction.</p><p>(While all reviewers considers this an interesting and important experiment, they also agree that it may not be currently feasible. If you cannot carry out this experiment at the current time, please add an appropriate discussion.)</p><p>3) The authors propose that the important KK residues identified in chTOG are required to turn over erroneous KT-MT attachments, and that mutation of these residues causes an increase in KT-MT stability. Although the assays used in Figures 4B and 4C are definitely suggestive of this, a cold-stable kinetochore-microtubule assay or visualization of other markers that report on KT-MT attachment stability (e.g. kinastrin, Ska1/3) would be more definitive.</p><p>4) In line with their previous results in yeast, the authors present data that chTOG facilitates error correction independently of Aurora B. However, it is surprising that Hec1 Ser55 phosphorylation does not increase in the presence of the numerous spindle and alignment defects caused by chTOG depletion (Figures 3C, 4A, and 5B). This is obviously very intriguing. Can the authors comment on or provide evidence of whether the kinetochores are under tension in the chTOG siRNA condition in Figure 5B? Also, the authors should report the pSer55 intensities on a per kinetochore basis instead of the mean kinetochore intensity per cell. A small population of tensionless attachments with high amounts of pSer55 could be averaged out by the quantification method used in Figure 5B.</p><p>5) Results paragraph two and Figure 1E/F: Instead of comparing one condition with MTs to another without, this experiment should be repeated using the thymidine block and nocodazole treatment detailed in Figure 1B to rule out any MT contribution to chTOG kinetochore staining. A blot for chTOG upon Hec1 siRNA should be also included in the supplemental materials.</p><p>6) In the mutant condition, the number of MAD1 positive KTs is lower (Figure 4B). On face value this means the cell is happy for mitosis to proceed, but it does not. The data on mitotic progression is restricted to a simple count of mitotic index (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). It would be good to see exactly where the delay is happening using live cell imaging to look at timing of each stage. Presumably the SAC is active? Would the KK/AA cells progress if the SAC is inactivated artificially (e.g. Mad2 knock-down)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61773.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the basic residues identified in Stu2 are indeed homologous with those identified in chTOG, nor what role they are playing in error correction.

Full length human Ndc80 and chTOG have only been purified in quantities sufficient for single molecule studies and much greater amounts are required for crosslinking mass spectrometry studies. Larger amounts of Human Ndc80 complex can be obtained by purifying a truncation or a complex where members are fused, but these complexes lack regions that might contribute to the chTOG:Ndc80c interaction. Therefore, we took a genetic approach to address the functional conservation of behavior between the basic linker regions of yeast (Stu2) and the human (chTOG) protein by generating chimeric Stu2 proteins and testing their viability. We replaced the Stu2 basic linker with the sequence from the chTOG basic linker and found that this chimera partially complemented loss of endogenous Stu2. Similar to the yeast data, the 15aa human “patch” was sufficient for this partial rescue. in vitro studies suggested the basic linker functions through a non-specific net positive charge, so we further tested this by replacing the Stu2 basic linker with the chTOG sequence between TOG2 and TOG3. Like the basic linker between TOG4 and TOG5, this region is predicted to be disordered and has a similar π (10.1 and 9.7 respectively). This region failed to even partially rescue the degradation of endogenous Stu2. Together, these additional data further support the conservation of the 15 residue basic linker activity between yeast and humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Unlike in Stu2, the &quot;patch&quot; in chTOG is just N-terminal to the TOG5 domain.

We agree it is an interesting question whether any of the TOG domains contribute to error correction and hope to develop assays that will directly address this in the future but currently do not have these capabilities.</p><p>We have mentioned this future direction in the Discussion and also addressed the reviewers’ hypothesis that the conserved “patch” is contributing to TOG5 lattice binding behavior. First we do not believe the patch or basic pair in chTOG are a structured member of HR0 or TOG5 because they reside 14 amino acids upstream of HR0 helices 12 of which are not resolved in the crystal structure from Byrnes and Slep (2017), likely because as predicted they are disordered. Second, functionally, mutation of TOG5 conserved tubulin binding loops or HR0 compromises chromosome alignment like mutation of the basic pair, but unlike the basic pair mutant they also alter microtubule dynamics and/or spindle organization (Byrnes and Slep, 2017), while the basic pair completely separates these activities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors propose that the important KK residues identified in chTOG are required to turn over erroneous KT-MT attachments, and that mutation of these residues causes an increase in KT-MT stability.

These results have been added to Figure 4 and provide additional evidence that the erroneous attachments are due to an increase in kinetochore-microtubule stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In line with their previous results in yeast, the authors present data that chTOG facilitates error correction independently of Aurora B. However, it is surprising that Hec1 Ser55 phosphorylation does not increase in the presence of the numerous spindle and alignment defects caused by chTOG depletion (Figures 3C, 4A, and 5B). This is obviously very intriguing. Can the authors comment on or provide evidence of whether the kinetochores are under tension in the chTOG siRNA condition in Figure 5B? Also, the authors should report the pSer55 intensities on a per kinetochore basis instead of the mean kinetochore intensity per cell. A small population of tensionless attachments with high amounts of pSer55 could be averaged out by the quantification method used in Figure 5B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We re-analyzed the data in Figure 5B (now Figure 6C) to quantify the signal of pSer55 phosphorylation at every individual kinetochore and found a 20% increase in Hec1 phosphorylation in chTOG depleted cells. As the reviewers suggested, we likely missed this originally by looking at per cell averages because only ~10% of kinetochores in each cell show an elevated phosphorylation status. These data suggest that when chTOG-based error correction is defective, erroneous, low-tension attachments form that are sufficient to activate the Aurora B Kinase, but its activity is not sufficient to destabilize these errors and they persist. We think this explains the phenotypes we observe. The persistence of low-tension attachments generates a spindle assembly checkpoint giving rise to the increased mitotic index, yet this checkpoint signal is weak because few fully unattached kinetochores are present. Thus, mitosis is delayed but eventually cells exit mitosis with severe and lethal chromosome segregation defects. We have included this new analysis of these data in the revised manuscript (Figure 6C) and accordingly adjusted our interpretation of the data and thank the reviewers for these helpful suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results paragraph two and Figure 1E/F: Instead of comparing one condition with MTs to another without, this experiment should be repeated using the thymidine block and nocodazole treatment detailed in Figure 1B to rule out any MT contribution to chTOG kinetochore staining.

The new results are reported in the revised Figure 1 and confirm that there is a population of chTOG on kinetochores that is independent of microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the mutant condition, the number of MAD1 positive KTs is lower (Figure 4B).

Would the KK/AA cells progress if the SAC is inactivated artificially (e.g. Mad2 knock-down)?</p></disp-quote><p>While live-cell imaging would better inform the nature of the mitotic delay, COVID-19 restrictions severely limited our access to high-resolution microscopes with environmental controls. We therefore used fixed cell analyses to address reviewers’ desire for a more complete understanding of the mitotic phenotype/delay after chTOG depletion/mutation. First, we found that the mitotic delay in chTOG depleted and KK/AA expressing cells was dependent on Mps1 activity, indicating that the SAC is active in these cells. However, we also found that these cells show a significant increase in chromosome segregation errors. We interpret this to mean that erroneous low-tension attachments are prematurely stabilized and appropriately trigger the SAC to cause a prometaphase-like delay. However, as the reviewers indicated, the low Mad1 signal means this SAC delay is weak and the cells eventually exit mitosis with defective attachments. These results have been added to the revised Figure 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
