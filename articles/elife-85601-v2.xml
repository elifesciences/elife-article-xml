Several studies have shown that caveolae flatten out in response to increased membrane tension, thereby acting as a mechanosensitive membrane reservoir that buffers acute mechanical stress. Caveolae have also been implicated in the control of RhoA/ROCK-mediated actomyosin contractility at the rear of migrating cells. However, how membrane tension controls the organisation of caveolae and their role in mechanotransduction remains unclear. To address this, we systematically quantified protein–protein interactions of caveolin-1 in migrating RPE1 cells at steady state and in response to an acute increase in membrane tension using biotin-based proximity labelling and quantitative mass spectrometry. Our data show that caveolae are highly enriched at the rear of migrating RPE1 cells and that membrane tension rapidly and reversibly disrupts the caveolar protein coat. Membrane tension also detaches caveolin-1 from focal adhesion proteins and several mechanosensitive regulators of cortical actin including filamins and cortactin. In addition, we present evidence that ROCK and the RhoGAP ARHGAP29 associate with caveolin-1 in a manner dependent on membrane tension, with ARHGAP29 influencing caveolin-1 Y14 phosphorylation, caveolae rear localisation, and RPE1 cell migration. Taken together, our work uncovers a membrane tension-sensitive coupling between caveolae and the rear-localised F-actin cytoskeleton. This provides a framework for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying caveolae-regulated mechanotransduction pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caveolae</kwd><kwd>caveolin-1</kwd><kwd>proximity proteomics</kwd><kwd>APEX2</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>membrane tension</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>cavin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001866</institution-id><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11823257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dittmar</surname><given-names>Gunnar</given-names></name><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001475</institution-id><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Membrane tension controls the dynamic assembly and disassembly of caveolae and their association with the F-actin cortex in migrating cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Caveolae are an abundant feature of the plasma membrane of almost all vertebrate cells. They are composed of the scaffolding proteins caveolin-1 (Cav1) and caveolin-2 (Cav2), which are embedded in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the cavin protein family, which form a loose peripheral caveolar membrane coat. There are four cavins in humans (cavin1/PTRF, cavin2/SDPR, cavin3/SRBC, and cavin4/MURC). Cav1 and cavin1 are essential for caveolae formation, whereas cavins 2–4 regulate caveolae dynamics and functions in a cell and tissue-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovtun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shvets et al., 2014</xref>). A third caveolin protein (Cav3) and cavin4 are expressed exclusively in muscle cells. In addition, the ATPase EHD2 and the F-BAR domain containing protein Pacsin2 are found at caveolae. While caveolins and cavins assemble into an oligomeric membrane coat that shapes the caveolar bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gambin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kovtun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovtun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ludwig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stoeber et al., 2016</xref>), EHD2 and Pacsin2 are localised to the caveolar neck and link caveolae to actin filaments to stabilise caveolae at the plasma membrane and to restrict their mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morén et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Senju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Caveolae are extraordinarily dynamic in nature and have been implicated in diverse biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng and Nichols, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parton and Simons, 2007</xref>). Caveolae are abundant in cells that are exposed to tensile forces or shear stress, such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and muscle cells, and protect such cells from mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dewulf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). There is evidence that caveolae disassemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>) or flatten out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthaeus et al., 2022</xref>) in response to an increase in membrane tension, and may similarly respond to other stresses such as osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2015</xref>), oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mougeolle et al., 2015</xref>), and UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon et al., 2019</xref>). Tension-induced flattening was proposed to be mediated (or accompanied) by the dissociation of the peripheral cavin coat and EHD2 from membrane-embedded caveolin oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yeow et al., 2017</xref>). Cavin complexes and EHD2 released into the cytosol can subsequently translocate into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMahon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Torrino et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that caveolae act as a dynamic mechanosensitive membrane reservoir that senses changes in membrane tension and transmits such inputs to downstream signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Pozo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Echarri and Del Pozo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Large numbers of caveolae are also found at the rear of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>), and several studies indicate an intricate relationship between caveolae-mediated mechanosensing and RhoA-mediated cell rear retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grande-García and del Pozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grande-García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>). Caveolae formation at the cell rear is promoted by low membrane tension and is dependent upon RhoA/ROCK1 signalling, the Rho guanidine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Ect2, and the RhoA effector protein and serine-threonine kinase PKN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>). Caveolae, in turn, enhance RhoA/ROCK1 signalling, leading to F-actin alignment, actomyosin contractility, and rapid rear retraction. Loss of caveolae, increased membrane tension, or inhibition of RhoA signalling all break this positive feedback loop, inhibiting rear retraction and impeding cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hetmanski et al., 2021</xref>). This indicates a central role for caveolae in coupling changes in membrane tension to the control of actomyosin contractility at the rear of migrating cells. However, how membrane tension controls caveolae assembly and disassembly and caveolae-mediated signalling at the cell rear has not been analysed in a quantitative and objective manner.</p><p>Here we used live-cell imaging and electron tomography to study the dynamics and ultrastructure of caveolae at the rear of migrating RPE1 cells. We then employed proximity biotinylation with the peroxidase APEX2 and quantitative proteomics to define a Cav1-associated interactome in RPE1 cells at iso-osmotic conditions and in response to an acute increase in membrane tension elicited by hypo-osmotic shock. Our data demonstrate that membrane tension rapidly and reversibly disassembles the caveolae structure and abolishes the linkage between caveolae and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we identify a number of potentially novel regulators and effectors of caveolae and present evidence that one of them, the Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) ARHGAP29, controls caveolae rear localisation and RPE1 cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Caveolae are abundant at and stably associated with the rear of RPE1 cells</title><p>We previously demonstrated that caveolae are enriched at the rear of hTERT-RPE1 cells (henceforth referred to as RPE1 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>). Quantification of endogenous Cav1 fluorescence intensity in fixed RPE1 cells (visualised with anti-Cav1 antibodies) revealed an approximately eightfold enrichment at the cell rear compared to the cell front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Such a polarised rear distribution of Cav1 is observed in ~70% of RPE1 cells sparsely grown on fibronectin-coated glass. To study the dynamics of caveolae in migrating RPE1 cells, we generated cell lines stably expressing fluorescently tagged cavin1 or cavin3 fusion proteins. Cavin1-APEX2-EGFP (Cavin1-A2E) was concentrated at the cell rear and colocalised with endogenous Cav1, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy and quantitative tracking of caveolae localisation in RPE1 cells migrating on a fibronectin-coated glass surface showed that both cavin1 and cavin3 fusion proteins were stably associated with the cell rear for several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2 fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 1–3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, caveolae were associated with the rear of RPE1 cells migrating in a 3D collagen matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>). Persistently migrating RPE1 cells showed relatively uniform protrusion and retraction speeds, resulting in an average translocation rate of ~0.4 µm/min. This is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vaidžiulytė et al., 2022</xref>) and comparable to cell migration speeds of MEFs and MDCK cells and A2780 cells migrating in durotactic gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitarska and Diz-Muñoz, 2020</xref>). When cells re-oriented their front-rear axis, this uniform protrusion/retraction cycle was transiently interrupted. The cells ceased to move and waves of new protrusions formed to establish a new leading edge. Interestingly, during this protrusion phase the rear remained relatively static, leading to a slow but persistent increase in cell length (aspect ratio) and cell area. At a certain point, the rear suddenly retracted, causing instantaneous and large cell rear displacements and an apparent accumulation of caveolae at the rear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and F</xref>). Complete reversals of the front-rear axis were also frequently observed. In such cases, the polarised distribution of caveolae was transiently lost but was rapidly re-established after a new front-rear axis had been established (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video7">Figure 1—video 7</xref>). Similarly, caveolae rear localisation was rapidly re-established after cell division (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video8">Figure 1—video 8</xref>). Our live-cell imaging data further show that when cells polarise spontaneously, caveolae become aligned along the long cell axis in a filament-like pattern and eventually accumulate at the rear membrane as the rear retracts and the polarity axis is established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video9 fig1video10">Figure 1—videos 9 and 10</xref>). Together this indicates that caveolae are stably associated with the RPE1 cell rear and suggests that rear retraction promotes the accumulation of caveolae at the trailing edge.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of caveolae at the rear of migrating RPE1 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RPE1 cells were fixed and stained with anti-Cav1 antibodies.

Several cytoplasmic effectors of cavins have previously been identified using BioID-mediated proximity proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McMahon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McMahon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mendoza-Topaz et al., 2018</xref>). However, BioID requires long labelling times (16–24 hr) and therefore is not suitable to dissect rapid changes in the caveolae-associated protein network that are likely to occur as cells respond to acute mechanical stress. To address this we employed a proximity biotinylation approach using the APEX2 peroxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lam et al., 2015</xref>).

In addition, fluorescent streptavidin labelling showed that the biotinylation reaction was restricted to the cell rear and colocalised with Cav1-A2E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We also generated a control RPE1 cell line expressing APEX2-EGFP fused to a nuclear export signal (NES-A2E). In this cell line biotinylated proteins were diffusely localised in the cytoplasm, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tan et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>To generate Cav1 proximity proteomes at resting conditions and upon an acute increase in membrane tension, we used a hypo-osmotic shock assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cav1-A2E-expressing cells were either grown in isotonic medium and left untreated (non-treated; NT), exposed to a brief 5 min hypo-osmotic shock (HYPO), or exposed to hypo-osmotic shock and allowed to recover in iso-osmotic medium for 30 min (REC). NES-A2E cells grown in iso-osmotic medium (NT) were used as a reference (or ‘spatial ruler’) to subtract abundant cytoplasmic proteins and non-specific bystanders. After ratiometric filtering over the NES sample, we identified a total of 348 unique proteins that were significantly enriched in the three Cav1 proximity proteomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the mass spectrometry data). In total, 70 proteins were exclusive to the HYPO sample, 15 proteins were enriched specifically in the HYPO and REC samples, and 26 proteins were enriched specifically in the NT and REC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, Cav1-A2E and all major caveolar proteins (Cav1, Cav2, PTRF/cavin1, and EHD2; note that cavin2 and cavin3 are not expressed in RPE1 cells) were specifically enriched in the iso-osmotic control (NT) and recovered (REC) samples. On the contrary, under hypo-osmotic (HYPO) conditions, Cav1, Cav2, and EHD2 were no longer significantly enriched with Cav1-A2E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that high membrane tension had caused the dissociation of these proteins from Cav1-A2E. Indeed, Cav1-A2E, PTRF/cavin1, and EHD2 were all specifically enriched in the NT and REC samples when directly compared to the HYPO sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). By contrast, no significant differences in the abundance of caveolar core components were observed between NT and REC samples, suggesting that caveolae formation is fully restored within 30 min of recovery from a hypo-osmotic shock. We concluded that proteins identified specifically in the NT and REC samples are associated with Cav1 in a membrane-tension-dependent manner and therefore constitute a reliable Cav1 proximity proteome under iso-osmotic conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The caveolin-1 interactome is enriched in cortical actin regulators and focal adhesion proteins and is highly sensitive to membrane tension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental set-up used for APEX2-mediated proximity biotinylation and LC-MS/MS.

We concluded that time-resolved proximity labelling with APEX2 uncovered a dynamic Cav1 interactome enriched in mechanosensitive cortical actin regulators, which is highly sensitive to acute changes in membrane tension.</p><p>To validate our proteomics data, we quantified the spatial proximity between Cav1 and some of the identified proteins using proximity ligation assays (PLA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with our proteomics data, under iso-osmotic conditions we observed robust PLA signals for Cav1-A2E and PTRF/cavin1, Cav1-A2E and filamin-A, and Cav1-A2E and cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Moreover, robust signals were observed for endogenous Cav1 and an APEX2-EGFP fusion protein of EHD2 (EHD2-A2E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). As expected, 70–80% of the PLA signals for Cav1-A2E and PTRF/cavin1 and anti-Cav1 and EHD2-A2E localised to the cell rear, whilst rear-localised PLA signals for Cav1-A2E and filamin-A and Cav1-A2E and cortactin were significantly lower (~40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This is expected as filamin-A and cortactin were present but not enriched at the cell rear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, hypo-osmotic shock drastically reduced the PLA signals in all of the above cases, whereas cells that had recovered from the hypo-osmotic shock showed PLA signals indistinguishable to that of control cells. Taken together our data indicate that a brief hypo-osmotic shock causes an instantaneous but reversible disassembly of caveolae, as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Torrino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yeow et al., 2017</xref>).

By contrast, ARHGAP29 siRNA transfected cells showed a significant increase in Cav1 Y14 phosphorylation, but pMLC levels were not significantly different to control cells. To test whether the increase in ARHGAP29 protein observed in Cav1 siRNA cells was due to elevated YAP-mediated gene transcription, we performed qPCR analyses.

The localisation of Cav1 and PTRF/cavin1 was not notably altered in ARHGAP29 siRNA-transfected cells (data not shown). In addition, cells with reduced ARHGAP29 expression showed normal cell migration behaviour compared to control siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). The lack of a migration phenotype may be explained by residual ARHGAP29 activity (i.e., incomplete knockdown) or functional redundancy (i.e., compensation by other related RhoGAPs). We therefore analysed the subcellular distribution of Cav1 and PTRF/cavin1 in cells overexpressing moderate levels of ARHGAP29. Only cells with an intact actin cytoskeleton and normal cell shape were considered for the analysis. Transfected A2E-ARHGAP29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>) was localised primarily in the cell cytoplasm, with occasional enrichment in lamellipodia-like protrusions. Interestingly, protrusions enriched in ARHGAP29 exhibited a clear reduction in Cav1 staining intensity. When normalised against total cellular protein levels, such protrusions showed an approximately threefold enrichment of ARHGAP29 over Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In addition, in cells overexpressing ARHGAP29 Cav1 was concentrated in the cell centre rather than being polarised to the rear as observed in cells transfected with the NES-A2E control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Quantification of this phenotype revealed that overexpression of A2E-ARHGAP29 indeed perturbed the polarised rear distribution of Cav1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The localisation of PTRF/cavin1 was similarly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>).

Consequently, ARHGAP29-overexpressing cells showed markedly reduced migration velocities and mean squared displacements compared to control-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>).

The data suggest that caveolae link changes in membrane tension to the control of the rear-localised actin cortex, integrin/focal adhesion turnover, and Rho/ROCK signalling (see below). Interestingly, several known mechanotransducers and cell migration regulators including filamins, cortactin, and utrophin were associated with Cav1, suggesting that caveolae integrate mechanosignalling at the rear of migrating cells. We note that the Cav1 interactome is enriched in proteins that are present at but not necessarily exclusive to the cell rear. Given the abundance of caveolae at the rear, the majority of the proteins identified in the interactome are likely to be associated with the rear-localised pool of caveolae. However, Cav1-APEX2 molecules localised elsewhere in the cell, for example in the leading edge, the Golgi apparatus, or on transport vesicles do contribute to the proteome. Therefore, the Cav1 interactome is not a specific interactome of caveolae at the cell rear but rather represents a composite cell-wide interactome of Cav1 oligomers and fully assembled caveolae.</p><p>Our proteomics and PLA data show that cavins, EHD2, as well as Pacsin2 are released from Cav1 scaffolds in cells exposed to a brief hypotonic shock. This underscores existing models suggesting that the caveolar coat is rapidly disassembled at high membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Pozo et al., 2021</xref>). The data also revealed that the entire caveolar coat structure is re-established within 30 min of recovery from the shock, demonstrating that caveolae assembly and disassembly are remarkably dynamic. It is worth noting that flat Cav1 scaffolds have recently been shown to contain detectable levels of cavins and that EHD2 and Pacsin2 are associated both with flat and curved caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matthaeus et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible, therefore, that the tension-induced conformational changes in the caveolar coat are more subtle than current models suggest. Nonetheless, our work clearly shows that membrane tension has a profound effect on caveolae and that such changes are quantifiable. Altogether, we suggest that membrane tension either dissociates the caveolar coat partially or induces a substantial structural remodelling of many but not all caveolae. One notable caveat of our approach is that the level of tension induced by hypo-osmotic shock likely exceeds that exerted at the rear of the cell. Hence, it will be important to address in future how much membrane tension actually changes at the cell rear as cells migrate, and whether these changes are sufficient to cause caveolae disassembly. We also obtained a list of proteins that became selectively enriched with Cav1 at high membrane tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This proximity proteome is composed of proteins with diverse cellular functions ranging from protein translation (ribosomal proteins) to membrane trafficking. Whether any of these proteins are involved in mediating a Cav1-dependent mechanosignalling response, for instance, via the recently proposed caveolae-independent Cav1 scaffolds termed dolines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lolo et al., 2023</xref>), remains to be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Membrane tension and actomyosin contractility regulate caveolae rear localisation</title><p>We show using fixed and live-cell imaging that caveolar proteins are enriched at and stably associated with the rear of migrating RPE1 cells. Although we cannot discriminate between flat and invaginated caveolae at the resolution provided by diffraction-limited microscopy, large clusters of morphologically distinct caveolae and interconnected caveolar networks were observed at the RPE1 cell rear using electron tomography. Such a polarised distribution of caveolae has been demonstrated in many other migratory cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grande-García and del Pozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grande-García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2008</xref>). What is the mechanism driving caveolae formation specifically at the cell rear? Several studies have shown that low membrane tension favours caveolae formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Pozo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the formation of caveolae specifically at the rear of migrating cells is the result of a relatively stable front-rear asymmetry in membrane tension. Such membrane tension gradients, with low tension at the rear and higher tension at the front, have indeed been observed in fast-moving fish keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lieber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lieber et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether stable membrane tension gradients are a general feature of migrating cells is not entirely clear, and whether membrane tension rapidly equilibrates across the cell (e.g. from the front to the rear) or can be locally confined has been the subject of much debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Belly et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitarska and Diz-Muñoz, 2020</xref>). Using fluorescence lifetime imaging with the Flipper-TR membrane tension probe, the Roux lab recently reported that stable front-rear membrane tension gradients indeed exist in many migrating cells, including RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Arcos et al., 2024</xref>). Tension gradients were even observed in non-migrating cells and were dependent upon a dynamic F-actin network, cell–substrate adhesions, and membrane–cortex attachments. The study provides strong support that membrane tension gradients are a common feature of adherent cells and that the migration mode determines how such gradients are established.</p><p>Hetmanski et al. reported that A2780 cells exhibit a front/rear membrane tension gradient only when cells migrate in an ECM rigidity gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>). Both inhibition of Rho signalling by Y-27632 and expression of a constitutively active ezrin mutant (which enhances membrane–cortex interactions at the cell rear) increased rear membrane tension, prevented the accumulation of cavin1 and Cav1 at the rear, and blocked cell rear retraction. The role of contractility in concentrating caveolae at the rear is also evident in our time-lapse movies, which suggest that caveolae (cavins) become concentrated at the rear when cells retract their trailing edge. Such sudden rear retractions are likely the result of bursts of contractility that pull on the rear membrane, lowering tension at the rear and promoting caveolae formation. In addition, cavins were frequently aligned in ‘filamentous stripes’ when cells establish front/rear polarity or reorient their front/rear axis, indicating a physical linkage between caveolae and F-actin fibres. Caveolae are indeed attached to and aligned along actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Echarri and Del Pozo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stoeber et al., 2012</xref>) and depolymerisation of the actin cytoskeleton or inhibition of actomyosin contractility affects caveolae distribution and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2021</xref>) and blocks caveolae rear localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether our data and a large body of existing literature indicate that caveolae are associated with the F-actin cytoskeleton and that actomyosin-driven contraction and a front/rear membrane tension gradient promote caveolae formation specifically at the rear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A model of caveolae function and dynamics at the cell rear</title><p>A putative model of how membrane tension and caveolae regulate actomyosin contractility and cell rear retraction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The model assumes that a stable membrane tension gradient exists in RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Arcos et al., 2024</xref>), promoting caveolae formation at the rear. Considering evidence that protrusion at the front is coupled to retraction at the rear and that membrane tension can propagate across the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Belly et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Houk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mueller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sitarska and Diz-Muñoz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>), it can be inferred that at short time scales absolute membrane tension values fluctuate at both the rear and the front. This would suggest that caveolae assembly and disassembly at the rear is coordinated with or driven by the protrusion/retraction cycle: When rear tension drops (e.g. in response to a sudden rear retraction), the formation of caveolae and caveolar networks is favoured. When tension at the rear builds up (e.g. when front protrusion is dominant over rear retraction), caveolae flatten out. Since caveolae and caveolar networks substantially increase the effective membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golani et al., 2019</xref>) and also provide a unique topology and curvature, their dynamic and reversible nature might not only be critical for buffering membrane tension, but also play an important role in regulating the recruitment of signalling proteins to the rear.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of caveolae dynamics and function at the rear of migrating cells.</title><p>Low membrane tension promotes caveolae formation at the cell rear, whilst high membrane tension causes caveolae to flatten out, which is accompanied by the dissociation of cavin1/PTRF, EHD2, and Pacsin2 from membrane-embedded Cav1 scaffolds. The linkage between the cortical F-actin network and Cav1 scaffolds is also lost at high membrane tension. Caveolae or Cav1 scaffolds promote RhoA/ROCK signalling, MLC phosphorylation, and cell rear retraction, possibly by recruiting the RhoGEF Ect2 and ROCK to the cell rear.

Knockdown of RhoA, ROCK1, or the rear-localised RhoGEF Ect2 in A2780 cells blocked caveolae rear localisation and impeded cell migration in durotactic gradients. Caveolae, in turn, were required for the recruitment of Ect2 to the rear, for RhoA activation, and for cell rear retraction, suggesting that caveolae and the actomyosin system control cell rear retraction via a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that ROCK1 is recruited to Cav1 at high membrane tension (i.e. under conditions that promote caveolae flattening) and that ROCK activity is required for caveolae reassembly after hypo-osmotic shock. In addition, we show that the loss of Cav1 leads to a drastic reduction in MLC phosphorylation, indicating that Cav1 is critical for myosin-II activation. Altogether this suggests that Cav1 scaffolds recruit Ect2 and ROCK1 to the cell rear to promote caveolae formation and actomyosin contractility. As discussed below, the function of ARHGAP29 might be to interrupt this feedback loop by suppressing RhoA signalling at the rear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A putative functional role of ARHGAP29 at the cell rear</title><p>We provide evidence that ARHGAP29 is associated with Cav1 in a membrane tension-dependent manner and that overexpression of ARHGAP29 suppresses caveolae rear localisation and RPE1 cell migration. Since caveolae are highly enriched at the cell rear, we expected that ARHGAP29 would (at least partially) be associated with the rear. However, both in fixed and live RPE1 cells ARHGAP29 appeared mostly cytoplasmic, with no obvious rear bias. This was somewhat unexpected as ARHGAP29 is localised to the plasma membrane in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Post et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rogg et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tan and Zaidel-Bar, 2015</xref>). Closer inspection revealed that a fraction of ARHGAP29 was present in lamellipodia-like protrusions, which interestingly were largely devoid of Cav1. This inverse spatial correlation suggests that ARHGAP29 can locally suppress caveolae assembly or prevent caveolae recruitment into such areas. This effect is likely due to the local inhibition of RhoA and can explain the caveolae rear polarity and cell migration defects we observe in cells overexpressing ARHGAP29. The apparent absence of ARHGAP29 from the cell rear at steady state then prompts the question why ARHGAP29 was identified in the Cav1 proteome with such specificity and reproducibility in the first place. This can be explained by the way the APEX2 enzyme works. Proximity biotinylation with APEX2 is extremely sensitive and is restricted to a labelling radius of ~20 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). The labelling reaction is conducted on live and intact cells at room temperature (RT) for 1 min. Although 1 min appears short, dynamic cellular processes occur at the time scale of seconds and are ongoing during the labelling reaction. It is conceivable, therefore, that within this 1 min time frame, ARHGAP29 cycles on and off the rear membrane (kiss and run). This might allow ARHGAP29 to be biotinylated by Cav1-APEX2, resulting in its identification by MS. Interestingly, ARHGAP29 contains an N-terminal F-BAR domain that is required for membrane targeting and that can sense changes in membrane curvature. Work in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> suggests that membrane recruitment of SPV-1, the worm orthologue of ARHGAP29, is favoured at low membrane tension, leading to RhoA inactivation at the cortex. Increased membrane tension releases ARHGAP29 from the membrane, permitting cortical RhoA activation and contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tan and Zaidel-Bar, 2015</xref>). This is line with our proteomics data and suggests that subtle changes in membrane tension might control ARHGAP29 levels at the cell rear. Recruitment of ARHGAP29 to the rear at low membrane tension (which presumably occurs immediately following the retraction of the rear) would transiently suppress Rho-mediated contractility, providing a potential mechanism to terminate rear retraction and to permit a new protrusion/retraction cycle.</p><p>Although our data do suggest a reciprocal functional connection between Cav1 and ARHGAP29, how and where ARHGAP29 functions in RPE1 cells remains unclear. Hence, the model proposed above is largely speculative and alternative scenarios are conceivable. Firstly, the proposed model suffers from the lack of strong evidence that ARHGAP29 is actually recruited to and active at the rear. Instead of transiently operating at the rear where RhoA-GTP levels are relatively high, it is equally possible that ARHGAP29 inhibits Rho activation at the cell front, similar to what has been suggested for podocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rogg et al., 2023</xref>). In this scenario, ARHGAP29 might be involved in establishing a Rac/Rho activity gradient along the front/rear axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>) rather than dampening RhoA activity at the rear. Secondly, we find that siRNA-mediated silencing of Cav1 expression results in a drastic reduction in cellular pMLC levels. By contrast, and unexpectedly, downregulation of ARHGAP29 had little or no effect on pMLC levels. This suggests that Cav1 and ARHGAP29 control actin dynamics in fundamentally different ways. Whilst Cav1 promotes cell rear retraction via RhoA/ROCK/MLC signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2021</xref>), ARHGAP29 may control the stability or turnover of F-actin networks by suppressing a RhoA/LIMK/cofilin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiao et al., 2017</xref>). Cofilin-driven actin depolymerisation plays an important role in cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</xref>), although there is conflicting data over whether cofilin is active at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisaria et al., 2020</xref>) or at the cell rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mseka and Cramer, 2011</xref>). Since myosin-II and cofilin crosstalk to control actomyosin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wiggan et al., 2012</xref>), the functions of ARHGAP29 and caveolae may be intertwined in a complex manner. Thirdly, we find that downregulation of ARHGAP29 significantly increases Cav1 Y14 phosphorylation, whilst downregulation of Cav1 stabilises or promotes the expression of ARHGAP29. Previous studies have shown that Y14 phosphorylation is dependent upon ROCK and Src activity and a role in the control of focal adhesion dynamics, cell migration, and caveolae-mediated mechanosignalling has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Joshi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zimnicka et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together this suggests that ARHGAP29 interferes with RhoA/ROCK or Src signalling to suppress Cav1 phosphorylation. Caveolae, in turn, somehow dampen ARHGAP29 expression to reinforce a positive feedback loop that promotes actomyosin-mediated cell rear retraction.</p><p>In conclusion, our data and previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetmanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hetmanski et al., 2021</xref>) suggest that caveolae act as a rear-localised membrane tension sensor that links the F-actin cortex and actomyosin contractility to cell rear retraction. The caveolar interactome identified here will be instrumental in dissecting the molecular machinery and mechanisms underlying caveolae-mediated mechanotransduction in migrating cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Transfections were performed in 6-well plates with the cells in a sub-confluent condition. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 1 µg plasmid DNA per well. Stable cell lines were generated by selection in complete medium containing 400 µg/ml geneticin (Gibco) for at least 14 days. Stable cell lines were maintained in media containing 200 µg/ml geneticin and occasionally subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to maintain populations in which ~40% of cells expressed Cav1-A2E or NES-A2E in the respective lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hypo-osmotic shock and inhibitors</title><p>For hypo-osmotic shock, cells were shifted from normal growth medium to hypo-osmotic medium (10% DMEM/90% deionised water) for 5 min and then immediately collected for the hypo-osmotic condition, or switched back to normal medium for 30 min to let cells recover from the osmotic shock. For the ROCK inhibition assays, the 5 min shock was performed in the presence or absence of 10 µM Y27632 (DMSO (1 µl/ml) was used as a control), followed by 30 min recovery in the presence or absence of the inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>RPE1 cells grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After further washing, cells were permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Blocking was performed with 10% FBS in PBS for 1 hr at RT. Samples were incubated for 1 hr at RT with primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01% Tween-20 in PBS (antibody buffer). After three washes with antibody buffer, samples were further incubated with the appropriate fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT. After three last washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Slides were imaged either on a spinning disk microscope (CorrSight, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Orca R2 CCD camera (Hamamatsu) or on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM880 FastAiry, Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired with a ×63 oil immersion Plan-Apochromat objective (NA = 1.4, Zeiss) and standard filter sets.

For CLEM, areas containing the cells of interest were sawed out using a jeweller’s saw and sectioned parallel to the substratum using a diamond knife. 70–80 nm semithin serial sections were picked up on formvar- and carbon-coated EM slot grids and imaged on a TecnaiT12 TEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 120 kV equipped with a 4k × 4k Eagle camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MiniSOG labelling and 3D tomography were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>).

Image analysis was performed with ImageJ/FIJI according to published protocols. Briefly, single-stack images were split in separate channels. The green channel was used for cell boundaries identification while the red channel for PLA signal retrieval. Thirty different cells from three independent experiments were used for quantification. The dot plots represent the number of PLA signals per cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Proximity biotinylation</title><p>The APEX2 labelling protocol was adapted from previously published papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tan et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tan et al., 2020b</xref>). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips (for IF) or on plastic dishes (for MS and WB). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in media containing 0.5 mM biotin phenol (Iris Biotech). After two washes in PBS, the labelling reaction was performed for 1 min with 0.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBS. Due to the higher expression level of NES-A2E compared to Cav1-A2E, we adjusted the hydrogen peroxide concentration to obtain an overall biotinylation intensity comparable to that obtained in the Cav1-A2E cell line. To quench the reaction, three washes with a quencher solution (5 mM (±)–6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox), 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide in PBS) were performed.

Lysates were then sonicated (three cycles of pulse sonication for 20 s) and clarified (centrifugation at 16,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4°C). Protein concentration was assessed either with Bradford’s assay or with EZQ protein quantification assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then kept at –80°C until further processing. Proteins were separated on precast 4–12% polyacrylamide gels and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were then dehydrated in methanol for 10 s and allowed to dry for 1 hr. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA in PBST (PBS, 0.2% Tween-20). After 3 × 10 min washes in PBST, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 5% fat-free milk in PBST. After further washes, membranes were developed with chemiluminescent substrate. To test biotinylation efficiency, membranes were incubated with streptavidin-HRP conjugated diluted 1:10,000 in PBST containing 2% BSA for 1 hr at RT and then washed five times with PBST before development.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Streptavidin purification and on-bead digestion</title><p>Streptavidin Beads (Pierce Streptavidin magnetic beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed twice with cold lysis buffer before incubation with protein lysates (50 µl bead slurry per 1 mg lysate) for 1.5 hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel. Beads were then washed twice with cold lysis buffer, and then once with each of the following washing buffers: 1 M KCl, 0.1 M of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 2 M urea in 50 mM AmBic pH 8. The last two washes were performed with cold 50 mM AmBic pH 8. Beads were then re-suspended in digestion buffer (2 M urea in 50 mM AmBic). Protein reduction was performed by adding 1 M DTT to reach 10 mM final concentration, and incubating for 45 min at 37°C and 800 rpm. After incubation with Iodocaetamide (25 mM final concentration, 30 min at RT and 800 rpm), alkylation reaction was stopped by incubating the samples at natural light for 2 min. Protein digestion was performed in a two-step reaction: samples were pre-digested with 0.5 µg LysC for 4 hr at 37°C and 800 rpm and then digested with 1 µg trypsin O/N at 37°C and 800 rpm. Peptides were then acidified (pH 2) by adding formic acid to 1% final concentration and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 rpm at 4°C to remove any residues of beads before proceeding with desalting on Sep-Pak µ-C18 Elution Plates. Peptides were then dried on a speed vac for 2 hr and re-suspended in 0.1% formic acid prior to LC-MS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>LC-MS/MS was performed using an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano (Thermo Fisher Scientific) LC system equipped with an Acclaim PepMap RSLC column (15 cm × 75 μm, C18, 2 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 300 nl/min in a linear gradient of 2–35% solvent B over 70 min (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid; B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile [ACN]), followed by a 5 min washing step (90% solvent B) and a 10 min equilibration step (2% solvent B). Mass spectrometry was performed on a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray source and using uncoated SilicaTips (12 cm, 360 μm o.d., 20 μm i.d., 10 μm tip i.d.) for ionisation, applying a 1500 V liquid junction voltage at 250°C capillary temperature. MS/MS analysis were performed in data-dependent acquisition mode, and the 12 most intense parent ions were fragmented with a resolving power of 17,500 (at 200 m/z). Automatic gain control, maximum fill time, and dynamic exclusion were set to 1e6, 60 ms, and 30 ms, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data analysis for mass spectrometry</title><p>Protein quantification was performed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.7.0) using the following parameters: carbamidomethyl cysteine as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and N-acetylation as variable modifications, digestion mode trypsin specific with a maximum of two missed cleavages, and an initial mass tolerance of 4.5 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Da for fragment ions. All experiments were performed in triplicates, and the abundance of assembled proteins was determined using label-free quantification (standard MaxQuant parameters) and match between run option was selected. Protein identification was performed searching against the UniProt reference proteome (UniProt ID 9606, downloaded on January 6, 2020). To this database were added two sequences for the detection of the fusion protein: Cav1-CANLF (UniProt id: P33724) and a manually curated fusion protein combining APEX2 (Q43758) and EGFP (P42212). Further processing with Perseus (version 1.6.10.45) was performed according to the following pipeline: removal of common contaminants, reverse and peptides identified only on site-specific modifications, and log2 transformation. Only proteins identified in three out of three replicates of at least one sample were considered for further analysis.

Imaging was carried out at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 90% humidity in a closed atmosphere chamber (IBIDI). Up to five different locations were imaged simultaneously using the multi-stage position function in LA software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Confocal image stacks (typically 3–4 images with a z-interval of 600–1000 nm) were acquired as 3 × 3 tiles with a ×40 oil objective (NA 1.3, EC Plan Neofluar M27, Zeiss) using the 488 nm laser line (65 mW; iChrome MLE-LFA) and a standard GFP filter set. Typically time-lapse movies were recorded at a frame rate of 5 or 10 min for 6–12 hr (in some cases even longer). Focus was maintained by a hardware autofocus system (Focus Clamp). The laser output power and exposure times were set to a minimum. Tiles were stitched and confocal image stacks converted into maximum intensity projections. Time-lapse recordings were analysed in ImageJ/FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Cell migration data was analysed with the ImageJ Manual Tracking plugin. Twenty-five cells per condition in five individual movies were analysed, and all experiments were performed in triplicate. GFP-positive cells were identified and tracked frame-by-frame by manually clicking on the centre of the nucleus. The X/Y coordinates were then imported into R, and CelltrackR package was used for further analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wortel et al., 2021</xref>). Data were normalised to overlay track starting points to zero. The R package was then used to calculate the duration of migration, displacement, track length, speed, and mean squared displacement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Quantification of rear localisation</title><p>All quantifications were performed in ImageJ/FIJI. For the quantification of Cav1 rear enrichment in fixed cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the mean pixel intensities at the cell rear and the cell front were measured. The cell rear was outlined manually based on the highest Cav1 signal. An equal size area was then measured at the front of the cell. The rear/front signal intensity ratios for each cell were calculated and plotted.</p><p>For the quantification of caveolae rear localisation in time-lapse movies, a 50 pixel wide line was drawn from the rear towards the front along the longest cell axis. The position and vector of the line were adjusted for each frame. Pixel intensities along the line were measured using the Plot Profile function of ImageJ/FIJI and exported into Excel. For the quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the pixel intensities along the line were divided into four equal size quadrants - rear, centre rear, centre front, and front.

Transfected cells were analysed by western blotting 48 hs post-transfection. For immunofluorescence and cell migration analysis, cells were trypsinised 48 hr post-transfection and seeded at low density onto glass coverslips or MatTec dishes, respectively. Cells were imaged 24 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>qPCR analysis</title><p>RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was removed using DNAse1 (Thermo Scientific) and cDNA was prepared using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR was carried out using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). Experiments were conducted in technical triplicates. Data was normalised to endogenous GAPDH levels and analysed using the comparative Ct method. Error bars represent the mean ± standard deviation, and a Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to generate p-values (*≤0.05, **≤0.01, ***≤0.001) (qPCR primers are listed in the Key Resources Table).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Mass spectrometry data.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85601-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Literature and database entries for the Cav1 interactome analysis.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-85601-supp2-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85601-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw mass spectrometry data was deposited in the PRIDE repository under accession PXD026464.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Girardello</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dittmar</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ludwig</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Spatially restricted proteomics reveals dynamic changes in the caveolin-1 interactome in response to increased membrane tension</data-title><source>PRIDE</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD026464">PXD026464</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>RG and EM were supported by the FNR AFR Bilateral Singapore grant 11823257 to GD and AL.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Patrick T Caswell (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>You will see in the comments below that the Reviewers are enthusiastic about your proteomics approach, but have a few concerns about the follow-up experiments. We invite you to submit a revised manuscript in light of all their comments, but with particular consideration of the following points:</p><p>1) We would like you to better quantify caveolae formation at the cell scale, as there is some potential discrepancy between some Figures. Furthermore, you frequently present the osmotic shock as a &quot;high membrane tension&quot; stimulus, but the study focuses on the rear of the cell and it isn't clear whether a global mechanical stimulus triggered by an osmotic shock really informs on what is happening locally. We all agree that a better characterization of the &quot;front-to-back&quot; cell model is needed.</p><p>2) We would also like to see a better characterization of the link between ARHGAP29 and caveolae, which is not sufficiently clear at this stage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>CAV1-A2E levels seem consistently lower in the hypo-osmotic conditions, which could reflect a change in oligomer formation or a difference in the labelling efficiency under this condition. Is the labelling efficiency across the three conditions (NT, HYPO, REC) the same, and similar between both Cav1-APEX2-EGFP and NSE-A2E?</p><p>Figure 3E is a little misleading in my opinion, and would be improved by an indication of where significantly altered protein changes are. For example, UTRN and TNS1 appear high (by z-score) in NT versus Hypo, but are actually only found in one repeat for the NT sample (Figure 3 Supplement 1) so are unlikely to be significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Based on cavin3 imaging, the author found that caveolae are stably associated at the rear of the cells. While an enrichment of cavin3 at the rear is visible in Figure 1A-B, there is no analysis of caveolae localization at the whole cell level. Because caveolae are well known to come with different sizes and lifetimes, a robust quantitative of analysis of the distribution and dynamics of Cav1, cavin1, 3 by fluorescence microscopy (endogenous and overexpressed proteins) would better support this claim. In addition, an analysis of these structures between the different area of the cell (front- middle-rear) during the different state of RPE1 cells (immobile and mobile) would be helpful to better establish this model. While the front cell in Figure1 shows almost no caveolae, the phenotype looks much less dramatic in Figure2 and Figure 4. Caveolae are distributed everywhere with some enrichment at the rear.</p><p>2. The authors identified new sets of protein associated with caveolae exposed at different membrane tension using a well-designed approach based on proximity biotinylation (Cav1-APEX), a methodology used previously by the group (reference 43-44). I congratulate the authors for these compelling set of data. Though, more explanation of the specific detection of biotinylated caveolae at the rear of the cell would be helpful. Once would expect that this strategy is global and all caveolin-1 positive structures should be detected. As recommended in point 1, a careful analysis of these cells would help to determine the degree of specificity of the proteomic analysis for caveolae localized at the rear of the cells.</p><p>Secondly, it should be discussed that the level of tension induced by the hypotonic shock is likely different from the one exerted at the rear of the cell. Thus, proteomic results might vary somehow from the physiology of a migrating cell.</p><p>Moreover, it is expected that hypo conditions would increase membrane tension and promote the dissociation of caveolae as observed by others (Sinha et al. 2011). This is actually observed in Figure 3 but this is not what is observed by the authors in Figure 1 where it is stated that caveolae were stably associated at the rear of migrating cell. Could the authors comment on this difference?</p><p>Last, providing evidence of actual membrane tension at front and rear would be interesting to support the statements of this study. The link is not clear to me. While the authors state that membrane tension is higher at the rear of the cells, other evidence show that membrane tension is higher at the front cell and lower at the rear. Hetmanski et al. (2019) measured membrane tension at front and rear in migrating cells by optical tweezer and did not report significant differences, except during durotactic cells where they found lower tension membrane at the rear, which is the opposite. Authors should clarify this point in the manuscript to avoid confusion.</p><p>3. Authors use PLA experiments to validate their proteomics analysis and results are accordingly quantified by the number of PLA spots detected (interaction). I was wondering what is the level of interaction (PLA) versus the total number of total caveolin-1 spots detected in all conditions? In other words, what is the proportion of proteins interacting with the caveolae population (and where in the cell)? This analysis could help to clarify the point of the authors relative to the existence of confined subpopulations of caveolae (detected by PLA) at the rear of the cell.</p><p>4. Better characterization of RhoGA ARHGAP29 is encouraged. Complementary experiments using Knock-out, dominant negative and dominant positive mutants would help as no phenotype is observed using KD experiment. Do overexpression of RhoGA ARHGAP29 displace the interaction of other regulators of the pathway identified at caveolae? Since overexpression is transient, phenotype may also vary from cell to cell. Is there a correlation between the level of overexpression and the phenotype observed?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85601.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>You will see in the comments below that the Reviewers are enthusiastic about your proteomics approach, but have a few concerns about the follow-up experiments.

In the revised manuscript we have addressed point 1 comprehensively by quantifying the rear localisation of endogenous and tagged Cav1 and cavins in fixed and migrating RPE1 cells. We have also analysed and now describe in more depth the dynamic behaviour of caveolae in RPE1 cells. In addition, we have analysed the PLA data in more detail and improved the data representation in our figures. We hope this addresses several questions and concerns raised by both reviewers, in particular regarding the enrichment of caveolae at the rear.</p><p>We have also much extended our discussion: We discuss technical aspects and the interpretation of our proteomics data, we elaborate on published literature describing how membrane tension is organised and generated in migrating cells, and we provide an objective discussion on how caveolae and ARHGAP29 might function at the cell rear.</p><p>With regards to point 2, we performed several new experiments to better characterise the functional link between caveolae and ARHGAP29 in RPE1 cells. As you will see in the specific responses to the reviewer’s questions, these experiments unfortunately have been largely unsuccessful or difficult to interpret.</p><p>Please find below a detailed point-by-point response to the reviewer’s comments.

The log2 fold change for Cav1-A2E is not noticeably different between the three samples. It’s ~4 in the NT and REC samples, and ~3 in the Hypo sample (see Figure 4). We do not interpret this as a biologically meaningful difference. What is different is the log10 p-value, which for Cav1-A2E and cavin1/PTRF is lower in the NES/Hypo sample compared to the other two samples. A lower p value however simply means there was more variance in the data measurements, for unknown reasons. What is important to note is that Cav1, Cav2 and EHD2 are no longer significantly enriched in the NES/Hypo sample. This is consistent with our conclusion that the caveolar coat disassembles under these conditions. The fact that cavin1/PTRF is still enriched in the NES/Hypo dataset may indicate that the coat is only partially disassembled, or that much of the cavin1 pool remains attached to Cav1-enriched membranes when cells are exposed to hypoosmotic shock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3E is a little misleading in my opinion, and would be improved by an indication of where significantly altered protein changes are. For example, UTRN and TNS1 appear high (by z-score) in NT versus Hypo, but are actually only found in one repeat for the NT sample (Figure 3 Supplement 1) so are unlikely to be significant.</p></disp-quote><p>This is due to the way the proteomics data was analysed. We filtered the data in such a way that at least one measurement in each sample was needed for the identified protein to be included in the dataset. Some proteins, such as Pacsin2, were not measured at all in any of the three Hypo replicates. This likely reflects a strong dissociation of Pacsin2 from Cav1 under these conditions. Conversely, UTRN and TNS1 were not identified in two out of the three NT replicates, but were identified in all three REC replicates. These proteins were included because two out of the three states could be compared (NT vs REC in this case). Based on the MS data it is tempting to speculate that UTRN and TNS1 are transient components of the Cav1 interactome that are specifically needed during early stages of caveolae formation. However, since we did not have the tools (antibodies) to confirm the spatial association between UTRN, TNS1 and Cav1 using PLA, we did not include this speculation in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

The analysis clearly demonstrates an enrichment of caveolae at the rear, independent of the fusion protein used (Figure 1 and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Our tomography and TEM data supports the abundance of caveolae at the rear as well (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, an analysis of these structures between the different area of the cell (front- middle-rear) during the different state of RPE1 cells (immobile and mobile) would be helpful to better establish this model.

Caveolae are distributed everywhere with some enrichment at the rear.</p></disp-quote><p>This cell-to-cell variability in caveolae distribution can be explained by the dynamic behaviour of RPE1 cells as they migrate. RPE1 cells migrate randomly and frequently reorient their front-rear axis as they turn or change direction. When this happens caveolae are redistributed, and when such cells are fixed in this particular moment in time, caveolae appear less polarised and more evenly distributed. We now describe these dynamic behaviours in the first paragraph of the Results section. We have included new figure panels (Figure 1 Figure Supplement 2) and we provide several movies that illustrate this dynamic behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors identified new sets of protein associated with caveolae exposed at different membrane tension using a well-designed approach based on proximity biotinylation (Cav1-APEX), a methodology used previously by the group (reference 43-44).

We show that Cav1 is enriched ~8 fold at the rear vs the front. A similar enrichment was observed for cavin1 (see Figure 1A-1D and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Given this strong enrichment at the trailing edge we propose that most of the proteins we detect in the MS dataset are associated with caveolae at the rear, because this is where caveolae are most abundant. However, strictly speaking, the proteome is indeed not a specific proteome of Cav1 at the cell rear (this is now clearly stated in the first paragraph of the discussion). There is no straightforward way to deconvolve the proteome to discriminate between proteins that are specifically associated with caveolae at the rear vs other places in the cell. We have however partially addressed this question with our new PLA analysis (Figure 5G), which shows that the majority of PLA signal between the caveolar core proteins (Cav1, cavin1, EHD2) is produced at the rear (70-80%). By contrast, proteins that are present but not restricted to the rear, such as CTTN and FLNA, do not show a clear rear bias in their interactions with Cav1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, it should be discussed that the level of tension induced by the hypotonic shock is likely different from the one exerted at the rear of the cell. Thus, proteomic results might vary somehow from the physiology of a migrating cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the hypoosmotic shock approach is expected to cause membrane tension changes very different to those a cell experiences during migration. This clearly is a limitation of the assay. However, the assay is widely used to address how membrane tension affects plasma membrane dynamics. It is rapid and reversible, and compatible with biochemical analysis (which was critical in our case). This assay coupled with APEX2 proteomics approach allowed us to obtain snapshots of the Cav1 interactome under resting conditions and upon an acute increase in membrane tension. Future experiments should now address how membrane tension changes are generated at the cell rear, how much tension is generated, and how caveolae respond to this. This is now discussed in the second paragraph of the discussion.</p><p>Measuring membrane tension changes in live migrating cells over time is not trivial and has not been done to our knowledge. Interestingly, however, a recent preprint by the Roux lab addresses this question using the Flipper-TR probe and FLIM. The data show that membrane tension gradients (low at the rear and high at the front) exist in migrating and even in non-migrating cells and that F-actin assembly and dynamics are critical for generating such gradients <sup>5</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, it is expected that hypo conditions would increase membrane tension and promote the dissociation of caveolae as observed by others (Sinha et al. 2011). This is actually observed in Figure 3 but this is not what is observed by the authors in Figure 1 where it is stated that caveolae were stably associated at the rear of migrating cell. Could the authors comment on this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Using live cell imaging we indeed find (and have now quantified in detail) that Cav1 and cavins are stably associated with the cell rear when cells migrate in 2D (Figure 1). However, given the limited resolution provided by light microscopy, it is impossible to discriminate between flat and invaginated caveolae. Electron tomography of the cell rear however confirmed that the signals we observe in light microscopy correspond to a large extent to invaginated and interconnected caveolae networks. For simplicity sake, we often refer in the text to caveolae when we describe the localisation of Cav1 or cavins. Strictly speaking however, it is likely that at any given point in time different states of caveolae co-exist at the rear. When tension is very low (for example in response to a sudden rear retraction), the formation of large invaginated caveolae networks of the kind we observe by tomography is favoured. When tension builds up (for example when front protrusion is dominant over rear retraction), a fraction of such networks or single caveolae will flatten out. These assumptions are based on data showing that protrusion at the front is coupled to retraction of the rear, and that tension can propagate within the cell <sup>7-9</sup>.</p><p>Our live imaging data does indeed suggest that the levels of Cav1 and cavins fluctuate at the rear; stronger signals tended to be observed right after cell rear retraction. Conversely, when cell protrusion was dominant (i.e. when cells stretched), the rear intensity appeared to drop, which could be interpreted as caveolae disassembly. We attempted to measure the rear signal intensity over time but found that these variations were difficult to quantify. Overall, we conclude that Cav1 and cavin1 remain rear localised even when cells protrude.</p><p>The model that cavins and other caveolar proteins completely dissociate from Cav1 at high membrane tension has not been formerly proven. In fact, a recent study by Matthaeus et al. showed, using correlative platinum replica EM, that a substantial fraction of cavins and EHD2 are associated with flat Cav1 scaffolds <sup>10</sup>. It is possible therefore that membrane tension-induced conformational changes in the caveolar coat (e.g. induced by hypo-osomotic shock) are more subtle than the original literature on this suggests <sup>11</sup>. Nonetheless, our proteomics data and PLA assays clearly show that membrane tension elicits profound and quantifiable changes in the caveolar coat. We propose that the coat is either partially dissolved, or that a considerable fraction of caveolae undergo major remodelling. This is now discussed in the second paragraph of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last, providing evidence of actual membrane tension at front and rear would be interesting to support the statements of this study. The link is not clear to me. While the authors state that membrane tension is higher at the rear of the cells, other evidence show that membrane tension is higher at the front cell and lower at the rear. Hetmanski et al. (2019) measured membrane tension at front and rear in migrating cells by optical tweezer and did not report significant differences, except during durotactic cells where they found lower tension membrane at the rear, which is the opposite. Authors should clarify this point in the manuscript to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the misleading description of membrane tension gradients in the original manuscript. We intended to say that membrane tension has been reported to be lower at the rear and higher at the front. This is now better explained in the revised version. It is also true that Hetmanski et al. did not observe a difference in membrane tension between the front and the rear in cells grown on glass (uniform stiff substrates), but a clear tension differential was observed when cells were embedded in stiffness gradients, with the rear membrane showing significantly lower membrane tension than the front <sup>6</sup>. Lieber et al. had previously measured membrane tension in fish keratinocytes migrating on a 2D surface, and similarly found that the rear exhibits lower membrane tension than the front <sup>12</sup>. This suggests that steady-state variations in tension can exist in the plasma membranes of moving cells. However, whether such membrane tension gradients are formed in all migrating cells is still unclear. In fact, there is a lively debate over whether membrane tension can be controlled locally <sup>13</sup> or whether it equilibrates rapidly <sup>9</sup>.</p><p>Our new quantifications clearly show that caveolae are enriched at the RPE1 cell rear. Such a polarized distribution is also observed in many other cell types <sup>14,15</sup>. Based on this and existing literature we suggest that low membrane tension at the rear promotes caveolae formation, which was nicely demonstrated by Hetmanski et al. Interestingly, a recent preprint by the Roux lab shows that membrane tension gradients (measured using the Flipper-TR probe) exist in many migrating and even in non-migrating cells <sup>5</sup>. We have included a section in the discussion in which we elaborate on this topic and on how membrane tension might regulate caveolae rear localisation and assembly. The relationship between caveolae, membrane tension, and actomyosin contractility is clearly complex and requires further work that goes beyond the objective of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Authors use PLA experiments to validate their proteomics analysis and results are accordingly quantified by the number of PLA spots detected (interaction). I was wondering what is the level of interaction (PLA) versus the total number of total caveolin-1 spots detected in all conditions? In other words, what is the proportion of proteins interacting with the caveolae population (and where in the cell)? This analysis could help to clarify the point of the authors relative to the existence of confined subpopulations of caveolae (detected by PLA) at the rear of the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have quantified the fraction of PLA dots we observe at the cell rear for four different combinations of antibodies/targets: Cav1/PTRF, Cav1/EHD2, Cav1/CTTN, and Cav1/FLNA (Figure 5G). In agreement with the localisation data, we find that 70-80% of the PLA dots for Cav1/PTRF and Cav1/EHD2 come from the cell rear, whilst this fraction is considerably lower (~40%) for Cav1/CTTN and Cav1/FLNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Better characterization of RhoGA ARHGAP29 is encouraged. Complementary experiments using Knock-out, dominant negative and dominant positive mutants would help as no phenotype is observed using KD experiment. Do overexpression of RhoGA ARHGAP29 displace the interaction of other regulators of the pathway identified at caveolae? Since overexpression is transient, phenotype may also vary from cell to cell. Is there a correlation between the level of overexpression and the phenotype observed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the functional connection between ARHGAP29 and caveolae and the role of ARHGAP29 in migrating cells was not well defined. Although we present some evidence for a reciprocal relationship between ARHGAP29 and caveolae, we concede we have been unable to add more mechanistic insight into this relationship. We attempted to produce ARHGAP29 KO RPE1 cells but failed in several attempts. We also performed additional siRNA and overexpression experiments, which were mostly non-conclusive or difficult to interpret (see comments to Reviewer 1). With regards to the last point, we do not find a strong correlation between the level of ARHGAP29 overexpression and cell migration behaviour. That said, we note that cells expressing very high levels of ARHGAP29 often exhibited a rounded cell shape, a much reduced F-actin content, and showed no net translocation at all in time lapse imaging. Such cells were not considered in our analysis.</p><p>References:</p><p>1. Qiao Y, Chen J, Lim YB, et al. YAP Regulates Actin Dynamics through ARHGAP29 and Promotes Metastasis.
