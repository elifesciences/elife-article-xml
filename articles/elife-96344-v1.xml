In vertebrates, these two distinct processes are controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), respectively. While it was suggested that a common secretagogue, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), oversees both functions, the generation of loss-of-function fish challenged this view. Here, we reveal that the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) is the primary regulator of this axis in zebrafish. We found that FSH cells express a CCK receptor, and our findings demonstrate that mutating this receptor results in a severe hindrance to ovarian development. Additionally, it causes a complete shutdown of both gonadotropins secretion. Using in-vivo and ex-vivo calcium imaging of gonadotrophs, we show that GnRH predominantly activates LH cells, whereas FSH cells respond to CCK stimulation, designating CCK as the bona fide FSH secretagogue. These findings indicate that the control of gametogenesis in fish was placed under different neural circuits, that are gated by CCK.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CCK</kwd><kwd>fsh</kwd><kwd>pituitary</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The French National Research Infrastructure for Biological Imaging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mollard</surname><given-names>Patrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1540/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levavi-Sivan</surname><given-names>Berta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NSF-BSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1947541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levavi-Sivan</surname><given-names>Berta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic loss-of-function approaches and functional calcium imaging reveal cholecystokinin as the primary regulator of follicle-stimulating hormone in zebrafish, redefining our understanding of gonadotropin regulation in vertebrates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates, the processes of folliculogenesis, ovulation, and spermatogenesis are controlled by two gonadotropin hormones (GtHs), FSH and LH. In fish, LH and FSH are secreted by distinct cell types in the pituitary. In recent years, different loss-of-function (LOF) studies revealed the stereotyped function of each gonadotropin: FSH signaling controls folliculogenesis, whereas the role of LH is restricted to the induction of ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). According to the existing dogma, the secretion of both GtHs by gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamic neuropeptide GnRH, which is produced by a small population of neurons in the preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belchetz et al., 1978</xref>). Studies conducted in mammals have shown that the differential control over gonadotropin secretion is attained via changes in frequencies and amplitude of GnRH pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Savoy-Moore and Swartz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stamatiades and Kaiser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson and Kaiser, 2014</xref>), as well as by a variety of other endocrine and paracrine factors that dictate whether the cells will secrete LH or FSH. In fish, the TGF-β family members activin, inhibin, and follistatin, as well as PACAP signalling have been shown to exert a differential effect on FSH and LH synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yuen and Ge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aroua et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yaron et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Ge, 2009</xref>). However, the hypothalamic mechanisms governing the differential release of FSH or LH in non-mammalian vertebrates remain largely unknown.</p><p>As in mammals, GnRH is considered the master regulator of gonadotropin secretion in fish. However, in recent years, its status as the sole neuropeptide regulating GtH secretion has been called into question, as other hypothalamic neuropeptides were shown to bypass GnRH and directly regulate gonadotropin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsutsui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biran et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biran et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ogawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajeswari and Unniappan, 2020</xref>). Due to genome duplication events, fish brains express up to three forms of GnRH, of which one form (usually GnRH1) innervates the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okubo and Nagahama, 2008</xref>). In some species, such as the zebrafish, that express only two forms of GnRH (GnRH2 and GnRH3), the gene encoding GnRH1 has been lost, and GnRH3 has become the dominant hypophysiotropic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okubo and Nagahama, 2008</xref>). For a yet unknown reason, in the zebrafish, even a complete absence of GnRH does not impair ovulation, as adult zebrafish with LOF of GnRH signaling are fertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spicer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Whitlock et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that GnRH activity is either replaced by a compensation mechanism or it is dispensable for the control of gonadotropin release overall. In other species, such as medaka, the effects of GnRH are limited to the control of final oocyte maturation and ovulation via LH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Since in both species the loss of GnRH does not affect gonadal development, the hypothalamic factor controlling FSH secretion in fish remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spicer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marvel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we addressed the question of the hypothalamic control of LH and FSH secretion in zebrafish. By mutating a previously identified CCK receptor highly expressed in FSH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>), we prove that CCK controls zebrafish reproduction by gating gonadotropin secretion. Using in vivo and ex vivo calcium imaging in zebrafish gonadotrophs to identify LH- and FSH-specific secretagogues, we show that the two types of gonadotrophs vary significantly in their activity patterns and that GnRH controls LH cells whereas FSH cells are preferentially activated by the satiety hormone CCK, which is also produced in the fish hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Himick and Peter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sobrido-Cameán et al., 2020</xref>) and its receptor is highly expressed in FSH cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>). The results identify CCK as a novel crucial regulator of the reproductive axis and establish a neuroendocrine link between nutritional status and reproduction in fish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCK and its receptor are vital regulators of the HPG axis</title><p>While in mammals, both LH and FSH are secreted by the same cell population, in fish these gonadotropins are produced by discrete cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golan et al., 2016</xref>). We took advantage of this unique feature to search for the mechanism that regulates the differential secretion of LH and FSH in fish. We have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>) that FSH cells differ from LH cells by the expression of an FSH-specific type of CCK receptor. While three types of CCK receptors (CCKRs; CCKAR, CCKBR, and CCKBR(A)) are reported in the genome of fish, only one type (CCKBR(A), XM_017357750.2) is expressed in the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In tilapia, the expression of this receptor is ~100- fold higher in FSH than in LH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, LH cells also express the CCK receptor (CCKBR(A)) albeit at a lower level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We, therefore, first validated its expression on gonadotroph cells in zebrafish using in situ hybridization and found that the receptor is predominantly expressed in FSH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To identify the source of CCK inputs we used immunohistochemistry to label CCK-expressing cells using a specific antibody against the eight amino acids of the mature CCK peptide. We found hypophysiotropic CCK-secreting neuronal projections innervating the pituitary near FSH cells and adjacent to GnRH axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating hypothalamic input of CCK into the pituitary gland.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of CCKBR(A) loss-of-function mutation on gonadal development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of CCKBR(A) and two identified gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) cells.

Three different mutations were induced by guide RNAs designed to target the fourth transmembrane domain of the protein, thus affecting the binding site of the receptor to its ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Three mutations were identified to generate a LOF: insertion of 12 nucleotides (CCKBR(A)<sup>+12</sup>), insertion of seven nucleotides (CCKBR(A)<sup>+7</sup>), and deletion of one nucleotide (CCKBR(A)<sup>–1</sup>). Modifications to the CCKBR(A) structure had significant implications for its function and ligand-binding capabilities, resulting in receptor inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). An insertion of +12 nucleotides is particularly interesting because a four-amino acid insertion does not cause a frame shift in the coding sequence. However, this insertion of a four-amino acid sequence (Asp-Asp-Ser-His) at the start of TM4 of the CCKBR(A) receptor, specifically between amino acids 188 and 192, led to receptor inactivation. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foucaud et al., 2008</xref> demonstrated that amino acid 192 is part of the binding site for the mammalian CCKR2. Our findings indicate that modifications in this region, significantly impact the receptor’s ligand-binding characteristics and overall functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Analysis of the phenotype of F2 adult fish (5–6 mo of age) revealed that while non-edited (wt/wt, n=15) and heterozygous fish (CCKBR(A)<sup>wt/+12</sup>, CCKBRB<sup>wt/+7</sup>, CCKBR(A)<sup>wt/-1</sup>, n=20) displayed typical sex ratios and functional adult gonads, all homozygous fish (CCKBR(A)<sup>+12/+12</sup>, CCKBR(A) <sup>+7/+7</sup>,CCKBR(A)<sup>-1/-1</sup>, n=12) were males with significantly small gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>; mean gonad area KO = 3.8 ± 0.48 mm^2, Heterozygous = 23.52 ± 10.6, WT = 78 ± 7.4 mm^2). The testes of mutant males displayed an immature phenotype as they were populated mostly by early stages of testicular germ cells (mostly spermatogonia and spermatocytes) and contained low volumes of mature spermatozoa compared to their WT and heterozygous siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Heterozygous fish were also affected and displayed significantly lower amounts of spermatozoa compared to the WT fish. Interestingly, the CCKBR(A) LOF fish do not phenocopy zebrafish with a loss of FSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, the phenotype of the CCKBR(A) LOF closely resembles the condition reported for zebrafish that have LOF mutations in both gonadotropin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, our mutants show decreased expression levels of both <italic>lhβ</italic> and <italic>fshβ</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that loss of CCK signaling affects both LH and FSH. Tissue distribution of the CCK receptors reveals the high expression of CCKBR(A) in the pituitary and in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which are both central areas of the HPG axis. CCK expression in the brain is directly connected to the metabolic status of the fish, as starved fish have a significant decrease in CCKB expression compared to fed fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Moreover, in fish, normal ovarian development in hypophysiotropic GnRH loss-of-function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marvel et al., 2018</xref>), together with the lack of FSH cells response to GnRH stimuli in pituitary cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Ge, 2009</xref>), further highlights the existence of an unknown FSH regulator other than GnRH. Here, we reveal that in zebrafish, CCK, a satiety hormone, gates reproduction by directly regulating GtH secretion. We show that GnRH preferentially controls LH secretion and identify CCK as the long-sought hypothalamic FSH secretagogue. Our results indicate that while fish gonadotrophs were segregated into two different populations and placed under the control of two distinct neuropeptides during evolution, a common hypothalamic pathway gates the secretion of both gonadotropins. Interestingly, in contrast to GnRH, the novel CCK regulation identified under the current study has a more substantial effect on the gonadotrophic axis, as revealed in our mutants, while the disruption of GnRH and its receptors didn’t lead to any drastic effect on reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spicer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The role of CCK as a satiety hormone has been demonstrated in multiple species of mammals and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lõhmus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2010</xref>). From an evolutionary perspective, allocating a satiety hormone for gating reproduction serves the unique demands of the life history of oviparous species. Egg-laying and placental animals display a marked difference in their reproductive energy allocation strategies. In oviparous species, the pre-ovulatory processes of gonadal development involving vitellogenin synthesis and deposition into the developing oocyte, also known as folliculogenesis, constitute the main nutritional challenge during the female reproductive cycle. Thus, in oviparous species, folliculogenesis is gated by the animal’s nutritional status. Since folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis are controlled by gonadotropin signaling from the pituitary, nutritional gating of gonadotrophs, may serve as an effective pathway to inhibit gonad development under limiting energetic balance. Our data suggest that, indeed, dedicated hypothalamic neurons have developed to integrate metabolic cues, such as food abundance and somatic condition, to induce the energetically costly process of reproduction in fish.</p><p>Since CCK is a regulator of satiety in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Himick and Peter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Volkoff, 2006</xref>), this hypothalamic circuit directly links the metabolic status of the fish to its reproductive capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Considering the recent report of an FSH-regulating role for CCK in the distantly related species medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uehara et al., 2023</xref>), our findings represent a highly conserved mechanism for controlling reproduction in fish.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model summarizing the two suggested regulatory axes controlling fish reproduction.</title><p>The satiety-regulated cholecystokinin (CCK) neurons activate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) cells. luteinizing hormone (LH) cells are directly regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH neurons that are gated by CCK, photoperiod, temperature, and behaviour, eventually leading to final maturation and ovulation.

Female gonad development in fish is directly linked to FSH signalling activity, as shown by genetic mutation of FSH receptors that leads to female gonad arrest and differentiation into male gonads as the fish mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2015a</xref>). The lack of females in our LOF mutant, together with the male’s infertility, suggests a direct disruption of both LH and FSH circuitry. We further show that CCK directly controls FSH cells by innervating the pituitary gland and binding to specific receptors that are particularly abundant in FSH gonadotrophs. However, our calcium imaging results and the LOF mutants demonstrate that CCK also activates LH cells to some extent. This activation may either be direct, as LH cells were also shown to express the CCK receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>) albeit at a lower level, or indirectly, by affecting LH cells via activation of GnRH or other neurons. The latter pathway can be wired through the close apposition of GnRH3 and CCK terminals in the zebrafish pituitary, as shown in this work. Additional support is the evidence in mammals where GnRH neurons express CCK receptors and CCK directly affects the migratory pathway of GnRH during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacobini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giacobini and Wray, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our identification of CCK-producing axons innervating the zebrafish pituitary suggests a predominantly central CCK-dependent control of FSH release. While in mammals, hypothalamic regulation of the pituitary is gated by the median eminence, in fish, hypothalamic neurons directly innervate the pituitary and secrete their regulatory peptide close to the destination cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golan et al., 2015</xref>). Similar innervation of CCK was observed in ancient jawless fish, such as lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sobrido-Cameán et al., 2020</xref>), and modern teleosts, such as the goldfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Himick and Peter, 1994</xref>). Modern oviparous tetrapods were also shown to express the CCK receptor in their pituitary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wan et al., 2023</xref>), indicating that this regulatory circuit may be evolutionarily conserved and common to oviparous vertebrates. However, since CCK is produced in the gut as well as in the central nervous system, we cannot rule out circulating CCK as a possible activator of GtH cells. Nevertheless, the direct innervation of CCK terminals into the pituitary gland and the concomitant increase of CCK in the gut and in the brain in response to feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Agostino et al., 2016</xref>) suggest that the two sources of CCK are interconnected. In this context, the vagal nerve may serve as a possible gut-brain communication route, as it was shown to relay satiety signals to the hypothalamus via CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borgmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>), thus forming a parasympathetic regulatory loop onto the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis.</p><p>Unlike the situation in fish, CCK LOF mice can reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2010</xref>), reflecting that the main metabolic challenge in the reproductive cycle of mammals is controlled by placental gonadotropins rather than by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The identified functional overlap in the hypothalamic control of both gonadotropins in zebrafish efficiently serves to gate reproduction by a single neuropeptide. Importantly, similar functional overlap also exists in the potency of GnRH to activate FSH cells, corresponding to a previous finding where LH and FSH are co-secreted during the female spawning cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">So et al., 2005</xref>). However, since FSH cells express a different type of GnRH receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2021</xref>), their activation is less consistent and results in reduced gonadotropin secretion. Moreover, in the zebrafish, as well as in other species, the functional overlap in gonadotropin signaling pathways is not limited to the pituitary but is also present in the gonad, through the promiscuity of the two gonadotropin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">So et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2019</xref>). This multilevel overlap creates functional redundancy that grants the reproductive system a high level of robustness and ensures the species' persistence.</p><p>Overall, our findings propose an updated view of the regulation of gonadal function in fish, in which metabolically driven hypothalamic circuits evolved to control gonad development. In addition to the novel insight into the evolution and function of the reproductive axis in oviparous animals, these findings are also of particular importance in the context of aquaculture, which has become the dominant supplier of fish for human consumption in the face of declining yields from wild fisheries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Froehlich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). With the identification of the CCK circuit as a regulator of folliculogenesis and the main gateway between metabolic state and reproduction, novel tools targeting this pathway can now be designed to manipulate gonadal development and overcome challenges in gamete production and the control of puberty onset in farmed fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zohar, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taranger et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample size and replication</title><p>Sample size varied between experiments, depending on the number of transgenic fish allocated for each experiment.

Briefly, the entire coding sequence of each CCK receptor variant was cloned from the DNA extracted from the different KO fish. Each coding sequence was inserted into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The constructs were transiently co-transfected with Cre-Luc reporter plasmid into COS7 cells (ATCC, CRL-1651) Three µg of each construct was co-transfected with three µg of Cre-Luc. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with tilapia CCK peptide (10 µM, eight dilutions of 1:3). The binding of the CCK peptide to the receptor elicits luciferase expression in a dose-dependent matter. The hormone treatment and the subsequent measurement of luciferase activities were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizrahi et al., 2019</xref>). Non-linear curve fitting on baseline-corrected (control) values was performed using Prism version 10 software (GraphPad). COS7 cells underwent weekly measurements for mycoplasma contamination and morphology checks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Tissue distribution</title><p>Tissue distribution of Tilapia CCKAR, CCKBR, and CCKBR(A) mRNAs were determined by real-time PCR as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biran et al., 2012</xref>), Tissue samples were collected from three mature male tilapia and total RNA was extracted from gills, anterior brain, mid brain, hindbrain, pituitary, diencephalon, brain stem, hypothalamus, Liver, anterior intestine, posterior intestine, stomach, spleen, retina, testis, kidney and muscles. Total RNA and cDNA were prepared, and real-time PCR was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biran et al., 2012</xref>). In short, cDNA (3 μL) was used as a template in a 20 μL reaction volume of platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen). Each set of primers was validated first for specificity and efficiency using six dilutions (5x) of sample cDNA. mRNA levels were normalized against the reference genes, EF1α, using the comparative threshold cycle method (−∆CT). Primer used for tilapia CCKAR, CCKBR, and CCKBR(A) described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Starving experiment</title><p>Fish were acclimated for 2 wk and fed twice daily, a feed volume of 3% of their body weight. Six adult female zebrafish (0.43 ± 0.59 g) were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: the Fed group, which continued with the same feeding regimen, and the fasted group, which was not fed for 2 wk. After 2 wk, the brains of all zebrafish were dissected for RNA extraction. cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR were conducted following the methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollander-Cohen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizrahi et al., 2019</xref>). RT-PCR was conducted to measure ZF CCKb (XM_002665615.6) expression with EF1a used as the housekeeping gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad). Whiskers on bar plots represent mean ± SEM. In violin plots, the middle line represents the median, whereas the bottom and top lines represent the lower and upper quartiles, respectively. The datasets in all figures were tested for equal variances (using Bartlett’s test) and normality (using D’Agostino and Pearson’s test or Shapiro-Wilk test for smaller datasets). Dataset pairs that exhibited equal variances and normal distribution were compared using a two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test (for two sets). For datasets with more than two sets, we used a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Tukey-Kramer test. Datasets with different variances and/or non-Gaussian distributions were tested using two-tailed Mann-Whitney’s test (for two sets) or Brown-Forsythe’s one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test. To compare levels of secreted hormone in the ex vivo assay, the one-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test (Wilcoxon test) was performed, as the sample size was lower than 10. To compare the datasets of the in vivo assay of CCK and GnRH injections, and the gonadotrophs expression in the LOF fish, a nonparametric one-way ANOVA test (Kruskal-Wallis test) was used, as the datasets failed the Bartlett’s test of equal variance. Significance was imparted at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body of 486 Languedoc-Roussillon (APAFIS#745-2015060114396791) and by the Experimentation 487 Ethics Committee of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (research number: AG-17-488 15126, Date: April 30, 2017).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-96344-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Gene expression data (figure 1A) was obtained from previously published dataset, deposited in GEO, GSE159470 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22126478">https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22126478</ext-link>.</p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hollander-Cohen</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Golan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Levavi-Sivan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>Differential regulation of gonadotropins as revealed by transcriptomes of distinct LH and FSH cells of fish pituitary</data-title><source>NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159470">GSE159470</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The writers would like to acknowledge the contribution of Mr. Antony Pinot from the Mollard lab for its help in operating the two-photon microscopy, Einat Zelinger, and Daniel Waiger from the CSI Center for Scientific Imaging Faculty of Agriculture for, for their help in guidance in operating the confocal microscopy.

In mammals, synthesis and secretion of FSH and LH by gonadotrope cells are controlled by the hypothalamic peptide, GnRH. As FSH and LH are made in the same cells in mammals, variation in the nature of GnRH secretion is thought to contribute to the differential regulation of the two hormones. In contrast, in fish, FSH and LH are produced in distinct gonadotrope populations and may be less (or differently) dependent on GnRH than in mammals. In the present manuscript, the authors endeavored to determine whether FSH may be independently controlled by a distinct peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK), in zebrafish.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors demonstrated that the CCK receptor is enriched in FSH-producing relative to LH-producing gonadotropes, and that genetic deletion of the receptor leads to dramatic decreases in gonadotropin production and gonadal development in zebrafish. Also, using innovative in vivo and ex vivo calcium imaging approaches, they show that LH- and FSH-producing gonadotropes preferentially respond to GnRH and CCK, respectively. Exogenous CCK also preferentially stimulated FSH secretion ex vivo and in vivo.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The concept that there may be a distinct FSH-releasing hormone (FSHRH) has been debated for decades. As the authors suggest that CCK is the long-sought FSHRH (at least in fish), they must provide data that convincingly leads to such a conclusion. In my estimation, they have not yet met this burden. In particular, they show that CCK is sufficient to activate FSH-producing cells, but have not yet demonstrated its necessity. Their one attempt to do so was using fish in which they inactivated the CCK receptor using CRISPR-Cas9. While this manipulation led to a reduction in FSH, LH was affected to a similar extent. As a result, they have not shown that CCK is a selective regulator of FSH.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusion regarding the necessity of CCK signaling for FSH secretion is based on the following evidence:</p><p>(1) CCK-like receptors are expressed in the pituitary gland predominantly on FSH cells.</p><p>(2) Application of CCK to pituitaries elicits FSH cell activation and to a much lesser degree activation of LH cells. (calcium imaging assays)</p><p>(3) Application of CCK to pituitaries and by injections in-vivo significantly increased only FSH release.</p><p>(4) Mutating the FSH-specific CCK receptor in a different species of fish (medaka) also causes a complete shutdown of FSH production and phenocopies a fsh-mutant phenotype (Uehara, Nishiike et al. 2023).</p><p>Taken together, we believe that this data strongly supports the conclusion that CCK is necessary for FSH production and release from the fish pituitary. Admittedly, the overlapping effects of CCK on both FSH and LH cells in zebrafish (evident in both our calcium imaging experiments and especially in the KO phenotype) complicates the interpretation of the phenotype. We speculate that the effect of CCK on LH cells in zebrafish can be caused either by paracrine signaling within the gland or by the effects of CCK on GnRH neurons that were shown to express CCK receptors .</p><p>In the current version, we emphasize that CCK also induces LH secretion. Although it does not affect LH to the same extent as FSH, an overlap does exist. This is mentioned in the abstract and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, they do not yet demonstrate that the effects observed reflect the loss of the receptor's function in gonadotropes, as opposed to other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>Although there is evidence for the expression of CCK receptor in other tissues, we do show a direct decrease of FSH and LH expression in the gonadotrophs of the pituitary of the mutant fish; taken together with its significant expression in FSH cells compared to the rest of the cells of the pituitary in the cell specific transcriptomic, it is the most reasonable explanation for the mutant phenotype.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike in mice, technologies for conditional knockout of genes in specific cell types are not yet available for our model and cell types. Additional tissue distribution of the three receptors types of CCK was added in supplementary figure 1, from this tissue distribution it can be appreciated how in the pituitary only CCKBRA (our identified CCK receptor) is expressed, while in other tissues it is either not expressed or expressed with the additional CCK receptors that can compensate its activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also is not clear whether the phenotypes of the fish reflect perturbations in pituitary development vs. a loss of CCK receptor function in the pituitary later in life. Ideally, the authors would attempt to block CCK signaling in adult fish that develop normally. For example, if CCK receptor antagonists are available, they could be used to treat fish and see whether and how this affects FSH vs. LH secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>While the observed gonadal phenotype of the KO (sex inversed fish) should have a developmental origin since it requires a long time to manifest, the effect of the KO on FSH and LH cells is probably more acute. Unfortunately a specific antagonist that affect only CCKRBA and not the other CCK receptors wasn’t identified yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Discussion, the authors suggest that CCK, as a satiety factor, may provide a link between metabolism and reproduction. This is an interesting idea, but it is not supported by the data presented. That is, none of the results shown link metabolic state to CCK regulation of FSH and fertility. Absent such data, the lengthy Discussion of the link is speculative and not fully merited.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we provided data to link cck with metabolic status in supplementary figure 1 and modified the discussion to tone down the link between metabolic status to and reproductive state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also in the Discussion, the authors argue that &quot;CCK directly controls FSH cells by innervating the pituitary gland and binding to specific receptors that are particularly abundant in FSH gonadotrophs.&quot; However, their imaging does not demonstrate innervation of FSH cells by CCK terminals (e.g., at the EM level).</p></disp-quote><p>Innervation of the fish pituitary does not imply a synaptic-like connection between axon terminals and endocrine cells. In fact, such connections are extremely rare, and their functionality is unclear. Instead, the mode of regulation between hypothalamic terminals and endocrine cells in the fish pituitary is more similar to &quot;volume transmission&quot; in the CNS, i.e. peptides are released into the tissue and carried to their endocrine cell targets by the circulation or via diffusion. A short explanation was added in lines 395-398 in the discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, they have not demonstrated the binding of CCK to these cells. Indeed, no CCK receptor protein data are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Our revised manuscript includes detailed experiments showing the activation of the receptor by its homologous ligand, supplementary Figure 1 includes a transactivation assay of CCK to its receptor and the effect of the different mutants on the activation of the receptor. Unfortunately, no antibody is available against this fish specific receptor (one of the caveats of working with fish models); therefore, we cannot present receptor protein data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The calcium responses of FSH cells to exogenous CCK certainly suggest the presence of functional CCK receptors therein; but, the nature of the preparations (with all pituitary cell types present) does not demonstrate that CCK is acting directly in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are some disadvantages in choosing to work with a whole-tissue preparation. However, we believe that the advantages of working in a more physiological context far outweigh the drawbacks as it reflects the natural dynamics more precisely. Since our transcriptome data, as well as our ISH staining, show that the CCK receptor is exclusively expressed in FSH cells, it is improbable that the observed calcium response is mediated via a different pituitary cell type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, the asynchrony in responses of individual FSH cells to CCK (Figure 4) suggests that not all cells may be activated in the same way. Contrast the response of LH cells to GnRH, where the onset of calcium signaling is similar across cells (Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>The difference between the synchronization levels of LH and FSH cells activity stems from the gap-junction mediated coupling between LH cells that does not exist between FSH cells(Golan, Martin et al. 2016). Therefore, the onset of calcium response in FSH cells is dependent on the irregular diffusion rate of the peptide within the preparation, whereas the tight homotypic coupling between LH cells generates a strong and synchronized calcium rise that propagates quickly throughout the entire population</p><p>The differences in connectivity between LH and FSH cells is mentioned in lines 194-195</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, as the authors note in the Discussion, the data presented do not enable them to conclude that the endogenous CCK regulating FSH (assuming it does) is from the brain as opposed to other sources (e.g., the gut).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that, for now, we are unable to determine whether hypothalamic or peripheral CCK are the main drivers of FSH cells. While the strong innervation of the gland by CCK-secreting hypothalamic neurons strengthens the notion of a hypothalamic-releasing hormone and also fits with the dogma of the neural control of the pituitary gland in fish (Ball 1981), more experiments are required to resolve this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript builds on previous work suggesting that the CCK peptide is the releasing hormone for FSH in fishes, which is different than that observed in mammals where both LH and FSH release are under the control of GnRH.

The paper did not show that CCK endogenously regulates FSH in fish. This has not been established yet.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important comment, also raised by reviewer 1. To avoid repetition, please see our detailed response to the comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper presents the pharmacological effects of CCK on ex vivo preparations but does not establish the in vivo physiological function of the peptide. The current evidence for a novel physiological regulatory mechanism is incomplete and would require further physiological experiments. These could include the use of a CCK receptor antagonist in adult fish to see the effects on FSH and LH release, the generation of a CCK knockout, or cell-specific genetic manipulations.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed in the responses to the first reviewer, we cannot conduct conditional, cellspecific gene knockout in our model. However we did conducted KO and show the direct effect on FSH and LH secretion together with physiological characterisation of the mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Zebrafish have two CCK ligands: ccka, cckb and also multiple receptors: cckar, cckbra and cckbrb. There is ambiguity about which CCK receptor and ligand are expressed and which gene was knocked out.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we clarified which of the receptors are expressed (CCKRBA) and which receptor is targeted. We also provided data showing the specificity of the receptors (both WT and mutant) to the ligands. Supplementary 1 shows receptor cross-activation. The method also specifies the exact NCBI ID numbers of the targeted receptor and the antibody used for the immunostaining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Blocking CCK action in fish (with receptor KO) affects FSH and LH. Therefore, the work did not demonstrate a selective role for CCK in FSH regulation in vivo and any claims to have discovered FSHRH need to be more conservative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the overlap in the effect of CCK measured in the calcium activation of cells and in the KO model does not allow us to conclude selectivity. In this context, it is crucial to highlight that CCKRBA exhibits high expression on FSH cells but not on LH cells. Therefore, the effect of CCK on LH cells is likely paracrine or through GnRH neurons that were shown to express CCK receptors. In the current version, we emphasize that CCK also induces LH secretion. Although it does not affect LH to the same extent as FSH, an overlap does exist. This is mentioned in the abstract and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The labelling of the terminals with anti-CCK looks a lot like the background and the authors did not show a specificity control (e.g. anti-CCK antibody pre-absorbed with the peptide or anti-CCK in morphant/KO animals).</p></disp-quote><p>Figures colours had been updated to better visualise the specific staining of the antibody. Also, The same antibody had been previously used to mark CCK-positive cells in the gut of the red drum fish(Webb, Khan et al. 2010) , where a control (pre-absorbed with the peptide) experiment had been conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Abstract:</p><p>The authors have not yet established that CCK is the primary regulator of FSH in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new version, we highlight the leading effect of CCK on the reproductive axis, which includes FSH and LH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>The authors need to make clear earlier in the Introduction that fish have two types of gonadotropes.

Why is this necessarily the case? Are there data indicating that a hypothalamic factor is required for FSH production in fish?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been mentioned in the discussion, we do not deny that circulating CCK or CCK from other brain areas might affect FSH secretion in the pituitary (line 402-404). However, as the hypothalamus serves as the main gateway from the brain to the pituitary and contains hypophysiotropic CCK neurons it is the most reasonable assumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>In the first paragraph, the authors reference three types of CCK receptors, only one of which is expressed in the pituitary.
