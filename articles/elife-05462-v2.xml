It remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve. Although laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, we show here that aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at &gt;30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations—but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05462.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05462.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05462.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Evolution is driven by changes to the genes and other genetic information found in the DNA of an organism. These changes might, for example, alter the physical characteristics of the organism, or change how efficiently crucial tasks are carried out inside cells. Whatever the change, if it makes it easier for the organism to survive and reproduce, it is more likely to be passed on to future generations.</p><p>DNA is organized inside cells in structures called chromosomes. Most of the cells in animals, plants, and fungi contain two copies of each chromosome. However, sometimes mistakes happen during cell division and extra copies of a chromosome—and hence the genes contained within it—may end up in a cell. These extra copies of genes might help to speed up the rate at which a species evolves, as the ‘spare’ copies are free to adapt to new roles. However, having extra copies of genes can also often be harmful, and in humans can cause genetic disorders such as Down syndrome.</p><p>In the laboratory, chromosomes are commonly studied in a species of yeast called <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This species consists of several groups—or strains—that are genetically distinct from each other. Over the years, breeding the yeast for experiments has created laboratory strains that have lost some of the characteristics seen in wild strains. Earlier studies suggested that these cells fail to grow properly if they contain extra copies of chromosomes. Now, Hose et al. have studied nearly 50 wild strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In these, extra copies of chromosomes are commonplace, and seemingly have no detrimental effect on growth. Instead, Hose et al. found that cells with too many copies of a gene use many of those genes less often than would be expected. This process is known as ‘dosage compensation’. This dosage compensation has not been observed in laboratory strains, in part because the extra gene copies make them sickly and hard to study.</p><p>Together, the results provide examples of how dosage compensation could help new traits to evolve in a species by reducing the negative effects of duplicated genes. This knowledge may have broad application, from suggesting methods to alleviate human disorders to implicating new ways to engineer useful traits in yeast and other microbes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05462.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05462.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>copy number variation</kwd><kwd>natural variation</kwd><kwd>stress resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM083989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hose</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Yong</surname><given-names>Chris Mun</given-names></name><name><surname>Gasch</surname><given-names>Audrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy (Department of Energy)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FC02-07ER64494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sardi</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Gasch</surname><given-names>Audrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HG006568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhishi</given-names></name><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dosage-compensated gene expression facilitates chromosomal aneuploidy, which presents a rapid route to phenotypic evolution in natural yeast isolates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Susumu Ohno proposed over 40 years ago that gene duplication could provide a major force in the evolution of new gene functions, by relaxing constraint on gene sequences and allowing one or both gene copies to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohno, 1970</xref>). The genomic era has largely borne out that hypothesis, and many studies have characterized the outcomes of whole and partial genome amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaillon et al., 2009</xref>). The immediate consequence of duplication is assumed to be increased expression of the affected genes, and in some cases the increased expression provides a selective advantage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edi et al., 2014</xref>). Over longer periods, the relaxed constraint afforded by functional redundancy allows one or both gene copies to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohno, 1970</xref>), driving sub- and neo-functionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lynch and Force, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lynch et al., 2001</xref>), expression divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and network rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Presser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freschi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Whole and partial chromosome amplification through aneuploidy is frequently observed in laboratory evolution studies and in drug-resistant fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selmecki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ni et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that aneuploidy is a rapid route to phenotypic evolution. However, aneuploidy comes with a fitness cost, most famously in cases of human aneuploidies such as Down syndrome (DS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonarakis et al., 2004</xref>). The reasons for aneuploidy toxicity are not entirely clear but may be due to increased expression from genes that are toxic when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siegel and Amon, 2012</xref>). Several studies have used <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a model for aneuploidy syndromes, since laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to chromosomal amplification. Laboratory strains with forced aneuploidy are extremely slow growing, regardless of the chromosome amplified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>). Transcriptomic and proteomic studies in these strains reported proportionately higher expression from virtually all amplified genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Torres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>), with a handful of exceptions recently identified at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dephoure et al., 2014</xref>). The apparent lack of dosage compensation is consistent with another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Springer et al. (2010)</xref>, which found that expression at hemizygous genes is not up-regulated to compensate for reduced gene copy. While these studies have generated important results on aneuploidy intolerance in these particular strains, one caveat is that they were all done in laboratory strains, which have lost many features inherent in wild strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kvitek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewis and Gasch, 2012</xref>). A remaining question is the extent to which aneuploidy occurs in nature and contributes to phenotypic variation in the wild.</p><p>Here, we report that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast strains, which are inherently tolerant of aneuploidy and display an active mode of gene-dosage compensation at the transcript level, for specific classes of amplified genes. Strikingly, genes subject to dosage compensation are buffered against copy-number variation (CNV) and thus show elevated rates of gene amplification in natural isolates. Our results raise new implications for the role of aneuploidy in phenotypic evolution and the mechanisms cells use to tolerate it.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We sequenced the genomes of 47 non-laboratory yeast strains, including wild, clinical, and industrial isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and assessed the copy number of the 16 yeast chromosomes. Nearly a third of all strains carried whole (12 strains) or partial (2 strains) chromosome amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Three strains harbored multiple aneuploidies, the extreme being insect-associated strain Y2189 that amplified four different chromosomes. Some chromosomes were amplified in multiple unrelated strains: Chromosome III (Chr 3), Chr 9, and Chr 12 were each amplified in different sets of strain pairs, Chr 1 (the smallest yeast chromosome) was amplified in three strains, and Chr 8 was aneuploid in five unrelated isolates. The higher incidence of Chr 8 amplification may reflect a higher frequency of mitotic error, since diploid mutation-accumulation (MA) lines propagated in the near-absence of selection amplify Chr 8 at a higher rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05462.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Aneuploidy is common in non-laboratory strains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative DNA copy (log<sub>2</sub> (RPKM)) per gene (rows) across each of the 16 chromosomes for 47 sequenced strains (columns).

Unlike diploid MA lines that were at maximum trisomic for specific chromosomes, half of naturally aneuploid strains are tetrasomic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, natural aneuploids showed no significant growth reduction compared to closely related euploid reference strains (p = 0.19, paired T-test), although there was a slight negative correlation between growth rate and extra DNA content (R = −0.3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is in stark contrast to aneuploid laboratory strains, which show extreme growth retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref> and below). We also found that chromosomal amplification was stable for &gt;200–400 generations in four interrogated wild strains, whereas the W303 laboratory strain generally loses aneuploidy within 20 generations. To distinguish if the tolerant strains have adapted to aneuploidy or if non-W303 strains can inherently accommodate chromosome amplification, we selected aneuploid derivatives of several naturally euploid parents (see ‘Materials and methods’). We found little to no growth defect in derived aneuploid strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> isolates are inherently tolerant of chromosomal amplification, which is common in nature.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A common aneuploidy response is distinct from that in the laboratory strain</title><p>Aneuploid laboratory strains are reported to show proportionately higher expression from virtually all amplified genes, causing proteotoxicity from excess protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pavelka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Torres et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore investigated transcriptome profiles through RNA deep sequencing (RNA-seq) in six naturally aneuploid strains normalized to paired euploid reference strains that are closely related (thereby minimizing neutral expression differences unrelated to aneuploidy, see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>Consistent with their near-normal growth rates, naturally aneuploid strains did not activate the environmental stress response as seen in sickly laboratory aneuploids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheltzer et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, we detected a weak signature common to several aneuploid strains, including the up-regulation of 69 unamplified genes (enriched for oxidoreductases) and reduced expression of 269 unamplified genes (strongly enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal protein (RP) genes and genes involved in respiration) in at least three of the six aneuploid strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We tested the respiratory capabilities of naturally aneuploid yeast with variable chromosome copy number and found no growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, a diploid W303 strain trisomic for Chr 12 (‘W303_Chr12-3n’) displayed an exacerbated growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources, and we were unable to make the tetrasomic W303_Chr12-4n strain that retained its mitochondrial genome, despite numerous backcrossing attempts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that differences in mitochondrial function may contribute to differences in aneuploid tolerance across strain backgrounds.

We investigated transcript abundance relative to DNA copy for amplified genes, interrogating 2204 genes spanning eight amplified chromosomes across the six aneuploids. Across all strains, nearly 40% of amplified genes showed lower expression per gene copy compared to the paired euploid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, blue points, see ‘Materials and methods’). These were enriched for genes encoding RPs, translation factors, proteins localized to the nucleus or to mitochondria, and other groups (p &lt; 1e-5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The lower-than-expected expression could not be explained by a general repression response to the aneuploidy, since only 39 of the 838 affected genes were part of the common response described above. In contrast, amplified genes with expression proportionate to gene copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, gray points) showed distinct enrichment for genes encoding proteins localized to the cytoplasm or to membranes, stress defense proteins, and kinases and transferases (p &lt; 1e-5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

New mutations, through adaptation or drift, could heritably reduce expression at toxic amplified genes. Alternatively, wild strains may actively down-regulate expression in proportion to gene dose, known as dosage compensation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated isogenic aneuploid–euploid strain pairs for three wild strains. We isolated euploid derivatives of strain T73_Chr8-4n (denoting four copies of Chr 8 in the diploid strain) and YJM428_Chr16-4n by serial passaging for many generations. We also used drug-based selection to isolate a mutant of naturally euploid oak-soil strain YPS163 in which Chr 8 was amplified (see ‘Materials and methods’). We then conducted duplicate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis in the isogenic aneuploid–euploid pairs and identified genes on Chr 8 or Chr 16 with lower-than-expected expression, as above. Because the strains are nominally isogenic (see ‘Materials and methods’), most expression differences between the strain pairs are an active response to the aneuploidy.</p><p>Recapitulating the results shown above, roughly 11–36% of amplified genes, depending on the strain, showed lower-than-expected expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue points), while 2–4% showed higher-than-expected expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, magenta points). Few of these genes participate in the common response to chromosome amplification, suggesting a mechanism of dosage compensation. A substantial fraction of the genes scored in the forced YPS163 aneuploid displayed reduced expression, even though this strain had little time to adapt to the aneuploidy. Thus, dosage compensation is likely an inherent trait in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that functions at a subset of yeast genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Gene classification further refines expression patterns at amplified genes</title><p>To more accurately define genes subject to dosage compensation vs heritable polymorphisms, we next generated isogenic strain panels for oak strain YPS1009 and West African strain NCYC110, in which isogenic diploids carry two, three, or four copies of Chr 12 or Chr 8, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Comparing expression within the isogenic strain panel allows us to identify genes whose expression does not increase linearly as gene copy increases; comparing expression in the panel strains to the closely related euploid reference identifies heritable expression differences in the two strain backgrounds. A comparable panel was developed for laboratory strain W303 aneuploid for Chr 12.

Our results show that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. The reduced expression is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes, some of which may have been selected for during the adaptation to aneuploidy. But reduced expression of other amplified genes—up to 30–36% in some strains—appears to be actively regulated in proportion to increased gene dosage. The prevalence of the dosage compensation found here is likely true for other species and may explain the lack of expression increase previously noted for amplified autosomal genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonarakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuster-Bockler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Woodwark and Bateman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The clear enrichment of specific functional classes—including genes encoding RP and mitochondrial proteins—points to specific targeted processes. While we did not find overwhelming support for the balance hypothesis, dosage compensated genes include several multi-subunit protein complexes and pathways. In the case of RP genes, dosage compensation most likely occurs via feedback to modulate mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Feedback is known to occur for several RP genes, including excess, unassembled L32 that binds a stem loop structure in its own transcript and inhibits intron splicing, perhaps triggering mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dabeva and Warner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vilardell and Warner, 1997</xref>). Our results imply that feedback pertains more broadly to other RP genes, including <italic>RPL15A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>)—notably, this transcript lacks an intron and thus must utilize a mechanism distinct from <italic>RPL32</italic>. The mechanism of dosage compensation at nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes is less clear; however, several mitochondrial proteins are known to regulate translation or stability of other transcripts in shared pathways. For example, unassembled Cox1 protein can suppress translation of the <italic>COX1</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Loon et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mick et al., 2011</xref>), while several TCA-cycle enzymes double as RNA-binding proteins that report on TCA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elzinga et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Jong et al., 2000</xref>). A mode of dosage compensation that functions at the level of transcript abundance may provide an additional level of regulation to control protein stoichiometry.</p><p>Natural isolates are generally tolerant to aneuploidy, whether or not they have had time to adapt to the extra chromosome. We did observe a common expression response in different aneuploid strains, including the up-regulation of oxidoreductases and the down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial translation and respiration. Interestingly, these trends are also seen in DS cells, which are extremely sensitive to reactive-oxygen species (ROS), and perhaps consequently, down-regulate mitochondrial respiration that in turn limits ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helguera et al., 2013</xref>). We found no defect in respiratory capacity in naturally aneuploid yeast, and so the implications of this response in yeast are not clear. Human patients display significant variability in their sensitivity to DS, suggesting genetic effects on DS pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roper and Reeves, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prandini et al., 2007</xref>). Our results also implicate strain-specific responses to Chr 8 amplification, in particular in the genes subject to dosage compensation vs heritably reduced expression. While some of the Class 2a genes could be mis-classified, these results raise the possibility of natural genetic variation in dosage compensation.</p><p>While the expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled in proportion to gene copy, many genes escape dosage compensation in response to aneuploidy and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation. Whole and partial chromosome amplification is common in laboratory selection experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yona et al., 2012</xref>) and is particularly prevalent in laboratory mutants that have an extreme fitness defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koszul et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rancati et al., 2008</xref>). Yet the <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> karyotype is extremely stable, holding at eight or sixteen chromosomes in most pre- and post-genome duplication species, respectively. This suggests that aneuploidy may serve as a transient intermediate, one that can be readily generated—and readily lost—depending on the selective pressures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yona et al. (2012)</xref> showed that selection for increased stress tolerance in the laboratory produced aneuploid strains that eventually gave way to other solutions even when the selective pressure persisted.

T73_Chr8-4n was passaged in liquid YPD culture for ∼275 generations before a euploid derivative was identified by qPCR screening. YJM428_Chr16-4n was passaged for ∼160 generations to produce a triploid strain that was then dissected and underwent mating-type switching to generate a diploid, euploid YJM428_Chr16-2n derivative.</p><p>We also generated two wild-strain panels from YPS1009 (also referred to as YPS1009_Chr12-3n for clarity in the text) and NCYC110 (aka NCYC110_Chr8-4n), and one laboratory strain panel for diploid W303_Chr12-3n (generated by mating a haploid disomic strain, generously provided by A Amon, to the euploid W303). Strain panels for W303_Chr12 and YPS1009_Chr12 were generated by sporulating the trisomic parents and selecting haploid spores with either one or no extra copies of Chr 12. The YPS1009 spores then diploidized after mating-type switching to form isogenic diploid strains having two (2n, i.e., euploid) or four (4n) copies Chr 12. The haploid W303_Chr12 spores were crossed to appropriate W303 strains to generate isogenic diploids with two, three, or four copies of Chr 12. Homozygous strain NCYC110_Chr8-4n was passaged in liquid YPD for ∼427 generations before an isolate with only three Chr 8 copies was identified by qPCR screening. (A similar procedure was performed for YPS1009_Chr12-4n and W303_Chr12-4n to determine the stability of the aneuploidies.) A completely euploid derivative of NCYC110 was isolated shortly after at 444 generations. Aneuploidy of the respective chromosomes in each of the strain panels was initially verified via aCGH and subsequently via genomic sequencing, with periodic confirmation by qPCR to ensure aneuploidy maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Genomic sequencing</title><p>Genomic sequencing was performed on genomic DNA isolated with a Genomic-tip 20/G Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). 1 μg genomic DNA in a total volume of 50 µl in a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube was fragmented with a Diagenode Bioruptor sonication device (Diagenode, Denville, NJ) to a peak fragment size of 300–400 bp, and 1 μg was used as an input into Illumina's TruSeq DNA Library Prep (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Ligation products were purified with the E-Gel SizeSelect System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). All cleanup steps in the genomic library prep were performed with Axy Prep MAG PCR Cleanup beads (Corning, Corning, NY). Genomic libraries were sequenced on Illumina's HiSeq 2000 or HiSeq 2500 System, generating single end 100 bp reads. Sequencing reads were processed with Trimmomatic version 0.30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>), and reads were mapped to a reference genome with strain-specific SNPs (for YPS163, YPS1009, NCYC110, NCYC3290, and W303) or to the S288c reference 58 for all other strains, using BWA version 0.7.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>).

Genomic DNA was sequenced in duplicates for all strain panels. Aneuploid strains were identified as triploid or tetraploid if the median RPKM signal across the chromosome was 0.4–0.7 (to call triploids) or 0.7 to &gt;1.0 (to call tetraploids).

GATK was used to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each remapped strain. We found one homozygous SNP in NCYC110_Chr8-3n and a different homozygous SNP in NCYC110_Chr8-2n that were each identified in both replicates of the strain sequences. We performed a similar procedure for singleton genome sequences from YJM428_Chr16-2n and T73_Chr8-2n and identified 13 or 40 homozygous SNPs; these numbers are in the range of false-positive identifications found in a single replicate, as assessed from the NCYC110_Chr8 analysis above. We conclude from this analysis that there are relatively few legitimate SNPs in passaged strains and that the majority of expression differences are a direct response to the aneuploidy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Cells were harvested for 3 min at 3000 r.p.m., after which time the cells were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at −80°C until RNA extraction.

In the case of K9/K1, NCYC110, and YPS1009, the control was chosen based on the genetically closest known relative at the time of the analysis based on phylogenetic comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fay and Benavides, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kvitek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liti et al., 2009</xref>).

Genes with lower-than-expected expression per gene copy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) were identified as follows:</p><p>For each aneuploid chromosome in each strain, we first removed sub-telomeric genes with skewed measurements since these genes frequently show copy-number differences across strains. We then calculated the chromosome-wide mean and standard deviation of the log<sub>2</sub>(aneuploid vs euploid DNA reads), across all genes on the affected chromosome. For each amplified gene being considered, we took the mean of the log<sub>2</sub>(aneuploid vs euploid DNA reads) measured for that gene specifically; we used this value minus one standard deviation of the chromosome-wide mean (or two standard deviations in the case of the sake strains)—this value served as a gene-specific cutoff for relative mRNA abundance. Genes with lower-than-expected expression per gene copy were identified if the log<sub>2</sub>(aneuploid vs euploid mRNA reads) was less than the filtering cutoff in both replicates (or one replicate for sake strains, which used a more stringent cutoff). This process identified genes whose relative mRNA abundance was lower than the relative DNA abundance at a high confidence interval. Genes whose log<sub>2</sub>(aneuploid vs euploid mRNA reads) difference was more than 1.5X lower (0.6 in log<sub>2</sub> space) than the euploid control were excluded from the list, since their expression may be influenced by other effects. This identified 838 unique genes from the six aneuploid strains whose expression was lower-than-expected per gene copy, with 111 genes amplified and affected in &gt;1 strain. We also identified amplified genes whose expression was distinctly not affected by dosage compensation as genes whose relative log<sub>2</sub>(mRNA abundance) was within the filtering cutoff for both replicates, excluding genes whose log<sub>2</sub> expression difference was more than 2.5× higher than the euploid control, since their expression may be influenced by other effects. This identified 928 genes whose expression was in the expected range if <italic>no</italic> dosage compensation is at work.

Preprocessed mRNA and DNA abundance data were analyzed further in the context of a new mixture of linear regressions (MLR) model in order to cluster genes according to their DNA/mRNA relationship. Within a given strain panel we modeled the relationship between DNA abundance at gene g from sample i, say X<sub>g,i</sub>, and mRNA abundance Y<sub>g,i</sub>, where both are normalized to euploid controls and considered on the logarithmic scale. Briefly, we first filtered genes that exhibited a nonlinear relationship using a likelihood ratio test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The interpretation of these profiles is not clear and therefore they were removed from further consideration. Data from the remaining genes, which exhibited a linear relationship Y<sub>g,i</sub> = A<sub>g</sub> + B<sub>g</sub> X<sub>g,i</sub> + error<sub>g,i,</sub> were fit to a discrete, random-effects mixture model in order to produce a relationship classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McLachlan and Peel, 2000</xref>). In the proposed MLR model, the five discrete classes correspond to constraints on the intercept α and slope β parameters of the linear regression: (Class 1) α<sub>g</sub> = 0, β<sub>g</sub> = 1, (Class 2a) α<sub>g</sub> &lt; 0, β<sub>g</sub> = 1, (Class 2b) α<sub>g</sub> &gt; 0, β = 1, (Class 3a) β &lt; 1, (Class 3b) β<sub>g</sub> &gt; 1. Class 1 represents genes with no dosage compensation and statistically indistinguishable expression between the 2n strain and paired euploid control. Class 2 represents genes whose expression increases linearly across the strain panel, but whose expression in the aneuploid derivatives is lower (Class 2a) or higher (Class 2b) per gene copy than the paired euploid. In contrast, Class 3 genes show expression changes across the strain panel that are disproportionate to the change in DNA copy, either showing lower (Class 3a) or greater (Class 3b) expression per gene copy as the aneuploidy increases. The inference is stabilized by treating the gene-specific slopes and intercepts as random effects that are constrained by the class structure; this effectively reduces the dimension of the parameter space. Fortuitously, explicit formula is available for the probability density of data within each class. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate the MLR parameters; subsequently, genes were clustered together if they had a high posterior probability of arising from the same discrete class. Genes were classified based on the maximum posterior probability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Further details are provided in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor), Duncan Odom (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers. The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus was that the demonstration that wild yeast strains exhibit gene expression compensation in the face of aneuploidy was of potentially high interest to a broad community. Some substantial criticisms were raised, in particular by Reviewers 1 and 2, which you must carefully address before this can be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The essential revision requirements are: (1) repeat the chromosome titrations you did for Chr12 in strain YPS1009 using the Chr8 strains derived from NCYC110, and this new analysis must include spike-in controls for RNA-seq; (2) much better annotation of the strains used both in main text and in the supplemental.</p><p>Like the three reviewers have done, the Reviewing Editor, Duncan Odom, has gone over your manuscript both editorially and graphic design-wise, and we have made suggestions below that should help improve your clarity and presentation. One extremely important point: you must re-tool your figures with an eye towards red–green color blindness.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting paper looking at aneuploidy in non-lab strains of yeast. They conclude that natural isolates are more tolerant of aneuploidy than the lab strain W303 and they suggest that this is related to an apparent dosage compensation of gene expression from the amplified chromosome.</p><p>I think this is important work, and it is getting to the heart of several key conundrums in the aneuploidy field. Because it's such an important problem, I think the paper should do more to convincingly show the results and how they contrast with the lab strain results. I suspect, as the authors find in one of the RNAseq experiments, that their results are not actually as different as it first seems.</p><p>1) The first set of RNAseq experiments are problematic for a few reasons. First, they are not performed with isogenic strains that only differ by presence/absence of a CNV. The additional variation in gene expression introduced by all the other genetic differences going on could be partly responsible for the observed differences. I think it is crucial to also show at least a few paired euploid samples of similar relatedness to demonstrate the degree of expression difference expected in the absence of any CNVs. The reason this is important can be best explained by imagining that the base expression really does change proportional to the copy number. Now imagine additional genetic differences cause many genes to change in expression by, say 1.5-fold up or down, a result that has frequently been observed in comparisons between natural isolates. In the simplest possible additive model of expression, many genes in the CNV would now show greater or less than expected changes in expression, but not due to dosage compensation.</p><p>Also, I think the data from these experiments would be much easier to interpret if displayed as histograms (e.g. something like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper from Amon and Torres) in addition to the scatter plot view. Furthermore, the analysis would be much more compelling if compared directly to data from at least the W303 gene expression series, and preferably additional aneuploid lab strains (for example, the Hughes et al. deletion collection strains that are aneuploid, or some of the aneuploids isolated from experimental evolution). Though on average genes in the CNV change proportionately with copy number in these lab strain experiments, that is certainly not universally true, nor should it be: the W303 experiments, for example, have the same problem as described above, that is, the layering of multiple expression signatures, in this case the stress and/or growth rate response coupled with the copy number driven expression. Evolved strains and deletion strains have additional mutations as well that may affect expression on top of the perturbation from the CNV. Direct comparison to these data would be very convincing if there really is a big difference here. It certainly wouldn't be the first time that lab strains are outliers in behavior, so I am inclined to believe there is something to see, but it should be shown explicitly.</p><p>2) Some of the concerns about the first set of experiments are mitigated by the dosage series generated for the second batch of RNAseq. Here, we have both isogenic lines carrying different numbers of chromosomes, and a direct comparison with the lab strain. The fact that the apparent dosage compensation is present in the W303 3N strain in this experiment is one thing that makes me suspect these results are not as different as initially posited (and see the paragraph above for ways of demonstrating that I'm wrong). Also, that the 4N W303 strain is the aberrant one, and grows most poorly, hints again at the issue with confounding additional gene expression signatures.</p><p>Additionally, I really wish that chromosome 12 had not been the core element of this part of the paper. The rDNA array is on chromosome 12, and differences in repeat number can change the size of the chromosome by up to a megabase. In the W303 experiments, chromosome 12 disomy causes a growth defect that I definitely would agree fits the definition of “extreme.” Also problematic, different strains carry polymorphisms in the rDNA that cause all sorts of potentially confounding phenotypes, such as issues with replication (see Kwan et al. 2013 PLoS Genetics), a problem that might be particularly important for aneuploids. I think the experiments are still interesting, of course, but they are difficult to interpret without some indication that the rDNA is similar in sequence and copy number in the different strain backgrounds. A chromosome 8 series in W303 (or at least one other matched set) would also be helpful in addressing the generalizability of the observations with 12.</p><p>3) The remaining parts of the paper are nice follow-up experiments, including the analysis over other strains of genes that are found in CNVs more or less frequently, and the plasmid expression experiments. I have no major comments about these analyses and appreciated their inclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The Hose et al. manuscript examines the extent of dosage compensation within wild yeast strains. The work examines RNA-seq data and uses a new model (mixture of linear regression) to identify distinct classes of dosage compensation.

At the known yeast mutation rate, this would result in roughly 2-3 mutations pre haploid genome content (or as many as 12 mutations in their strain as it is tetraploid). As anueploidy tolerating mutations are known to arise quickly (Torres et al. Cell 2010), it is unclear whether the observed differences arise from changes in aneuploidy or mutations.

The reviewer is absolutely correct that other genetic differences can contribute to the expression differences between aneuploid strains and their paired euploid references. This is the main motivation for the strain panels that we focused on in the paper, which do not suffer from this limitation.</p><p>However, to fully address the reviewer’s concern, we have now added additional sequencing data for three aneuploid strains (two natural aneuploids and one derived aneuploid) and their isogenic euploid partners. The strains in each pair were derived from one another and differ only in the number of affected chromosomes (as supported by SNP analysis in the paired strains). The addition of this analysis allowed us to substantially expand the number of dosage-compensated genes identified, bolstering in the statistical power throughout the paper. The new analysis was done with spike-in normalization controls, which gives virtually the same data as RPKM normalization.</p><p><italic>Also, I think the data from these experiments would be much easier to interpret if displayed as histograms (e.g. something like</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>in the recent</italic> eLife <italic>paper from Amon and Torres) in addition to the scatter plot view.

Because of the completely aberrant response of this strain, it is not appropriate to use the strain as a reference point. We now provide data for five different strains backgrounds for which we have paired aneuploid-euploid strains or strain panels, with few identified SNPs; furthermore, any SNPs are unlikely to be common across the five strain groups. Thus, the simplest explanation is that our results are reflecting on dosage compensation in natural strains.</p><p>It is likely true that the W303_Chr12-3n strain utilizes some form(s) of dosage compensation at specific genes, and in fact our results support this conclusion. We have clarified this point in the main text (in subsection headed “Dosage compensation is mediated by multiple mechanisms”). Because the manuscript now covers a large number of different aneuploid strains, we have opted not to show individual histograms for each strain but rather focus on pooled analysis of the genes across strains.</p><p><italic>2) Some of the concerns about the first set of experiments are mitigated by the dosage series generated for the second batch of RNAseq.

Incidentally, Chr 12 amplification in W303 was reported to be among the least toxic aneuploidy in that strain background (Sheltzer et al<italic>.</italic> PNAS 2012). With the newly added data, we now have five isogenic aneuploid-euploid strain groups spanning three chromosomes (Chr 12, Chr 8, and Chr 16).

Redoing all their RNA-seq studies is unnecessary if spike in normalization for one strain relative to its closely related euploid shows largely identical results</italic>.</p><p>As requested by this reviewer and the editors, we have redone some of the RNA-seq analysis with spike-in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> controls (including a biological replicate of the entire NCYC110 strain panel as required by the editor and duplicated aneuploid-euploid strain pairs for three new strains). The bottom line is that the spike-in normalization gives data that are virtually indistinguishable from RPKM normalized data, and the dosage-compensation phenotype we previously reported in the NCYC110_Chr8 strain panel is clearly recapitulated in the new replicates normalized by spike-in controls.</p><p>To summarize these experiments:</p><p>The spike-in approach we use involves mixing a precise number of <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> cells (grown in a single large-scale batch) with each <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain under consideration. A critical aspect is that the <italic>Sz. pombe:S. cerevisiae</italic> cell ratio must be identical across all strains and samples.</p><p>This is extremely challenging to do with wild strains, many of which are flocculent and thus impossible to count accurately. We went to extreme lengths to carefully estimate cell numbers for mixing purposes. Because mixing is done on a cell-count basis before RNA isolation, library preps, and bulk sequencing, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reads across samples can be normalized by setting the slope of <italic>Sz. pombe</italic> read counts across samples to 1.0.</p><p>We show that the results are virtually the same as RPKM normalization, through three approaches. First, we compared the slope across biological replicates that were normalized with each of the two methods; because these are replicates, the slope across all genes is expected to be 1.0. Indeed, the average slope across replicates for spike-in normalization (1.052 +/- 0.042) was very similar to the average slope across replicates normalized by RPKM (0.992 +/- 0.026). The slope when comparing spike-in normalized data to RPKM normalized data was effectively 1.0, indicating that the values across the transcriptome were nearly identical when normalized with the two approaches. Second, we compared the slope across the transcriptome when comparing aneuploid strains to their isogenic euploid partners: the average slope is essentially the same (1.07 or 1.01) when the data were normalized by spike-in controls versus RPKM, although the standard deviation was significantly lower for RPKM (0.019) compared to spike-in controls (0.15), likely owing to the challenges with cell -based spiking. Third, we used the replicated NCYC110_Chr8 strain panel data to assess the fit between the mRNA and DNA abundance across NCYC110_Chr8 cells carrying two, three, or four copies of Chr 8. Recall that for a given gene, an mRNA <italic>versus</italic> DNA slope &lt;1.0 is indicative of dosage compensation, whereas cells that escape compensation display a slope of the mRNA-DNA fit of 1.0 (or in some cases higher). The mRNA-DNA slopes across the panel are virtually indistinguishable when the data are normalized by RPKM versus spike-in controls (slope of the slopes = 0.9997). This indicates that the mRNA-versus-DNA fits across the dataset are the same whether the data are normalized by spike-in controls or RPKM.</p><p>Finally, in accordance with the editor’s request, we reassessed the mRNA-DNA fit across the new NCYC110_Chr8 strain panel data normalized by the spike-in controls, compared to the strain-panel data normalized by RPKM as reported in the original manuscript. Of the 27 genes previously classified as dosage-compensated (Class 3a), 24 (89%) have reduced mRNA-DNA slopes (&lt;1.0) in the newly added spike-in normalized NCYC110_Chr8 strain panel – thus the new data fully support our original analysis.</p><p>The Methods section has been updated to describe the spike-in controls and to briefly summarize our conclusions that the two normalization methods give essentially the same data.

We added a short description of this analysis to the Methods and clarify that most of the effects we see are likely to be due to the aneuploidy.
