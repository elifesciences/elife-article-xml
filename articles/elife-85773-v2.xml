channels are important regulators of cellular excitability and control action potential repolarization in the heart and brain. K<sub>V</sub> channel mutations lead to disordered cellular excitability. Loss-of-function mutations, for example, result in membrane hyperexcitability, a characteristic of epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmias. Interventions intended to restore K<sub>V</sub> channel function have strong therapeutic potential in such disorders. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and PUFA analogues comprise a class of K<sub>V</sub> channel activators with potential applications in the treatment of arrhythmogenic disorders such as long QT syndrome (LQTS). LQTS is caused by a loss-of-function of the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel – a tetrameric potassium channel complex formed by K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and associated KCNE1 protein subunits. We have discovered a set of aromatic PUFA analogues that produce robust activation of the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, and a unique feature of these PUFA analogues is an aromatic, tyrosine head group. We determine the mechanisms through which tyrosine PUFA analogues exert strong activating effects on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel by generating modified aromatic head groups designed to probe cation–pi interactions, hydrogen bonding, and ionic interactions. We found that tyrosine PUFA analogues do not activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel through cation–pi interactions, but instead do so through a combination of hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyunsaturated fatty acids</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>long QT syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019180</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>850622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-01885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL131461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>H Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Changing substituents on the aromatic rings of polyunsaturated fatty acid analogues tailors their activation effect on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel and thus their therapeutic potential for long QT syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The delayed rectifier potassium channel (I<sub>Ks</sub>) underlies a critical repolarizing current that determines the timing of the ventricular action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</xref>). The cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> current is mediated by the association of the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel K<sub>V</sub>7.1 α-subunit with the KCNE1 β-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramochkin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>). The K<sub>V</sub>7.1 α-subunit consists of six transmembrane spanning segments, denoted S1–S6 where S1–S4 form the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and S5–S6 form the pore domain (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). The S4 segment contains several positively charged arginine residues that allow S4 to move outward, toward the extracellular side of the membrane, when the membrane becomes depolarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broomand et al., 2003</xref>). This outward movement of the S4 is transformed into pore opening as a result of conformational changes in the S4–S5 linker of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2018</xref>). Co-expression of KCNE1 with K<sub>V</sub>7.1 imparts a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, slower activation kinetics, and increased single-channel conductance compared to K<sub>V</sub>7.1 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yang and Sigworth, 1998</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel can lead to an arrhythmogenic disorder known as long QT syndrome (LQTS), which predisposes individuals to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernández-Falgueras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Roden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Watanabe et al., 2005</xref>). Current treatments for LQTS include pharmacological intervention with β-blockers or surgical implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Waddell-Smith and Skinner, 2016</xref>). However, limitations of these treatments generate a need for novel therapeutic interventions to treat LQTS.</p><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are amphipathic molecules composed of a charged hydrophilic head group and a long, polyunsaturated hydrophobic tail group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jump, 2002</xref>). It is well documented that PUFAs form a group of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators that interact with the channel VSD, thus influencing the voltage dependence of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moreno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elinder and Liin, 2017</xref>). The ability of PUFAs to activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel makes them great candidates for potential LQTS therapeutics. PUFAs promote I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation through an electrostatic interaction between the negative charge of the hydrophilic PUFA head and positively charged arginine residues in the S4 segment of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elinder and Liin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Börjesson and Elinder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Larsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>). This electrostatic activation of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel is seen as a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation that leads to increases in I<sub>Ks</sub> current. Recently, it has been reported that PUFAs increase I<sub>Ks</sub> current through two independent effects: one on S4 (as described above) and one on the PD through an electrostatic interaction with a positively charged lysine residue located in S6 (K326) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2018</xref>). This electrostatic interaction with the K326 mediates an increase in the maximal conductance (G<sub>max</sub>) of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism through which the negatively charged PUFA head group interacts with positive charges of S4 and S6 is called the lipoelectric hypothesis where the polyunsaturated tail of PUFAs and PUFA analogues incorporates into the cell membrane via hydrophobic interactions and electrostatically attracts the outermost gating charges of S4 as well as positively charged K326 in the S6 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohannon et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>PUFA analogues that have the most robust effects on increasing I<sub>Ks</sub> current are those that have a low pKa value and thus possess a negatively charged head group at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohannon et al., 2020</xref>). Examples include PUFAs with glycine or taurine head groups that possess either a carboxyl or sulfonyl head group, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohannon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liin et al., 2016</xref>). We have observed that another PUFA analogue, N-(α-linolenoyl) tyrosine (NALT), has robust effects on I<sub>Ks</sub> current. NALT is unique in that it possesses a large aromatic tyrosine head group rather than a carboxyl or sulfonyl group present in most of the PUFAs and PUFA analogues that we have characterized. NALT induces a potent leftward shift in the voltage dependence of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation and an increase in the maximal channel conductance, thus increasing overall I<sub>Ks</sub> current. Here, we aim to determine the mechanism behind I<sub>Ks</sub> activation by NALT using PUFA analogues with aromatic and modified aromatic head groups. Better understanding of the mechanism of how these aromatic PUFA analogues have more potent I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation effects could help to aid future drug development for LQTS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diverse PUFA analogues with a tyrosine head group activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel</title><p>To measure the effects of the aromatic PUFA analogues on the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, we expressed the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel complex in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We co-injected mRNA for the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 α-subunit and the KCNE1 β-subunit to achieve expression of tetrameric I<sub>Ks</sub> channels. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings, we applied depolarizing voltage steps to activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) before and after applying four different tyrosine PUFA analogues: N(α-linolenoyl)-tyrosine (NALT), linoleoyl tyrosine (Lin-tyrosine), docosahexanoyl tyrosine (DHA-tyrosine), and pinoleoyl tyrosine (Pin-tyrosine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). From these voltage-clamp experiments, we are also able to acquire dose–response curves for different aspects of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation, including changes in overall I<sub>Ks</sub> current (I/I<sub>0</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), changes in the voltage dependence of activation (ΔV<sub>0.5</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and changes in the maximal channel conductance (Gmax/Gmax<sub>0</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). NALT, Lin-tyr, DHA-tyr, and Pin-tyr all activate the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel by shifting the voltage dependence of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation to more negative voltages (NALT: ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> = –56.2 ± 3.6 mV; Lin-tyr: –74.4 ± 4.1 mV; DHA-tyr: –72.0 ± 4.9 mV; and Pin-tyr: –60.5 ± 5.8 mV at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and increasing the maximal conductance (NALT: 1.43 ± 0.3; Lin-tyr: 2.0 ± 0.6; DHA-tyr: 1.5 ± 0.2; and Pin-tyr: 1.8 ± 0.4 at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, the left shift in V<sub>0.5</sub> and the increase in G<sub>max</sub> increase the overall I<sub>Ks</sub> current measured in response to a voltage step close to 0 mV (NALT: 5.14 ± 1.2; Lin-tyr: 12.8 ± 2.1; DHA-tyr: 5.0 ± 0.9; and Pin-tyr: 5.8 ± 0.9 at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: see ‘Materials and methods’ for calculation of I/I<sub>0</sub>). In comparison, Lin-glycine (a known I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activator; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) causes only modest leftward voltage shifts (ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> = –30.8 ± 5.4 mV at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), but similar increases in maximal conductance (2.6 ± 0.5 at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and I/I<sub>0</sub> current (6.7 ± 1.1 at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) as for most tyrosine PUFAs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) analogues with a tyrosine head group are strong I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of two electrode voltage-clamp setup (inset: I<sub>Ks</sub> channel cartoon + PUFA [pink]).

Cation–pi interactions take place between the pi-electrons of an aromatic ring and positively charged (cationic) groups (such as arginine and lysine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Infield et al., 2021</xref>). If tyrosine PUFAs activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel via cation–pi interactions, we would expect that other aromatic groups (such as phenylalanine) would similarly affect I<sub>Ks</sub> activation. We tested two different PUFA analogues that both contain a phenylalanine head group – linoleoyl phenylalanine (Lin-phe) and N-(α-linolenoyl) phenylalanine (NAL-phe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Lin-phe and NAL-phe both increase I/I<sub>0</sub> (Lin phe: 2.6 ± 0.3; and NAL-phe: 2.4 ± 0.5 at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>), causing a modest leftward shift in the V<sub>0.5</sub> (Lin-phe: ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> = –13.1 ± 2.9 mV; and NAL-phe: –12.5 ± 3.8 mV at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). However, Lin-phe and NAL-phe have minimal effects on the G<sub>max</sub> (Lin phe: 1.2 ± 0.1; and NAL-phe: 1.2 ± 0.2 at 20 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). All of these effects (I/I<sub>0</sub>, ΔV<sub>0.5</sub>, and G<sub>max</sub>) are reduced in comparison with tyrosine PUFAs, with Lin-phe and NAL-phe having an attenuated effect compared to NALT (p=0.51 and p=0.44, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and resulting in a significantly smaller increases in I/I<sub>0</sub> compared to Lin-tyrosine (***p=0.0004 and ***p=0.0004, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, both NALT and Lin-tyrosine cause a significantly greater ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> compared to NAL-phe and Lin-phe (****p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these differences suggest that cation–pi interactions are not the primary mechanism through which tyrosine PUFAs activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. Rather, our data suggest that it is actually the presence of the distal –OH group on the aromatic head group that is critical for the potent activation of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel because the loss of this –OH group (Lin-phe and NAL-phe) results in pronounced reductions in PUFA efficacy.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The distal hydroxyl (–OH) group of tyrosine polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) analogues is necessary for robust I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of NAL-phe and Lin-phe.

One explanation for this discrepancy is that the –OH group can also behave as a hydrogen bond donor. To determine whether hydrogen bonding contributes to the activating effects of tyrosine PUFA analogues, we applied the modified aromatic PUFA analogue N-(α-linolenoyl)–3-fluoro-L-tyrosine (3F-NALT), which has a fluorine atom adjacent to the tyrosine hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The addition of the fluorine atom reduces the pK<sub>a</sub> of the distal hydroxyl group and increases the hydrogen bonding ability of said group in 3F-NALT as compared to NALT.

To identify the residue with which the tyrosine head group hydrogen bonds, we mutated residues in the S3–S4 loop capable of hydrogen bond formation. We chose residues in the S3–S4 loop because it is located near the top of the PUFA head group in the proposed binding site for PUFAs to have the voltage-dependence effect. We individually mutated serine 217 (S217A), glutamine 220 (Q220L), threonine 224 (T224V), and serine 225 (S225A) and compared the effects of NALT on mutated channels compared to the WT I<sub>Ks</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). We found that S217A, Q220L, and S225A showed similar maximum shifts in voltage-dependent activation compared to the wild-type channel (WT + NALT: ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> = –56.1 ± 3.6 mV; S217A + NALT: –65.9 ± 3.7 mV; Q220L + NALT: –59.5 ± 11.1 mV; S225A + NALT: –52.4 ± 3.7 mV at 20 μM, ns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

To determine whether this effect was specific to compounds with the ability to form hydrogen bonds, we compared the effects of hydrogen-bonding NALT and non-hydrogen-bonding NAL-phe on T224V mutant channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast to the attenuation of the overall voltage shift observed when NALT was applied to the T224V, there was no difference in the voltage-shifting effects of NAL-phe between the T224V mutant and WT channels (WT + NAL-phe:ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> = –12.5 ± 3.8 mV; T224V + NAL-phe: –13.2 ± 2.6 mV at 20 μM, ns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>).

Tyrosine PUFAs shift the voltage dependence of activation to negative potentials and increase the maximal conductance, which together contribute to increases in overall I<sub>Ks</sub> current. The tyrosine head group is an aromatic ring with a distal -OH group in the para-position. Tyrosine PUFA analogues have the potential to interact with the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel through several candidate mechanisms involving either the aromatic ring or the -OH group (or both). The aromatic ring could modulate I<sub>Ks</sub> channel function through cation–pi interactions with positively charged groups on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. In addition, the -OH group could participate in electrostatic interactions and/or act as a hydrogen bond donor. In this work, we elucidate the mechanisms of this PUFA-induced activation of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel by applying PUFA analogues with modified aromatic head groups designed to test specific chemical interactions between the PUFA head group and the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</p><p>If cation–pi interactions were the primary mechanism through which tyrosine PUFAs activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, we would expect similar activating effects of PUFA analogues with aromatic rings that lack the –OH group, such as phenylalanine. However, PUFA analogues with phenylalanine head groups (Lin-phe and NAL-phe) do not activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel to the same degree as PUFA analogues with a tyrosine head group (Lin-tyr and NALT) and display significant reductions in efficacy for increases in I/I<sub>0</sub> and shifts in the V<sub>0.5</sub>. Further evidence that cation–pi interactions are not a predominant mechanism for I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation by tyrosine PUFA analogues comes from experiments applying fluorinated phenylalanine PUFAs (4F-NAL-phe and 3,4,5F-NAL-phe), which can be used as a tool to probe cation–pi interactions in ion channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pless et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pless et al., 2014</xref> demonstrated that tri-fluorination of phenylalanine disperses the electrostatic surface potential that is necessary for cation–pi interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pless et al., 2014</xref>). Disruption of the electrostatic surface potential through addition of fluorine atoms to the NAL-phe head group (3,4,5F-NAL-phe), therefore, is expected to reduce the efficacy of 3,4,5F-NAL-phe in comparison to NAL-phe alone. However, we find the opposite when we apply 3,4,5F-NAL-phe to the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, and see that 3,4,5F-NAL-phe is a more potent activator of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel compared to NAL-phe alone. Together, these data suggest that cation–pi interactions are not the primary mechanism through which these aromatic PUFA analogues activate the cardiac I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</p><p>When we look at several fluorinated and brominated phenylalanine PUFA analogues, we find specifically that 3,4,5F-NAL-phe has significantly greater effects on I/I<sub>0</sub> and ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> compared to NAL-phe alone. While not statistically significant, 4Br-, 4F-, and 3,4,5F-NAL-phe also lead to some of the most consistent increases in G<sub>max</sub> among the PUFA analogues tested in this work, with each of these compounds leading to a twofold increase in G<sub>max</sub>. These data suggest that aromatic PUFA analogues with highly electronegative atoms on the distal end of the aromatic head group have the most pronounced effects on the maximal conductance of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. Although brominated and fluorinated phenylalanine analogues increase the maximal conductance of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, these modified PUFAs still fail to recapitulate the leftward ΔV<sub>0.5</sub> observed with tyrosine PUFA analogues. While the –OH group of tyrosine PUFA analogues is indeed strongly electronegative, it can also act as a hydrogen bond donor. When we applied a fluorinated tyrosine PUFA (3F-NALT) to increase hydrogen bonding abilities, we found that this leads to a stronger leftward shift in the voltage dependence of I<sub>Ks</sub> activation. This suggests that hydrogen bonding via the –OH group contributes to the left-shifting effects of voltage-dependent activation through effects on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel voltage sensor. Most notably, these results suggest that specific modifications to the aromatic PUFA head group can preferentially improve either the voltage-shifting or maximal conductance effects of PUFA analogues. Our data suggests that adding highly electronegative groups to an aromatic ring, such as bromine and fluorine, most consistently improve the maximal conductance-increasing effects and reduce voltage dependence-shifting effects relative to PUFA analogues with a tyrosine or phenylalanine head group. On the other hand, we found that reducing the pK<sub>a</sub> of the –OH group (and increasing the potential for hydrogen bonding), while leaving the effect on G<sub>max</sub> intact, preferentially improves the voltage-shifting effects on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that PUFA analogues have two independent effects on I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activation. PUFA analogues are known to shift the voltage dependence of activation in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel through electrostatic effects on the channel voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). This is mediated by interactions of the negative PUFA head group with the outermost positively charged arginine residues located in the S4 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, though, a second effect on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel pore has been reported to influence the maximal conductance of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2018</xref>). This is mediated through electrostatic interactions between the PUFA head groups and a positively charged lysine residue in the S6 segment – K326 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the K<sub>v</sub>7.1 (KCNQ1) channel (the pore-forming domain for the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>) identified two separate high-occupancy sites for linoleic acid: site 1 at R231 in the S4 segment, and site 2 at K326 in the S6 segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>). We here show that the more effective aromatic PUFAs also act on these sites in S4 and S6. To do this, we selected the best V<sub>0.5</sub> shifting aromatic PUFA (Lin-tyr) to test on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel with the S4 mutation R231Q. Additionally, we selected the best G<sub>max</sub> increasing aromatic PUFA (3,4,5F-NAL-phe) to test on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel with S6 mutation K326C. The mutation R231Q decreases the V<sub>0.5</sub> shifting effect of Lin-tyr by half, indicating that Lin-tyr is shifting the voltage dependence by creating an electrostatic interaction with the positive charges on the voltage sensor. Conversely, the mutation K326C almost completely removed the G<sub>max</sub> increasing effect of 3,4,5F-NAL-phe. To demonstrate that these effects are also independent of each other in aromatic PUFAs, we evaluate the V<sub>0.5</sub> shifting effect and the G<sub>max</sub> increasing effect of Lin-tyr on both mutations. The R231Q mutation decreases V<sub>0.5</sub> shifting effect but does not change the G<sub>max</sub> effect of Lin-tyr. While the K326 mutation decreases the G<sub>max</sub> effect but does not change the V<sub>0.5</sub> shifting effect of Lin-tyr. We therefore propose that the increased effects of the aromatic PUFAs, compared to non-aromatic PUFAs, are due to the additional hydrogen bonding in site 1 and electrostatic interactions in site 2 to better anchor them in these binding sites to increase their effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As mentioned above, we also show that the aromatic rings have the potential to be modified to give preferential effects on either the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel voltage sensor or channel pore.</p><p>Our experiments with NAL-Phe and 3F-NALT show that the hydrogen bonding capacity of the –OH on the tyrosine of NALT is necessary for it to have a more effective voltage dependence shift effect. We further discovered the specific details of the hydrogen bond interactions between this –OH group of NALT and the S3–S4 loop of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. We mutated all residues capable of hydrogen bonding in the S3–S4 loop, removing their ability to hydrogen bond and tested whether this changed the NALT voltage dependence shifting effect. The voltage dependence of mutations S217A, Q220L, and S225A was shifted to the same degree by NALT as the wild-type I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. However, the voltage dependence of mutation T224V was shifted significantly less than the WT I<sub>Ks</sub> channels. This shows that the –OH group on the tyrosine of NALT hydrogen bonds with T224V, thereby improving the PUFA’s ability to shift the voltage dependence. This hydrogen bond interaction between PUFAs and the 3–4 loop of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel is a novel mechanism to increase the effect of PUFAs to activate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel. These data suggest that the drugs designed to target this interaction would be more effective at shifting I<sub>Ks</sub> channel voltage dependence.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that different aromatic PUFA analogues not only increase PUFA efficacy on activating the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, but their specific effects on I<sub>Ks</sub> function can be modulated independently, either increasing the maximal conductance or voltage-shifting effect. Patients with LQTS can have mutations in the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel that causes either a decrease in G<sub>max</sub> or a rightward shift of voltage dependence. By independently modulating PUFAs to either increase G<sub>max</sub> or cause a leftward shift in voltage dependence, we may be able to design therapies that are more personalized to each patient’s specific LQTS mutation. This novel mechanistic understanding of how aromatic PUFAs have these effects on the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel may help to aid drug development for LQTS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 channel cRNA were transcribed using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion). 50 ng of cRNA was injected at a 3:1, weight:weight (K<sub>V</sub>7.1:KCNE1) ratio into defolliculated <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes (Ecocyte, Austin, TX) for I<sub>Ks</sub> channel expression.

Electrophysiological recordings were obtained using Clampex 10.3 software (Axon, pClamp, Molecular Devices). During the application of PUFAs, the membrane potential was stepped every 30 s from –80 mV to 0 mV for 5 s before stepping to –40 mV and back to –80 mV to ensure that the PUFA effects on the current at 0 mV reached steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A voltage-step protocol was used to measure the current vs. voltage (I–V) relationship before PUFA application and after the PUFA effects had reached steady state for each concentration of PUFA. Cells were held at –80 mV followed by a hyperpolarizing prepulse to –140 mV to make sure all channels are fully closed.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wayland WL Cheng (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that these results are solid and interesting. However, reviewers also raised several concerns that should be addressed by the authors. Essential revisions should include:</p><p>1) The choice of NALT as the focus of this study is not fully clear; please clarify.</p><p>2) You may wish to reconsider the conclusion that T224 forms a hydrogen bond with NALT or provide complementary evidence to support this claim (see full comments from reviewer #3).</p><p>3) Please clarify the rationale for the mutagenesis scan in the S3-S4 loop (reviewer #2).</p><p>4) The claim that aromatic PUFA analogues act through similar mechanisms to non-aromatic PUFAs would be strengthened by showing the (lack of/reduced) effects of aromatic PUFA analogues on conductance for the mutant R231Q/Q234R, or the (lack of/reduced) effects on deltaV0.5 for K326C mutants, as indicated by reviewers #1 and #3. In this context, it would be expected that the addition of Lin-Tyr, which causes significant effects on both Gmax and deltaV0.5, would present reduced effects in both K326C and R231Q/Q234R mutants.</p><p>5) We would recommend revising the text according to all comments raised by the reviewers and listed in the individual reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The abstract and introduction focus the aim of the work on the identification of mechanisms underlying the effect of N-a-linoleoyl Tyr (NALT) on Iks. However, four different Tyr PUFA analogues are actually used in this work, of which not NALT but Lin-Tyr has the most striking effect on Iks. It does produce a left shift of -74 mV and duplicates Gmax, resulting in an overall increase of 12.8 times IKs (I/Io). It would be interesting to explain why the focus is centered on studying NALT as opposed to Lin-Tyr, which seems to be more effective in increasing Iks.</p><p>As stated in this work and shown previously in other publications by the lab, it is convincingly shown that the Tyr PUFAs exert two different effects, by left-shifting the G-V and/or increasing channel conductance. It is clear that both effects can contribute synergistically to the net increase of IKs (I/Io). Coincident large effects in both (e.g. Lin-Tyr, -74.4 mV shift, and 2.0 Gmax increase) or modest effects of both (e.g. NAL-Phe, -13.1 mV shift, and 1.2 Gmax increase) result in large (12.5) or moderate (2.5) increase of I/Io. However, if one effect is predominant, it seems that the influence on IKs is more directly related to the increase in Gmax. For example, NALT produces a large shift of -56.2 mV and mild effects on the Gmax (1.43) which results in a 5.14 increase in IKs. Although a significantly larger shift is produced by 3F-NALT (-69.3) with similar effects on Gmax (1.3), however, this has no remarkable effect on IKs (5.0) as compared with NALT. When adding 3,4,5F-NAL-Phe, the effect on the G-V shift is modest (-32.4), but the increase in Gmax is significant (2.4), leading to higher net effects on Iks (7?) even than NALT.

However, four different Tyr PUFA analogues are actually used in this work, of which not NALT but Lin-Tyr has the most striking effect on Iks. It does produce a left shift of -74 mV and duplicates Gmax, resulting in an overall increase of 12.8 times IKs (I/Io). It would be interesting to explain why the focus is centered on studying NALT as opposed to Lin-Tyr, which seems to be more effective in increasing Iks.</p></disp-quote><p>We used NALT as our main compound because it is commercially available.

We now mention this reason in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As stated in this work and shown previously in other publications by the lab, it is convincingly shown that the Tyr PUFAs exert two different effects, by left-shifting the G-V and/or increasing channel conductance. It is clear that both effects can contribute synergistically to the net increase of IKs (I/Io). Coincident large effects in both (e.g. Lin-Tyr, -74.4 mV shift, and 2.0 Gmax increase) or modest effects of both (e.g. NAL-Phe, -13.1 mV shift, and 1.2 Gmax increase) result in large (12.5) or moderate (2.5) increase of I/Io. However, if one effect is predominant, it seems that the influence on IKs is more directly related to the increase in Gmax. For example, NALT produces a large shift of -56.2 mV and mild effects on the Gmax (1.43) which results in a 5.14 increase in IKs. Although a significantly larger shift is produced by 3F-NALT (-69.3) with similar effects on Gmax (1.3), however, this has no remarkable effect on IKs (5.0) as compared with NALT. When adding 3,4,5F-NAL-Phe, the effect on the G-V shift is modest (-32.4), but the increase in Gmax is significant (2.4), leading to higher net effects on Iks (7?) even than NALT. This may have been discussed somewhere else, but maybe the authors can comment on this apparent correlation. The higher effect of 3,4,5F-NAL-Phe on IKs would be worth discussing (Figure 3D)</p></disp-quote><p>Note that all these experiments were made on wt channels, for which a shift in voltage dependence only have a minor effect on the maximum currents at 0 mV. This is due to that the V0.5 of wt channels is close to 0 mV. So, one cannot expect more than around a 2-3-fold increase in currents by a voltage shift. However, the idea is to use these compounds to treat LQTS and many LQTS mutations shift the voltage dependence of the IKs channels to more positive voltages. Therefore, these mutants have a low open probability at 0 mV and PUFAs have more room to increase the currents for these mutants by a voltage shift (&gt;10-fold increase) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85773-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Has the effect of Lin-Tyr on the K326C mutant been tested?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show data on LIN-Tyr on K326C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From previous works it is inferred that 3,4,5F-NAL-Phe on the K326C mutant is specific on Qmax, i.e. it produces a similar effect on V0.5 than WT, is that right?
