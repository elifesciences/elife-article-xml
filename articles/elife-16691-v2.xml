Memory requires a remodeled form of the Set1/COMPASS methyltransferase lacking Spp1, which dimethylates histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2). H3K4me2 recruits the SET3C complex, which plays an essential role in maintaining this mark. Finally, while active <italic>INO1</italic> is associated with Cdk8<sup>-</sup> Mediator, during memory, Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator recruits poised RNAPII PIC lacking the Kin28 CTD kinase.

Such stress-specific genes are typically switched off again when the conditions improve, but can remain primed and ready to be switched on again when needed. This phenomenon is known as “epigenetic transcriptional memory” and allows for a faster or stronger response to the same stress in the future. In fact, these memories can last for a long time, even after the cell divides many times.</p><p>Inside cells, most of the DNA is wrapped tightly around proteins called histones. To activate – or transcribe – a gene, the DNA must be re-packaged to allow better access for specific proteins including the enzyme called RNA polymerase II. This repackaging involves a number of changes including chemical modification of the histone proteins. Genes that have been previously transcribed under stress are packaged in a different way so that they are poised and ready for the next time they are needed. However, the details of this process were not clear.</p><p>Using yeast as a model, D'Urso et al. have dissected the changes that are responsible for priming genes to respond to future events. The yeast gene <italic>INO1</italic>, which shows transcriptional memory, was studied in cells by characterizing the proteins bound at and around the gene and the histone modifications in the region. D'Urso et al. found that a protein called SfI1 bound to this gene only during transcriptional memory and that this binding was critical to start the phenomenon.</p><p>Further experiments showed that transcriptional memory also required altering two protein complexes that normally bind to genes when they are switched on. One complex, which includes an enzyme that modifies histones, was altered so that the histones at the <italic>INO1</italic> gene were marked in a unique way. The other complex was responsible for recruiting an inactive, poised form of RNA polymerase II to the gene, which allowed the gene to be activated when needed. In addition, D'Urso found that other genes that show transcriptional memory in yeast, as well as such genes in human cells, were also marked in the same ways.</p><p>A future challenge will be to understand how different conditions in different organisms can lead to transcriptional memory. Further studies could also explore how this memory phenomenon is inherited and how it influences an organism’s fitness.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16691.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16691.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>nuclear architecture</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>Mediator</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 080484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Urso</surname><given-names>Agustina</given-names></name><name><surname>Marone</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><name><surname>Coukos</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Randise-Hinchliff</surname><given-names>Carlo</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chicago Biomedical Consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Catalyst Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epigenetic transcriptional memory employs a novel regulatory strategy to create a heritable poised state by remodeling and repurposing complexes involved in active transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic transcriptional memory is a mitotically heritable form of 'priming' that changes the speed or strength of expression of select genes based on previous cellular experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Urso and Brickner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). A well-established model for transcriptional memory is the inducible inositol-1-phosphate synthase (<italic>INO1</italic>) gene in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). Upon transcriptional activation, the <italic>INO1</italic> gene moves from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear periphery and physically interacts with the nuclear pore complex (NPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>). Upon repression, <italic>INO1</italic> remains associated with the NPC for up to four generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, maintenance of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> at the NPC represents an epigenetic state.</p><p>Active <italic>INO1</italic> and recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> interact with different Nups through distinct and independent mechanisms. Each interaction involves different <italic>cis</italic>-acting <italic>DNA zip codes</italic>: DNA elements that are both necessary and sufficient for targeting to the nuclear periphery and interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Targeting of active <italic>INO1</italic> to the nuclear periphery requires two Gene Recruitment Sequences (GRSs) in the promoter that interact with the transcription factors Put3 and Cbf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016a</xref>). However, after repression, <italic>INO1</italic> remains associated with the periphery through a mechanism that is independent of the GRSs but requires a separate zip code, the Memory Recruitment Sequence (MRS) and the nuclear pore protein Nup100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). After repression, changes in chromatin structure (H2A.Z incorporation and dimethylation of H3K4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Santos-Rosa et al., 2002</xref>) are required for <italic>INO1</italic> localization at the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>) and binding of poised RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (RNAPII PIC), which poises <italic>INO1</italic> for transcriptional reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). Loss of Nup100, H2A.Z or mutations in the MRS lead to loss of all aspects of <italic>INO1</italic> memory.</p><p>Epigenetic memory is a common phenomenon and may stem from an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Upon repression, both <italic>GAL1-10</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhou and Zhou, 2011</xref>) and <italic>INO1</italic> remain dimethylated on H3K4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Santos-Rosa et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, like <italic>INO1, GAL1-10</italic> localizes at the nuclear periphery and exhibits a faster rate of transcriptional reactivation for up to 8 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tan-Wong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kundu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). Also, 77 of the genes induced by oxidative stress are activated more rapidly in yeast cells that have previously experienced salt stress, an effect that persists for four generations and requires the nuclear pore protein Nup42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Gasch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guan et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, heat shock alters the responsiveness of plants to heat stress for days and correlates with H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lämke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sani et al., 2013</xref>). In human cells, hundreds of the genes that are induced by IFN-γ exhibit stronger or faster induction in cells that have previously experienced IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). This effect persists through 4–7 cell divisions, is associated with H3K4 dimethylation and binding of poised RNAPII and requires physical interaction with the nuclear pore protein Nup98 (homologous to yeast Nup100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, dimethylation of H3K4, binding of poised RNAPII and physical interaction with nuclear pore proteins may play a general, conserved role in memory to epigenetically enhance future gene expression. However, the potential general role of H2A.Z in memory is unclear because loss of H2A.Z has pleiotropic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Halley et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Transcription in eukaryotes is commonly regulated through recruitment of RNAPII. However, transcription can also be stimulated through regulated elongation and, occasionally, through regulated initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwak and Lis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith and Shilatifard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Spencer et al., 1990</xref>). RNAPII often initiates transcription but after synthesizing 30–50 nt, becomes paused through the action of DSIF, NELF, GDOWN1 and the PAF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilmour and Lis, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rougvie and Lis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yamaguchi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Paused RNAPII is phosphorylated on serine 5 of the carboxy terminal domain (CTD). Elongation is stimulated by recruitment of the super elongation complex, which phosphorylates serine 2 on the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marshall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ni et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith and Shilatifard, 2013</xref>). However, RNAPII recruitment does not always lead to initiation. A large number of inactive genes are bound by preinitiation RNAPII, suggesting that they are regulated upstream of transcription initiation in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kouzine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Radonjic et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, starvation of L1 larvae in <italic>C. elegans</italic> leads to RNAPII 'docking' over the promoters of ~750 genes involved in growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maxwell et al., 2014</xref>). This form of RNAPII appears to be neither active nor paused, suggesting that it has not initiated. Following previous expression, unphosphorylated, preinitiation RNAPII binds to the promoter of yeast and human genes that exhibit transcriptional memory, along with PIC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). Finally, the inducible Retinoic Acid Receptor β (<italic>RARB)</italic> promoter is bound to RNAPII and a partially assembled PIC in the absence of inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akoulitchev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pavri et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that transcriptional poising may be a more general regulatory mechanism. Thus, all three steps of transcription can be regulated: PIC assembly/recruitment, transcription initiation and transcription elongation.</p><p>It is unclear how memory is initiated, how and why the memory-specific chromatin structure is established and how this leads to transcriptional poising. Using the yeast <italic>INO1</italic> gene as a model, we address these three questions, providing important new insight about the molecular mechanism of transcriptional memory. <italic>INO1</italic> memory is initiated by binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor to the MRS zip code specifically upon shifting from activating to repressing conditions. Sfl1 is necessary and sufficient to promote targeting to the nuclear periphery and is essential for all aspects of transcriptional memory. <italic>INO1</italic> memory is lost in strains that lack lysine 4 on histone H3 or upon conditional inactivation of the Set1/COMPASS complex, indicating that H3K4me2 is required for memory. During memory, the Set1/COMPASS histone methyltransferase is remodeled by dissociation of the Spp1 subunit. The resulting Spp1<sup>-</sup> complex is capable of H3K4 dimethylation, but not trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morillon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roguev et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wood et al., 2003</xref>). Set3, the eponymous member of the SET3C HDAC complex, is recruited by H3K4me2 to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter through its PHD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pijnappel et al., 2001</xref>). Conditional inactivation of SET3C during memory rapidly disrupts both RNAPII binding and H3K4 dimethylation, suggesting that it is both the reader of this mark and is essential for its persistence. Finally, whereas a core Mediator subunit is required for RNAPII binding under both activating and memory conditions, the form of Mediator containing the Cdk8 kinase module (Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator) binds to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter specifically during memory and is specifically required to recruit poised RNAPII and to enhance future expression.</p><p>To test the generality of our conclusions, we also probed the molecular mechanism of memory for stress-induced genes in yeast and IFNγ-induced genes in HeLa cells. During memory, these genes are marked with H3K4me2, bind RNAPII and are also associated with Cdk8 binding. Furthermore, salt stress-induced memory requires SET3C. This suggests that the mechanism of <italic>INO1</italic> memory is general and highly conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Sfl1 transcription factor binds to the MRS to initiate <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory</title><p>After repression, <italic>INO1</italic> remains associated with the NPC for up to four generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). The interaction of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC is controlled by the MRS zip code (5’-TCCTTCTTTCCC-3’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in this DNA sequence abolish all aspects of memory: after repression, <italic>INO1</italic> is not retained at the nuclear periphery, fails to incorporate H2A.Z or H3K4me2 into the promoter, does not retain RNAPII and exhibits a specific defect in the rate of reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). Because the Sfl1 transcription factor binds to a sequence that is similar to the MRS (5’-TTCTTC-3’) and shows genetic interactions with <italic>NUP120</italic> - a component of the Nup84 subcomplex that is required for transcriptional memory - we hypothesized that the Sfl1 transcription factor interacts with the MRS to promote memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costanzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujita et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Robertson and Fink, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) against Sfl-GFP expressed in wild type and <italic>mrs</italic> mutant strains under activating (-inositol), repressing (+inositol) and memory conditions (-inositol → + inositol, 3 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sfl1 bound to the wild type <italic>INO1</italic> promoter specifically under memory conditions, but not to the <italic>mrs</italic> mutant <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Because the shell constituting the outer 25–30% of the nuclear volume (<italic>i.e.</italic> the 200 nm closest to the nuclear envelope) is unresolvable from the nuclear envelope by light microscopy, a randomly localized spot within the nucleus is expected to colocalize with the nuclear envelope in ~30% of the cells (blue hatched line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>).

However, such null mutations cannot distinguish between H3K4 methylation during active transcription being a prerequisite for memory and H3K4 methylation being required for the establishment or perpetuation/inheritance of memory. Therefore, we employed the Anchor Away system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) to conditionally inactivate COMPASS to assess the importance of H3K4 methylation in the persistence/inheritance of memory. This system allows removal of a nuclear protein tagged with the FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain (FRB), expressed in a strain in which the ribosomal protein Rpl13A is fused to the FK506 binding protein (FKBP12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>). Upon addition of rapamycin, the two will dimerize and, because ribosomes traffic through the nucleus during their biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Warner, 1999</xref>), the nuclear protein will relocalize to the cytoplasm and be depleted from the nucleus. In the absence of the FRB fusion, the RPL13A-2xFKBP12 strain (HHY168) is resistant to rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>) and addition of rapamycin had no effect on H3K4 dimethyltion or RNAPII binding over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under either activating or memory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The Swd1 subunit of COMPASS was tagged with FRB-GFP.

Global H3K4me3 disappeared and H3K4me1 decreased over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We monitored RNAPII binding and H3K4me2 over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under memory conditions (–inositol to +inositol for 3 hr) and activating conditions (-inositol) after addition of rapamycin. In mock-treated cells, H3K4me2 and RNAPII were maintained over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter for ≥2.5 hr (<italic>i.e.</italic> 5.5 hr of repression), confirming that memory persists over this time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Pairwise comparisons were conducted by the following procedure: For each condition, we pooled the ChIP-seq reads from the two replicates into one sample since the ChIP-seq signal from the two replicates were exceedingly similar. Then we calculated the reads coverage score for each pooled sample. The reads coverage score at a given genomic location is defined as the number reads that cover this location after extending each single-end read from start position downstream 150 bp. This score was further normalized by the total number of aligned reads of each sample for comparisons between samples. Second, we divided the genome into overlapping bins using a sliding window of width = 500 bp and a step size of 250 bp. Under this strategy, two consecutive windows will have 250 bp overlap, such that any ChIP signal, as long as shorter than 250 bp, will be completely covered in one window. This could help better detect the differential ChIP signal (compared to using non-overlap 500 bp windows where signal may split at the window boundary). Third, for each window, we define the total coverage score <italic>y</italic> as the summation of reads coverage score from all base pairs within the window. To illustrate our method for differential ChIP-seq analysis, we consider comparing the H3K4 tri-methylation between Repressed (REP) vs Memory (STR) conditions.

Substitution of alanine for tryptophan 140 in the Set3 PHD finger (or loss of Set3; not shown) resulted in loss of H3K4me2 on the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under memory conditions, but had no effect on the H3K4me2 over <italic>INO1</italic> under activating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). ChIP-seq against H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in wild type and <italic>set3∆</italic> strains revealed that <italic>INO1</italic> memory is associated with a Set3-dependent H3K4 dimethylation over the 5’ end of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>; complete dataset: doi:10.5061/dryad.93fv2). The pattern of H3K4 dimethylation observed by ChIP-seq was similar to that revealed by ChIP qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), although the signal over the promoter was less apparent. This may be due to differences in shearing efficiency, aspects of library preparation or differences in normalization between the two techniques. Regardless, we observed clear Set3-dependent H3K4me2 over the <italic>INO1</italic> gene during memory. Trimethylation of H3K4 was observed only under activating conditions and was not Set3 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, loss of Set3 resulted in neither trimethylation of H3K4 nor hyperacetylation of H3/H4 over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that recognition of H3K4me2 by the Set3 PHD domain is required for the persistence of this mark during memory, but is dispensable for the deposition of H3K4me2 under activating conditions. Although Set3 associates with two different histone deacetylases, loss of Set3 does not alter the acetylation of histones over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under any of these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Set3 null mutants have both positive and negative effects on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>SET3</italic> knockout mutants or null mutants having a loss-of-function mutation in the PHD domain also showed a defect in the expression of <italic>INO1</italic> and lower RNAPII binding under activating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and data not shown). To confirm that the role of Set3 is direct and specific, we utilized the Anchor-Away system. Removal of Set3-FRB-GFP from the nucleus upon addition of rapamycin led to rapid loss of both H3K4 dimethylation and RNAPII binding under memory conditions but not under activating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). Therefore, Set3 is required for the persistence of H3K4me2 and RNAPII recruitment under memory conditions. As was observed with inactivation of COMPASS, loss of H3K4me2 preceded loss of RNAPII. This suggests that Set3 has a direct and continuous role in the perpetuation of transcriptional memory by both recognizing H3K4me2 and maintaining this mark after repression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Molecular requirements for PIC assembly during memory</title><p>The binding of RNAPII during memory is not simply a residual effect of previous transcription or the slow disassembly of the PIC after repression. The binding of RNAPII during memory requires the MRS, H2A.Z, Sfl1, COMPASS, SET3C and Nup100; loss of these factors leads to rapid loss of RNAPII from the promoter specifically during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). Furthermore, RNAPII association is <italic>epigenetic</italic>, persisting for ≥6 hr (3–4 generations) after repression, suggesting that it is bound to the promoter of the gene that had been expressed as well as the promoter of that gene in the daughters, granddaughters and great-granddaughters of that cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory is also associated with binding of components of the preinitiation complex, including TBP, TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the most parsimonious interpretation of these results is that memory recruits the PIC, leading to a poised form of the promoter that affects future activation rates.</p><p>To explore the molecular requirements for PIC assembly during memory and compare them to the requirements for PIC assembly during active transcription, we used the Anchor-Away system. Removal of TBP (Spt15), Mediator (Med1), TFIIH (Tfb1) and TFIIK (Kin28) from the nucleus was monitored by confocal microscopy and the effect of loss of each of these components was measured by ChIP against RNAPII and H3K4me2. Inactivation of Spt15, Med1 and Tfb1 caused RNAPII levels to drop over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under both activating and memory conditions, suggesting that TBP, Mediator and TFIIH are necessary for recruitment and stabilization of both active and poised PIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, E, H and K</xref>). However, depletion of Kin28 (Cdk7 in mammals), the kinase module of TFIIK that phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII upon initiation, disrupted RNAPII binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under activating conditions, but not under memory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that Kin28 is not bound to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under memory conditions and that the RNAPII bound during memory is unphosphorylated on the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Kin28 phosphorylation of the CTD regulates the interaction of Mediator with PIC, permitting promoter escape, which does not occur during memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that PIC assembly during memory proceeds through a mechanism very similar to PIC assembly during active transcription, but is arrested upstream of Kin28/TFIIK recruitment, which maintains the PIC in a poised state.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16691.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Molecular requirements for PIC assembly during transcriptional memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>G</bold> and <bold>J</bold>) Confocal micrographs of the indicated proteins fused to FRB-GFP before or after treatment with rapamycin for 90 min.

We performed ChIP against RNAPII and Cdk8 from untreated cells (uninduced), after 24 hr treatment with IFN-γ (active) or 48 hr after removal of IFN-γ (memory).

We propose that memory is initiated by the regulated binding of the Sfl1 transcription factor.

If Sfl1 binding initiates memory, then the duration and heritability of memory may reflect the regulation of Sfl1 binding to the MRS. Sfl1 binds to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter in an MRS-dependent manner specifically during memory. Because Sfl1 binding to other sites is constitutive, it seems that the regulation of Sfl1 binding is context-dependent. Sfl1 binding to the MRS may be influenced in <italic>cis</italic> by other transcription factors or by the changes in chromatin structure that are associated with transcriptional memory.

Although Set3 is recruited by H3K4me2 under both activating and memory conditions, it is only required for RNAPII binding and persistent H3K4 dimethylation under memory conditions, suggesting that SET3C might play a different role during activation. It is unclear if the SET3C deacetylase activity per se is important for establishing a poised state. Although memory is associated with hypoacetylated histones, neither loss of Set3 nor mutation of the MRS leads to acetylation under these conditions. Our results suggest that SET3C either protects H3 lysine 4 from demethylases and/or promotes recruitment of remodeled COMPASS during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Homologous proteins may play a similar role in mammals since Set3 is similar to MLL5 and SET3C is related to NCoR/SMRT.</p><p>The ultimate output of memory is the binding of the poised PIC, which presumably bypasses the rate-limiting step in transcriptional reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The recruitment of poised RNAPII requires H3K4 dimethylation, suggesting that the chromatin changes play an important role in PIC assembly. Assembly of the poised PIC during memory also requires TBP, Mediator and TFIIH, but is independent of Kin28/TFIIK (Cdk7). This is consistent with our observations that Kin28 is not bound to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory and that RNAPII is unphosphorylated on serine 5 of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>). Kin28 phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD disrupts the interaction of Mediator with the PIC, allowing promoter escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, preinitiation poising may be achieved by recruitment of Mediator and PIC in the absence of Kin28.</p><p>PIC recruitment during <italic>INO1</italic> memory requires Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>); inactivation of Cdk8 disrupted RNAPII binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory, resulting in slower reactivation. Cdk8 has also been proposed to enhance transcription by directly phosphorylating transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bancerek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nelson et al., 2003</xref>) and RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knuesel and Taatjes, 2011</xref>) and to regulate transcription elongation and pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galbraith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2013</xref>). As a kinase, it is possible that Cdk8 has multiple, distinct roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nemet et al., 2014</xref>). However, for the genes that exhibit memory in yeast and humans, Cdk8 binding correlates with memory, when these genes are not transcribed. Furthermore, the role of Cdk8 in <italic>INO1</italic> memory is specific: inactivation of Cdk8 altered RNAPII recruitment to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under memory conditions and reduced the rate of reactivation, but had no effect on the RNAPII recruitment to the active gene or on the rate of activation. Reminiscent of the effect of Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator on TFIIH recruitment to the poised human <italic>RARB</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pavri et al., 2005</xref>), Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator occupancy is mutually exclusive with Kin28/TFIIK during <italic>INO1</italic> memory. Thus, we propose that Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator promotes transcriptional poising by facilitating recruitment of unphosphorylated RNAPII and, possibly, by regulating Kin28/TFIIK association with the PIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jeronimo and Robert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Genes that exhibit transcriptional memory are regulated by different mechanisms depending on the previous experiences of the cell. During the first experience of the stimulus, these genes are induced through regulated recruitment of RNAPII. After previous expression, these genes remain associated with poised RNAPII and their reactivation is stimulated by regulated initiation, a mechanism requiring Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator. Thus, epigenetic transcriptional memory is a regulatory strategy that impinges upon a more broadly utilized poising mechanism through the action of nuclear pore proteins, remodeled COMPASS and SET3C. The function of H3K4 dimethylation is likely upstream of RNAPII PIC recruitment. This raises the possibility that some genes might be constitutively poised, independent of the memory-specific regulatory factors. Such genes should be bound to Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator and be rapidly induced, but might not be dimethylated on H3K4 or associated with nuclear pore proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Unless noted otherwise, chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich, media components were from Sunrise Science and Genesee Scientific, oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies, and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs.

The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of FA lysis buffer + protease inhibitor cocktail and loaded into a 1 ml milliTUBE AFA Fiber from Covaris (520130). Chromatin shearing is performed with Covaris E220 focused ultrasonicator (Peak Incident Power: 280 W, Duty Factor; 20%, Cycles per Burst; 200, Time; 12 min). Sheared DNA sizes within 200 to 500 bp were confirmed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel following protease K treatment at 65°C for 2 hr and DNA purification with QIAquick Spin Columns (QIAGEN). Sonicated chromatin was centrifuged in 1.5 ml tubes at maximal speed, 4°C for 15 min. The protein concentration of the cleared chromatin was quantified by Bradford method. 800 μl of 1.5 mg/ml chromatin in FA lysis buffer + protease inhibitor cocktail was mixed with 20 µl anti-H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 antibodies and incubated with gentle shaking at 4°C overnight. 100 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads from Santa Cruz Biotech (sc-2003) equilibrated with FA lysis buffer, was added to the chromatin-antibody complex and incubated with gentle shaking at 4°C overnight. The beads are washed with FA lysis buffer once, FA lysis buffer supplemented with 1 M NaCl twice, FA-W3 buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) once, and TE buffer once. Both the immunoprecipitated chromatin on the beads and non-immunoprecipitated chromatin for the input DNA were treated with 40 μg of protease K in 300 μl PK buffer (100 mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) at 42°C for 3 hr, followed by incubation at 65°C for 6 hr. The immunoprecipitated DNA and the input DNA were purified with QIAquick Spin Columns, and used for library construction with Illumina’s TruSeq DNA Library preparation kit. DNA libraries were validated with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and sequenced with NextSeq 500 System (Illumina) using default Illumina standards for base calling and read filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keogh and Buratowski, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ChIP-Seq analysis</title><p>ChIP Seq Normalization: For the total number of aligned reads (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) from sample <italic>j</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the raw reads coverage score at the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> position of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> sample.

We also generated a corresponding input control for each sample, which was used to locally normalize the reads. The results from the global normalization and two-step procedure (global + local) are extremely similar because the reads coverage score from the input samples is very similar across different samples throughout the genome. Therefore, we only presented the results based on the global normalization. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> includes five different comparisons between samples, as described in the legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Will Light, Richard Gaber, Danny Reinberg (New York University, HHMI) and members of the Brickner laboratory for helpful comments and suggestions on the manuscript and Professor Curt Horvath for help with HeLa cell experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Alan Hinnebusch and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies from Brickner has contributed to define molecular events associated with what they define as the transcriptional memory, eg, the facilitated activation of a gene that has undergone a cycle of activation/repression. Here, they further address how this memory is established. More precisely, they investigate the chromatin changes from an active state to a repressed state. They characterized a poised state which is supposed to be an intermediate state associated to the transcriptional memory. They show that the transition to active from repressed state (defined as memory condition) correlates with the binding of the transcriptional repressor SfI1 at the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. This binding is dependent on the presence of a Memory Recruitment Sequence at the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter and correlates with high levels of H3K4me2 and PolII, two hallmarks of the poised state. Moreover, SfI1 is required to retain <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear envelope in the memory condition. Next, they show that PolII recruitment is lost in the memory condition when H3K4 methylation is abolishes. They further document this latter point by anchoring away the COMPASS Cps50 (Swd1) subunit which is essential for the assembly of the complex and therefore for the three H3K4 methylation states. By depleting Cps50 from the nucleus, they observed a rapid decrease of H3K4me2 but a slow decrease of PolII occupancy. In parallel of these observations, they found that the COMPASS subunit Cps40 (Spp1) which is only required for H3K4me3 is not recruited to <italic>INO1</italic> in memory conditions in contrast to other subunits (Cps50 (Swd1), Cps60 (Bre2), and Cps25 (Sdc1)). Consistent with previous studies from Buratowski lab, they show persistent H3K4me2 is correlated with the recruitment of Set3 to <italic>INO1</italic> in memory conditions in a way that depend on the integrity of the Set3 PHD domain and on SfI1. They show that the presence of Set3 allows H3K4me2 to be maintained in the 5' end and 3' end of <italic>INO1</italic> in memory conditions. Next they show that nucleus depletion of Spt15, Med1, and Tbf1 prevents PolII to be maintained at the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter in memory conditions while depletion of Kin28 prevents the binding of PolII under activation but not under memory conditions. Similarly, during memory removal of Kin28 does not affect H3K4me2. Along the same line, they show that the mediator subunit Ssn3 (Cdk8) binds to <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under memory and that its conditional depletion from the nucleus leads to the loss of PolII from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. Finally, they show that four genes whose expression is induced by H202 and that have been identified as exhibiting a salt stress memory share features of the <italic>INO1</italic> memory, eg, Set3 recruitment and Set3-dependent PolII occupancy under memory.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following summarizes the important additional experiments and revision of text required by the referees, described more fully in the following complete reviews submitted by each of the three referees.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper would benefit from a better description of the experimental strategies.

We now show that the nuclear localization and Sfl1 levels do not increase during memory using confocal microscopy of Sfl1-GFP. Also, we show that, whereas binding of Sfl1 to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter occurs only during memory, binding to either another promoter (<italic>SUC2</italic>) or to an ectopic copy of the MRS element is unregulated. This suggests that Sfl1 binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter is regulated by its context, either by neighboring transcription factors or by local changes in chromatin structure that are memory- specific.</p><p> <italic>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B: A</xref> much better explanation of the expectations of this assay for genes that either do, or do not, show localization to the nuclear periphery when they are actively transcribed is required here.</italic> </p><p>We have augmented our description of the chromatin localization assay to include the following passage:</p><p>“Using confocal microscopy, the position of <italic>INO1</italic> was scored for colocalization with the nuclear envelope, visualized using a Pho88-mCherry fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The reviewer may be referring to the precise kinetics of <italic>INO1</italic> induction as measured by RT qPCR, which can vary depending on the strains used, stocks of inositol, the primers or the qPCR reagents. However, these effects have no bearing on the conclusion of either study.</p><p>One thing that is counter-intuitive about <italic>INO1</italic> memory is that the rate of reactivation is similar to, or even slightly slower than, the rate of activation. This is particularly true in certain strains like BY4741 (see Brickner et al., 2007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The experiments conducted here, in Light et al., 2010 and in Light et al., 2013 used W303-based strains, for which this difference is less clear. The reason that reactivation is not faster than activation is due to the fact that the Ino1 enzyme is long-lived and cells cannot sense inositol starvation as quickly during reactivation as during activation. This creates a refractory period during reactivation that is not observed during activation, delaying the onset of transcription. However, once they sense starvation, the rate of reactivation is strongly dependent on transcriptional memory. To strengthen our proposal that <italic>INO1</italic> is primed for faster activation, we now include kinetic analysis of RNAPII binding to both the promoter and the coding sequence during either activation or reactivation in wild type and <italic>sfl1∆</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This experiment shows clearly that memory promotes association of active RNAPII with the <italic>INO1</italic> gene during reactivation, enhancing the rate of reactivation.</p><p>Furthermore, we have also analyzed transcriptional memory for salt-induced genes in yeast and IFN-γ-induced genes in human cells, neither of which have the issues associated with <italic>INO1</italic>. For both sets of genes, reactivation is either much faster than activation or much stronger (Light et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the current manuscript). This makes us confident that, despite the complexities of inositol biology, <italic>INO1</italic> is an excellent model for a conserved and broadly utilized mechanism of transcriptional poising.</p><p><italic>– <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: The rationale for measuring H3K4 methylation only in the promoter region of INO1 must be defended, or better yet, extended to include the CDS, possibly by using your genome-wide data.

We also include a brief discussion of the possible sources of the differences between the qPCR experiments and the ChIP-seq experiment.

However, we think that the progressive disassembly model is not supported by the data. <italic>INO1</italic> is repressed extremely rapidly (Brickner et al., 2007). The RNAPII associated with <italic>INO1</italic> memory persists for 4 cell divisions, suggesting that it cannot represent the persistent binding of RNAPII to the originally transcribed gene (which constitutes only 6.25% of the loci after 4 generations). Memory lasts for up to 7 generations in HeLa cells (our unpublished data). Thus, RNAPII must be continuously recruited over this time period. Recruitment requires factors upstream of Kin28, but not Kin28, which is incompatible with the model that it is slow disassembly of active PIC (which requires Kin28). Finally, the recruitment of RNAPII during memory requires factors that are bound only after repression and that have no effect on the active promoter (i.e. Sfl1, Cdk8, Nup100).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It would be valuable to begin Results by describing the kinetics of INO1 induction in the different states to lay out the memory phenomenon in terms of transcription levels.

However, these effects have no bearing on the conclusion of either study.</p><p>One thing that is counter-intuitive about <italic>INO1</italic> memory is that the rate of reactivation is similar to, or even slightly slower than, the rate of activation. This is particularly true in certain strains like BY4741 (see Brickner et al., 2007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The experiments conducted here, in Light et al., 2010 and in Light et al., 2013 used W303-based strains, for which this difference is less clear. The reason that reactivation is not faster than activation is due to the fact that the Ino1 enzyme is long-lived and cells cannot sense inositol starvation as quickly during reactivation as during activation. This creates a refractory period during reactivation that is not observed during activation, delaying the onset of transcription. However, once they sense starvation, the rate of reactivation is strongly dependent on transcriptional memory. To strengthen our proposal that <italic>INO1</italic> is primed for faster activation, we now include kinetic analysis of RNAPII binding to both the promoter and the coding sequence during either activation or reactivation in wild type and <italic>sfl1∆</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This experiment shows clearly that memory promotes association of active RNAPII with the <italic>INO1</italic> gene during reactivation, enhancing the rate of reactivation.</p><p>Furthermore, we have also analyzed transcriptional memory for salt-induced genes in yeast and IFN-γ-induced genes in human cells, neither of which have the issues associated with <italic>INO1</italic>.</p><p>For both sets of genes, reactivation is either much faster than activation or much stronger (Light et al., 2013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the current manuscript). This makes us confident that, despite the complexities of inositol biology, <italic>INO1</italic> is an excellent model for a conserved and broadly utilized mechanism of transcriptional poising.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should put their findings into the context of previously published results on the poised state in other organisms, and indicate the novelty of their results.</italic></p><p>We have now discussed and cited a number of additional studies with relevance to our current manuscript and clarified the novelty of our contribution.</p><p><italic>5) It should be shown that the mrs1 mutation eliminates H3K4me2 in the memory state.</italic> </p><p>This is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) It is important to establish the functionality of the CPS50-FRB and Cps50-FRB-GFP fusions by Western analysis of bulk H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3.</italic></p><p>We have added immunoblots examining the loss of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 after addition of rapamycin to the Swd1-FRB-GFP strain and to the parent strain lacking Swd1-FRB-GFP.</p><p><italic>7) It is necessary to cite the previous demonstrations that rapamycin has no effect in the strains engineered for anchor away.</italic></p><p>We now make reference to the original Haruki et al., 2008 paper, which analyzed the effect of rapamycin on growth of a strain lacking the FRB-tagged protein. Also, we performed immunoblots against H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 from this strain and ChIP against H3K4me2 and RNAPII under repressing, activating and memory conditions. We observed no phenotype upon addition of rapamycin.</p><p><italic>8) As noted above, the expected loss of mono, di, and trimethylation of H3K4 following anchor away of Cps50 should be verified.</italic></p><p>See response to point 6, above.</p><p><italic>10) As the key conclusion of the paper, that COMPASS is repurposed during memory, is based on a single ChIP experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, a</xref> time course analysis of Cps40 occupancy would bolster this conclusion and also provide valuable information about when Cps40 is lost from the promoter during the establishment of the memory state.</italic></p><p>We agree that the ChIP experiment alone could be strengthened by the suggested time course experiment. Therefore, we have examined the Spp1 (Cps40) binding upon repression and upon reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results completely support our initial result and provide a clear view of the remodeling of COMPASS during memory and upon reactivation.</p><p><italic>11) As above, a more complete analysis of methylation that includes the CDS may be required at least for certain key experiments.</italic></p><p>We have included new qPCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showing that <italic>INO1</italic> is marked with H3K4me2 over the 5’end and promoter during memory.</p><p><italic>12) Stipulate the region of INO1 being analyzed</italic></p><p>We have added descriptions of the location of the primers used for each experiment to the legends.</p><p><italic>13) As noted above, some measurement of histone deacetylation in WT versus set3 mutants is required.</italic> </p><p>We have tested this hypothesis and added these results to the manuscript. Loss of Set3 has no effect on the acetylation of the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter under any condition and therefore, it is unclear whether the deacetylase activity plays a critical role in memory. We have included this conclusion in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p><italic>15) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, indicate the oligos used for the ChIP.</italic></p><p>We have added descriptions of the location of the primers used for each experiment to the legends.</p><p><italic>17) More complete citation of the relevant literature is required</italic></p><p>We have now discussed and cited a number of additional studies with relevance to our current manuscript and clarified the novelty of our contribution.</p><p><italic>18) COMPASS subunits should be labelled by their current yeast names.</italic></p><p>We have changed the names of the COMPASS subunits in the text and the Figures to the appropriate names.</p></body></sub-article></article>
