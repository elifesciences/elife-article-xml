alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors (decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A lot of cancer survivors experience a decline in mental health, persisting often decades after successful treatment. Many factors contribute to this reduced mental well-being, including the physical, emotional and financial stresses they experience.</p><p>Scientists think that the increased prevalence of mental health disorders among cancer patients and survivors may also be linked to the cancer itself. Previous research has shown that most tumors, in particular in melanomas, cervical and ovarian cancers, and head and neck cancers, contain sensory nerves that sense thermal, mechanical and chemical changes and so alert an organism about a potential danger, such as extreme temperature, pressure, changes in pH or inflammation.</p><p>To investigate whether these nerves contribute to the worsened mental health of cancer patients, Barr, Walz et al. studied male mice with tumors growing in their mouths, mimicking the disease of patients with head and neck cancers. The mice with tumors exhibited several altered behaviors linked to their well-being, suggesting that they had reduced overall health compared to mice without tumors. For example, they were less inclined to build nests, accept treats or run on a wheel.</p><p>Next, Barr, Walz et al. injected a fluorescent dye into the tumors to label the nerves inside the cancerous growths. Fluorescence microscopy and imaging studies revealed that, days later, the dye had traveled to multiple regions of the brain, indicating that the nerves in the tumors had connected to a preexisting nerve circuit that included these brain regions.</p><p>Further experiments revealed that the nerve cells in these brain regions were more active in mice with tumors and had different functional properties compared to mice without tumors. Removing the connecting nerves either genetically or with a drug improved all the behaviors of the mice with tumors. Treating the mice with painkillers also improved some but not all of their behaviors, indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. These two experiments suggest that the nerves from the tumors relay information about pain to the brain and contribute to reduced well-being of the mice.</p><p>Further studies will test whether these tumor-brain connections also contribute to behavioral changes in mice with other types of cancer. The data suggest that disrupting the neural connections between a tumor and the brain may improve the mental health of patients with cancer, but more research is needed to establish this link.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroscience</kwd><kwd>tumor innervation</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>sensory nerves</kwd><kwd>head and neck

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of mental health disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety, suicide) in cancer patients is significantly greater than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pitman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Walker et al., 2013</xref>). For those patients with no prior psychiatric history, a cancer diagnosis increases the risk of mental health decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of cancer introduces many stressors (physical, financial, relational) into the lives of patients, thus a negative impact on mental health may not be surprising. However, these changes persist even in long-term cancer survivors. For instance, decade-long cancer survivors maintain an increased incidence of depression (approximately 12%, depending on the cancer type) as compared to the population at large (3–5%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Steel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Götze et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuba et al., 2019</xref>). While the intensity and prevalence of psychological symptoms in cancer patients fluctuate before, during, and after treatment for a given type of cancer, and between cancer types, it remains higher than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Naser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tsaras et al., 2018</xref>). The association of cancer with impaired mental health is directly mediated by the disease, its treatment or both; these findings suggest that the development of a tumor alters brain functions.</p><p>We have demonstrated the presence of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Madeo et al., 2018</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balood et al., 2022</xref>), cervical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lucido et al., 2019</xref>), and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2021</xref>). Nerve recruitment to the tumor bed is an active process that involves the release of soluble factors, including neurotrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Renz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayakawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kasprzak and Adamek, 2020</xref>). Tumor-released small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) also recruit loco-regional nerves to the tumor bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Madeo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Silverman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2020</xref>). While these and other studies establish that solid peripheral tumors engage with the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Madeo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cole et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Magnon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sadighparvar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen and Ayala, 2018</xref>), it raises the possibility of a direct neuronal connection from the tumor to the brain.</p><p>A recent study used pseudorabies virus and mapped a connection from tumor-infiltrating nerves in an orthotopic model of murine lung cancer to areas in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). We expand these findings and demonstrate that HNSCC-associated nerves are transcriptionally and functionally altered and project to discrete regions in the brain. The brain neurons connected to the tumor manifest increased activity, which is associated with behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing animals. Consistent with this, newly diagnosed HNSCC patients suffer high rates of depression and anxiety and lower quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henry et al., 2022</xref>). As most cancer patients face cancer-related pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Virgen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hjermstad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">van den Beuken-van Everdingen et al., 2007</xref>), we tested whether treating pain could restore normal behavior. While pain treatment restored normal function at the tumor site, such as nesting behavior, it only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior. Our findings suggest that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tumor innervation begins early in disease</title><p>MOC2-7 cells are HNSCC cancer cells derived from a CXCR3 null mouse on a C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Judd et al., 2012</xref>). Their implantation in male mice results in dense innervation of tumors with nociceptor nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Restaino et al., 2023</xref>). To define the timing of tumor innervation, C57BL/6 wildtype male mice were orthotopically implanted (oral cavity) with MOC2-7 cells, and tumors were collected on days 4-, 10-, and 20- post-implantation. Western blot analysis of whole tumor lysate indicated expression of Tau, a neuronal marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Georgieff et al., 1993</xref>), as early as day four post-tumor implantation, which increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A similar increase in the neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While DCX is well-known for its expression in immature neurons, it is also expressed in adult peripheral neurons, including dorsal root ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dellarole and Grilli, 2008</xref>), and in non-neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernreuther et al., 2006</xref>). The DCX signal did not originate from the tumors, as MOC2-7 cell lysate was negative for this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). Consistent with this, immunohistochemical staining of these tumors with the neuronal marker β-III tubulin (β3T), demonstrated the increasing presence of nerves beginning on day 4 post-tumor implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tumor-infiltrating nerves form a circuit connecting to the brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of MOC2-7 whole tumor lysates for Tau (<bold>A</bold>) and Doublecortin, DCX (<bold>B</bold>).

Given the impact of nociceptor neuron ablation on tumor growth, we wondered whether differences in tumor volume contributed to the behavioral differences we noted. Thus, the behavior data were graphed as a function of tumor volume. A simple linear regression model was used to fit the data. In the case of nesting scores, the linear regression did not fit the data points very well making it difficult to assess nesting scores at a given tumor volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the linear regression model fit the time to interact data better. Here, the data suggest that tumor volume did influence behavior as at any given tumor volume the time to interact with the cookie is generally smaller in TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA animals as compared to C57BL/6 animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).

To assess the potential influence of cancer-associated pain, 1 week post tumor inoculation, groups of mice were treated with carprofen (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory), extended-release buprenorphine (opioid), or vehicle. We found that wheel running decreased as tumors progressed, an effect partially alleviated by carprofen and buprenorphine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The nesting behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and food disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) were also alleviated by the painkillers. Neither carprofen nor buprenorphine impacted MOC2-7 tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), but buprenorphine increased tumor growth compared to carprofen-treated mice. Significant effects for all statistical analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. These findings suggest that choosing pain management drugs in the context of cancer can potentially influence tumor growth adversely. Furthermore, the data reveal that behaviors associated with the tumor site are adversely affected by cancer-associated pain. Pain-induced anhedonia is mediated by changes in the reward pathway. Specifically, in the context of pain, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) become less responsive to pain and release less serotonin. This decreased serotonin results in disinhibition of GABA release; the resulting increased GABA promotes an increased inhibitory drive leading to anhedonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Markovic et al., 2021</xref>) and, when extreme, anorexia. Carprofen and buprenorphine treatments completely reversed nesting behavior and significantly improved eating. Inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekhbat et al., 2022</xref>) and opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>) directly influence reward processing and though our tracing studies did not indicate that the tumor-brain circuit includes the VTA, this brain region may be indirectly impacted by tumor-induced pain in the oral cavity. Thus, an alternative interpretation of the data is that the effects of carprofen and buprenorphine treatments on nesting and food consumption may be due to inhibition of anhedonia (and anorexia) rather than, or in addition to, relieving oral pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campos et al., 2017</xref>). However, merely alleviating pain (or inhibiting anhedonia) does not fully restore all behaviors, as evidenced by persistent issues in activities like wheel running.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Treating for pain does not restore all behaviors.</title><p>C57BL/6 male mice were orthotopically implanted with MOC2-7 tumors and separated into three groups: carprofen treated (10 mg/kg, blue, n=10), buprenorphine treated (3.25 mg/kg, red, n=10) or vehicle treated (black, n=9).

This connection occurs independently of pain, and this cancer-brain circuit drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. While the elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, it also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. This underscores the complex interplay between sensory neurons, cancer progression, and mental health, uncovering a two-pronged approach to improving HNSCC patients’ physical and psychological health.</p><p>In melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balood et al., 2022</xref>) and HNSCC, we demonstrated significant alterations in transcript levels within tumor-infiltrating nerves. Several mechanisms can account for these changes. For instance, TRPV1 stimulation is sufficient to trigger the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor within neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backes et al., 2018</xref>). Such TRPV1 activation could occur in response to low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boedtkjer and Pedersen, 2020</xref>) or hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pocock and Hobert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Pocock and Hobert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>), which are both prevalent within the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, we previously demonstrated that tumor-released sEVs, which transport microRNAs (miRNAs), induced sprouting of loco-regional nerves to the tumor bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Madeo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2020</xref>). These sEV-transported miRNAs could also modulate various neuronal transcription factors and, in turn, drive the transcriptomic changes we observed in these neurons.</p><p>Our data indicate that these peripheral neuronal changes also influence the functioning of the brain areas to which they connect. Although we did not make the complete cartography of all brain regions used by tumor-infiltrating nerves, we identified a few critical nuclei. Subsequent work will use emerging circuit mapping techniques for whole brain profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, our tracing in tumor-bearing nociceptor-neuron-ablated and intact animals was sufficient to functionally implicate TRPV1-expressing neurons in this communication.</p><p>Trigeminal ganglia neurons are composed of ~80% of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> nociceptor neurons, with one-half being peptidergic (TRPV1<sup>+</sup>, TRPA1<sup>+</sup>) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mickle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>). In the TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA mouse, these peptidergic neurons are eliminated, leaving intact ~50% of pain-sensing neurons. The remaining presence of these non-peptidergic, largely MrgD<sup>+</sup>, neurons might explain why nesting behavior in TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA tumor-bearing animals is only partially restored.</p><p>Inflammation contributes to pain in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Renna et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with analgesic drugs (carprofen, buprenorphine) resulted in complete restoration of nest building and performance in the cookie test. These data show that the constraint imposed by the tumor on behavioral activities that require the use of the oral cavity is mainly due to pain and not to the physical interference of the tumor mass with the pattern of oral activities that need to take place for mice to perform the corresponding behavior.</p><p>Cancer pain often interferes with activities that don't involve oral movements, a phenomenon evident in the impaired voluntary wheel running observed in tumor-bearing mice. Although analgesic drugs can partially mitigate this deficit, they fail to restore this behavior fully, despite their efficacy in completely restoring oral activity behaviors like nesting and the cookie test. Moreover, given that carprofen and buprenorphine decrease inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shepherd and Mohapatra, 2018</xref>), their ability to restore normal nesting and cookie test behaviors (which require the use of the oral cavity where the tumor is located) suggests that inflammation at the tumor site contributed to the decline in these behaviors in vehicle-treated animals. Since both drugs were given systemically and each only partially restored wheel running, it suggests that systemic inflammation alone cannot fully account for the decline in wheel running seen in vehicle-treated animals. We posit that the inflammation- and pain-independent component of this behavioral decline is mediated via the transcriptional and functional alterations in the cancer-brain circuit.</p><p>This suggests that factors beyond pain contribute to the observed behavioral changes. These alterations could be attributed to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Walker et al., 2014</xref>) or represent a competition between the energy demands of the HNSCC malignant cells and the host’s skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grossberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Thaker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kim-Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Neuro-immune interactions have been studied in the context of a variety of conditions including, but not limited to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camp et al., 2021</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kabata and Artis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), homeostasis in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">van Baarle et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jacobson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jakob et al., 2020</xref>), as well as neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jorfi et al., 2023</xref>). Neuro-immune communications in the context of cancer and behavior have also been studied (e.g. sickness behavior, depression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dantzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kopec et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dantzer, 2018</xref>) however, these studies did not assess these interactions at the tumor bed. Investigations into neuro-immune interactions occurring within primary malignancies which harbor nerves have shed light on these critical communications. In the context of melanoma, which is innervated by sensory nerves, we identified that release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) induces immune suppression. This effect is mediated by CGRP binding to its receptor, RAMP1, which is expressed on CD8 +T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balood et al., 2022</xref>). A study utilizing a different syngeneic model of oral cancer similarly found an immune suppressive role for CGRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McIlvried et al., 2022</xref>). These studies demonstrate that neuro-immune interactions occur at the tumor bed. Our current findings indicating that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to a circuit that includes regions within the brain suggest that neuro-immune interactions within the peripheral malignancy may contribute to the behavioral alterations we studied.</p><p>Our current findings suggest that interrupting tumor-to-brain communication can mitigate the mental health decline often associated with cancer. Yet, a higher prevalence of depression persists among long-term cancer survivors compared to individuals without a cancer history. Having received treatment and showing no evidence of disease, these survivors continue to battle mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Götze et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kuba et al., 2019</xref>). This phenomenon prompts a critical question - why does this discrepancy exist? It is conceivable that these patients, through treatments like surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, have disrupted the tumor-brain connection and have sustained this disconnection over the years. However, unlike animal models, their mental health decline is not reversed. Several speculations, grounded in known factors, can be considered.</p><p>The human experience with cancer is distinct from that of mouse models; individuals can live with malignant growths for extended periods, often unaware of their existence due to asymptomatic or nonspecific symptoms. During this undiagnosed period, the tumor-brain circuit might induce irreversible changes in central neurons through activity-dependent transcriptional modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Takayanagi-Kiya and Kiya, 2019</xref>). These alterations, anchored in neuronal plasticity, adaptation, and behavior, may become permanent even after the cancer is diagnosed and treated.</p><p>Moving forward, to reverse these entrenched brain changes, understanding the specific transcriptional alterations incurred by central neurons is vital. Unraveling this complexity could pave the way for therapies that reverse the neuronal activity impacts, fostering improved mental health. Although in its early stages, our insight into the role of nerves in cancer is growing and highlighting neuronal targets for pharmacological interventions.</p><p>Our study is not exempt from limitations. First, our exploration of the tumor-to-brain pathway was confined to mice with HNSCC and used a single cancer cell line. Hence, the universality of our conclusions warrants verification through additional HNSCC cell lines and diverse cancer models. Furthermore, the exclusive focus on HNSCC, particularly considering the nerve-rich oral region, raises questions about the pathway’s establishment and behavioral impact in other contexts. Our behavioral assessment was not exhaustive; a comprehensive analysis of nerve-dependent and independent behaviors remains forthcoming. Behaviors could also be influenced by elements like soluble factors or the energy competition between the tumor and behavioral activities.</p><p>Head and neck cancer is predominantly a cancer in males; it occurs in males three times more often than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gaeta et al., 2023</xref>), this disparity increases in certain parts of the world. While smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are risk factors for HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, even males that do not smoke and drink are have a higher susceptibility for this cancer than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dittberner et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, our studies used only male mice. However, we do recognize that females also get this cancer. In fact, female patients with head and neck cancer, particularly oral cancer, report more pain than their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Reyes-Gibby et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that differences in tumor innervation exist in males and females. Our studies have also solely involved male mice, presenting a clear gap in understanding the potential sex differences in the development of the tumor-to-brain communication pathway and its subsequent influence on behavior. The inclusion of female subjects in future research is essential to provide a comprehensive insight into these processes.</p><p>Second, our nerve tracing methodology, where we injected 2 µl of WGA into the tumor bed, is designed to label only the tumor-infiltrating nerves and their connections. However, this approach fails to label <italic>all</italic> tumor-infiltrating nerves, predominantly those not close to the WGA-injected region and nerves that are in contact with or influenced by the tumor but are not directly infiltrating it. This limitation is a calculated one, reflecting a technical trade-off. We aimed to ensure the specificity of capturing only tumor-infiltrating nerves, which meant sacrificing the comprehensiveness of labeling all nerves associated with the tumor. This constraint extends to our calcium imaging studies and brain tracing. Although we can confidently assert that all labeled neurons are indeed tumor-infiltrating or connected, we cannot conclusively state that all tracer-negative ipsilateral nerves are unconnected to the tumor-brain circuit.</p><p>Even with these constraints, our findings are important. We have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit. This circuit extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. This revelation paves the way for in-depth exploration into the mechanistic underpinnings of cancer-associated alterations in well-being and mental health, shedding light on potential therapeutic interventions to alleviate these profound effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study approval</title><p>All animal studies were performed with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Sanford Research and were within institutional guidelines and complied with all relevant ethical regulations.

All mice were maintained in IVC Tecniplast Green line Seal Safe Plus cages which were opened only under aseptic conditions in an animal transfer station. All cages were changed every other week using aseptic technique. All cages had individual HEPA filtered air. Animal rooms were maintained at 75 °F, 30–70% humidity, with a minimum of 15 air changes per hour, and a 14:10 light/dark cycle. Corncob bedding, which was autoclaved prior to use, was maintained in all cages. Irradiated, sterile food (Envigo) and acidified water (pH 2.8–3.0) were available ad libitum. There was a maximum of 5 mice/cage. All animals were observed daily for abnormal behavior, signs of illness or distress, the availability of food and water and proper husbandry. Animals injected with murine tumor cells were 10-week-old C57BL/6 or TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA mice (The Jackson Laboratory) weighing approximately 24 g. Investigators were blinded to the groups when assessing animals (e.g. measuring tumors). Animals were numbered by ear punch and cage number. For all studies, animals were randomized into groups.</p><p>Nociceptor-neuron-ablated TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA animals were generated by crossing ROSA26-DTA (diphtheria toxin A, B6.129P2-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor <sup>tm1(DTA)Lky</sup></italic>/J)(Jax#009669) and TRPV1-Cre (B6.129-<italic>Trpv1<sup>tm1(cre)Bbm</sup></italic> /J) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavanaugh et al., 2011</xref>) (Jax# 017769) mice; the progeny (TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA) express DTA (diphtheria toxin fragment A) under control of the TRPV1 promoter, thereby genetically ablating all TRPV1 expressing cells (including TRPV1-expressing neurons) throughout development. Absence of TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons was validated by IHC staining of TGM ganglia for TRPV1.</p><p>Chemoablation of TRPV1-expressing neurons post-development was accomplished with resiniferatoxin (RTX), a naturally occurring potent TRPV1 agonist. RTX treatment results in the specific ablation of TRPV1 neurons (post-development), while sparing other TRPV1 expressing (non-neuronal) cells. RTX treatment in mice consisted of three injections of RTX given 24 hr apart. The injections are given in the flank and were: 30 µg/kg on day 1, 70 µg/kg on day 2, and 100 µg/kg on day 3. Just prior to the first RTX injection, mice are treated with 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine, given intraperitoneally, as the first injection causes pain. Subsequent injections do not require buprenorphine. It takes 4 weeks for TRPV1 nerve ablation to occur. Control mice received injections with vehicle solution (DMSO with Tween80 in PBS). The tail flick test was used to confirm nerve ablation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tail flick test</title><p>Prior to testing, mice are acclimated to the room for 30 min. A water bath is pre-warmed to 52 °C and a thermometer is used to constantly monitor the temperature of the water. The mice are picked up using a fresh paper towel so that only their tail is outside the paper towel. Once the mouse is relaxed in the tester’s hand, the mouse’s tail is lowered into the water so that a quarter of the tail is submerged. The time for the tail to be flicked out of the water is recorded. If no response has occurred by 20 s, the mouse’s tail is removed from the water to prevent tissue damage. A response time latency greater than 10 s signifies denervation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Tumor implantation</title><p>The cells injected into animals were cultured in media containing 10% fetal calf serum. When cells are harvested for tumor injections, they are first washed two times with PBS and then trypsinized to detach the cells from the plate. Cells are collected, washed again with PBS and resuspended with DMEM without serum; this is what is injected into animals. We harvest cells in this way in order to eliminate any serum being injected into mice. Ketamine (87.5 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) were used to anesthetize mice prior to oral cavity tumor implantation. Tumors were initiated as follows: using a 25-gauge needle, cells (5x10<sup>4</sup> cells in a total of 50 μl) were implanted orthotopically in the oral cavity of male C57BL/6 mice. Specifically, the needle was placed proximal to the crease of the mouse cheek, inserted at approximately a 45° angle, bevel deep, and tumor cells injected into this location of the cheek pouch. Mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia on a heating blanket and returned to their home cage. Control (non-tumor) mice were treated the same way only their injection contained media alone (no cells). Tumor growth was monitored weekly by caliper measurements of isoflurane anesthetized animals and tumor volume calculated was using the formula: ½ (length*(width^2)). Non-tumor control mice were also anesthetized with isoflurane each time that tumor-bearing animals were anesthetized for tumor measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Euthanasia criteria</title><p>Criteria for euthanasia in our IACUC approved protocol include maximum tumor volume of 1000 mm<sup>3</sup>, edema, extended period of weight loss progressing to emaciation, impaired mobility or lesions interfering with eating, drinking or ambulation, rapid weight loss (&gt;20% in 1 week), as well as weight loss at or more than 20% of baseline. In addition to tumor size and weight loss, we use the body condition score to evaluate the state of animals and to determine euthanasia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Drug treatments</title><p>Carprofen (Pivetal) was provided in the drinking water (10 mg/kg which is equivalent to 0.067 mg/ml) which was refreshed every 7 days. Buprenorphine-ER (Fidelis Animal Health), a 72 hr extended-release formulation, was given by subcutaneous injection (3.25 mg/kg) every 72 hr. Vehicle-treated animals were treated with subcutaneous injection of saline. Drug treatments commenced on day 7 post-tumor implantation in all groups. Given that buprenorphine treatment requires a subcutaneous injection every 3 days, mice in the other groups (vehicle and carprofen) received a subcutaneous injection of saline at the same volume (60 µl) as the buprenorphine-treated animals. In this way, all animal stress from handling and injection was the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Nest building</title><p>Nest building is an innate behavior performed in rodents of both sexes and is a general indication of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Neely et al., 2019</xref>); it also measures the motivation to perform a goal-directed task. To assess nesting behavior, individually housed mice were given a nesting square (Ancare) overnight. The following morning, nests were scored by two independent scorers who were blinded to the conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deacon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kraeuter et al., 1916</xref>). The scoring system is 0–4 and based on the percentage of the nestlet that is shredded and the height of the nest. Two baseline measurements were conducted prior to tumor implantation followed by weekly testing. Exclusion criteria of an average baseline score of 3 or greater was used to ensure all mice were good nest builders at baseline (n=3 C57BL/6 mice and n=7 TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA mice were excluded for this reason).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cookie test</title><p>The cookie test is a variation of the sucrose preference test, a test of anhedonia (the inability to experience enjoyment or interest in previously rewarding activities). This test assesses the animal’s endogenous inclination for sweet tastes and the notion that it derives pleasure from consuming sweets. One hour prior to testing, mouse food is removed and the animals are acclimated to the brightly lit testing room. Following the acclimation period, mice were given a piece of cookie (approximately 1.5 g). The time it took the mouse to bite the cookie from its placement in the cage was measured to determine time-to-interact. Each mouse was acclimated to the cookie every other day for 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation with a baseline measurement followed by weekly testing. Mice were individually housed. One mouse from the C57BL/6 group was excluded due to incomplete data (mouse died before completion of the study).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Voluntary wheel running</title><p>Prior to tumor implantation, mice were singly housed with a running wheel maintained in the home cage continuously. The only time that the wheel was removed was when mice were undergoing nesting. The mice were acclimated to the wheel for 2 weeks prior to tumor implantation. This acclimatization period provided the time to stabilize their running performance. Running wheels were maintained in the home cage for the duration of the study. As mice are most active during the dark phase, nighttime running (8pm to 8am) was assessed. Running data were collected in 1 min bins continuously throughout the duration of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Food disappearance</title><p>Animals were provided 100 g of solid food per cage each week. At the end of each week, the remaining food was weighed, and this value was used to calculate the amount of food that disappeared in that week per cage. For all behavioral experiments, mice were singly housed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Neural tracing of orthotopic HNSCC tumors</title><p>When oral tumors reached approximately 5x5 mm in size, neural tracer was injected into the tumor as described below. Ketamine (87.5 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) were used to anesthetize the mice. A 10 µL Hamilton syringe with 30 G needle was loaded with 1% Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to either AlexaFluor 594 (Invitrogen) or CF568 (Biotium) in PBS and 2 μl was slowly injected intra-tumorally with the bevel side up. The needle was inserted approximately midway through the tumor then pulled back slightly to reduce pressure and leakage of tracer following injection. The injection of tracer occurred slowly over the course of 10 min. After the tracer was injected, the needle was kept in place for 2 additional minutes before being slowly removed. Mice were placed on a heating pad until recovery from anesthesia. Five to 7 days later, mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and trigeminal ganglia (TGM) were carefully removed and placed in HBSS in a 24-well plate kept on ice. TGM harvesting was completed as follows: euthanized animals were subjected to a midline incision while in the prone position to expose the crown of the skull. The brainstem was separated from the spinal cord by a transverse cut and the top of the skull was removed, exposing the brainstem and TGM. All tissues (tumor, ganglia and brain) were fixed, sectioned, and imaged for WGA labeled nerve fibers and somas under confocal microscopy. WGA injection into control (non-tumor bearing animals) was performed the same way and injection was into the same oral region where tumors were implanted. Volumes of 2 or 10 μl of WGA were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining</title><p>Tissues were formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded and cut into 5 µm sections. The BenchMark XT automated slide staining system (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc) was used to optimize antibody dilutions and staining.

All sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.3% Tx-100. All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum. Sections were incubated in Fos antibody for 72 hr. Following washes in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline, sections were incubated in secondary antibody for 3 hr. Following additional washes, sections were mounted onto glass slides, and cover slipped with cytoseal prior to imaging.

The data were then analyzed using a repeated measures two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26-1-5"><title>Food disappearance</title><p>Statistical analysis by repeated measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26-1-6"><title>Weight</title><p>Statistical analysis by repeated measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26-1-7"><title>Tumor growth curves</title><p>Statistical analysis of tumor growth curves by repeated measures ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26-1-8"><title>Kaplan Meier survival</title><p>Statistical analysis of survival by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health were followed for all animals experiments in this study.

So, most of the changes were likely due to site-specific pain and not a unique signal from the tumor.</p></disp-quote><p>The tumor generates pain at the site it is implanted, and it is likely amplified by the oral activities tumor bearing mice have to engage in. As there is no pain in the absence of the tumor, the pain is, by definition, caused by the tumor, not by the site. Concerning the relationship between pain and behavior, the behavioral assays undertaken in our study (nesting, cookie test, wheel running) were very limited in scope. Two of these assays (nesting, cookie test) require use of the oral cavity. Only nesting and wheel running were assessed in the context of treatment for pain. Nesting behavior was completely restored with carprofen and buprenorphine treatment suggesting that in the absence of pain, mice were able to make perfect nests. Consistent with this, carprofen and buprenorphine treated animals also gained weight indicating that eating (another activity dependent on the oral cavity) was also restored. Wheel running, an activity that does not rely on the oral cavity, was only partially restored with drug treatment. While additional behavioral tests are necessary to confirm this finding, the data suggest that there is pain-independent information relayed to the brain which accounts for this decline in wheel running.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>(1) The main claim is that tumor-infiltrating nerves underlie cancer-induced behavioral alterations, but the experimental interventions are not specific enough to support this. For example, all TRPV1 neurons, including those innervating the skin and internal organs, are ablated to examine sensory innervation of the tumor. Within the context of cancer, behavioral changes may be due to systemic inflammation, which may alter TRPV1 afferents outside the local proximity of tumor cells. A direct test of the claims of this paper would be to selectively inhibit/ablate nerve fibers innervating the tumor or mouth region.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a direct test of the hypothesis would require selectively inhibiting the nerve fibers innervating the tumor and assessing the impact on behavior. Studies in the lab are on-going using pharmacological interventions to do this. These studies are beyond the scope of this current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Behavioral results from TRPV1 neuron ablation studies are in part confounded by differing tumor sizes in ablated versus control mice. Are the differences in behavior potentially explained by the ablated animals having significantly smaller tumors? The differences in tumor sizes are not negligible. One way to examine this possibility might be to correlate behavioral outcomes with tumor size.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have graphed nesting scores and time-to-interact (cookie test) relative to tumor volume. In both cases, we used simple linear regression to fit the data and analyzed the slopes of the lines. In the case of nesting, there was no significant difference between the slopes. This is now included as Supplemental Figure 4A. In the case of the cookie test, there was a significant difference between the slopes. This is now included as Supplemental Figure 4B. Graphing the data in this way allows one to look at any given tumor volume and infer what the nesting score and the time-to-interact for the two groups of mice. The linear regression model fits the time to interact with the cookie reasonably well, thus from this graph, we can see that at any given tumor volume the time to interact with the cookie was generally shorter in TRPV1cre::DTAfl/wt animals as compared to C57BL/6 mice. Unfortunately, the linear regression does not fit the nesting data very well and thus it is more difficult to make the comparison of tumor volume and nesting score.</p><p>The following text has been added to the results section.</p><p>Given the impact of nociceptor neuron ablation on tumor growth, we wondered whether differences in tumor volume contributed to the behavioral differences we noted. Thus, the behavior data were graphed as a function of tumor volume (Supplemental Fig 4A, B). A simple linear regression model was used to fit the data. In the case of nesting scores, the linear regression did not fit the data points very well making it difficult to assess nesting scores at a given tumor volume (Supplemental Fig 4A). However, the linear regression model fit the time to interact data better. Here, the graph suggests that tumor volume did not influence behavior as at any given tumor volume the time to interact with the cookie is generally smaller in TRPV1-Cre::Floxed-DTA animals as compared to C57BL/6 animals (Supplemental Fig 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>(1) The authors mention in their Discussion the need for additional experiments. Could they also include / comment on the potential impact on the anti-tumor immune system in their model?</p></disp-quote><p>The following text has been added to the discussion:</p><p>Neuro-immune interactions have been studied in the context of a variety of conditions including, but not limited to infection 109, inflammation 110,111, homeostasis in the gut 112-114, as well as neurological diseases115,116. Neuro-immune communications in the context of cancer and behavior have also been studied (e.g., sickness behavior, depression) 117-119 however, these studies did not assess these interactions at the tumor bed. Investigations into neuro-immune interactions occurring within primary malignancies which harbor nerves have shed light on these critical communications. In the context of melanoma, which is innervated by sensory nerves, we identified that release of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) induces immune suppression. This effect is mediated by CGRP binding to its receptor, RAMP1, which is expressed on CD8+ T cells 49. A study utilizing a different syngeneic model of oral cancer similarly found an immune suppressive role for CGRP 120-122. These studies demonstrate that neuro-immune interactions occur at the tumor bed. Our current findings indicating that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to a circuit that includes regions within the brain suggest that neuro-immune interactions within the peripheral malignancy may contribute to the behavioral alterations we studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors mention the importance of inflammation contributing to pain in cancer but do not clearly highlight how this may play a role in their model. Can this be clarified?</p></disp-quote><p>The following text has been added to the discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, given that carprofen and buprenorphine decrease inflammation 104, their ability to restore normal nesting and cookie test behaviors (which require the use of the oral cavity where the tumor is located) suggests that inflammation at the tumor site contributed to the decline in these behaviors in vehicle-treated animals. Since both drugs were given systemically and each only partially restored wheel running, it suggests that systemic inflammation alone cannot fully account for the decline in wheel running seen in vehicle-treated animals. We posit that the inflammation- and pain-independent component of this behavioral decline is mediated via the transcriptional and functional alterations in the cancer-brain circuit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The tumor model apparently requires isoflurane injection prior to tumor growth measurements. This is different from most other transplantable types of tumors used in the literature. Was this treatment also given to control (i.e., non-tumor) mice at the same time points?

They mention this as a limitation in the Discussion. Was there an original reason why they only tested male mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The following text has been added in the discussion section:</p><p>Head and neck cancer is predominantly a cancer in males; it occurs in males three times more often than in females 123, this disparity increases in certain parts of the world. While smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are risk factors for HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, even males that do not smoke and drink are have a higher susceptibility for this cancer than females 124,125. Thus, our studies used only male mice. However, we do recognize that females also get this cancer. In fact, female patients with head and neck cancer, particularly oral cancer, report more pain than their male counterparts 126,127. These findings suggest that differences in tumor innervation exist in males and females.</p><p>Therefore, another project in the lab has been to compare disease characteristics (including innervation and behavior) in male and female mice. The findings from this second study are the topic of a separate manuscript.</p><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing editor:</bold></p><p>(1) Tumors can communicate with the brain via blood-borne agents from the tumor itself or immune cells that are activated by the tumor in addition to neurons that invade the tumor. The xia and malaise that accompanies some tumors can be mediated by direct innervation and/or the humoral factors because both can activate the same parabrachial pathway. This paper makes the case for the direct innervation being important but ignores the possibility of both being involved. The interesting observation that innervation supports tumor growth (perhaps via substance P) is troublesome because the slower appearance of behavioral consequences (Figures 4 &amp; 5) could be attributed to the smaller tumor size. A nice control for humoral effects would be to implant the tumor cells someplace in the body where innervation does not occur (if possible) and then examine behavioral outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>In the course of several projects, we have implanted different tumor cell lines in different locations in mice (oral cavity, hind limb, flank, peritoneal cavity). In each location, tumor innervation occurs. This is not a phenomenon found only in mice as we completed an immunohistological survey of human cancers from different sites and found they are all innervated (PMID 34944001). These data are consistent with tumor and locally-released factors that recruit nerves to the tumor bed (PMID: 30327461)(PMID: 32051587)(PMID: 27989802). Thus, an implantation site that does not result in tumor innervation is currently unknown and likely does not exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should address whether there is an inflammatory component in this tumor model.</p></disp-quote><p>MOC2-7 tumors have been characterized as non-inflamed and poorly immunogenic 129-131.</p><p>This information has been added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The RTX experiment in Figure 5 would be more compelling if the drug was injected directly into the tumor rather than injecting it in the flank, thus ablating all TRPV1-exressing neurons as in the genetic approach.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer that ablating the TRPV1-expressing neurons at the tumor site directly would be ideal, RTX treatment takes approximately one week for ablation to occur but a significant amount of inflammation is associated with this. Therefore, we wait a total of 4 weeks for the inflammation to resolve. By this time, tumors have generally reached sacrifice criteria. Thus, this approach would not enable the question to be answered Moreover, we are not aware of any studies in which RTX has been injected in the oral cavity or face. While RTX is utilized clinically to treat pain, it is typically administered intrathecally, epidurally or intra-ganglionically (PMID: 37894723).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors address affective aspects of pain but do not adequately address the sensory aspects, e.g., sensitivity to touch, heat and/or cold. They attribute the decrease in food disappearance (consumption) and nest building to oral pain, but it could be due to anhedonia and anorexia that can accompany tumor progression.</p></disp-quote><p>Assaying for touch and heat/cold sensitivity in the oral cavity is a critical aspect of studying head and neck cancer that needs to be addressed. However, in rodents these assays are not trivial given that any touch/heat/cold in the area of the tumor (oral cavity) impacts the sensitive whiskers in that region which directly influence these assays. Thus, we have been refining assays (e.g., OPAD, facial von Frey) to address these important questions. The findings from these studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer makes a good point about anhedonia and anorexia. The following text has been added to the results section:</p><p>Pain-induced anhedonia is mediated by changes in the reward pathway. Specifically, in the context of pain, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) become less responsive to pain and release less serotonin. This decreased serotonin results in disinhibition of GABA release; the resulting increased GABA promotes an increased inhibitory drive leading to anhedonia 82 and, when extreme, anorexia. Carprofen and buprenorphine treatments completely reversed nesting behavior and significantly improved eating. Inflammation 83 and opioids 84 directly influence reward processing and though our tracing studies did not indicate that the tumor-brain circuit includes the VTA, this brain region may be indirectly impacted by tumor-induced pain in the oral cavity. Thus, an alternative interpretation of the data is that the effects of carprofen and buprenorphine treatments on nesting and food consumption may be due to inhibition of anhedonia (and anorexia) rather than, or in addition to, relieving oral pain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Comment on why only males were used in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to public reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Please provide a justification for the use of exclusively male mice and expand in the discussion if there is potential for these findings to be directly applicable to female mice as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to public reviews.</p><p>The following text has been added to the discussion:</p><p>Head and neck cancer is predominantly a cancer in males; it occurs in males three times more often than in females 123, this disparity increases in certain parts of the world.

Of note, we purposefully used whole trigeminal ganglia rather than FACS-sorted tracer-positive dissociated neurons to avoid artificially imposing injury and altering the transcript levels of these cells 53,54. Thus, significantly elevated expression of Fus by ipsilateral TGM neurons from tumor-bearing animals suggests the presence of neuronal injury induced by the malignancy. This is consistent with our previous findings 55 and those of others 56 showing that tumor-infiltrating nerves harbor higher expression of nerve-injury transcripts and neuronal sensitization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In line 197 please clarify the mice used.

We demonstrated that this small volume did not leak out of the tumor (Figure 1) and thus any tracer labeled neurons we identified were deemed as being connected in a circuit to nerves in the tumor bed. While we acknowledged that this calculated technical approach restricted our ability to tracer label all neurons in the tumor bed (as well as those they share circuitry with), it ensured no tracer leakage and inadvertent labeling of non-tumoral nerves. In non-tumor animals injected with 10 µl of tracer, labeled regions in the brain included the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, the parabrachial nucleus, the central amygdala, the facial nucleus and the motor nucleus of the trigeminal. The regions that were tracer positive when tumor was injected were limited to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, the parabrachial nucleus and the central amygdala. Thus, the regions in the brain that we focused on were the areas that became tracer-positive following injection of tracer into the tumor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Were the cells that were injected cultured in media with 10% fetal calf serum?

Neurons were incubated with the calcium indicator, Fluo-4AM, at 37°C for 20 min. After dye loading, the cells were washed, and Live Cell Imaging Solution (Thermo-Fisher) with 20 mM glucose was added. Calcium imaging was conducted at room temperature. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were measured using a Nikon scanning confocal microscope with a 10x objective. Fluo-4AM was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser with intensity attenuated to 1%. The fluorescence images were acquired in the confocal frame (1024 × 1024 pixels) scan mode. After 1 min of baseline measure, capsaicin (300nM final concentration) was added. Ca2+ images were recorded before, during and after capsaicin application. Image acquisition and analysis were achieved using NIS-Elements imaging software. Fluo-4AM responses were standardized and shown as percent change from the initial frame. Data are presented as the relative change in fluorescence (DF/F0), where F0 is the basal fluorescence and DF=F-F0 with F being the measured intensity recorded during the experiment. Calcium responses were analyzed only for neurons responding to ionomycin (10 µM, positive control) to ensure neuronal health. Treatment with the cell permeable Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (200 µM), served as a negative control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Suggestions for Figure 1:</p><p>- In Figures 1C, D, E, include labels for the days of tumor harvest.</p><p>- Please make the size of the labels the same for 1K an 1L and align them.</p><p>- Microscopy image in Figure 1L for SpVc looks like it may be at a different magnification.</p><p>- If possible, include (either in the figure or the supplement) IHC images staining for Dcx and tau, which would complement the western blot data.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested changes to the figures have been made.

Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors (decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated cFos and delta FosB as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain is pivotal to developing targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 28, 104, 258, 486, 521, and many other places, &quot;utilized&quot; should be &quot;used&quot; because the former refers to an application for which it is not intended, e.g. a hammer was utilized as a doorstop.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested changes have been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 32 and 73, it is not clear whether the basal activity is heightened or whether excitability is increased. &quot;manifest&quot; might be better than &quot;harbor&quot; on line 73.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the wording in the abstract to be clearer.
