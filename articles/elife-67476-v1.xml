Upon uptake, glucose can enter pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or be used in glycolysis. Here, we showed that blocking 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) in the oxidative PPP resulted in substantial reduction of Tregs suppressive function and shifts toward Th1, Th2, and Th17 phenotypes which led to the development of fetal inflammatory disorder in mice model. These in turn improved anti-tumor responses and worsened the outcomes of colitis model. Metabolically, 6PGD blocked Tregs showed improved glycolysis and enhanced non-oxidative PPP to support nucleotide biosynthesis. These results uncover critical role of 6PGD in modulating Tregs plasticity and function, which qualifies it as a novel metabolic checkpoint for immunotherapy applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>6PGD</kwd><kwd>immunoregulation</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd><kwd>pentose phosphate pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bayer Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-07-1112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seth</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U24DK097215-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA177558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase controls regulatory T cells metabolism with shifts to Th1, Th2, and Th17 phenotypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are distinct subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that limit inflammatory responses by suppressing self-reactive T cells to maintain balance between protective and excessive inflammation. Although lipid oxidation and the mevalonate pathway being considered key to their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Timilshina et al., 2019</xref>), cellular metabolism in Tregs is an active area of investigation. Tregs depend on these pathways to maintain their suppressive functions, which are distinct from the high glycolytic signatures of conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> effector subsets, Th1, Th2, and Th17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>). Although glycolysis is not major feature in Tregs, it is critical for Treg expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pacella et al., 2018</xref>). Glucose (Glc) enters the cell via glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) and is metabolized to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which has alternative fates via glycolysis and as the entry point into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The PPP, also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt or phosphogluconate pathway, comprises two interdependent branches: the oxidative branch and the non-oxidative branch. Oxidative PPP is composed of three essentially irreversible reactions in which the first is catalyzed by G6PD that converts G6P to 6-phosphogluconolactone (6PGL) while generating reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). 6PGL then hydrolyzes to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG), which is oxidatively decarboxylated by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), producing ribulose-5-phosphate and a second molecule of NADPH and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Ribulose-5-phosphate is the precursor for ribose-5-phophate (R5P) and thence nucleotides, and NADPH is required both for reductive anabolism and for antioxidative defense.</p><p>Tregs are known to have high rates of lipid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>), which would provoke antioxidant machinery which requires NADPH generated from PPP. We thus investigated the role of PPP in T CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets. Our preliminary studies using inhibitors of the PPP enzymes indicated that the third enzyme in the oxidative PPP, 6PGD, has critical roles in modulating T cell functions.</p><p>To assess the role of 6PGD in modulating Treg function, we generated mice with flox targeted <italic>Pgd</italic> allele (<italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>), which were crossed with <italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>YPF-Cre</sup> mice to generate <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>YPF-Cre</sup> (thereafter <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup>). Interestingly, <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed a distinct phenotype, namely spontaneous fatal autoimmunity and lower lifespan. Isolated <italic>Pgd</italic>-deficient Tregs had diminished suppressive functions both in vitro and in vivo. They also displayed shift in differentiation toward Th1, Th2, and Th17 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subtypes. Stable isotope tracing studies on sorted Tregs revealed reprogrammed metabolic pathways consistent with the generation of these subsets. Our results for Tregs directly isolated from pro-inflammatory mice model and derived from naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro uncover a critical role of 6PGD in maintaining Tregs metabolism, phenotype, and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PGD deficiency in Tregs induces spontaneous fatal autoimmunity</title><p>Our preliminary studies showed that pharmacological inhibitor of 6PGD (6-aminonicotinamide [6-AN]) but not G6PD inhibitor (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) enhances IFN-Î³ production by in vitro activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), while DHEA but not 6-AN at 10 ÂµM instigated poor T cells viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Compared with <italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (wild-type [WT]) controls at 20 days of age, <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice exhibited a reduced body size and crusting of ears and eyelids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), enlargement of peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and lymphoproliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) that was accompanied by a significantly shorter lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Lymphoproliferation was attributed to a higher frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) with increased frequencies of CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup> effector/memory phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), reduced frequencies of CD44<sup>low</sup>CD62L<sup>high</sup> naÃ¯ve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), higher expressions of CD69 activation marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and enhanced production of IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In these mice, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also produced more granzyme-B and higher cytotoxic marker CD107a expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The titers of serum antibodies were much higher in <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice had a significant increase in serum levels of IFN-Î³, IL-17A, IL-4, and IL-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).

Notably, Gln served as the main fuel source for the Krebs cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), with Gln metabolism being significantly higher in 6PGD-deficient than WT Tregs. Enhanced Gln metabolism via the Krebs cycle led to increased Î±KG production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B-F</xref>), which could serve as critical âmetabolic signalâ for CD4<sup>+</sup> T subset differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Klysz et al., 2015</xref>).

However, instead of depletion, this blockade led to enhanced accumulation of D and/or <sup>13</sup>C-labeled R5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâc</xref>), which are downstream products of the 6PGD reaction. Also D and/or <sup>13</sup>C-labeled sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâd</xref>), erythrose-4-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâe</xref>), and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâf</xref>) accumulated in 6PGD-deficient Tregs. These metabolites are all products of the non-oxidative PPP.

In turn, R5P generated fueled the enhanced biosynthesis of both pyrimidine and purine nucleotides (D, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>15</sup>N labeled species, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) to fulfill the nucleotide demands of activated T cells.</p><p>It should be noted that enhanced incorporation of Gln derived carbon (C* or D*C*/C*NxDx scrambled species) into 6PG (C* and D*C* scrambled species, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâb</xref>) and ATP/GTP (C*, D*C*, and C*NxDx, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C-m,l</xref>) in 6PGD-deficient Tregs are consistent with elevated GNG in these cells. This is because these <sup>13</sup>C-labeled species can only be produced via the reaction sequence of glutaminolysis, the Krebs cycle, and GNG initiated by conversion of OAA to PEP via PEPCK, followed by the reversal of the glycolytic reactions. The latter produce 3-phosphoglycerate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, F6P, and G6P, which can fuel both oxidative and non-oxidative PPP as well as serine biosynthesis-one carbon pathway to power purine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Increased accumulation of <sup>13</sup>C-G6P, together with that of D-G6P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Dâa</xref>) indicate enhanced activity of G6PD, the first rate-limiting and NADPH-producing enzyme of the oxidative branch of the PPP. This is expected to help compensate for the loss of NADPH production due to blocked 6PGD action. Overall, similar shifts of metabolic patterns in Tregs generated in vitro (iTregs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>) as those sorted from mouse models were evident.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In our pilot studies, we found that inhibition of G6PD led to reduced T cell survival with little changes in IFN-Î³ production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-C</xref>) but that of 6PGD resulted in higher T cell survival and T subsets activations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-C,I-J</xref> ). Our G6PD inhibitor study is consistent with a recent study, which showed that G6PD inhibition depleted NADPH and decreased inflammatory cytokine production by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ghergurovich et al., 2020</xref>). To better understand the role of 6PGD in T cells, we generated <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice to examine the effect of 6GPD blockade on Tregs as central immune regulators. Interestingly, <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed severe autoimmune disorders highlighting a critical role of 6PGD in Tregs function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Tregs isolated from <italic>Pgd</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup><italic>Foxp3</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice showed reduced suppressive function in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which was accompanied by a shift of gene expression signatures and phenotype markers toward T CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets of Th1, Th2, and Th17. Loss of suppressive function and plasticity toward conventional subsets was also reproduced by treatments with 6PGD small molecule inhibitor 6-AN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Although Glc, but not Gln, contributes to Tregs differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pacella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Procaccini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakaya et al., 2014</xref>), Glc depletion by blocking the Glc transporter Glut1 did not alter the suppressive function of Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Macintyre et al., 2014</xref>). However, our study showed that the suppressive function of Tregs was modulated by altered Glc metabolism via the oxidative PPP, that is, <italic>6PGD</italic> deficiency in Tregs resulting in significantly improved anti-tumor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâN</xref>) or changed IBD outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This qualifies 6PGD as an immune checkpoint by modulating the Treg function while implicating the importance of Glc metabolism via the oxidative PPP in Treg activation.</p><p>As our knowledge of Glc and Gln metabolism in Tregs is limited, we tracked the metabolic fates of both fuel substrates with stable isotope tracers in 6PGD blocked versus WT Tregs. We found that blocking 6PGD in oxidative PPP shifted Glc flow into glycolysis and non-oxidative PPP to provide sufficient substrates (e.g. one-carbon metabolites and R5P) for fueling nucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This was also accompanied by enhanced Gln flow into GNG to power nucleobase synthesis and NADPH production, which can compensate for NADPH loss due to 6PGD blockade. These reprogrammed metabolic activities co-occurred with the shift of expression in phenotypic and functional markers toward conventional T CD4<sup>+</sup> subsets. The importance of glycolytic shift on modulating Tregs fitness has been shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Watson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zappasodi et al., 2021</xref>). Tregs in high Glc environment lose their fitness while upregulation of lactate metabolism is important for maintaining their suppressive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Watson et al., 2021</xref>). Also, the presence of Glc was shown to be a key factor in interfering Treg function under anti-CTLA-4 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zappasodi et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, although glycolysis is key to supporting the energy and anabolic demands during Treg expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pacella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">De Rosa et al., 2015</xref>), further increase in glycolysis as a result of mTOR and c-Myc activation suppresses Treg generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kabat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Our metabolic fate analysis not only corroborates with glycolytic control of Treg functions but also reveals the role of 6PGD as a key regulator of Treg stability.</p><p>Although disruption of Gln uptake did not impact Treg function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nakaya et al., 2014</xref>), enhanced Gln metabolism in 6PGD-deficient Tregs was evident and co-occurred with the shift from Treg to Th1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Klysz et al., 2015</xref>), Th2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>), or Th17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xu et al., 2017</xref>) phenotypes. Increased Gln oxidation in the Krebs cycle promoted the synthesis of immunomodulatory metabolites such as Î±KG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which has been shown to signal Foxp3 suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Klysz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). At the same time, diversion of Gln carbons for enhanced nucleotide synthesis would help meet the metabolic demand of the shift toward conventional T subsets. Thus, Gln metabolism could synergize with 6PGD deficiency in eliciting Treg plasticity toward immune activation. Further studies will be required to substantiate such metabolic mechanism.</p><p>In summary, we reported a critical role of 6PGD, the second rate-limiting enzyme of PPP, in skewing Tregs function and metabolism toward those of the Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets. As such, 6PGD could be a novel metabolic target in clinical applications such as autoimmune disorders or cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cells from spleen and lymph nodes were obtained by tissue harvest, mechanically disintegration, passing through 70 Î¼m cell strainer and then red blood cell lysis. Tumor infiltration cells were also prepared using the same steps with additional 30 min collagenase treatment at 37Â°C. Cultured cells and sorted cells just passed one step of wash with FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% FBS). Cells were suspended in FACS buffer and stained for surface markers for 30 min at 4Â°C. Aqua LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead Cell Stain was used in all staining to distinguish dead cells. Intracellular staining for IL-4, IL-13, Il-5, IFN-Î³, IL-17A, TGF-Î², and granzyme B was performed with the Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit with BD GolgiPlug (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. To detect cytokines, cells were cultured in RMPI containing 10% FBS and were stimulated with PMA (50 ng/ml), ionomycin (1 Î¼g/ml), and GolgiPlug (1 Î¼l/ml) for 4 hr at 37C before starting the staining. For assessment of Foxp3, cells were stained intracellularly using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Buffer Set (eBiosciences) following the manufacturerâs protocol. Glc uptake was analyzed by incubation of the cells with 20 Î¼M 2-NBD-Glc (Cayman Chemical) for 30 min at 37Â°C. Cells were analyzed by a CytoFLEX LX (Beckman Coulter) cytometer and analysis was performed using FlowJo_V10 software. All antibodies are listed in the Key resources table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell isolation by flow cytometry cell sorting</title><p>To obtain purified cells, single cells were first enriched by negative selection using EasySep Mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolation kit (STEMCELL Technologies) following manufacturerâs protocols. Then cells were stained for desired surface markers and sorted by flow cytometry. Surface markers for gating/sorting of each cell type included: naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>high</sup> CD44<sup>low</sup>), YFP<sup>+</sup> Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> YFP<sup>+</sup>), EFGP<sup>+</sup> Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> EGFP<sup>+</sup>), and T effector cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>high</sup>). All the stainings were done at 4Â°C for 30 min and sorting was done by Becton Dickinson SORP FACSAria II (Beckman Coulter). Isolated cell phenotypes were confirmed by running again with flow cytometer (CytoFLEX LX, Beckman Coulter).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell culture and treatment</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>NaÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell treatment with inhibitors</title><p>NaÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>high</sup> CD44<sup>low</sup>) were isolated and cultured in complete RPMI media containing 10% FBS and IL-2 (20 IU/ml) and treated with 6-AN (10 ÂµM), DHEA (10 ÂµM), or vehicle DMSO. Cells stimulation was done by adding soluble anti-CD3 (1 Âµg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 Âµg/ml). Cells were harvested and evaluated 4 days post culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>NaÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells polarization toward Tregs and treatment with 6-AN</title><p>To target 6PGD in vitro, naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>high</sup> CD44<sup>low</sup>) were isolated and polarized to Tregs using IL-2 (50 IU/ml) and TGF-Î²1 (5 ng/ml). Stimulation was done by culturing the cells in plate coated antibodies. For coating anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (2 Âµg/ml PBS each) were put on the plate and incubated 4 hr at 37Â°C and then washed twice with PBS. For inhibitor treatment 6-AN (10 ÂµM) or vehicle DMSO was added.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Culture of YFP<sup>+</sup> sorted cells</title><p>Isolated Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> YFP<sup>+</sup>) were cultured in vitro in presence of IL-2 (700 IU/ml) and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads (Treg:beads ratio 1:3) and cells number was assessed at 24 and 48 hr time points.

These cells express CD45.2 on their surface (B6 CD45.2<sup>+</sup>). To check suppressive capacity of prepared Tregs, the cells were mixed with WT CD45.1<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>high</sup>) in different ratio and cultured in U shaped plate. The effecter cells were stained with CFSE (0.5 mM) for 30 min before culture. For optimized stimulation of effector cells, 2.5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> irradiated (30 Gy) splenocytes from CD45.2<sup>+</sup> mice (WT B6 CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) and soluble anti-CD3 (1 Âµg/ml) was added. After 72 hr of co-culture, amount of CFSE dilution was determined in CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45.1<sup>+</sup> effector cells using flow cytometer (CytoFLEX LX, Beckman Coulter).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA purification, RNAseq, and real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from YFP<sup>+</sup> sorted cells with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and RNA concentrations were determined using Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). Total DNA-free RNA was used for mRNA isolation and library construction. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HISEQ 2500 (Illumina). Confirmation of RNAseq was done by examination of key representative genes by real-time quantitative PCR method using ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Used TaqMan probes are listed in the Key resources table. Expression of each gene was normalized to the housekeeping gene expression (18 S rRNA) as ÎCT = CT (gene X) â CT (18 S rRNA). The alteration between groups was calculated as fold change = 2^(ÎÎCT). ÎÎCT is: CT (gene X) â CT (gene X at baseline).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Bioenergetics analysis by Seahorse and mitochondrial activity</title><p>Prepared Tregs (YFP<sup>+</sup> sorted cells) were seeded on Cell-Tak coated Seahorse XFe24 (Agilent) culture plates (0.8â1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) in assay media. The media was DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA and 25 mM Glc, 1 mM pyruvate, and 2 mM Gln. The ECAR and OCR were measured over 75 min. To obtain maximal respiratory and control values, cells were treated with oligomycin (1 Î¼M), FCCP (1.5 Î¼M), and rotenone/antimycin A (0.5 Î¼M).</p><p>Mitochondrial activity also was examined by flow cytometry. For this, cells were stained with 200 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM (ThermoFisher) for mitochondrial mass and 200 nM tetra-methylrhodamine ester (TMRE) (ThermoFisher) for mitochondrial membrane potential. Staining was done in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS) along with cell surface markers for 30 min at 37Â°C. To detect mitochondrial reactive oxygen species cells surface markers were added and then 5 Î¼M MitoSOX Red (ThermoFisher) was added in last 10 min incubation at 37Â°C. Cells were analyzed by a CytoFLEX LX (Beckman Coulter) cytometer and analyzed by FlowJo_V10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>IBD model</title><p>To examine Tregs suppressive activities in vivo, the IBD model was used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ostanin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Steinbach et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Apurva Sarin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Silvia Piconese (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study demonstrates that 6PGD, a rate-limiting enzyme in the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway, modulates Treg metabolism and functions. Mice with a Treg-restricted 6PGD deficiency (either constitutive or inducible) spontaneously develop a multi-organ scurfy-like lethal disease, and succumb to early death, suggesting a loss of Treg cell immunosuppressive function. Treg cell frequency in these mice is apparently only slightly reduced and is mostly affected by a transcriptional reprogramming to resemble that of conventional T effector subsets, with Tregs presenting skewed metabolism toward glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and non-oxidative PPP. The study includes a description of disease phenotypes and cellular properties, which is supported by transcriptional analysis and detailed metabolite analysis at the cellular level. The precise mechanism through which 6PGD destabilizes Tregs remains to be elucidated. The core ideas of this manuscript are of interest in the area of Treg immunometabolism, which currently lags behind conventional CD4 and CD8 literature.</p><p>Daneshmandi et al. describe metabolic and functional consequences of blocking the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in Treg cells. While the core ideas of this manuscript are of interest in the area of Treg immunometabolism, there are substantial issues â outlined in the comments, that remain to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Most experiments describing the Treg cell phenotype and function are in Foxp3Cre 6PGDfl/fl mice, which has significant systemic inflammation. This confounds Treg cell phenotypes that are presented (e.g., RNA-seq profile, in vitro suppression, ECAR, OCR, adoptive transfer). The Foxp3Cre 6PGDfl/fl system is appropriate for the in vivo profiling data of conventional CD4, CD8, and Treg cells, but not to conclude direct effects of 6PGD loss within Treg cells. The characterization of 6PGD deficient Treg cells should be undertaken in an inflammation-free system, using either mixed bone marrow chimera mice or an inducible-cre system (see the following comment). Alternatively, key analyses may be performed using Foxp3Cre/+ heterozygous females, only if they do not develop inflammation. Characterization of the Treg phenotype in an inflammation-free background is critical to support the main conclusion of the study.</p><p>2. The authors are advised to reassess the experiments using tamoxifen-inducible Foxp3-CreERT2 as the intricacies of this system appear to have been overlooked. Tamoxifen treatment does not induce Foxp3-EGFP expression in these mice as Foxp3-EGFP is expressed irrespective of tamoxifen (doi: 10.1126/science.1191996). Tamoxifen treatment will induce Cre-mediated gene deletion in Foxp3 expressing cells, but the cells are already EGFP+. In order to observe these cells, the mice must be crossed with a Rosa26-driven, stop-floxed fluorescent reporter mouse (e.g., YFP, available at jax.org/strain/006148), which will have fluorescent reporter expression only in the cells with successful Cre activation. The bulk EGFP+ cells contain a mixture of 6PGD+/+ and 6PGD-/- Treg cells. Furthermore, Foxp3-CreERT2 is a notoriously inefficient system for successful Cre activation, with only 50% or less of Treg cells actually having Cre-mediated gene deletion following tamoxifen treatment in vivo. If there are constraints on completing the experiment with the reporter as recommended, the data in its current form may be omitted from the study.</p><p>3. In the Results section, the sentence &quot;As our preliminary studies showed that 6PGD but not G6PD blockade induces T cells activation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 B-C). &quot; is truncated. The preliminary data shown in suppl. Figure 1B-C indicates that a 6PGD pharmacological inhibitor enhances IFN-Î³ production by in vitro activated CD4 T cells, not that it &quot;induces&quot; T cell activation: the text should be corrected accordingly. In supplemental figure 1, the effects of DHEA on cell viability are noticeable. Any activation defects on the cells are likely a secondary consequence. Is it possible to use a lower dose to avoid so much cell death? In Figure 1G, the sentence &quot;Lymphoproliferation was attributed to a higher number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen/lymphoid organs should be corrected, since this figure shows frequencies and not counts. Further, Figure 1G only shows one plot, but it is from multiple organs according to the text. Are the other plots missing?</p><p>4. Regarding Treg frequency in Figure 2A, it is more informative to show the percentage of Foxp3+ in gated CD4 T cells, and also to show the gMFI of Foxp3 in gated Foxp3+ cells (it seems much lower in fl/fl mice; indeed this is confirmed by RT-PCR in Figure 2E). Is the difference between the two groups statistically significant? Statistics for frequencies and total numbers of Treg cells are missing. It is unclear why iTreg cells were used for figure 2C? A 50% reduction in Foxp3 gene expression, (Figure 2E), is substantial and seems incongruent with the claim of only a &quot;slight decrease&quot; in YFP MFI. Does direct Foxp3 staining and MFI quantification show the same result?</p><p>5. Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D does not explain Treg plasticity since it refers to conventional effector T cell polarisation. The authors may consider removing this experiment from the manuscript. Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 F-G-H presumably shows gated/sorted Foxp3+ cells: if this is the case, it needs to be clarified in the respective legend.</p><p>6. Figure 3B, and especially the meaning of the arrows, is unclear and may be omitted. Figure 3C shows substantial loss of Foxp3 gene expression with 6-AN treatment, but this does not appear to manifest in YFP expression as seen in Figure 3B. To check whether 6-AN affects iTreg polarization, the frequency of YFP+ cells and/or the gMFI of Foxp3-YFP should be assessed first in total CD4 T cells and not in gated YFP+ cells as apparently done here. In figure 3D-E, have YFP+ iTregs been sorted before assessing their suppressive function? In figure 3G, it is not clear what CONTROL means: is it the wild-type (not transgenic) mouse? The Treg gate looks very wide. Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C is not mentioned in the text at the following point in the text: &quot;higher infiltration of T cells (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells)&quot;. Regarding Figure 3âfigure supplement 1L-M, are these cells MDSCs or rather pro-inflammatory neutrophils? Some more profiling is needed to identify these cells as MDSCs.</p><p>7. Reiterating an earlier point, the analysis of Figure 4 should be performed in Treg cells isolated from an inflammation-free system.</p><p>8. Statistical analysis is to be provided for data in Figures 3 and 4C</p><p>9. As a more general point, it should be clarified that data (and supporting bibliography) refer not to conventional T cells polarising into T helper subsets but to Tregs becoming unstable and gaining T helper-like features, which is a defined process.</p><p>10. The precise mechanism through which 6PGD destabilizes Tregs may be epigenetic (as mentioned in the discussion) as also metabolic (for instance related to a higher glucose capture). See for instance the two recent papers 10.1038/s41586-021-03326-4 and 10.1038/s41586-020-03045-2. The discussion could be integrated with some more hypotheses and speculations on the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>11. The manuscript would benefit from careful editing since several statements are not adequately supported by the data or by the quoted references.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors employ chemical inhibition as well as genetic approaches to block 6PGD activity and report striking phenotypes of loss of immune-suppression in mice carrying a Treg-specific deletion.

(2) The goal of current paper is reporting observed phenotype and function and we aim to address the mechanism of action in future studies.</p><p>The main goal of current manuscript is to demonstrate the key role of 6PGD (the key enzyme in oxidative PPP) in modulating Treg function. We understand that there are questions unanswered, notably the mechanism of action and possible effects of inflammatory condition on the observed phenotype. However, to fully answer these questions is beyond the current scope. We have highlighted âinflammatory conditionâ throughout the manuscript to keep in mind that targeting 6PGD in Tregs comes along with systemic inflammation.</p><p>Suffice to say, we have examined the key findings in inflammation free conditions:</p><p>â We have generated Tregs from wild type (WT) naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of 6PGD inhibitor (6-AN) and showed key findings as alteration of FoxP3/GATA3 expression, cytokine production shift and altered suppressive function (Figure 3A-E).</p><p>â We also showed comparable results in Tregs function (Figure 3H-O) using inducible FoxP3 mice (please see further details in response to comment 2) that provide inflammation free condition and the same inflammation baseline for both WT and 6PGD blocked Tregs.</p><p>â Furthermore, to evaluate metabolic shifts in Tregs in an inflammation free condition, we generated Tregs from naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within 4 days in vitro (therefore there was no inflammatory environment) and tracked Glc and Gln metabolism which showed a similar pattern of shift as Tregs isolated from 6PGD<sup>fl/fl</sup> FoxP3<sup>Cre</sup> mice (please see added Figure 4 supplementary figure 2 and Figure 4 supplementary figure 3).</p><p>It should be noted that it is highly unlikely to generate inflammation free condition by Chimeric models of 6PGD deletion as it would need several weeks to develop chimera, while even 3 weeks of 6PGD blockade induces massive inflammation that kill the mice after birth. This is the reason why we took the in vitro approach. However, per the reviewerâs suggestion, the inducible FoxP3 Cre (tamoxifen-inducible Foxp3-CreERT2) is useful as we examined (Please see response to Comment 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors are advised to reassess the experiments using tamoxifen-inducible Foxp3-CreERT2 as the intricacies of this system appear to have been overlooked.

Although the tamoxifen induction does not induce deletion in 100% of Tregs (possibly 50% based on the mentioned reference), it was sufficient to reduce tumor growth (i.e. reduced Treg suppressive function in vivo) and suppressive capacity in suppression assay in vitro. This is important in the context of Comment 1 discussion. The mentioned reference has very nicely shown that gene deletion (50%) only happened upon Tamoxifen induction, supporting âtarget specificityâ and âinflammation free condition at baselineâ. Our data indicate that 6PGD did not need to be deleted in 100% of Tregs to show significant phenotype. So, while we have not done the suggested improved experiment, the current data support our goal of defining 6PGDâs role in modulating Tregs function. We have added a statement in the result section to reflect the incomplete induction of FOXP3 deletion in the model used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Further, Figure 1G only shows one plot, but it is from multiple organs according to the text. Are the other plots missing?</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence was corrected based on the comment to show enhanced IFN-Î³ production and not âinduction of activationâ in T cells.</p><p>The main point of supplemental figure 1B-C was to show noticeable effect of DHEA on activated T cells viability. While the same concentration of 6-AN and DHEA inhibitors (10 ÂµM) were used, DHEA instigated poor T cells viability but not 6-AN. This shows the critical role of G6PD in cells viability and therefore its targeting is not tolerable by T cells. Meanwhile, blocking 6PGD was tolerable by the activated T cells and resulted in higher IFN-g production presumably by the induced metabolic shifts. This preliminary experiment provided the reason why we investigated 6PGDâs role in T cell activation. Text on page 4 was revised to substantiate this point.</p><p>For Figure 1G, the word âCountâ was corrected for âFrequencyâ. (Count per organ is presented in Figure 1E). We have evaluated both lymph nodes and spleens for markers mentioned in Figure 1G-K. As both spleen and lymphnodes show similar pattern or responses, we presented splenocytes data as an example. We have revised the relevant Results text on page 5 accordingly. Moreover, the enlarged spleen and lymph node size shown in Figure 1D suggests lymphoproliferation in both spleen and lymph nodes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Regarding Treg frequency in Figure 2A, it is more informative to show the percentage of Foxp3+ in gated CD4 T cells, and also to show the gMFI of Foxp3 in gated Foxp3+ cells (it seems much lower in fl/fl mice; indeed this is confirmed by RT-PCR in Figure 2E). Is the difference between the two groups statistically significant? Statistics for frequencies and total numbers of Treg cells are missing. It is unclear why iTreg cells were used for figure 2C? A 50% reduction in Foxp3 gene expression, (Figure 2E), is substantial and seems incongruent with the claim of only a &quot;slight decrease&quot; in YFP MFI. Does direct Foxp3 staining and MFI quantification show the same result?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the percentage of Foxp3+ in gated CD4 T cells in Figure 2A. We also added Figure 2B to show gMFI of Foxp3 in gated Foxp3+ cells. Statistical analysis for the two panels are provided to show significantly lower frequency of FoxP3+ T cells in 6PGD<sup>fl/fl</sup> FoxP3<sup>Cre</sup> group. Figure 2C (original) was eliminated to prevent confusion.</p><p>Decreased FoxP3 expression (Figure 2E) is consistent with lower levels of Foxp3 staining in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and gMFI quantifications (Figure 2A-B) in 6PGD blocked Tregs. This result was also reproduced when Tregs were generated with 6PGD inhibitor 6-AN, in vitro (Figure 3C). About 50% decrease in YFP+ cells is also evident in 6PGDfl/fl FoxP3Cre mice (Data not shown in paper; Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) Please note that Figure 2D is representative of âSorted YFP+ cellsâ that have been used in all YFP+ sorted experiment (e.g. Figure 2E-G and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 4 and supplements).

Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D does not explain Treg plasticity since it refers to conventional effector T cell polarisation. The authors may consider removing this experiment from the manuscript.

While 6PGD blocked Tregs show altered markers of CD4<sup>+</sup> T subsets (revised Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-C and also Figure 2G and Figure 3C), E-G of revised figure 2âfigure supplement 1 provide additional information regarding CD4<sup>+</sup> T subsets and indicate general shift of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells subsets in 6PGD<sup>fl/fl</sup> FoxP3<sup>Cre</sup> mice.

Figure 3C shows substantial loss of Foxp3 gene expression with 6-AN treatment, but this does not appear to manifest in YFP expression as seen in Figure 3B. To check whether 6-AN affects iTreg polarization, the frequency of YFP+ cells and/or the gMFI of Foxp3-YFP should be assessed first in total CD4 T cells and not in gated YFP+ cells as apparently done here. In figure 3D-E, have YFP+ iTregs been sorted before assessing their suppressive function? In figure 3G, it is not clear what CONTROL means: is it the wild-type (not transgenic) mouse? The Treg gate looks very wide. Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C is not mentioned in the text at the following point in the text: &quot;higher infiltration of T cells (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells)&quot;. Regarding Figure 3âfigure supplement 1L-M, are these cells MDSCs or rather pro-inflammatory neutrophils? Some more profiling is needed to identify these cells as MDSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reviewer meant arrows in the schemes of Figure 3A (original) being unclear (as the Figure 3B was a flowcytometry graph). We have removed the figure 3A panel.</p><p>The original Figure 3B (now Figure 3A) shows the percentage of YFP+ cells. The YFP gMFI (gated on CD4<sup>+</sup> cells) for respective treatments was determined and presented in bar graph as new Figure 3B.

The precise mechanism through which 6PGD destabilizes Tregs may be epigenetic (as mentioned in the discussion) as also metabolic (for instance related to a higher glucose capture).

The early onset of systemic inflammation in mice with an ablation of 6PGD may modulate the analysis of cell intrinsic 6PGD dependencies, a limitation not ruled out in the study.
