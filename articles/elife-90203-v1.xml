highly conserved protein-coding genes (<italic>SLITRK2</italic> and <italic>FMR1</italic>) on the X chromosome. Intriguingly, these miRNAs are predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a potential role in spermatogenesis and male fertility. Here, we report that the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs were derived from the MER91C DNA transposons. Selective inactivation of individual miRNAs or clusters caused no discernible defects, but simultaneous ablation of five clusters containing 19 members of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family led to reduced male fertility in mice. Despite normal sperm counts, motility, and morphology, the KO sperm were less competitive than wild-type sperm when subjected to a polyandrous mating scheme. Transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed that these X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs, in addition to targeting a set of conserved genes, have more targets that are critical for spermatogenesis and embryonic development during evolution. Our data suggest that the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs function to enhance sperm competitiveness and reproductive fitness of the male by finetuning gene expression during spermatogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sperm competition</kwd><kwd>reproductive fitness</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>selective

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis is highly conserved among all vertebrates. Although it generally consists of three phases (mitotic, meiotic, and haploid), many characteristics appear to be species-specific, for example<italic>,</italic> the duration of each of the three phases, the seminiferous epithelial organization, and the shape and length of spermatozoa, likely reflecting the adaptive changes during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Oakberg, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Muciaccia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2019</xref>). Several cellular events are unique to the male germ cells, for example, postnatal formation of the adult male germline stem cells (i.e., spermatogonia stem cells), pubertal onset of meiosis, and haploid male germ cell differentiation (also called spermiogenesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hermo et al., 2010</xref>). Unique cellular processes are often accompanied by a more complex yet unique transcriptome, which may explain why the testis expresses more genes than any other organs in the body, with the possible exception of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khaitovich et al., 2006</xref>). Regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Idler and Yan, 2012</xref>). As a post-transcriptional regulator, miRNAs are abundantly expressed in the testis and are required for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Papaioannou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2022</xref>). miRNAs typically function at post-transcriptional levels by binding the complementary sequences in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs – particularly in the 3′UTRs through the ‘seed sequence’ (2nd–7th nucleotides)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Numerous miRNAs are subject to rapid evolution, probably in response to the accelerated rate of divergence of UTRs compared to the exonic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayr, 2016</xref>). Divergence of genomic sequences can be mediated by transposable elements (TEs), which are known as building blocks of the genome and mostly map to UTRs and intronic regions of protein-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). Each miRNA can bind numerous target mRNAs, and one mRNA can be targeted by multiple different miRNAs. This ‘one-to-multiple’ relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs amplifies their potential to coordinate gene expression in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Moreover, miRNA genes often exist in clusters, which are transcribed as a unit followed by nuclear and cytoplasmic cleavage events to generate individual miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Multiple clusters of miRNA genes containing the same seed sequences are categorized as a miRNA family, and miRNAs within the same family likely evolved from a common ancestor sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). Of great interest, many of the testis-enriched miRNA clusters map to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2009</xref>). Sex-linked genes are generally subject to the male germline-specific phenomenon called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which silences transcription during most, if not all, of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, prior to 2009, there were no confirmed reports of any sex-linked genes escaping the repressive effects of MSCI. Surprisingly, however, we found that many X-linked miRNA genes do escape MSCI, suggesting that they may contribute to particularly important functions during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2009</xref>). This notion has since been tested by the generation of knockouts (KOs) of individual miRNA genes or individual clusters of miRNA genes normally expressed during spermatogenesis. However, these KOs resulted in minimal, if any, phenotypic effects and did not appear to impede normal spermatogenesis or male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). This left the field facing multiple unanswered questions, including (1) why do so many X-linked miRNAs express uniquely or preferentially during spermatogenesis and escape MSCI, (2) what is their origin, and (3) how and why did they evolve rapidly?</p><p>To address these questions and better understand the functional role played by these X-linked miRNAs, we investigated the evolutionary history of this unique miRNA family and also generated KOs of individual, paired, triple, quadruple, or quintuple sets of miRNA clusters within this family and tested the effects on male fertility, initially by standard monandrous mating assays. Consistent with previous efforts to inactivate miRNA genes in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miska et al., 2007</xref>), KOs of either individual members or individual clusters of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family induced no discernible phenotypes and did not impact male fertility. This may reflect the level of functional redundancy inherent within the members and clusters of this miRNA family. It was only when four or more clusters of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family were ablated that relevant phenotype became detectable, which was manifested in the form of reduced litter size despite normal sperm counts, motility, and morphology. Interestingly, the most common male fertility testing for lab rodents is based on a monandrous mating scheme, that is<italic>,</italic> one fertility-proven female mated with one male. However, there are additional aspects of male fertility in many mammalian species, particularly those that are normally litter-bearing. In the wild, litter-bearing females often mate with multiple different males such that a single litter may include pups sired by more than one male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firman and Simmons, 2008</xref>). This polyandrous mating introduces the potential for additional aspects of male reproductive fitness to accrue, one of which involves sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firman and Simmons, 2008</xref>). Sperm competition can occur when sperm from more than one male are present in the female reproductive tract simultaneously, such that they then compete to fertilize each oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker, 1970</xref>). Sperm competition has been now recognized as a significant evolutionary force directly impacting male reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker, 1970</xref>). Using experiments that mimic polyandrous mating, we found that the quinKO male mice indeed displayed compromised sperm competition.

Of interest, no significant changes were detected in litter interval, testis weight, or histology in any of the four types of KOs, as compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–G</xref>). Computer-assisted sperm analyses (CASA) revealed no significant differences in sperm counts and motility parameters among the four types of KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Overall, there appears to be an inverse correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9139, p&lt;0.05, <italic>F</italic>-test) between the number of miRNAs inactivated and the litter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Interestingly, several human studies have correlated the dysregulated <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs with impaired male fertility due to maturation arrest and oligo-asthenozoospermia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Halima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heidary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Qing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These data suggest that the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family may play an important role in spermatogenesis and male fertility.</p><p>Most of the protein-coding genes that are exclusively or preferentially expressed in the testis with an essential role in spermatogenesis are highly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). Despite their male germ cell-predominant expression, the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs appear to have evolved rapidly to diverge their sequences, suggesting that these miRNAs might control certain ‘non-conserved’ aspects of spermatogenesis, leading to enhanced sperm competitiveness for male reproductive success. Supporting this hypothesis, previous reports have documented that females of most species throughout the animal kingdoms mate with multiple males before pregnancy, suggesting that sperm competition may serve as a selection mechanism to bias the birth of offspring sired by the males with more competitive sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firman and Simmons, 2008</xref>). Studies have also shown female rodents in the wild mate with multiple males and produce litters of mixed paternity, and that pups born to the females following such polyandrous mating display greater survival rates than those produced from females following monandrous mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Firman, 2011</xref>). Given that CASA detected no difference in swimming patterns between quinKO and WT sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>), we next carried out sperm competition experiments that mimic polyandrous mating in the wild. Since the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs are X-linked, the Y sperm from the quinKO mice are genetically indistinguishable from those of WT controls. We, therefore, adopted the mTmG male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) for sperm competition experiments because the embryos or offspring fathered by the mTmG males can be easily identified based on the constitutively expressed membrane-tagged tomato red (mT) fluorescence and/or PCR genotyping.</p><p>We first conducted sequential mating with two mating events ~6–8 hr apart. Interestingly, all of the pups born were fathered by mTmG males (n = 8) when the WT females were mated first with mTmG males and subsequently with the quinKO males. In contrast, when the WT females were mated first with quinKO males and subsequently with mTmG males, ~89% of the pups born were fathered by quinKO males, and the remaining ~11% of pups were from mTmG males (n = 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1 fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 1 and 2</xref>). It is noteworthy that in the sequential mating experiments, the two coituses occurred ~6–8 hr apart due to practical reasons, whereas in the wild, polyandrous mating may take place much faster. To better mimic polyandrous mating in vitro, we mixed the WT and quinKO sperm in different ratios and used the mixed sperm to perform IVF (in vitro fertilization). MII oocytes fertilized by mTmG, quinKO, or a mixture of two types of sperm at three ratios (mTmG:quinKO = 1:1, 4:1, and 1:4) all displayed comparable rates at which fertilized oocytes developed into blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Interestingly, when a 1:1 ratio (mTmG sperm:quinKO sperm) was used, ~73% of the resulting blastocysts were derived from mTmG sperm, whereas the remaining ~27% were from quinKO sperm (n = 179) (p&lt;0.0001, chi-squared test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). When a 4:1 sperm ratio (mTmG: quinKO) was used, ~92% of the blastocysts were from mTmG sperm and only 8% were from quinKO sperm (n = 170) (p&lt;0.05, chi-squared test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). In contrast, when a 1:4 sperm ratio (mTmG:quinKO) was used, blastocysts derived from mTmG and quinKO sperm represented ~28% and ~72% of the total, respectively (n = 135) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). We also performed co-artificial insemination (AI) using mTmG and quinKO sperm. When a 1:1 sperm ratio (mTmG:quinKO) was used, ~62.5% of the embryos (n = 96) were derived from mTmG sperm (p&lt;0.05, chi-squared test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). When a 1:4 ratio was used, ~35.3% of the embryos (n = 17) were from the mTmG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata3 fig4s1sdata4">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 3 and 4</xref>). Together, these results indicate that the quinKO sperm are less competitive than the control mTmG sperm both in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies suggest that sperm aggregation and midpiece size might be involved in sperm competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher and Hoekstra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fisher et al., 2016</xref>), but no changes in these two parameters were observed in the quinKO sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K and L</xref>). Although the blastocyst rate (out of two-cell embryos) of quinKO was comparable to that of the mTmG mice, the two-cell rates (out of zygotes) were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test) in the quinKO mice (~39%, n = 67) when compared to the mTmG mice (~88%, n = 58) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1M</xref>), implying that the quinKO sperm is indeed less efficient in fertilizing eggs and/or supporting early embryonic development, especially the first cleavage of the zygotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs mostly target the genes involved in spermatogenesis and embryonic development and compensate for each other</title><p>To identify the target genes of these X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs, we performed RNA-seq analyses using testis samples from the five types of KOs (<italic>Mir465</italic> sKO, dKO, tKO, quadKO, and quinKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

To distinguish the two possibilities, we first compared the extent of similarities among the 3′UTR sequences of the 2510 shared target genes between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). We adopted the PhyloP scores to measure the evolutionary conservation at individual nucleotide sites in the 3′UTRs of the shared target genes. The overall conservation appeared to be greater in the regions targeted by <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs than in the non-target regions in the 3′UTRs of the shared target genes in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>) with a few exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>) (p&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test). These data suggest that the regions targeted by the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs are under relatively stronger purifying, rather than adaptive, selection. We then tested the second hypothesis that the rapid evolution of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family resulted in more extant mRNAs being targeted by these miRNAs. We first compared the average target numbers of each <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNA between humans and mice using the 2510 shared targets between predicted targets in humans and the dysregulated targets in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and F</xref>).</p><p>Among these shared targets, the human <italic>MIR-506</italic> family members could target ~1268 unique transcripts per miRNA, whereas the murine <italic>MIR-506</italic> family members could only target ~1068 (p&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs target more genes in humans than in mice. Furthermore, we analyzed the number of all potential targets of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs predicted by the aforementioned four algorithms among humans, mice, and rats. The total number of targets for all the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs among different species did not show significant enrichment in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting the sheer number of target genes does not increase in humans. We then compared the number of target genes per miRNA. When comparing the number of target genes per miRNA for all the miRNAs (baseline) between humans and mice, we found that on a per miRNA basis, human miRNAs have more targets than murine miRNAs (p&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with higher biological complexity in humans. This became even more obvious for the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family (p&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In humans, the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, on a per miRNA basis, targets a significantly greater number of genes than the average of all miRNAs combined (p&lt;0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, in mice, we observed no significant difference in the number of targets per miRNA between X-linked miRNAs and all of the mouse miRNAs combined (mouse baseline) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest that although the sheer number of target genes remains the same between humans and mice, the human X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family targets a greater number of genes than the murine counterpart on a per miRNA basis. We also investigated the number of <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNA targeting sites within the individual target genes in both humans and mice, but no significant differences were found between humans and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). To determine whether increased target sites in humans were due to the expansion of the MER91C DNA transposon, we analyzed the MER91C DNA transposon-containing transcripts and associated them with our DETs. Of interest, 28 human and 3 mouse mRNAs possess 3′UTRs containing MER91C DNA sequences, and only 3 and 0 out of those 28 and 3 genes belonged to DETs in humans and mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting a minimal effect of MER91C DNA transposon expansion on the number of target sites. Taken together, these results suggest the human X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family has been subjected to additional selective pressure, causing them to exert additional regulatory functions by targeting more mRNAs expressed during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Successful reproduction is pivotal for the perpetuation of species, and sperm are constantly facing selective pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morrow, 2004</xref>). To enhance their chance to fertilize eggs, sperm need to adapt accordingly, and miRNAs-mediated regulation of gene expression in spermatogenesis provides a rapidly adaptable mechanism toward this end. Although miRNAs were initially believed to be evolutionarily conserved, the number of non-conserved miRNAs has been steadily increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Piriyapongsa et al., 2007</xref>). Among the non-conserved miRNAs, many are derived from TEs, suggesting that TEs may serve as a major source of miRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Piriyapongsa et al., 2007</xref>). The delayed recognition of TE-derived miRNAs, in part, results from the fact that repetitive sequences were usually excluded during the computational annotation of miRNAs. In theory, TEs can serve as a good donor of miRNA sequences for the following reasons: (1) TEs are ubiquitous and abundant in the genome and are known to contribute to the regulatory elements of the coding genes, for example, UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>). As one of the regulatory factors that target mainly the 3′UTRs, TE-derived miRNAs can regulate a larger number of mRNAs with multiple miRNA-targeting sites. (2) TEs are among the most rapidly evolving sequences in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">González and Petrov, 2012</xref>) and thus, can continuously produce species/lineage-specific miRNA genes to diversify their regulatory effects. Consistent with these notions, the present study provides evidence supporting that the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs originated from the MER91C DNA transposons. Of more interest, the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs, despite their rapid evolution, are all expressed in spermatogenic cells in the testis and sperm, supporting a lineage-specific functional diversification of TE-derived miRNAs. In fact, the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs were among the first reported TE-derived miRNAs because of their location in a small region of the X chromosome and their confined, abundant expression in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2009</xref>). RNAs are much less abundant in sperm than in somatic or spermatogenic cells (~1/100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Sperm-borne small RNAs represent a small fraction of total small RNAs expressed in their precursor spermatogenic cells, including spermatocytes and spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, when the same amount of total/small RNAs are used for quantitative analyses, sperm-borne small RNAs (e.g., <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs) would be proportionally enriched in sperm compared to other spermatogenic cells.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that under certain circumstances genes that evolve under sexual conflicts tend to move to the X chromosome, especially when they are male-beneficial, female-deleterious, and act recessively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rice, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibson et al., 2002</xref>). The X chromosome is enriched with genes associated with male reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). The rapid evolution of the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family strongly suggests that these miRNA genes were under selection to expand and diversify their regulatory effects on spermatogenesis. Indeed, our data strongly suggest that targeting new mRNAs was likely the driving force for the rapid evolution of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family of miRNAs. However, expansion and sequence divergence of the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family may simply reflect natural drifting without functional significance, similar to some of the pachytene piRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Özata et al., 2020</xref>). We argue that the neutral drifting theory may not be true to the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family for the following reasons: (1) despite highly divergent overall sequences of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, some miRNAs share the same seed regions across multiple species, suggesting that these regions may undergo strong selections. (2) The <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs, especially the <italic>FmiRs</italic>, are highly conserved in modern humans, implying a strong selection of these miRNAs. (3) Knockout of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family (either quinKO or XS) results in male subfertility, reflecting a biological function. (4) The quinKO sperm are less competitive than the WT sperm both in vivo and in vitro. (5) Several human studies have linked the dysregulation of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family with male infertility/subfertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Halima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heidary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Qing et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, one study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also showed that the rapidly evolving testis-restricted miRNAs underwent adaptive evolution rather than neutral drifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mohammed et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since TEs are abundant in UTRs, TE-derived miRNAs can target a much greater number of mRNAs than those derived from distinct non-repetitive genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Piriyapongsa et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, thousands of the dysregulated genes detected in the <italic>Mir465</italic> sKO, dKO, tKO, quadKO, and quinKO testes are involved in multiple pathways of spermatogenesis. By analyzing the sequence divergence, we noticed that the most common sequence substitutions among all of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNA sequences were U-to-C and A-to-G, which were likely mediated by ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) that can change A to I (which is functionally equivalent to G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nishikura, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, ~90% of the A-to-I editing appears to have occurred in Alu elements (belonging to the SINE family), and some of the edits occurred in miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nishikura, 2016</xref>). Since G and U can form the so-called G-U wobble base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Varani and McClain, 2000</xref>), those U-to-C or A-to-G substitutions can, in theory, target similar sequences and exert regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doench and Sharp, 2004</xref>), suggesting that the evolving miRNA sequences could target not only the original sequences but also new sites with similar sequences. Consistent with this notion, the predicted target genes of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family in mice can also be found in rats and humans, suggesting the target genes are shared across species despite the quick divergence of the miRNA sequences across species. This is also supported by our data showing that the binding sites for the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family of miRNAs are more conserved than the surrounding, non-targeting regions in the 3′UTRs of the predicted target mRNAs. Furthermore, seed sequences among some <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs remain the same despite the high divergence of these miRNAs, and these conserved seed sequences appear to be present in the dominant mature miRNAs. Thus, the seed region of these miRNAs appears to have undergone strong selection. Supporting this notion, previous studies have shown correlations between miRNA expression and the evolution of miRNAs and target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meunier et al., 2013</xref>). In general, miRNAs repress their target gene expression. However, numerous studies have also shown that some miRNAs, such as human miR-369–3, Let-7, and miR-373, mouse miR-34/449 and the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, and the synthetic miRNA miRcxcr4, activate gene expression both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vasudevan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Place et al., 2008</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). Earlier reports have shown that these miRNAs can upregulate their target gene expression, either by recruiting <italic>FXR1</italic>, targeting promoters, or sequestering RNA subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vasudevan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Place et al., 2008</xref>). Of interest, miRNAs with the same seed sequences may exert divergent functions. For example, the mature miR-465a, miR-465b, and miR-465c only have a few mismatches outside of the seed region, but only miR-465c exerts functional activation of <italic>Egr1</italic>. A similar effect has also been reported in the miR-465 cluster on the <italic>Alkbh1</italic> 3′UTR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, despite the same seed sequences in the miR-465 or miR-743 cluster, miR-465a and miR-465c have differential activating effects on the 3′UTR of <italic>Crisp1</italic>, and miR-743a and miR-743b exert opposite effects on the <italic>Crisp1</italic> 3′UTR, further confirming their functional divergence. Therefore, the sequences outside of the miRNA seed region may play an important role in their functions, which have also been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broughton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helwak et al., 2013</xref>). To unequivocally demonstrate the physiological role of miRNAs<italic>,</italic> it would be ideal to delete not only the miRNAs but also their binding sites in their target transcripts in vivo. A few previous studies have established the miRNA: target relationship by deleting the miRNA-binding sites in target transcripts in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinzón et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ecsedi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garaulet et al., 2020</xref>), but similar studies have not been reported in mice or humans. The strategy may work in mRNAs with 3′UTRs containing only one or two miRNA-binding sites, but for more complex 3′UTRs of mRNAs in mice and humans that often contain multiple binding sites for the same or different miRNAs, deletion of one miRNA binding site may not cause any discernible effects as the loss of function can easily be compensated by other miRNAs. Nevertheless, by deleting all five highly expressed clusters of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family one by one, we were able to overcome the compensatory effects among the family members/clusters and successfully revealed the physiological role of this miRNA family. Based on small RNA-seq, some <italic>FmiRs</italic>, for example, <italic>miR-201</italic> and <italic>miR-547</italic>, were upregulated in the <italic>SmiRs</italic> KO mice, suggesting that this small cluster may act in concert with the other five clusters and thus, worth further investigation.</p><p>It is well known that mice in the wild are promiscuous, and one female often mates with multiple males sequentially, giving rise to polyandrous litters derived from sperm from more than one sire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Firman and Simmons, 2008</xref>). Polyandrous mating establishes a situation where sperm from multiple males coexist in the female reproductive tract, with the most competitive ones fertilizing eggs and producing offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomendio et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, a male that may be fertile in the monandrous mating scheme may rarely sire offspring in a polyandrous mating scenario, rendering this male functionally ‘sub-fertile’ or vene ‘infertile’. Therefore, sperm competitiveness reflects the general reproductive fitness of the male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomendio et al., 2006</xref>). Although the quinKO males tend to produce smaller litters under the monandrous mating scheme, their sperm counts, sperm motility, and morphology are indistinguishable from those of WT sperm. This is not surprising given that miRNAs of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family most likely function to control certain non-essential aspects of spermatogenesis. Sperm can be subject to competition at multiple steps during fertilization, including their migration through the female reproductive tract (cervix, uterine cavity, and oviduct), binding the cumulus-oocyte complexes, penetration of zona pellucida, etc. Therefore, IVF may not be ideal for evaluating sperm competition in the real world as it bypasses several key sites where sperm competition likely takes place. AI may represent a better way to assess sperm competition than IVF, but it is probably less desirable than polyandrous mating for the following reasons: first, in the wild, sperm from two males rarely, if not never, enter the female reproductive tract simultaneously. We had tried to place two males into the cage with one female, but the two males ended up fighting, and the submissive one never mated. Second, sperm are delivered directly into the uterus or oviduct during AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nagy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stone et al., 2015</xref>), thus bypassing the potential sites for sperm competition (e.g., cervix and uterine cavity). Although our breeding scheme also involves sperm competition, by shortening the time between the two mating events in a laboratory setting, the sequential mating method reported here may be further improved to better mimic the natural polyandrous mating in the future. Moreover, future analyses of the quinKO sperm may help identify biochemical or molecular biomarkers for sperm competitiveness.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs are derived from the MER91C DNA transposon. These miRNAs share many of their targets and can compensate for each other’s absence, and they work jointly through regulating their target genes in spermatogenesis to ensure sperm competitiveness and male reproductive fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and use</title><p>All mice used in this study were on 2- to 3-month-old adult C57BL/6J background (strain # 000664, The Jackson Laboratory, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>) and housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled, specific pathogen-free facility under a light-dark cycle (12:12 light-dark) with food and water ad libitum.

After washing in 1× PBS twice (5 min/wash), the slides were blocked with 1× blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS) at room temperature for 1 hr, then incubated with the anti-CRISP-1 antibody (Cat# AF4675-SP, R&amp;D Systems, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2687670">AB_2687670</ext-link>, 1:100 in 1× blocking solution) at 4°C overnight. After primary antibody incubation, the slides were washed in 1× PBS three times (10 min/wash), followed by incubation in the donkey anti-goat IgG H&amp;L (HRP) (Cat# ab97110, Abcam, 1:250 in 1× blocking solution) at room temperature for 1 hr, and three times washes in 1× PBS (10 min/wash). Tyramide signal amplification was performed and stopped using reagents from Invitrogen Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide SuperBoost Kit (Cat# B40941, Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by mounting and counterstaining in Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Cat# H-1800, Vector Lab). Nail polish was applied on the edge of the coverslips after 2 hr of mounting to prevent further evaporation and stored at 4°C before taking images. Images were taken using the Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 Confocal microscope with the NIS-Elements Software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Western blot</title><p>Testes from adult WT and KO mice were collected and sonicated in 2× Laemmli buffer (Cat# 1610737, Bio-Rad) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol (Cat# M6250, Sigma-Aldrich) and cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Cat# 11836170001, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by incubating at 100°C for 10 min. The proteins were separated on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Cat# 4561094, Bio-Rad) and then transferred onto Amersham Protran Premium Western blotting membranes, nitrocellulose (Cat# GE10600003, Sigma-Aldrich). The membranes were then stained with Ponceau S solution (Cat# P7170, Sigma-Aldrich) to check the samples' loading. After taking pictures, the membrane was destained with 0.1 M NaOH, and washed with water and TBS. Then the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST (TBS containing 0.1% [v/v] Tween-20) for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated with the anti-CRISP-1 antibody (Cat# AF4675-SP, R&amp;D Systems, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2687670">AB_2687670</ext-link>, 1:2000 in TBST containing 5% skim milk) and anti-GAPDH antibody (Cat# G9545, Sigma, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_796208">AB_796208</ext-link>, 1:6000 in TBST) overnight at 4°C. After washing with TBST three times, the membrane was incubated with the donkey anti-goat IgG H&amp;L (HRP) (Cat# ab97110, Abcam) or goat anti-rabbit IgG H&amp;L (HRP) (Cat# ab6721, Abcam) at room temperature for 1 hr. Followed by three washes with TBST, the bands were detected using the WesternBright ECL kit (Cat# K-12045-D20, Advansta).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay</title><p>The potential off-target sites that may be induced by CRISPR-Cas9 were predicted using Alt-R Custom Cas9 crRNA Design Tool (IDT) and assessed by T7 endonuclease I (Cat# M0302L, NEB) assay. The sequences were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser, and the primers flanking the off-target sites were designed to cover ~600 bp. Genomic DNA from WT C57BL/6J or quinKO was amplified using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (Cat# M0494L, NEB) or PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Cat# R010B, Takara) with the designed off-target primers. 2 μl of the unpurified PCR product was diluted in 1× NEBuffer 2 in a 9.5 μl volume and denatured at 95°C for 5 min, followed by annealing at 95–85°C at a –2°C/s rate, and 85–25°C at a –0.1 °C/s rate. Then 0.5 μl of T7EI was added to the 9.5 μl denatured PCR products and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The T7EI-treated PCR products were run on 1× TBE gel and stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain (Cat# S11494, Thermo Fisher Scientific) to detect the off-target effects.

One hundred species were analyzed. PhastCons considers the flanking sequences and does not rely on fixed sliding windows; consequently, both highly conserved short sequences and moderately conserved long sequences can yield higher scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>). PhastCons gives a value between 0–1, the higher the value is, the more conserved the region is. By contrast, PhyloP compares the conservation of individual nucleotides among all phylogeny clades, giving positive scores once the region is conserved and vice versa. PhyloP and PhastCons scores of all miRNAs, <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, <italic>FMR1</italic> CDS, <italic>SLITRK2</italic> CDS, and the intergenic region (IGR) were retrieved from the UCSC genome browser and quantified. Kruskal–Wallis test was used for statistical analysis, and adjusted p&lt;0.05 was identified as statistically significant. PhyloP scheme was used to measure the evolutionary conservation level at individual nucleotide sites in the 3′UTRs of the target genes. Positive PhyloP scores suggest higher conservation and stronger purifying selection, whereas negative PhyloP scores indicate accelerated evolution and potential adaptive selection. The genomic annotations and mRNA sequences were based on the hg38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Casper et al., 2018</xref>) ('TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene' and 'BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38') and mm10 ('TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene' and 'BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10') assemblies for human and mouse, respectively. The PhyloP scores were mapped to individual nucleotides in 3′UTRs based on the transcript coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Unique materials generated in this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± SEM, and statistical differences between datasets were assessed by two-samples <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>F</italic>-test, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test as the post hoc test following one-way ANOVA, chi-squared test, or Kruskal–Wallis test as described in the text or figure legends.

They showed that the miR-506 family underwent rapid evolution. They provided evidence that miR-506 appeared to have originated from the MER91C DNA transposons. Human MER91C transposon produced mature miRNAs when expressed in cultured cells. A series of mouse mutants lacking individual clusters, a combination of clusters, and the entire X-linked cluster (all 22 miRNAs) were generated and characterized. The mutant mice lacking four or more miRNA clusters showed reduced reproductive fitness (litter size reduction). They further showed that the sperm from these mutants were less competitive in polyandrous mating tests. RNA-seq revealed the impact of deletion of miR-506 on the testicular transcriptome. Bioinformatic analysis analyzed the relationship among miR-506 binding, transcriptomic changes, and target sequence conservation. The miR-506-deficient mice did not have apparent effect on sperm production, motility, and morphology. Lack of severe phenotypes is typical for miRNA mutants in other species as well. However, the miR-506-deficient males did exhibit reduced litter size, such an effect would have been quite significant in an evolutionary time scale. The number of mouse mutants and sequencing analysis represent a tour de force.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is a comprehensive investigation of the X-linked miR-506 miRNA family. It provides important insights into the evolution and function of the miR-506 family.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90203.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors conducted a comprehensive study of the X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs in mice on its origin, evolution, expression, and function. They demonstrate that the X-linked miR-506 family, predominantly expressed in the testis, may be derived from MER91C DNA transposons and further expanded by retrotransposition. By genetic deletion of different combinations of 5 major clusters of this miRNA family in mice, they found these miRNAs are not required for spermatogenesis. However, by further examination, the mutant mice show mild fertility problem and inferior sperm competitiveness. The authors conclude that the X-linked miR-506 miRNAs finetune spermatogenesis to enhance sperm competition.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a comprehensive study with extensive computational and genetic dissection of the X-linked miR-506 family providing a holistic view of its evolution and function in mice. The finding that this family miRNAs could enhance sperm competition is interesting and could explain their roles in finetuning germ cell gene expression to regulate reproductive

(Public Review):</bold></p><p>Wang et al investigated the evolution, expression, and function of the X-linked miR-506 miRNA family. They showed that the miR-506 family underwent rapid evolution. They provided evidence that miR-506 appeared to have originated from the MER91C DNA transposons. Human MER91C transposon produced mature miRNAs when expressed in cultured cells. A series of mouse mutants lacking individual clusters, a combination of clusters, and the entire X-linked cluster (all 22 miRNAs) were generated and characterized. The mutant mice lacking four or more miRNA clusters showed reduced reproductive fitness (litter size reduction). They further showed that the sperm from these mutants were less competitive in polyandrous mating tests. RNA-seq revealed the impact of deletion of miR-506 on the testicular transcriptome. Bioinformatic analysis analyzed the relationship among miR-506 binding, transcriptomic changes, and target sequence conservation. The miR-506-deficient mice did not have apparent effect on sperm production, motility, and morphology. Lack of severe phenotypes is typical for miRNA mutants in other species as well. However, the miR-506-deficient males did exhibit reduced litter size, such an effect would have been quite significant in an evolutionary time scale. The number of mouse mutants and sequencing analysis represent a tour de force. This study is a comprehensive investigation of the X-linked miR-506 miRNA family. It provides important insights into the evolution and function of the miR-506 family.</p><p>The conclusions of this preprint are mostly supported by the data except being noted below. Some descriptions need to be revised for accuracy.</p><p>L219-L285: The conclusion that X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs are expanded via LINE1 retrotransposition is not supported by the data. LINE1s and SINEs are very abundant, accounting for nearly 30% of the genome. In addition, the LINE1 content of the mammalian X chromosome is twice that of the autosomes. One can easily find flanking LINE1/SINE repeat. Therefore, the analyses in Fig. 2G, Fig. 2H and Fig. S3 are not informative. In order to claim LINE1-mediated retrotransposition, it is necessary to show the hallmarks of LINE1 retrotransposition, which are only possible for new insertions. The X chromosome is known to be enriched for testis-specific multi-copy genes that are expressed in round spermatids (PMID: 18454149). The conclusion on the LINE1-mediated expansion of miR-506 family on the X chromosome is not supported by the data and does not add additional insights. I think that the LINE1 related figure panels and description (L219-L285) need to be deleted. In discussion (L557558), &quot;...and subsequently underwent sequence divergence via LINE1-mediated retrotransposition during evolution&quot; should also be deleted. This section (L219-L285) needs to deal only with the origin of miR506 from MER91C DNA transposons, which is both convincing and informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed, the corresponding sentences were deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 3A: can you speculate/discuss why the miR-506 expression in sperm is higher than in round spermatids?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: RNAs are much less abundant in sperm than in somatic or spermatogenic cells (~1/100). Spermborne small RNAs represent a small fraction of total small RNAs expressed in their precursor spermatogenic cells, including spermatocytes and spermatids. Therefore, when the same amount of total/small RNAs are used for quantitative analyses, sperm-borne small RNAs (e.g., <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs) would be proportionally enriched in sperm compared to other spermatogenic cells. We discussed this point in the text (Lines 550-556).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>**Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</p><p>In this paper, Wang and collaborators characterize the rapid evolution of the X-linked miR-506 cluster in mammals and characterize the functional reference of depleting a few or most of the miRNAs in the cluster. The authors show that the cluster originated from the MER91C DNA transposon and provide some evidence that it might have expanded through the retrotransposition of adjacent LINE1s. Although the animals depleted of most miRNAs in the cluster show normal sperm parameters, the authors observed a small but significant reduction in litter size. The authors then speculate that the depletion of most miRNAs in the cluster could impair sperm competitiveness in polyandrous mating. Using a successive mating protocol, they show that, indeed, sperm lacking most X-linked miR-506 family members is outcompeted by wild-type sperm. The authors then analyze the evolution of the miR-506 cluster and its predicted targets. They conclude that the main difference between mice and humans is the expansion of the number of target sites per transcript in humans.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are, in most cases, supported by the data; however, a more precise and indepth analysis would have helped build a more convincing argument in most cases.</p><p>(1) In the abstracts and throughout the manuscript, the authors claim that &quot;... these X-linked miRNA-506 family miRNA [...] have gained more targets [...] &quot; while comparing the human miRNA-506 family to the mouse. An alternative possibility is that the mouse has lost some targets. A proper analysis would entail determining the number of targets in the mouse and human common ancestor.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: This question alerted us that we did not describe our conclusion accurately, causing confusion for this reviewer. Our data suggest that although the sheer number of target genes remains the same between humans and mice, the human X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family targets a greater number of genes than the murine counterpart on a per miRNA basis. In other words, mice never lost any targets compared to humans, but per the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNA tends to target more genes in humans than in mice.</p><p>We revised the text to more accurately report our data. The pertaining text (lines 490-508) now reads: “Furthermore, we analyzed the number of all potential targets of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs predicted by the aforementioned four algorithms among humans, mice, and rats. The total number of targets for all the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs among different species did not show significant enrichment in humans (Figure 6-figure supplement 1 C), suggesting the sheer number of target genes does not increase in humans. We then compared the number of target genes per miRNA. When comparing the number of target genes per miRNA for all the miRNAs (baseline) between humans and mice, we found that on a per miRNA basis, human miRNAs have more targets than murine miRNAs (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D), consistent with higher biological complexity in humans. This became even more obvious for the X-linked miR-506 family (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Figure 6-figure supplement 1 D). In humans, the X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, on a per miRNA basis, targets a significantly greater number of genes than the average of all miRNAs combined (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Figure 6-figure supplement 1 D). In contrast, in mice, we observed no significant difference in the number of targets per miRNA between X-linked miRNAs and all of the mouse miRNAs combined (mouse baseline) (Figure 6-figure supplement 1 D). These results suggest that although the sheer number of target genes remains the same between humans and mice, the human X-linked <italic>MIR-506</italic> family targets a greater number of genes than the murine counterpart on a per miRNA basis.”</p><p>We also changed “have gained” to “have” throughout the text to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors claim that the miRNA cluster expanded through L1 retrotransposition. However, the possibility of an early expansion of the cluster before the divergence of the species while the MER91C DNA transposon was active was not evaluated. Although L1 likely contributed to the diversity within mammals, the generalization may not apply to all species. For example, SINEs are closer on average than L1s to the miRNAs in the SmiR subcluster in humans and dogs, and the horse SmiR subcluster seems to have expanded by a TE-independent mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. We deleted the data mentioned by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some results are difficult to reconcile and would have benefited from further discussion. The miR-465 sKO has over two thousand differentially expressed transcripts and no apparent phenotype. Also, the authors show a sharp downregulation of CRISP1 at the RNA and protein level in the mouse. However, most miRNAs of the cluster increase the expression of Crisp1 on a reporter assay. The only one with a negative impact has a very mild effect. miRNAs are typically associated with target repression; however, most of the miRNAs analyzed in this study activate transcript expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Both mRNA and protein levels of Crisp1 were downregulated in KO mice, and these results are consistent with the luciferase data showing overexpression of these miRNAs upregulated the Crisp1 3′UTR luciferase activity. We agree that miRNAs usually repress target gene expression. However, numerous studies have also shown that some miRNAs, such as human miR-369-3, Let-7, and miR-373, mouse miR-34/449 and the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, and the synthetic miRNA miRcxcr4, activate gene expression both in vitro (1, 2) and in vivo (3-6). Earlier reports have shown that these miRNAs can upregulate their target gene expression, either by recruiting FXR1, targeting promoters, or sequestering RNA subcellular locations (1, 2, 6). We briefly discussed this in the text (Lines 605-611).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) More information is required to interpret the results of the differential RNA targeting by the murine and human miRNA-506 family. The materials and methods section needs to explain how the authors select their putative targets. In the text, they mention the use of four different prediction programs. Are they considering all sites predicted by any method, all sites predicted simultaneously by all methods, or something in between? Also, what are they considering as a &quot;shared target&quot; between mice and humans? Is it a mRNA that any miR-506 family member is targeting? Is it a mRNA targeted by the same miRNA in both species? Does the targeting need to occur in the same position determined by aligning the different 3'UTRs?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Since each prediction method has its merit, we included all putative targets predicted by any of the four methods. The &quot;shared target&quot; refers to a mRNA that any <italic>MIR-506</italic> family member targets because the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family is highly divergent among different species. We have added the information to the “Large and small RNA-seq data analysis” section in Materials and Methods (Lines 871-882).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors highlight the particular evolution of the cluster derived from a transposable element. Given the tendency of transposable elements to be expressed in germ cells, the family might have originated to repress the expression of the elements while still active but then remained to control the expression of the genes where the element had been inserted. The authors did not evaluate the expression of transcripts containing the transposable element or discuss this possibility. The authors proposed an expansion of the target sites in humans. However, whether this expansion was associated with the expansion of the TE in humans was not discussed either. Clarifying whether the transposable element was still active after the divergence of the mouse and human lineages would have been informative to address this outstanding issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. The MER91C DNA transposon is denoted as nonautonomous (7); however, whether it was active during the divergence of mouse and human lineages is unknown. To determine whether the expansion of the target sites in humans was due to the expansion of the MER91C DNA transposon, we analyzed the MER91C DNA transposon-containing transcripts and associated them with our DETs. Of interest, 28 human and 3 mouse mRNAs possess 3′UTRs containing MER91C DNA sequences, and only3 and 0 out of those 28 and 3 genes belonged to DETs in humans and mice, respectively (Figure 6-figure supplement 1 E), suggesting a minimal effect of MER91C DNA transposon expansion on the number of target sites. We briefly discussed this in the text (Lines 511-518).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Post-transcriptional regulation is exceptionally complex in male haploid cells, and the functional relevance of many regulatory pathways remains unclear. This manuscript, together with recent findings on the role of piRNA clusters, starts to clarify the nature of the selective pressure that shapes the evolution of small RNA pathways in the male germ line.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. We appreciate your insightful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors conducted a comprehensive study of the X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs in mice on its origin, evolution, expression, and function. They demonstrate that the X-linked miR-506 family, predominantly expressed in the testis, may be derived from MER91C DNA transposons and further expanded by retrotransposition. By genetic deletion of different combinations of 5 major clusters of this miRNA family in mice, they found these miRNAs are not required for spermatogenesis. However, by further examination, the mutant mice show mild fertility problem and inferior sperm competitiveness. The authors conclude that the X-linked miR-506 miRNAs finetune spermatogenesis to enhance sperm competition.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a comprehensive study with extensive computational and genetic dissection of the X-linked miR506 family providing a holistic view of its evolution and function in mice. The finding that this family miRNAs could enhance sperm competition is interesting and could explain their roles in finetuning germ cell gene expression to regulate reproductive fitness.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors specifically addressed the function of 5 clusters of X-link miR-506 family containing 19 miRNAs. There is another small cluster containing 3 miRNAs close to the Fmr1 locus. Would this small cluster act in concert with the 5 clusters to regulate spermatogenesis? In addition, any autosomal miR-506 like miRNAs may compensate for the loss of X-linked miR-506 family. These possibilities should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: The three FmiRs were not deleted in this study because the SmiRs are much more abundant than the FmiRs in WT mice (Author Response image 1, heatmap version of Figure 5C). Based on small RNA-seq, some FmiRs, e.g., miR-201 and miR-547, were upregulated in the SmiRs KO mice, suggesting that this small cluster may act in concert with the other 5 clusters and thus, worth further investigation. To our best knowledge, all the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family miRNAs are located on the X chromosome, although some other miRNAs were upregulated in the KO mice, they don’t belong to the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family. We briefly discussed this point in the text (Lines 635-638).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>sRNA-seq of WT and <italic>MIR-506</italic> family KO testis samples.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90203-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Direct molecular link to sperm competitiveness defect remains unclear but is difficult to address.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: In this study, we identified a target of the <italic>MIR-506</italic> family, i.e. Crisp1. KO of Crisp1 in mice, or inhibition of CRISP1 in human sperm (7, 8), appears to phenocopy the quinKO mice, displaying largely normal sperm motility but compromised ability to penetrate eggs. The detailed mechanism warrants further investigation in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Lines 84-85: &quot;Several cellular events are unique to the male germ cells, e.g., meiosis, genetic recombination, and haploid male germ cell differentiation (also called spermiogenesis)&quot;. This statement is not accurate. Please revise. Meiosis and genetic recombination are common to both male and female germ cells. They are highly conserved in both sexes in many species including mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. We have revised the sentence and it now reads: “Several cellular events are unique to the male germ cells, e.g., postnatal formation of the adult male germline stem cells (i.e., spermatogonia stem cells), pubertal onset of meiosis, and haploid male germ cell differentiation (also called spermiogenesis) (9)” (Lines 83-86).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 163-164: &quot;we found that Slitrk2 and Fmr1 were syntenically linked to autosomes in zebrafish and birds (Fig. 1A), but had migrated onto the X chromosome in most mammals&quot;. This description is not accurate. Chr 4 in zebrafish and birds is syntenic to the X chromosome in mammals. The term &quot;migrated&quot; is not appropriate. Suggestion: Slitrk2 and Fmr1 mapped to Chr 4 (syntenic with mammalian X chromosome) in zebrafish and birds but to the X chromosome in most mammals.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. Revised as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In the significance statement, the authors mention that the mutants are &quot;functionally infertile,&quot; although the decrease in competitiveness is partial. I suggest referring to them as &quot;functionally sub-fertile.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. Revised as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I will urge the authors to explain in more detail how some figures are generated and what they mean. Some critical information needs to be included in various panels.</p><p>(2a) Figure S1. The phastCons track does not seem to align as expected with the rest of the figure. The highest conservation peak is only present in humans, and the sequence conserved in the sea turtle has the lowest phastCons score. I was expecting the opposite from the explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: The tracks for phyloP and phastCons are the scores for all 100 species, whereas the tracks with the species names on the left are the corresponding sequences aligned to the human genome. We have revised our figure to make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2b) Figure 2A and Figure S2C. Although all the functional analysis of the manuscript has been done in mice, the alignments showing sequence conservation do not include the murine miRNAs. Please include the mouse miRNAs in these panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: The mouse has Mir-506-P7 with the conserved miRNA-3P seed region, which was included in the lower panel in Figure 1-figure supplement 2 C. However, mice do not have Mir-506-P6, which may have been lost or too divergent to be recognized during the evolution and thus, were not included in Figure 2A and the upper panel in Figure 1-figure supplement 2 C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2c) Figure S7H. The panel could be easier to read.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed. We combined all the same groups and turned Figure S7H (now Figure 3-figure supplement 1 H) into a heatmap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2d) The legend of Figure 6G reads, &quot;The number of target sites within individual target mRNAs in both humans and mice .&quot; Can the author explain why the value 1 of the human &quot;Number of target sites&quot; is connected to virtually all the &quot;Number of target sites&quot; values in mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Sorry for the confusion. For example, for gene 1, we have 1 target site in the human and 1 target site in the mouse; but for gene 2, we have 1 target site in the human and multiple sites in the mouse; therefore, the value 1 is connected to more than one value in the mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>CRISP1 and EGR1 protein localization in WT and mutant sperm by immunostaining would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: Agreed.

CRISP1 seems mainly expressed in the principal piece and head of sperm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The detailed description of the generation of various mutant lines should be included in the Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Reply: We added more details on the generation of knockout lines in the Materials and Methods (686-701).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) S.
