during sleep deprivation and at times of the day when animals are predominantly awake spontaneously, suggesting that the circadian sleep-wake distribution directly contributes to the daily rhythms in <italic>Per2</italic>. We found support for this hypothesis by recording sleep-wake state alongside PER2 bioluminescence in freely behaving mice, demonstrating that PER2 bioluminescence increases during spontaneous waking and decreases during sleep. The temporary reinstatement of PER2-bioluminescence rhythmicity in behaviorally arrhythmic SCN-lesioned mice submitted to daily recurring sleep deprivations substantiates our hypothesis. Mathematical modeling revealed that PER2 dynamics can be described by a damped harmonic oscillator driven by two forces: a sleep-wake-dependent force and an SCN-independent circadian force. Our work underscores the notion that in peripheral tissues the clock gene circuitry integrates sleep-wake information and could thereby contribute to behavioral adaptability to respond to homeostatic requirements.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Circadian rhythms are daily cycles in behavior and physiology which repeat approximately every 24 hours. The master regulator of these rhythms is located in a small part of the brain called the supra-chiasmatic nucleus. This brain structure regulates the timing of sleep and wakefulness and is also thought to control the daily rhythms of cells throughout the body on a molecular level. It does this by synchronizing the activity of a set of genes called clock genes.</p><p>Under normal conditions, the levels of proteins coded for by clock genes change throughout the day following a rhythm that matches sleep-wake patterns. However, keeping animals and humans awake at their preferred sleeping times affects the protein levels of clock genes in many tissues of the body. This suggests that, in addition to the supra-chiasmatic nucleus, sleep-wake cycles may also influence clock-gene rhythms throughout the body.</p><p>To test this theory, Hoekstra, Jan et al. measured the levels of PERIOD-2, a protein coded for by the clock gene <italic>Period-2</italic>, while tracking sleep-wake states in mice. They did this by imaging a bioluminescent version of the PERIOD-2 protein in the brain and the kidneys, at the same time as they recorded the brain activity, movement and muscle response of animals. Results showed that PERIOD-2 increased on waking and decreased when mice fell asleep. Additionally, in mice lacking a circadian rhythm in sleep-wake behavior – whose changes in PERIOD-2 levels with respect to time were greatly reduced – imposing a regular sleep-wake cycle restored normal PERIOD-2 rhythmicity.</p><p>Next, Hoekstra, Jan et al<italic>.</italic> developed a mathematical model to understand how sleep-wake cycles together with circadian rhythms affect clock-gene activity in the brain and kidneys. Computer simulations suggested that sleep-wake cycles and circadian factors act as forces of comparable strength driving clock-gene dynamics. Both need to act in concert to keep clock-genes rhythmic. The model also predicted the large and immediate effects of sleep deprivation on PERIOD-2 levels<italic>,</italic> giving further credence to the idea that waking accelerated clock-gene rhythms while sleeping slowed them down. Modelling also suggested that having regular clock-gene rhythms protects against sleep disturbances.</p><p>In summary, this work shows how sleep patterns contribute to the daily rhythms in clock genes in the brain and body. The findings support the idea that well-timed sleep-wake schedules could help people to adjust to new time zones. It might also be useful to inform other strategies to reduce the health impacts of shift work.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>period-2</kwd><kwd>kidney</kwd><kwd>cortex</kwd><kwd>waking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>146694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Marieke MB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>179190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katsioudi</surname><given-names>Georgia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of Vaud</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Marieke MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name><name><surname>Emmenegger</surname><given-names>Yann</given-names></name><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sleep-wake patterns, together with a suprachiasmatic nuclei-independent circadian factor, are necessary and sufficient to maintain high-amplitude nychthemeral rhythms in PERIOD-2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The sleep-wake distribution is coordinated by the interaction of a circadian and a homeostatic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daan et al., 1984</xref>). The biological substrates underlying the circadian process are relatively well understood: circadian rhythms in overt behavior of mammals are generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) located in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>). At the molecular level, so-called ‘clock genes’ interact through negative transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs), where the CLOCK/NPAS2:ARNTL (BMAL1) heterodimers drive the transcription of their target genes, among them the <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1,2</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1,2</italic>) genes. Subsequently, PER and CRY proteins assemble into repressor complexes that inhibit CLOCK/NPAS2:ARNTL-mediated transcription, including their own. The resulting reduction of the repressor complex allows a new cycle to start. This feedback loop, present in almost each cell of the mammalian body, interacts with other molecular pathways, together ensuring a period of ~24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>). The SCN synchronizes peripheral clock gene expression rhythms through its rhythmic behavioral, electrical, and humoral output generated across the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schibler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that, perhaps surprisingly, clock genes are also involved in the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Franken, 2013</xref>). This is illustrated by the sleep deprivation (SD)-induced increase in the expression of the clock gene <italic>Per2</italic> in tissues peripheral to the SCN, including the cerebral cortex, liver, and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franken et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maret et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the highest level of peripheral <italic>Per2</italic> expression is reached after the time of day mice were awake most, suggesting that also during spontaneous periods of waking <italic>Per2</italic> expression accumulates. Accordingly, lesioning of the SCN, which eliminates the circadian sleep-wake distribution, attenuates the circadian amplitude of clock gene transcripts and proteins in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinturel et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that sleeping and waking are important contributors to clock gene expression, but dissecting the contribution of the sleep-wake distribution and circadian time is challenging because the two change in parallel.</p><p>By simultaneously recording electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), locomotor activity (LMA), and PER2-dependent bioluminescence signals from cortex and kidney in freely behaving mice, we established that the circadian sleep-wake distribution importantly contributes to the daily rhythmic changes in central and peripheral PER2 levels. To further test this hypothesis, we predicted that (i) in behaviorally arrhythmic SCN-lesioned (SCNx) mice, daily recurring SDs mimicking a circadian sleep-wake distribution will temporarily reinstate high-amplitude PER2 bioluminescence rhythms, and (ii) in intact rhythmic animals, reducing the amplitude of the circadian sleep-wake distribution will result in a reduced amplitude of PER2 rhythms. While daily SDs indeed enhanced the amplitude of peripheral PER2 rhythms in SCNx mice, the protocol used to reduce the amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution did not reduce PER2 amplitude in all mice. To reconcile the sleep-wake-driven and circadian aspects of PER2 dynamics, we implemented a mathematical model in which waking represents a force that sets in motion a harmonic oscillator describing PER2 dynamics and found that the sleep-wake distribution, also under undisturbed conditions, is an important contributor to the daily changes in PER2 bioluminescence. Moreover, we discovered a second, SCN and sleep-wake independent force with a circadian period that underlay the residual circadian PER2 rhythms in SCNx mice, and that the phase relationship between these two forces is important for predicting the amplitude response in PER2 rhythms to sleep-wake perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To quantify PER2 levels, we used mice expressing a knock-in (KI) construct encoding a fused PER2::LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) protein and in which changes in emitted bioluminescence can be used as proxy for changes in PER2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI mice have been used to follow clock gene expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Vinne et al., 2018</xref>). However, in these studies, mice had to be anesthetized for each measurement, while in the set-up used in our study (RT-Biolumicorder; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saini et al., 2013</xref>), we assessed PER2 bioluminescence continuously in freely moving mice, in central and peripheral tissues. For the central quantification of bioluminescence, we used mice in which the <italic>Per<sup>Luc</sup></italic> construct was back-crossed onto a C57BL/6J (B6) background (see Materials and methods). For the experiments that quantified bioluminescence in the periphery, we used hairless SKH1 mice carrying the <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI construct because lack of fur allows for the unobstructed measurement of emitted photons (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for experimental design and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> for imaging of bioluminescence in SKH1 mice). Under standard LD12:12 conditions, SKH1 mice exhibited sleep-wake patterns characteristic of mice, that is, during the light phase they spent more time in both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and REM sleep relative to the dark phase, the latter being their habitual active phase. Moreover, they showed the typical sleep homeostatic response to a 6 hr SD during the first 18 hr of recovery, both in sleep time and EEG delta power, although the increase in REM sleep did not reach significance levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In three pilot experiments, we optimized our experimental set-up. We established that the most important source contributing to the peripheral bioluminescence signals in the SKH1 mice are the kidneys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We have previously shown that the central bioluminescence signal obtained in B6 mice is of cortical origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>). To accomplish this, luciferin was infused directly into the brain, the skull locally thinned and equipped with a glass cone, and animals were not shaved, thereby preventing passage of photons from the periphery (see Materials and methods). We confirmed that in B6 mice thus prepared only photons emitted by the brain could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Finally, by using mice expressing luciferase under the control of synthetic CAG promotor (CAG-Luc mice; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2004</xref>), we determined that its substrate luciferin is best delivered through implantable osmotic mini-pumps compared to administration through the drinking water. Under the latter condition, strong daily rhythms in bioluminescence were observed, likely as a result of rhythms in drinking behavior, thereby driving luciferin availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sleep-wake state affects PER2 bioluminescence</title><p>It now has been well documented that enforced wakefulness affects <italic>Per2</italic> mRNA and protein levels in various tissues and mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Franken, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Möller-Levet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vassalli and Franken, 2017</xref>), but it is not known whether circadian rhythms in spontaneous sleep-wake behavior contribute to the daily changes in PER2 levels. To address this question, we equipped <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI B6 and SKH1 mice (n = 6 and 5, respectively) with wireless EEG/EMG recorders (i.e., NeuroLoggers) and monitored simultaneously sleep-wake state, PER2 bioluminescence, and LMA under constant darkness (DD; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Time asleep in mice kept in the RT-Biolumicorder quantified with the NeuroLoggers under DD was similar to that quantified under LD conditions using a tethered EEG acquisition system (48 hr baseline in DD vs. LD in C57BL/6J mice: NREM sleep: 42.2% ± 1.6%, REM sleep 6.1% ± 0.3% of total recording time; n = 6; compared to 41.3 ± 1.1 and 5.2% ± 0.2%, respectively; n = 12, data taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diessler et al., 2018</xref>). Sleep and EEG have not been recorded in SKH1 mice previously. Also in these mice, similar sleep durations were obtained under the two conditions (48 hr baseline in DD vs. LD: NREM sleep: 40.4% ± 2.1%, REM sleep 5.8% ± 0.9%; n = 5; compared to 40.0% ± 1.0% and 6.9% ± 0.2%, respectively; n = 8; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, we reproduced the circadian changes in PER2 bioluminescence as well as the response to a 6 hr SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>) in both peripheral bioluminescence, mainly of renal origin, and central bioluminescence, emitted by the cortex (see Materials and methods for explanation of the SD procedure). Similar to what was observed in that publication, SD elicited a tissue-specific response, with an immediate increase in central PER2 bioluminescence after SD, while in the periphery the response was delayed and PER2-bioluminescence increases were observed in the second and fifth hour of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to these direct effects on PER2 bioluminescence within the first 6 hr of recovery, the SD also caused a long-term reduction of rhythm amplitude during both recovery days; that is, the first (REC1) and last (REC2) 24 hr period of recovery. In the periphery, this decrease amounted to ca. 30% on both days (REC1: 17.5–41.1%; REC2: 18.7–42.4%, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]). In the central recordings, PER2-bioluminescence amplitude decreased significantly during REC1 (32% [10.2–54.5%]), whereas the decrease during REC2 (22% [0.06–44.8%]) no longer reached significance levels (linear mixed model with fixed conditional effect [‘BSL,’ ‘REC1,’ ‘REC2’] and random intercept effect [‘Mouse’]; periphery: BSL vs. REC1 p=0.0014; vs. REC2 p=0.0011; central: BSL vs. REC1 p=0.022; vs. REC2 p=0.082; sinewave-fitted baseline amplitudes: periphery 0.258 [0.15–0.36]; central 0.193 [0.08–0.31 a.u.]). This long-term reduction of PER2-biolumnescence is reminiscent of the long-term SD effects on rhythm amplitude we observed for <italic>Per2</italic> expression and for other clock genes in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The sleep-wake distribution contributes to changes in PER2 bioluminescence.</title><p>Red, peripheral (kidney) bioluminescence; purple, central (cortical) bioluminescence.

To quantify this observation, transitions from sleep (irrespective of sleep state) to wake and from wake to sleep were selected (see Materials and methods for selection criteria). Examples of the selected transitions are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> as a hypnogram. A similar number of sleep-to-wake and wake-to-sleep transitions passed selection criteria during the two-and-a-half baseline days (periphery: 31.2 ± 3.9 and 29.0 ± 3.9; central: 25.6 ± 1.4 and 24.6 ± 1.4, respectively; mean ± SEM). Transitions obtained in mice in which central bioluminescence was recorded were shorter (longest common wake period after sleep-to-wake transitions: 39 vs. 57 min; longest common sleep period after wake-to-sleep transitions: 63 vs. 75 min, for central and periphery, respectively). Although PER2 bioluminescence increased during wakefulness and decreased during sleep in both tissues, tissue-specific differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At sleep-to-wake transitions, tissue differences concerned an initial decrease in peripheral PER2 bioluminescence after wake onset, followed by a steep increase saturating at 125%. In contrast, central levels of PER2 bioluminescence increased from the start and followed a linear time course throughout the waking period. Despite these different dynamics, similar bioluminescence levels were reached in both tissues. After wake-to-sleep transitions, peripheral PER2 bioluminescence initially increased before quickly decreasing and then leveling out at around 84% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the central signal decreased linearly throughout the sleep period reaching levels of 91% at the end.</p><p>Changes in sleep-wake state are accompanied by physiological alterations, such as changes in body and brain temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sela et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vishwakarma et al., 2021</xref>), which could influence bioluminescence by changing substrate levels and/or the rate of the enzymatic reaction. Although the circadian rhythms of subcutaneous temperature and PER2 bioluminescence are ca. 4 hr out of phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), this does not exclude the possibility that fast changes in physiology associated with sleep-wake transitions contribute to luciferin availability. Therefore, we assessed sleep-wake-related changes in mice carrying two other luciferase reporter constructs. Besides the CAG-Luc mice we used to decide on the route of luciferin administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we also had access to <italic>Pkg1-Luc</italic> mice in which bioluminescence is under the control of the promotor of the housekeeping gene <italic>Pkg1</italic> (see Materials and methods). As expected from a housekeeping gene, bioluminescence in <italic>Pkg1-Luc</italic> mice was relatively constant and did not increase at sleep-wake transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast, in CAG-Luc mice increases at transitions were larger than in <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> mice, consistent with the rapidly activated CMV-immediate-early enhancer contained within the CAG synthetic promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brightwell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collaco and Geusz, 2003</xref>). These results show that the bioluminescence changes at sleep-wake transitions are specific to the luciferase reporter construct and therefore not an artifact of sleep-wake-related changes in physiology.</p><p>Taken together, three observations indicate that the sleep-wake distribution importantly contributes to both central and peripheral PER2-bioluminescence dynamics: (1) enforced wakefulness has both acute and long-term effects on PER2 bioluminescence; (2) the changes in PER2 bioluminescence at sleep-wake transitions demonstrate that also spontaneous waking is associated with an increase, and sleep with a decrease, in PER2 bioluminescence; and (3) that PER2 bioluminescence is high when mice are spontaneously awake more.</p><p>The central PER bioluminescence signals tended to be noisier than peripheral signals (signal-to-noise ratio: –1.15 ± 1.0 and 0.37 ± 1.0 dB, respectively; estimated on 3 min values in baseline of the 6 hr SD experiments according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leise et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the peripheral signal was easier to obtain and minimally invasive to the animal. We therefore decided for the next experiments to focus on peripheral PER2 bioluminescence using the <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> SKH1 mice. Because waking correlates highly with LMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), we recorded LMA as proxy for wakefulness to avoid invasive EEG/EMG surgery and mice having to adapt to a ca. 2.7 g recorder mounted on the head.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modulating the amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution and its influence on PER2 bioluminescence</title><p>The SCN is the main driver of the circadian sleep-wake distribution because animals in which the SCN is lesioned (SCNx) lack a circadian organization of sleep-wake behavior under constant conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edgar et al., 1993</xref>). Under these conditions, the amplitude of clock gene expression in peripheral organs is significantly reduced, but not eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tahara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinturel et al., 2021</xref>). Given our results in freely behaving mice, we expect that imposing a rhythmic sleep-wake distribution in SCNx mice will reinstate high-amplitude rhythmicity in PER2 bioluminescence. Conversely, reducing the amplitude of the circadian sleep-wake distribution in SCN-intact mice is expected to reduce the amplitude of PER2 bioluminescence. We tested these predictions in two complementary experiments (see experimental design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the first experiment, we enforced a daily sleep-wake rhythm in arrhythmic SCNx mice by sleep depriving them for 4 hr at 24 hr intervals during four subsequent days. In the second experiment, we aimed to acutely reduce the circadian distribution of sleeping and waking in intact mice according to a ‘2hOnOff’ protocol, comprising 12 2-h SDs each followed by a 2 h sleep opportunity ‘window’ (SOW), previously utilized in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yasenkov and Deboer, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Repeated sleep deprivations in SCNx mice temporarily reinstate a circadian rhythm in PER2 bioluminescence</title><p>Lesioning the SCN rendered LMA arrhythmic under DD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In arrhythmic SCNx mice, we confirmed that rhythms in PER2 bioluminescence were strongly reduced, but not completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). During the second baseline measurement after SCNx (BSL2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we observed in two of the four mice erratic high values (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) that we cannot readily explain especially because in the subsequent four SD days the variance in the PER2 bioluminescence signal among mice was again as small as in the earlier recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A vs. B</xref>). The erratic values in these two mice led to a &gt;10-fold increase in the residual sum of squares (RSS), indicating a poorer fit, and to a higher amplitude of the fitted sinewaves in the second compared to the first baseline recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, BSL1 vs. BSL2). The repeated SDs induced a robust oscillation in the PER2-bioluminescence signal, restoring amplitude to the levels observed prior to SCN lesioning and higher than those observed in the baseline recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The latter observation shows that the increased amplitude during the SD did not result from an SD-mediated alignment of different individual phases in baseline.

We measured sleep-wake state and PER2 bioluminescence during baseline conditions, the 2hOnOff procedure, and the two recovery days in two cohorts of mice. In the first cohort, PER2 bioluminescence was monitored, and mice were taken out of the RT-Biolumicorder for the 2 hr SDs. Bioluminescence was therefore quantified only during the SOWs, thus biasing the read-out of PER2 bioluminescence during the 2hOnOff protocol towards levels reached during sleep. A second cohort was implanted with tethered EEG/EMG electrodes to determine the efficacy of the 2hOnOff protocol in reducing the sleep-wake distribution amplitude.</p><p>As expected, mice exhibited a circadian PER2-bioluminescence rhythm under baseline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Contrary to expectation, the 2hOnOff protocol did not significantly decrease the ongoing circadian PER2 oscillation when analyzed at the group level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). When inspecting the individual responses, four out of the six mice did show a consistent 27% reduction (range 23–31%) in PER2-biolumininescence amplitude during the 2-day 2hOnOff protocol, while in the remaining two mice amplitude increased by 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In all six mice, PER2-bioluminescence amplitude reverted to baseline values during recovery, irrespective of whether it was increased or decreased during the 2hOnOff protocol. The distinct bimodal, opposing response in amplitude observed among individual mice and the subsequent reverting back to baseline suggest that the 2hOnOff protocol did affect the ongoing PER2-bioluminescence rhythm. This phenomenon might relate to factors not accounted for in our experimental design. In the modeling section at the end of the Results section, we explore this observation further and find that variation in circadian phase could underlie the individual differential response (for details, see ‘Modeling PER2 dynamics’).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The 2hOnOff protocol reduced the circadian sleep-wake amplitude but did not consistently affect PER2 bioluminescence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example of a PER2-bioluminescence recording under baseline, 2hOnOff, and recovery conditions.

In contrast to bioluminescence, the amplitude of the circadian sleep-wake distribution did decrease consistently in all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). The circadian rhythm in the sleep-wake distribution was, however, not eliminated because the sleep obtained during the 2 hr SDs as well as during the 2 hr SOWs both varied as a function of time of day (sleep during SDs: average: 12.4%, min-max: 4.9–23.0%; during SOWs: average: 54.3%, min-max: 35.7–76.4%). This was especially evident at the beginning of the subjective light phase of day 2 when the average time spent asleep during the SD reached 23%. The sleep obtained during the SDs at this time could be due to a substantial sleep pressure because of lost sleep during day 1 of the 2hOnOff protocol (total time spent asleep/day, mean ± SEM; baseline: 11.1 ± 0.1 hr; 2hOnOff: day 1: 7.3 ± 0.3 hr, day 2: 8.6 ± 0.7 hr, paired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, BSL vs. 2hOnOff-day 1: t(7) = 8.86, p&lt;0.001; BSL vs. 2hOnOff-day 2: t(7) = 4.18, p=0.004; 2hOnOff-day 1 vs. -day 2, t(7) = 1.97, p=0.09), combined with the difficulty for the experimenters to visually detect and prevent sleep in pinkish hairless mice under dim-red light conditions.

To understand how these two factors collectively generate the variance in PER2 bioluminescence, we put our experimental data into a theoretical framework and modeled changes in peripheral PER2 bioluminescence according to a driven harmonic oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curie et al., 2013</xref>). This type of oscillator is not self-sustained but depends on rhythmic forces to set in motion and maintain the oscillation. In the model, we assume the sleep-wake distribution to represent one such force. In the absence of rhythmic forces, the oscillator loses energy, resulting in a gradual reduction of its amplitude according to the rate set by its damping constant (γ). Besides amplitude and timing (i.e., phase) of the recurring forces and the damping constant, the oscillatory system is further defined by a string constant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula>) with the natural angular frequency (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) defining the intrinsic period.

The individual data showed, however, that in four mice this intervention did decrease PER2-bioluminescence amplitude, while in the remaining two amplitude increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). With the model, we addressed the third question: Do circadian phase differences predict the opposite effects of the 2hOnOff intervention on amplitude? Surprisingly, when systematically varying the phase of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> during the baseline prior to the 2hOnOff intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we found that at phase advances larger than 2.5 hr, the model predicted an increase of PER2 amplitude during the subsequent 2hOnOff protocol instead of a decrease (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> for a 6 hr phase advance). Circadian phase differences among animals might relate to individual differences in period length of their free-running rhythms that accumulate over time. We did not find evidence for a difference in PER2 bioluminescence or LMA phase at the end of the baseline recording (2.5 days under DD) between animals that showed a decrease in PER2-bioluminescence amplitude compared to animals that showed an increase. However, during the first day of recovery following the 2hOnOff protocol (5.5 days under DD), we observed a ca. 2 hr phase advance in bioluminescence and 1 hr phase advance in LMA in the two mice that increased their amplitude during the preceding 2hOnOff protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, left) compared to the four mice for which we observed the anticipated decrease in PER2 amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, right). Whether these differences in phase contributed to the opposite response cannot be answered with the current data set. Nevertheless, the model yielded a perhaps counterintuitive but testable hypothesis by demonstrating that phase angle between the sleep-wake distribution and peripheral circadian clock-gene rhythms is an important variable in predicting outcome and emphasizes the importance of carefully controlling the initial conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we assessed the contribution of the sleep-wake distribution to circadian peripheral PER2 rhythmicity. We presented four key findings, supporting the notion that sleep-wake state is indeed an important factor in determining the circadian amplitude of peripheral changes in PER2: (1) spontaneous sustained bouts of waking and sleep were associated with increased and decreased PER2 bioluminescence, respectively; (2) a single SD acutely increased PER2 bioluminescence and during subsequent recovery dampened its circadian amplitude; (3) repeated SDs temporarily reinstated robust rhythmicity in PER2 bioluminescence in behaviorally arrhythmic mice; and (4) mathematical modeling suggests that PER2 dynamics is best understood as a harmonic oscillator driven by two forces: a sleep-waking-dependent force (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) and an SCN-independent and sleep-wake-independent, circadian peripheral force (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf84"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How does wakefulness increase PER2?</title><p><italic>Per2</italic> transcription can be initiated from its cognate E-boxes by CLOCK/NPAS2:ARNTL.

The SD-evoked increase in <italic>Per2</italic> expression could therefore be mediated through other clock genes in the circuitry, as was demonstrated by the differential SD-evoked response in <italic>Per2</italic> levels in mice lacking the core clock genes <italic>Npas2</italic> and both <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>–2</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franken et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wisor et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Apart from a TTFL-mediated activation, <italic>Per2</italic> transcription can be induced by other signaling molecules directly acting on elements within the <italic>Per2</italic> promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schibler et al., 2015</xref>). For example, ligand-bound glucocorticoid receptors can induce <italic>Per2</italic> transcription by binding to their glucocorticoid response elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">So et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), and serum-response factor (SRF) can directly activate <italic>Per2</italic> transcription through CREs, heat-shock elements, and CArG-boxes, respectively, present in the <italic>Per2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tamaru et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Travnickova-Bendova et al., 2002</xref>). Through these pathways, <italic>Per2</italic> responds to stress, light, temperature, blood-borne systemic cues, and cellular activation as an immediate early gene (IEG). Because of this, <italic>Per2</italic> can appear rhythmic even in the absence of a functional TTFL, provided these signaling pathways fluctuate cyclically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kornmann et al., 2007</xref>). In behaviorally arrhythmic SCNx animals, the residual PER2 rhythms we observed might similarly result from SCN-independent corticosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 1968</xref>) or body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Satinoff and Prosser, 1988</xref>) rhythms, or, alternatively, might be TTFL-driven locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinturel et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Important for the current study is that several of the pathways known to directly influence <italic>Per2</italic> expression are activated by either spontaneous and/or enforced waking (e.g., corticosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mongrain et al., 2010</xref>], temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>], <italic>Hsf1</italic> and <italic>Srf</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hor et al., 2019</xref>], pCREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cirelli and Tononi, 2000</xref>]) and are therefore good candidates linking sleep-wake state to changes in PER2. The observed changes in PER2 bioluminescence were rapid and suggest that increases in protein can occur within an hour of spontaneous wakefulness. Other studies document that PER genes can indeed be rapidly transcribed and translated. For instance, a light pulse given at CT14 leads within an hour to a significant increase in <italic>Per2</italic> transcript in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan and Silver, 2002</xref>). One study reported a large increase in hepatic <italic>Per2</italic> transcript levels within 1 hr after food presentation in fasted rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2010</xref>), underscoring the ability of this transcript to rapidly adapt to homeostatic need. <italic>Per2</italic> translation is not solely dependent on de novo transcription and, for example, in the SCN, light was shown to promote <italic>Per2</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that transcription would not be necessary to increase PER2 protein levels. Such mechanism could also underlie the very fast (&lt;30 min) 1.5-fold increase in PER2 protein observed in fibroblasts after serum shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, as the PER2 protein levels measured are the net result of translation and degradation, also sleep-wake-dependent changes in PER2-degradation rate may contribute both to its increase during wakefulness and its decrease during sleep. PER2 degradation is crucial in setting TTFL period and the timing and stability of the circadian sleep-wake distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">D’Alessandro et al., 2017</xref>). One established pathway leading to PER2 degradation involves <italic>Casein kinase 1</italic> (<italic>Csnk1</italic>)-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eide et al., 2005</xref>) followed by the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase <italic>β-transducin repeat-containing proteins</italic> (<italic>Btrc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Masuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ohsaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reischl et al., 2007</xref>). Other kinases, such as <italic>Salt-inducible kinase 3</italic> (<italic>Sik3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayasaka et al., 2017</xref>), and phosphorylation-independent ubiquitin ligases, such as <italic>Transformed mouse 3T3 cell double minute 2</italic> (<italic>Mdm2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2018</xref>, p. 2), also target PER2 for degradation. Using a modeling approach to estimate the role of <italic>Btrc</italic> in circadian period length, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reischl et al., 2007</xref> estimated a linear decay rate of 0.18/hr for PER2 degradation, which is not inconsistent with the approximately 0.10/hr net decay rate we observed for the PER2 bioluminescence during sleep. However, the dynamics of PER2 degradation have been assessed in a circadian context exclusively, and effects of sleep-wake state have not been quantified previously.</p><p>The obvious next step is to determine which pathway(s) contributes to the wake-driven changes in PER2 protein. We already established that the SD-incurred increase in <italic>Per2</italic> in the forebrain partly depended on glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mongrain et al., 2010</xref>). Along those lines, restoration of daily glucocorticoid rhythms in adrenalectomized rats reinstates PER2 rhythms in several extra-SCN brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Segall and Amir, 2010</xref>). To determine the contribution of the aforementioned wake-driven factors, a genetic screen could be deployed where one-by-one the regulatory elements in the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter are mutated, and the effect of sleep-wake driven <italic>Per2</italic> changes is assessed. This approach has already been taken for the GRE and CRE elements in the <italic>Per2</italic> promoter to test their respective roles in circadian phase resetting and integrating light information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">So et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Travnickova-Bendova et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Insights from the model</title><p>The model accurately captured the main features of peripheral PER2 dynamics observed in all three experiments, thereby giving further credence to the notion that sleep-wake state importantly contributes to the changes in PER2 observed in the periphery. Moreover, it demonstrated that the large amplitude of the circadian PER2 rhythm in intact mice is likely the result of the momentum gained in the harmonic oscillator through the daily recurring sleep-wake distribution. This is conceptually different from a currently accepted scenario, in which direct and indirect outputs from the SCN assure phase coherence of locally generated self-sustained circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schibler et al., 2015</xref>). According to this model, loss of amplitude observed at the tissue level in SCNx mice is caused by phase dispersion of the continuing rhythms in individual cells. Among the SCN outputs thought to convey phase coherence are feeding, LMA, and changes in temperature. Because these outputs all require or are associated with the animal being awake, it can be argued that in both models the circadian sleep-wake distribution is key in keeping peripheral organs rhythmic.</p><p>The harmonic oscillator model further showed that, although important, the sleep-wake force alone was not sufficient to predict PER2 dynamics. In addition to account for the residual PER2 rhythms observed in undisturbed SCNx mice, the SCN-independent and sleep-wake-independent circadian force greatly improved the performance of the model.

Despite this general observation, we found clear tissue-specific differences: the 6 hr SD elicited an immediate increase in the central PER2 signal, while in the periphery this increase occurred several hours later, confirming our earlier findings in brain versus liver and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>). Tissue specificity was also observed after spontaneous bouts of wakefulness: in the brain, PER2 bioluminescence immediately increased after the animal woke up and continued to do so until the end of the waking bout, whereas in the kidney the increase in PER2 bioluminescence became apparent only 5–10 min after the transition. Similar differences in PER2 dynamics were observed after falling asleep, albeit in opposite direction. Also, the model suggested a tissue specificity as central dynamics of the 6 hr SD experiment could not be accurately predicted with the parameters optimized on peripheral PER2-bioluminescence data. In its current form, the model describes the global effects of external forces (the sleep-wake distribution and the SCN-independent circadian force) on the behavior of the oscillator, but not their acute effects. Translated into molecular terms, the model only makes predictions on the TTFL aspect of PER2 regulation, not on PER2 as an IEG. Accordingly, the model cannot capture the fast changes at the transitions. Similarly, the short-lasting high levels of PER2 observed in the brain immediately after the 6 hr SD might reflect an IEG response rather than the state of the TTFL oscillator, which would explain why the model could not predict it. As sleep-wake states are brain states, it stands to reason that changes in brain PER2 levels capture more of the acute IEG effects than in the periphery. One could test this hypothesis by quantifying the PER2 response after activating a peripheral tissue, provided this can be achieved without affecting sleep-wake state as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Do changes in bioluminescence reflect changes in PER2 levels?</title><p>The method we implemented to quantify PER2 protein levels presents advantages over previous methods used. It enabled us to acquire data at a time resolution needed to link changes in PER2 to sleep-wake state transitions in individual mice. Moreover, because of the within-subject experimental design, there is a substantial reduction in data variability, and, as illustrated with the effects of individual phase on PER2 amplitude in the 2hOnOff experiment, we could assess the presence of individual differences in the initial conditions that might influence experimental outcome. Finally, the number of mice needed for these experiments has been greatly reduced while obtaining better quality data.</p><p>A limitation of this method is the assumption that changes in bioluminescence reflect changes in PER2 protein levels. Using western blot, we previously validated that changes in bioluminescence during baseline and after a 6 hr SD indeed reflect changes in PER2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, substrate availability can importantly contribute to the signal as demonstrated in the experiment in which we delivered luciferin in the drinking water. Even the use of osmotic mini-pumps does not guarantee constant delivery as its release rate is temperature dependent (Alzet, manufacturer’s notes) and bioluminescence’s increase during wakefulness might therefore result from the accompanying increase in temperature during this state. Arguments against a possible temperature effect on bioluminescence changes come from a study in which, using the same osmotic mini-pumps, the expression of two clock genes known to oscillate in anti-phase could be confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ono et al., 2015</xref>), which would not be possible if temperature was the main determinant of bioluminescence. In the current data, the circadian rhythm in wakefulness in the CAG-Luc and <italic>Pkg1-Luc</italic> mice was not accompanied by changes in bioluminescence. Moreover, we observed that the circadian rhythms of subcutaneous temperature and PER2 bioluminescence are ca. 4 hr out of phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), supporting that the large circadian changes in bioluminescence are not driven by changes in luciferin availability. Moreover, the lack of an increase in bioluminescence during wake bouts in <italic>Pkg1-Luc</italic> mice demonstrates that changes in rate-limiting availability of luciferin did not contribute to the fast sleep-wake-evoked changes in PER2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we used a unique combination of methods allowing us to collect high-resolution data of sleep-wake state in conjunction with PER2 levels and found that the sleep-wake distribution profoundly affects PER2 bioluminescence both short and long term. Such behavior-dependent plasticity of the time-keeping machinery in tissues peripheral to the SCN enables the organism to respond to challenges as time-restricted feeding experiments have demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Damiola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). Besides its importance in regulating feeding and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass and Takahashi, 2010</xref>), the clock circuitry also plays a prominent role in sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Franken, 2013</xref>). PER2 seems perfectly suited as an integrator of sleep-wake state and circadian time because it is sensitive to a variety of sleep-wake-driven signals. Our model suggests that having a large amplitude rhythm protects from acute disturbances of sleep as observed in the 2hOnOff experiment, while sleep-depriving arrhythmic SCNx mice had immediate and large effects on PER2. These rapid effects could only be achieved through the synergistic effect of a second force that we found to be independent of the SCN and the sleep-wake distribution. The coordination of the sleep-wake force and this second force in the model was critical in predicting the effects of sleep-wake interventions on PER2. Research on the nature of this second force would therefore be important to facilitate phase resetting and normalize disrupted clock gene rhythms under conditions of jet lag and shift work, complementing strategies aimed at altering the timing of the central pacemaker.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and housing conditions</title><p>To measure peripheral PER2-bioluminescence levels, we made use of the <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). The KI construct was originally generated on a C57BL/6J-129 mixed background and subsequently brought onto a C57BL/6J (B6) background by backcrossing for at least 11 generations. These mice were then crossed with outbred SKH1 mice (Crl:SKH1-Hrhr; Charles River) to create hairless <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI mice. We used male homozygous <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI B6 and hairless heterozygous <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI SKH1-B6 hybrid (here referred to as SKH1 mice) mice. Mice were kept under a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle with light- and dark onset referred to as Zeitgeber time (ZT)-0 and -12, respectively. Age at time of recording varied between 12 and 24 weeks. Food and water was available ad libitum, and after surgery mice were singly housed. All experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of the State of Vaud Veterinary Office Switzerland under license VD2743, 3201, and 3402.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Source of bioluminescence and luciferin’s route of administration</title><p>Because <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> KI mice express ubiquitously luciferase and the RT-Biolumicorder cannot discriminate between different sources of bioluminescence, we assessed which peripheral organ(s) was/were the major source of bioluminescence.

The main source of dorsal bioluminescence overlapped with the expected location of the kidney, whereas ventrally almost no bioluminescence was detected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Most bioluminescence quantified during the experiment is of dorsal origin due to the orientation of the mouse relative to the PMT, suggesting that the kidneys are the main source of peripheral bioluminescence in <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> SKH1 mice. To confirm our previous report that the main source of central bioluminescence was the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curie et al., 2015</xref>), we imaged one male B6 PER2::LUC mouse at ZT3 again using the IVIS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When luciferin is infused centrally and the skull is thinned and a glass cone mounted, all emitted bioluminescence originates from the head of the mouse, with no detectable signal from the periphery. For details on the surgery see ‘Surgical procedures and experimental design.’.</p><p>In a second pilot experiment, we investigated the optimal route of luciferin administration. Although luciferin administration via drinking water has been used before to measure bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saini et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwano et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sinturel et al., 2021</xref>), we were concerned that this route could limit luciferin availability in a circadian fashion because drinking behavior has a strong circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bainier et al., 2017</xref>). To address these concerns, we made use of mice expressing constitutively luciferase under control of the synthetic CAG promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2004</xref>, Jackson catalog number 008450), thus allowing for testing of circadian fluctuating levels of luciferin. Mice received luciferin via the drinking water or via an osmotic mini-pump and served as their own control. Four male CAG-Luc mice were housed for two subsequent experiments in constant darkness in the RT-Biolumicorder. During the first experiment, 0.5 mg/mL luciferin was dissolved in the drinking water. At the end of this experiment, mice received subcutaneously an osmotic mini-pump (Alzet, model 1002) under light anesthesia (isoflurane; 2–4% mixed with O<sub>2</sub>) containing 70 mg/mL of luciferin and could recover for 2 days before bioluminescence and activity was monitored for the second experiment in the RT-Biolumicorder.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgical procedures and experimental design</title><p>Experimental design of the three main experiments is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> with the upper panel (Experiment 1) illustrating the central and peripheral recordings of PER2 bioluminescence alongside EEG/EMG and LMA before, during, and after a 6 hr SD, and the middle and bottom panels (Experiment 2 and 3) the SCNx and the 2hOnOff experiments, respectively.

Three gold-plated screws (frontal, parietal, and cerebellar) were screwed into the skull over the right cerebral hemisphere, where the cerebellar screw served as a reference for the other two electrodes. Two additional screws were used as anchor screws. For the EMG, a gold wire was inserted into the neck musculature along the back of the skull. For brain delivery of D-luciferin, a cannula (Brain Infusion Kit1, Alzet) was introduced stereotaxically into the right lateral ventricle (1 mm lateral, 0.3 mm posterior to bregma, and 2.2 mm deep) under deep anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine; intraperitoneally, 75 and 10 mg/kg, respectively), and connected to the mini-pump. A depression (diameter 2 mm) was made in (but not through) the skull in a region of the left frontal cortex (approximate coordinates 2 mm lateral to midline, 2 mm anterior to bregma), in which a glass cylinder (length 4.0 mm; diameter 2.0 mm) was positioned and fixed with dental cement. The EMG and three EEG electrodes were subsequently soldered to a connector and cemented to the skull. The cerebellar screw served as a reference for the parietal and frontal screw and the EMG. After the first recovery day, mice were habituated to the weight of the wireless EEG recording system by attaching a dummy of same size and weight to their connector. Two days before habituation to the RT-Biolumicorder, mice were implanted with the osmotic mini-pump (model 1002, Alzet; luciferin 35 mg/mL) under light anesthesia. 8–10 days post-surgery, mice were placed in the RT-Biolumicorder at the end of the light phase (~ZT10-ZT12) for 2 days in LD to habituate to the novel environment. At the end of the second habituation day, the dummy was replaced with a wireless EEG (NeuroLogger, TSE Systems GmbH).

In short, mice are left undisturbed as long as they do not show signs of sleep. Sleep is prevented by introducing and removing paper tissue, changing the litter, bringing a pipet in the animal’s proximity, or gentle tapping of the cage.

Electrolytic lesions (1 mA, 5 s) were made using a direct current (DC) lesion device (3500, Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). After lesion, mice were housed in constant dark (DD) conditions for at least 10 days to verify absence of circadian organization of overt behavior.

Based on this new 3 min sleep-wake sequence, clear sleep-to-wake and wake-to-sleep transitions were selected according to the following criteria: at least 9 min (three 3 min intervals) of the initial state had to be followed by at least 15 min (five 3 min intervals) of the other state. Transitions were followed both forward and backward in time as long as state did not change. Bioluminescence for all 3 min intervals of a transition was expressed as a percentage of the level reached at the transition; that is, the average between the level reached in the last 3 min prior to the transition and the first 3 min after the transition. Transitions were aligned according to time of the state transition (time 0) and then averaged first within and then across mice. Average time courses were reported for the longest time spent in state after the transition to which all mice contributed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>2hOnOff experiment</title><p>Bioluminescence data obtained 5 min before and 10 min after the SDs were excluded from analysis.

To solve this equation and optimize for parameters that best describe the observed PER2 bioluminescence, we proceeded as follows: the relative bioluminescence data from both experiments were averaged across mice using 30 min bins. LMA was averaged across mice using 6 min bins. LMA could not be measured directly during SDs and was estimated by assessing the increase in LMA during SDs measured in EEG-implanted mice, which was found to be 2.4 times higher compared to average baseline levels. Thus, the SD effect was estimated using 2.4 times the mean activity observed during baseline (i.e., 181.9 and 180.2 for the SCNx and 2hOnOff, respectively).</p><p>To solve the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the driven harmonic oscillator, we transformed it into the following system of two first-order ODEs describing the change of position and speed of our oscillator:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="left left" columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>ω</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>We then used the fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK4) numerical method to approximate the solution using a fixed time step of 0.1 hr.

For the 2hOnOff experiment, the model was generated for 20 days prior experiment to reach a steady state using replication of LMA observed in baseline (T0–T24). The position and speed of the oscillator at the end of the 20 days were taken as initial values for the fitting. We optimized the model for the following parameters: intercept (equilibrium position of the oscillator), natural frequency, damping constant, and coefficient for the force exerted by LMA, amplitude of circadian force and phase of circadian force. We optimized the fitting by minimizing the RSS between predicted position of our model and the observed PER2-bioluminescence level. The box-constrained PORT routines method (nlminb) implemented in the optimx/R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nash and Varadhan, 2011</xref>) was used to minimize the RSS.</p><p>The goodness of fit of the model was assessed as follows.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hiroki Ueda (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you can see from the feedback provided by the reviewers they found the data interesting and thought-provoking, yet they also raised substantial concerns about different aspects of the work. Importantly, the reviewers noted that some of the main conclusions (based on the presented data) are not fully supported. A considerable amount of work that is beyond the scope of a revision at <italic>eLife</italic> would be needed to address these concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper entitled &quot;The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2&quot;, the authors observed PER2 expression in peripheral tissues of freely behaving animals and found that the sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral PER2 dynamics. In addition, implementing the mathematical model, they showed that the peripheral PER2 rhythms can be generated by two factors: a sleep-wake state dependent one and a peripheral (not master) circadian dependent one. Despite the difficulty to dissect the effect of these two factors in vivo, the authors, dealing with this problem by the unique experimental designs, provided direct evidence that sleep-wake state itself affects peripheral daily rhythms. However, this paper has a couple of points to be improved, which are summarized in the comments below.</p><p>1. As for Figure 1B, 1C and 1D, the authors showed PER2 bioluminescence changes according to circadian rhythm and state transitions in only one individual mouse (ID: 2MP82), which might be insufficient for concluding that the PER2 bioluminescence changes depending on the circadian and sleep-wake cycle. Plus, there might be a mistake in the time label of Figure 1B (is this plot started from time = 6 or time = 0?). Thus, the reviewer suggests that the authors should add data about other mice and perform the statistical analyses to clarify the validity of the circadian- and sleep-wake-dependent change of PER2 bioluminescence. With Figure 4, the reviewer suggests the same, i.e., the authors should analyze not only one representative mouse but a group of mice.</p><p>2. In lines 202 to 205, the authors concluded that the behavioral rhythm reduction by 2hOnOff protocol appeared to be insufficient to consistently reduce the amplitude of the PER2-bioluminescence oscillation. However, it is difficult to follow its logic toward the conclusion. Thus, the reviewer recommends that the authors should describe their logic in more detail.</p><p>3. As for Figure 4 and Table 2, the authors compared two mathematical models and concluded that the two forces model has better prediction accuracy. However, it is unclear whether the circadian force itself or the combination of the two forces is important to predict PER2-bioluminescence dynamics. The reviewer suggests that the authors should add a comparison with a model that using a single circadian force (F = FPERI).</p><p>4. In lines 277 to 280, the authors described the increase in PER2 amplitude during the 2hOnOff experiment by advancing the phase of FPERI by 6h. The reviewer suggests that the authors should clearly explain why they apply their mathematical model to the 6h advancing, although they observed 1-2h phase advance in their experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>By measuring EEG/EMG and PER2::LUC bioluminescence (most signal comes from the kidney) from freely behaving mice simultaneously or from separate cohort mice with similar conditions, the authors observed that sleep state acutely changed PER2::LUC bioluminescence, repeated daily sleep deprivation reinstated circadian PER2::LUC rhythm in SCN ablated behaviorally arrhythmic mice. The authors also did a mathematical simulation modeling peripheral PER2::LUC bioluminescence influenced by a sleep dependent force and a SCN independent force.</p><p>I believe the data presented in the current manuscript, however, I don't think the main conclusions are supported by the data. The acute changes (within 30 min) of luminescence they observed is most likely caused by in vivo factors (Not changed in PER2::LUC protein, artifact). It is very problematic to assess the amplitude change from averaged luminescence record from multiple behaviorally arrhythmic mice (analysis flaw). Although the above mentioned two major conclusions must be removed from the manuscript, the study validates previously published results done by ex vivo tissue and in vivo anesthetized animal with luminescence measure from freely behaving mice. So I encourage the authors to publish the data to another journal (please also see my specific points below), but I don't think discovery reported in the work is novel for the publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. It is unlikely that the acute change of PER2::LUC luminescence reflects PER2 protein translation and degradation. As the authors refer to correctly, luminescence from PER2::LUC knockin mice reflects PER2::LUC fusion protein (not Per2 transcription). The authors didn't correctly refer to the studies measuring light induction of Per2 mRNA and protein in the SCN. The light induction of Per2 mRNA in the SCN can only be seen 60 min after onset of the light pulse (no induction was observed at 30 min after the light pulse. Takumi et al. 1998 and many other publications). Increased PER2 protein in the SCN can only be seen at 4 h after the light pulse (no change was observed 2 h after the light pulse. Yan and Sliver 2004, Antoun et al., 2012). Therefore, the acute luminescence change observed at sleep wake transitions (Figure 1D) is unlikely reflecting changes in the PER2::LUC fusion protein. Temperature, pH, and Ca/Mg and ATP levels all strongly affect luminescence produced by firefly luciferase and luciferin. It was shown that the ultradian rhythm of the core body temperature closely matched the ultradian behavior rhythm (Blessing 2018 PMID: 30454601). The authors referred to their own published study that luminescence rhythm change was vilified by qPCR. However, the time scale of their published work showed that changes occurred after 6 h of sleep deprivation, not in the 30 min range.</p><p>2. The advantage of continuous luminescence measurement from the same mouse is that the presence and absence of the rhythm can be determined from a mouse that has no phase marker (e.g. SCN lesioned mice). Arrhythmicity (or lowered amplitude of the rhythm) observed by conventional population sampling (from multiple mice) cannot be determined if individual mice lose rhythmicity, or if individual mice retained intact rhythm but they are out of sync. From the data presented in Figure 2, the authors claimed repeated sleep deprivations reinstated the rhythm, but they didn't analyze amplitude change before, during, and after sleep deprivation in individual mice (even they didn't provide individual data anywhere else, they provided individual data in other experiments). It is well known that the SCN-lesioned mice do not show a daily rhythm under LD cycle (Light cannot reinstate behavior rhythm). The authors stated that they performed daily sleep deprivation to the mice 5 weeks after SCN-lesioned. From average luminescence rhythms of 4 SCN-X mice, the authors cannot conclude their main claim that sleep deprivation reinstated the peripheral circadian rhythm. It is possible there is no change in the amplitude of individual peripheral circadian oscillators, but repeated sleep deprivation entrained those rhythms (the authors averaged individual luminescence relative to the phase of daily sleep deprivation).</p><p>3. In the complementary experiment presented in Figure 3, the authors analyzed the amplitude changes from individual mice, but didn't analyze from the averaged data. The authors observed a reduced amplitude by 2hOnOff procedure in 4 out of 6 mice, and an increased amplitude in 2 out of 6 mice. But the authors concluded that the 2hOnOff procedure did not &quot;consistently&quot; affect the rhythm (in another place, they wrote &quot;2hOnOff protocol didn't noticeably affect the ongoing circadian PER2 oscillation&quot;).</p><p>4. Because of the issues pointed out above, the parameters used for the mathematical simulation are not valid. Use of locomotor activity as a wake parameter is also not appropriate. Mice can be wake without moving.</p><p>5. In the method section, the authors described each procedure. However, it was impossible for me to know how exactly each individual mouse went through the procedures. It seems some sleep deprivation was done under dim red light and other was done under light. I suggest the authors provide a timeline (e.g. flowchart figure) of procedures in each experiment.</p><p>6. Since in vivo bioluminescence recording became popular technology, I strongly suggest the authors move the data presented in supplementary Figure 2 to the main text as an actual figure. Were CAG mice also crossed with hairless strain? Does tissue explanted from this mouse in vitro not show a circadian rhythm? It even looks like luminescence from the mice with luciferin supplemented by osmic pump shows a weak rhythm. I wonder if CAG promoter may have circadian rhythm as CMV promoter does (Collaco et al., 2005). Amplitude of activity rhythm is lowered in mice with pump. Is this due to surgery (pump implantation)? If so, lowered amplitude of luminescence rhythm might also be affected by surgery. Having a control (saline in pump and luciferin supplied through drinking water) is necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study. As far as I know, there are no previous studies performing simultaneous measurement of sleep-wake state and bioluminescence (clock gene expression) in freely moving mice. In addition, their measurement method was well validated through several pilot studies, and measurements obtained using this method are therefore reliable. In fact, the presented data are clear and convincing. However, although I have no doubt that the results are useful and valuable for a wide range of circadian scientists, I feel the present version of their work may not be a strong candidate for publication in this journal because of insufficient novelty and impact.</p><p>1) The results clearly revealed the temporal relationship between sleep-wake state and PER2 bioluminescence through simultaneous monitoring in freely moving mice, with high time resolution. However, because previous studies have already found that sleep deprivation results in a change in PER2 levels, I feel that the present study does not make obvious progress toward further understanding the mechanism. The simultaneous monitoring experiments are interesting but each of the techniques was originally established by other groups. For example, some findings related to the identification of systemic or molecular pathways controlling PER2 expression during sleep deprivation may be required.</p><p>2) Although a detailed description of the method for sleep deprivation is important, I was not able to find it in the main text. The authors should clarify whether sleep deprivation itself or other factors such as stress signals triggered by sleep deprivation affect PER2 expression. At this time, I feel not sleep deprivation per se but some stress signals affect PER2 expression. Many previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids, well-known stress hormones, strongly affect peripheral clocks. Sleep deprivation, one of the stimuli activating stress signals, may therefore affect PER2 expression in peripheral clocks via glucocorticoid signaling pathways. The contribution of glucocorticoids to PER2 expression during sleep deprivation can be examined simply through surgical removal of the adrenal glands.</p><p>3) Their conclusions may be specific to the kidney. All bioluminescence data were obtained through monitoring only the kidney. The authors should justify why they can conclude that sleep deprivation affects &quot;peripheral clocks&quot; only judging from kidney data. To generalize kidney data to other peripheral clocks, they should repeat similar experiments using at least another organ or tissue. Real-time monitoring of bioluminescence from the liver is technically simple because injected adenoviruses (carrying a reporter gene driven by a clock gene promoter) specifically infect the liver.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Some may be addressed by reanalyzinging the data already present in the paper (non-circadian reporter mice, CAG-luc). It is claimed that PER2LUC luminescence spikes in Figure 1B are caused by changes in sleep-wake status (analysis is shown in Figure 1C). Currently, for the CAG-LUC animals, there is only group average data (Supplementary Figure 3B). A valid suggestion, hinted by reviewers, is to show individual records: if spikes are not seen in these animals it helps excluding the possibility that the in vivo luminescence spikes are an artifact (e.g. caused by core body temperature changes). Although it doesn't seem to be recorded EEG/EMG from the non-circadian reporter mice, a similar analysis (based on defining sleep as sustained immobility) could be conducted.</p><p>Yet, what would really provide strong support to the claims, eliminating doubts about potential artifacts, is to validate the data with conventional methods (immunoblot). As it is mentioned in the MS, during previous work (Curie 2015, PMID: 25581923) the authors have partially validated by Western blot analyses peripheral Per2luc bioluminescence data (Figure S4, liver). Yet, the temporal resolution, and experimental condition of such analyses may not be fully comparable to what is present here,</p><p>It is also important to consider that most of the conclusions drawn from the data are based on the temporal correlation between kidney-derived bioluminescence and sleep-wake states. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the temporal correlation between single organ-derived bioluminescence and sleep-wake states to other peripheral and central clocks. Such limitation of the work (in the absence of additional data) should be clearly acknowledged.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this paper entitled &quot;The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2&quot;, the authors attempted to find the factor(s) directly contributing to clock gene expression in peripheral tissues. To achieve that, they observed PERIOD-2 (PER2) expression in peripheral tissues of freely moving mice and developed new mathematical models to analyze them. They found that the sleep-wake distribution correlates to the peripheral PER2 dynamics, and that the peripheral PER2 rhythms can be predicted by sleep-wake-state- and peripheral-circadian-dependent factors. Despite the difficulty to dissect the effects of circadian and the sleep-wake cycle on gene expression in vivo, they provided direct evidence that the sleep-wake cycle itself affects peripheral daily rhythms by the unique experimental designs. However, there are still a few points to be addressed before publication including a detailed validation of the PER2 bioluminescence system, which would further support their conclusion.</p><p>All things considered, their findings will have an impact on the chronobiology field, as giving direct evidence on sleep-wake-state-dependent regulation of peripheral clock gene expression. In addition, those methods can be useful to investigate the gene expression not only in the kidney or cerebral cortex but also in other various tissues of freely moving mice.</p><p>In the revised paper, the authors addressed almost all our concerns with proper correction and additional analyses, but it has some points to be improved before publication, which are summarized in the comments below.</p><p>1. The authors assumed that PER2 bioluminescence directly reflected expression of PER2 protein, but it has not been fully confirmed yet especially in the fast (within an hour) dynamics. For further progress of the method, the combination with other techniques to quantify fast and small (&lt; 10%) protein changes would be required, as the authors mentioned in the paper.</p><p>2. This reviewer suggests that the authors should discuss about the controversial results regarding PER2-bioluminescene amplitude and sleep-wake distribution in Figure 3 and Suppl. Figure 7. When the amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution was reduced, PER2-bioluminescence amplitude was reduced in 4/6 mice as the model expected, while it was increased in 2/6 mice.</p><p>3. Regarding Figure 3E, the authors showed that the 2hOnOff protocol decreased the amplitude of sleep-wake distribution. However, the sleep-wake distribution during the recovery phase was not assessed. Thus, the reviewer recommends that the authors should add data of recovery day to Figure 3E and compare it to the PER2 bioluminescence trends (Figure 3C).</p><p>4. In lines 290 to 294, the authors concluded that the prediction from the model, the behavioral rhythm reduction reduces PER2 bioluminescence amplitude, which is consistent with their observation in the Figure 3. However, this conclusion could be difficult to understand because the 2hOnOff protocol increases the PER2 bioluminescence amplitude in one-third of mice (there may be no significant change between BSL and the 2hOnOff protocol; see Figure 3C). The authors provided an additional model (Suppl. Figure 7A-C) to explain the individual difference, and thus the reviewer suggests the authors to describe that conclusion after the modeling part to make the logic clearer.</p><p>5. Regarding Suppl. Figure 7A-C, the authors described the increase in PER2 amplitude during the 2hOnOff experiment by advancing the phase of FPERI more than 2.5h. The reviewer suggests that the authors could mention these results in Results or Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hoekstra et al. investigated the relationship between sleep state and PER2::LUC luminescence in freely behaving mice and showed that luminescence acutely changed at sleep/wake transitions.

Technically REC day 1 is the same as SD, but it is good to show how the amplitude in the group average and the individual mouse declines.</p><p>Line 573-584: This is an important discussion addressing the possible temperature artifact.

Part of this concern is based on the fact that the Curie et al., 2015 work not only shows signals (in B6 mice) coming from the cortex, but also clear signals coming from the kidney/liver (as visualized with the IVIS signals, whereas the RT-Biolumicorder does not allow sorting those signals).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hoekstra et al. investigated the relationship between sleep state and PER2::LUC luminescence in freely behaving mice and showed that luminescence acutely changed at sleep/wake transitions. The authors also showed that repeated daily sleep deprivation reinitiated the PER2::LUC luminescence rhythm in SCN ablated behaviorally arrhythmic mice. This re-initiated rhythm sustained a few cycles in constant conditions, indicating that sleep can synchronize (or coordinate) peripheral circadian oscillators.</p><p>A strength of this study is the simultaneous recording of EEG/EMG/activity and PER2::LUC luminescence in freely moving mice.</p><p>One obvious concern is that acute PER2::LUC luminescence changes occurring at sleep/wake transitions are artifacts (e.g. due to acute change in core body temperature, Calcium/Magnesium, pH, ATP), but not caused by the synthesis/degradation of PER2 protein. After two major revisions, the authors now provided the data showing that no luminescence change occurs at sleep/wake transitions in Pkg1-luc activity (housekeeping gene promoter activity measured by luminescence reporter). Although it is still difficult for this reviewer to believe 30-40% changes in PER2 protein can occur within 30 min in the brain and peripheral organs, the new Pkg1-luc data rejects the above-mentioned concern. The authors also provided an interesting new analysis that acute luminescence changes at sleep/wake transitions in CAG-luc mice are much faster compared to changes in PER2::LUC mice. The authors reasoned this by saying the CAG synthetic promoter is activated by transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB, CREB, AP-1). This is an interesting result but raises a new concern. The authors used this CAG-luc mouse to optimize the luciferin administration method, as this is a non-circadian reporter. However, if being awake activates CAG promoter, this reviewer expects to see a basal circadian change of luminescence in CAG-luc mice.</p><p>Another relatively minor concern is that the authors used PER2::LUC in pigmented C57BL/6 mice with a cranial window for &quot;the central quantification of bioluminescence&quot;. This reviewer suggested the authors to perform IVIS imaging and show the signal coming from the brain and not from other tissues. Instead, the authors referred to their previous publication (Curie et al., 2015) that the luminescence signal is from the cortex. However, in this paper, the authors actually detected a signal from the liver and kidney as well. Because the authors only showed the hold changes in those tissues (brain, liver kidney), it is not known how strong the signal from cranial windows compare to that from the liver and kidney. Without showing an absolute luminescence value emitted from the brain, liver, and kidney in the same mouse, the authors cannot say that the luminescence signal from the entire mouse is from the cortex.</p><p>This reviewer appreciates the efforts of the authors to address the concerns raised by the reviewer.</p><p>This reviewer can now recommend this work to be published in this journal. However, those two concerns need to be addressed.</p><p>One additional suggestion is that it may not be clear to the reader that mice with a cranial window is used for measuring signal from the cortex.

In addition, implementing the mathematical model, they showed that the peripheral PER2 rhythms can be generated by two factors: a sleep-wake state dependent one and a peripheral (not master) circadian dependent one. Despite the difficulty to dissect the effect of these two factors in vivo, the authors, dealing with this problem by the unique experimental designs, provided direct evidence that sleep-wake state itself affects peripheral daily rhythms. However, this paper has a couple of points to be improved, which are summarized in the comments below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his positive evaluation and particularly for stating that the results “provided direct evidence that sleep-wake state itself affects peripheral daily rhythms”, which is the central claim of our work. We also thank the reviewer for the suggestions to help improve our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. As for Figure 1B, 1C and 1D, the authors showed PER2 bioluminescence changes according to circadian rhythm and state transitions in only one individual mouse (ID: 2MP82), which might be insufficient for concluding that the PER2 bioluminescence changes depending on the circadian and sleep-wake cycle. Thus, the reviewer suggests that the authors should add data about other mice and perform the statistical analyses to clarify the validity of the circadian- and sleep-wake-dependent change of PER2 bioluminescence. With Figure 4, the reviewer suggests the same, i.e., the authors should analyze not only one representative mouse but a group of mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Figure 1B and -C (now Figure 1B) represented an example of one mouse. Group means based on 5 mice were, however, depicted in Figure 1A and -D (now Figure 1A and C), as was mentioned in the figure legend, illustrated by the individual recordings of the 4 remaining mice in Suppl. Figure 3 (now Suppl. Figure 4), stated in the ‘transparent reporting’ form in our submission, and can be deduced from the raw data we provided for this and all other figures. The same holds true for Figure 4 where the model was based on recordings in 4 and 6 mice, respectively. In response to a suggestion from Reviewer 2, we have included a supplementary figure (Suppl. Figure 1) with an overview of all experiments explicitly stating the number of animals used in each.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Plus, there might be a mistake in the time label of Figure 1B (is this plot started from time = 6 or time = 0?).</p></disp-quote><p>The plot starts at 12h, at a time of day that under the previous LD cycles is referred to as ZT12; i.e., the beginning of the dark phase. The tick and label indeed disappeared. This has been corrected in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In lines 202 to 205, the authors concluded that the behavioral rhythm reduction by 2hOnOff protocol appeared to be insufficient to consistently reduce the amplitude of the PER2-bioluminescence oscillation. However, it is difficult to follow its logic toward the conclusion. Thus, the reviewer recommends that the authors should describe their logic in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. With the use of the word ‘appeared’ we hoped it was clear that this was an interpretation. Our logic was as follows: If the sleep-wake distribution contributes to the diurnal changes in PER2 bioluminescence then we can expect that after experimentally reducing the amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution, the amplitude of the PER2 oscillation will be reduced as a result. With the 2hOnOff protocol we reduced, but did not eliminate, the amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution. This reduction was however accompanied by a reduction of PER2 amplitude in only 4 of the 6 mice and we therefore concluded that the reduction in sleep-wake amplitude appeared to be insufficient to elicit the anticipated PER2 effects in all mice. We now have eliminated this interpretative sentence from the Result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As for Figure 4 and Table 2, the authors compared two mathematical models and concluded that the two forces model has better prediction accuracy. However, it is unclear whether the circadian force itself or the combination of the two forces is important to predict PER2-bioluminescence dynamics. The reviewer suggests that the authors should add a comparison with a model that using a single circadian force (F = FPERI).</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We have now performed the suggested additional analysis in the revised manuscript, illustrating better that both forces are needed and their combination represents an important statistical gain in predicting PER2. The results have been added to Figure 4B and C and are presented in the text (l. 326-332). We now extended the modeling to predict results of the 6h SD experiments using the parameters obtained in the other two experiments (Figure 4D, Suppl. Figure 7D, Table 2, l. 297-302).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In lines 277 to 280, the authors described the increase in PER2 amplitude during the 2hOnOff experiment by advancing the phase of FPERI by 6h. The reviewer suggests that the authors should clearly explain why they apply their mathematical model to the 6h advancing, although they observed 1-2h phase advance in their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis was meant as thought-experiment to illustrate on the one hand the power of our dynamic model to perform <italic>in silico</italic> experiments and, on the other hand, that the initial conditions could give rise to diametrically opposing results. We made this clearer in the manuscript. We have now regrouped this analysis together with the analysis mentioned under the preceding point 3, as one of three questions addressed by the model as <italic>in silico</italic> experiments (l. 356-379). In a re-analysis for the revised manuscript, we found that the same effect (i.e., an increase of PER2 bioluminescence amplitude instead of the expected decrease) could already be observed with a 2.5h phase advance. We have added this finding to the revised manuscript (l. 360-365) and illustrated this analysis in Suppl. Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>By measuring EEG/EMG and PER2::LUC bioluminescence (most signal comes from the kidney) from freely behaving mice simultaneously or from separate cohort mice with similar conditions, the authors observed that sleep state acutely changed PER2::LUC bioluminescence, repeated daily sleep deprivation reinstated circadian PER2::LUC rhythm in SCN ablated behaviorally arrhythmic mice. The authors also did a mathematical simulation modeling peripheral PER2::LUC bioluminescence influenced by a sleep dependent force and a SCN independent force.</p><p>I believe the data presented in the current manuscript, however, I don't think the main conclusions are supported by the data. The acute changes (within 30 min) of luminescence they observed is most likely caused by in vivo factors (Not changed in PER2::LUC protein, artifact). It is very problematic to assess the amplitude change from averaged luminescence record from multiple behaviorally arrhythmic mice (analysis flaw). Although the above mentioned two major conclusions must be removed from the manuscript, the study validates previously published results done by ex vivo tissue and in vivo anesthetized animal with luminescence measure from freely behaving mice. So I encourage the authors to publish the data to another journal (please also see my specific points below), but I don't think discovery reported in the work is novel for the publication in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed each of the issues mentioned in detail below. What the reviewer refers to as “very problematic” and “analysis flaw” could be easily addressed. Moreover, the reasons given to deem our bioluminescence signal as artifact are flawed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is unlikely that the acute change of PER2::LUC luminescence reflects PER2 protein translation and degradation. As the authors refer to correctly, luminescence from PER2::LUC knockin mice reflects PER2::LUC fusion protein (not Per2 transcription). The authors didn't correctly refer to the studies measuring light induction of Per2 mRNA and protein in the SCN. The light induction of Per2 mRNA in the SCN can only be seen 60 min after onset of the light pulse (no induction was observed at 30 min after the light pulse. Takumi et al. 1998 and many other publications). Increased PER2 protein in the SCN can only be seen at 4 h after the light pulse (no change was observed 2 h after the light pulse. Yan and Sliver 2004, Antoun et al., 2012). Therefore, the acute luminescence change observed at sleep wake transitions (Figure 1D) is unlikely reflecting changes in the PER2::LUC fusion protein. Temperature, pH, and Ca/Mg and ATP levels all strongly affect luminescence produced by firefly luciferase and luciferin. It was shown that the ultradian rhythm of the core body temperature closely matched the ultradian behavior rhythm (Blessing 2018 PMID: 30454601). The authors referred to their own published study that luminescence rhythm change was vilified by qPCR. However, the time scale of their published work showed that changes occurred after 6 h of sleep deprivation, not in the 30 min range.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we have to correct two of the reviewer’s statements: (1) We did not claim that the literature showed that 30min light-pulses induce PER2 in the SCN and (2) we previously used western blot, and not qPCR, to validate the sleep-deprivation induced increases in PER2 bioluminescence in brain and liver.</p><p>We are aware that no study has reported on such quick induction of PER2 after a light pulse. We did, however, not study light effects in the SCN, and the effects of wakefulness on PER2 in peripheral tissues are vastly under-explored and might differ from those of light in the SCN as a variety of molecular pathways activated by waking are known to affect PER2 (reviewed in the Discussion). The fact that in the literature there is no precedent of wakefulness rapidly inducing small but significant changes in PER2 using more conventional techniques, cannot be used as argument that we reported on a mere artefact. We already cited the study by Cao <italic>et al.</italic> (Nat Neurosci 2015), demonstrating that PER2 protein can indeed be rapidly induced through other means than light; i.e., within 30 min after a serum shock (see Discussion paragraph l. 400-414). The wake-related rapid induction of PER2 is an important novel aspect of our study. Whether the signal obtained with the PER2::Luciferase construct indeed reflects PER2 protein was already discussed in detail in the Discussion (“Do changes in bioluminescence reflect changes in PER2 levels?”).</p><p>Although the variables listed by the reviewer do affect the bioluminescence reaction, they seem not to play a large role (see Discussion section: ‘Do changes in bioluminescence reflect changes in PER2 levels?’). The reviewer’s example of a potential temperature effect can illustrate this. Body temperature changes in a circadian fashion, yet the bioluminescence time courses reporting on clock genes known to be regulated in anti-phase, remain anti-phasic and do not simply follow the temperature dynamics. Also the lack of a noticeable rhythm in the CAGbioluminescence signal (Suppl. Figure 3B) confirms that the circadian rhythm in activity and associated temperature changes have little or no effect (or even decreases when activity is highest, see our response to point 6 below). We have added this observation to the Discussion (l. 577-579). While temperature increases quickly (within minutes) after awakening and stays high while awake (see the Blessing <italic>et al.</italic> reference mentioned by the reviewer and our own work: Hoekstra <italic>et al. eLife</italic> 2019), PER2-bioluminescence follows a much slower time course and initially continues to decrease before subsequently increasing (see Figure 1C). For this rebuttal we followed both central (see also comment 3 of Reviewer 3) and peripheral PER2-bioluminescence for as long as waking prevailed as opposed to the 1st 30min after wake onset only. The new analysis shows that peripheral PER2 increases and then again decreases with increasing wake duration, while central levels monotonically keep increasing consistent with the western-blot verified tissue-specific effects of experimentally prolonging wakefulness (Figure 1C and brain vs. liver in Curie <italic>et al.</italic> 2015). These results further underscore that changes in PER2 bioluminescence do not follow wake related changes in temperature. We have replaced the transition analyses in Figure 1C with this new analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The advantage of continuous luminescence measurement from the same mouse is that the presence and absence of the rhythm can be determined from a mouse that has no phase marker (e.g. SCN lesioned mice). Arrhythmicity (or lowered amplitude of the rhythm) observed by conventional population sampling (from multiple mice) cannot be determined if individual mice lose rhythmicity, or if individual mice retained intact rhythm but they are out of sync. From the data presented in Figure 2, the authors claimed repeated sleep deprivations reinstated the rhythm, but they didn't analyze amplitude change before, during, and after sleep deprivation in individual mice (even they didn't provide individual data anywhere else, they provided individual data in other experiments).</p><p>The authors stated that they performed daily sleep deprivation to the mice 5 weeks after SCN-lesioned. From average luminescence rhythms of 4 SCN-X mice, the authors cannot conclude their main claim that sleep deprivation reinstated the peripheral circadian rhythm. It is possible there is no change in the amplitude of individual peripheral circadian oscillators, but repeated sleep deprivation entrained those rhythms (the authors averaged individual luminescence relative to the phase of daily sleep deprivation).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue. We had provided the individual amplitude information for the baseline bioluminescence rhythms of the SCNx mice in the first version of our manuscript (Suppl. Figure 5C and Figure 2B), but indeed did not include this information during and after the sleep deprivations. As mentioned in our reply to minor issue 1 from Reviewer 1, we have added these data to main Figure 2C. The results clarified that increased amplitude during the sleep deprivations does not simply result from a phase alignment as it is significantly larger than in the baseline recordings. This analysis and conclusion has now been added in the Results (l. 206-210).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is well known that the SCN-lesioned mice do not show a daily rhythm under LD cycle (Light cannot reinstate behavior rhythm).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not make this claim in the manuscript and therefore fail to see the relevance of this comment. Moreover, the literature indicates that this claim is less well-known as the reviewer makes us believe (specifically addressed in Redlin and Mrosovsky J Comp Physiol A 1999, reviewed by Redlin Chronobiol Int 2001). Light is an important driver of rhythmic sleep-wake behavior (see e.g. Hubbard <italic>et al.</italic> PNAS 2021 <italic>in press</italic>; bioRxiv).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the complementary experiment presented in Figure 3, the authors analyzed the amplitude changes from individual mice, but didn't analyze from the averaged data. The authors observed a reduced amplitude by 2hOnOff procedure in 4 out of 6 mice, and an increased amplitude in 2 out of 6 mice. But the authors concluded that the 2hOnOff procedure did not &quot;consistently&quot; affect the rhythm (in another place, they wrote &quot;2hOnOff protocol didn't noticeably affect the ongoing circadian PER2 oscillation&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We did analyze the amplitude changes at the group level by comparing PER2 amplitude under baseline with the 2hOnOff regime, and mentioned the results in the figure legend (“resulting in overall lack of an effect of the 2hOnOff protocol”) along with the statistics. In the Results section, the lack of an overall effect was reiterated twice. We now have added the mean values and the SEMs to the figure legend for additional clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Because of the issues pointed out above, the parameters used for the mathematical simulation are not valid.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer claims the parameters for the simulation are not valid, but does not explain how he or she arrives at this conclusion. Many issues were raised in the preceding three points, none of which make reference to the model. We will not try and guess what the reviewer might have meant especially since we have now addressed the issues pointed out above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Use of locomotor activity as a wake parameter is also not appropriate. Mice can be wake without moving.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, locomotor activity can importantly deviate from time-spent-awake in certain situations. This was however not the case in the current experiments as could be deduced from the very strong positive correlation between waking and LMA (R<sup>2</sup>=0.79) which we presented in Suppl. Figure 5A (now Suppl. Figure 6B), confirming that the two variables strongly covary. Moreover, from a modeling perspective the important point is not whether locomotor activity one-to-one relates to waking but that the time courses of the two variables match. We have added another panel to this supplementary figure illustrating the time course of LMA and waking to underscore their similarity (Suppl. Figure 6A). Finally, we now have modelled PER2 dynamics in the 6h SD experiments based on either wakefulness or LMA. Both resulted in similar tight fits. These findings were added to the results and Suppl. Figure 6C. To conclude, in the context of the model, locomotor activity is a highly appropriate proxy for the sleep-wake distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the method section, the authors described each procedure. However, it was impossible for me to know how exactly each individual mouse went through the procedures. It seems some sleep deprivation was done under dim red light and other was done under light. I suggest the authors provide a timeline (e.g. flowchart figure) of procedures in each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this useful suggestion and we have included the suggested figure as Suppl. Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Since in vivo bioluminescence recording became popular technology, I strongly suggest the authors move the data presented in supplementary Figure 2 to the main text as an actual figure. Were CAG mice also crossed with hairless strain? Does tissue explanted from this mouse in vitro not show a circadian rhythm? It even looks like luminescence from the mice with luciferin supplemented by osmic pump shows a weak rhythm. I wonder if CAG promoter may have circadian rhythm as CMV promoter does (Collaco et al., 2005). Amplitude of activity rhythm is lowered in mice with pump. Is this due to surgery (pump implantation)? If so, lowered amplitude of luminescence rhythm might also be affected by surgery. Having a control (saline in pump and luciferin supplied through drinking water) is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the many suggested follow-up experiments related to the results obtained in the CAGmice have their merit, addressing them experimentally is clearly far removed from the aims of our manuscript and would be more appropriate for a separate, technical paper. With a straightforward and unique approach, we show that administering the luciferase substrate in the drinking water gives rise to high-amplitude bioluminescence rhythms that all but disappear when using mini-pumps. The by far most plausible explanation is that the large-amplitude rhythms are an artefact associated with the circadian timing of water intake (and thus luciferin availability) and that therefore mini-pumps are to be preferred to administer the substrate.</p><p>Indeed, a small yet significant bioluminescence rhythm is present in CAG mice implanted with mini-pumps which does, however, not challenge our choice of route of administration. Moreover, this residual bioluminescence rhythm peaks 6.3 circadian hours prior to when the activity rhythm peaks and bioluminescence thus decreases when animals are awake most, again demonstrating that changes in bioluminescence do not simply follow changes in e.g. body temperature associated with the circadian sleep-wake distribution.</p><p>The reviewer claims that the amplitude of the activity rhythm in mice implanted with minipumps is lower. Statistics fail to support the reviewer’s claim (P=0.67, t=0.47, paired t-test, n=4 on amplitudes derived from sine-wave fits of individual time-course data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an interesting study. As far as I know, there are no previous studies performing simultaneous measurement of sleep-wake state and bioluminescence (clock gene expression) in freely moving mice. In addition, their measurement method was well validated through several pilot studies, and measurements obtained using this method are therefore reliable. In fact, the presented data are clear and convincing. However, although I have no doubt that the results are useful and valuable for a wide range of circadian scientists, I feel the present version of their work may not be a strong candidate for publication in this journal because of insufficient novelty and impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for judging our work well validated and our data reliable, clear, and convincing. Our study is indeed the first to simultaneously record EEG/EMG and bioluminescence, as well as locomotor activity allowing to show that undisturbed sleep-wake behavior contributed to PER2 dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The results clearly revealed the temporal relationship between sleep-wake state and PER2 bioluminescence through simultaneous monitoring in freely moving mice, with high time resolution. However, because previous studies have already found that sleep deprivation results in a change in PER2 levels, I feel that the present study does not make obvious progress toward further understanding the mechanism. The simultaneous monitoring experiments are interesting but each of the techniques was originally established by other groups. For example, some findings related to the identification of systemic or molecular pathways controlling PER2 expression during sleep deprivation may be required.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer states our work lacks the novelty that would justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic> by referring to previous sleep-deprivation studies. In doing so, the reviewer overlooked an important novel aspect of our current study: we are the first to have quantified the relationship between spontaneous sleep-wake behavior and PER2-bioluminescence, whereas our previous work only assessed the effects of sleep deprivation. We discovered that like sleep deprivation, also spontaneous wakefulness, raises PER2 levels. The finding that PER2’s increase is associated with wakefulness <italic>per se</italic> and does not result from confounding physiological changes accompanying the sleep deprivation (e.g. stress, see next issue), is a core assumption of the mathematical model which, with high accuracy, could predict PER2’s behavior under three challenging experimental protocols. Thus, the circadian distribution of sleep-wake behavior under undisturbed conditions, considered by most a mere output of the clock, modulates the circadian time-keeping circuitry and is required to maintain high-amplitude PER2 oscillations. We believe this to be a major advance in understanding circadian-rhythm generation in tissues peripheral to the SCN as it challenges current dogma of the clockgene circuitry being responsible for all rhythmic gene expression, including clock genes themselves. In the Discussion we had already reviewed the molecular pathways by which sleep-wake state could affect the clock-gene circuitry. We recently published on one of these pathways (temperature – CIRBP – clock genes; Hoekstra <italic>et al. eLife</italic> 2019) through which the sleep-wake distribution could modulate clock-gene expression outside the SCN. We now have put more emphasis on the importance of spontaneous sleep-wake behavior on PER2 bioluminescence rhythms and added an analysis documenting this further (l. 344-353).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although a detailed description of the method for sleep deprivation is important, I was not able to find it in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed did not describe the sleep-deprivation method in detail but referred to our sleep- phenotyping methods paper instead [“…mice were sleep deprived for six hours at a time they were expected to rest (….) by gentle handling as described (Mang and Franken, 2012)”]. We have expanded on this method in the revised manuscript (l. 683-689).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clarify whether sleep deprivation itself or other factors such as stress signals triggered by sleep deprivation affect PER2 expression. At this time, I feel not sleep deprivation per se but some stress signals affect PER2 expression. Many previous studies have shown that glucocorticoids, well-known stress hormones, strongly affect peripheral clocks. Sleep deprivation, one of the stimuli activating stress signals, may therefore affect PER2 expression in peripheral clocks via glucocorticoid signaling pathways. The contribution of glucocorticoids to PER2 expression during sleep deprivation can be examined simply through surgical removal of the adrenal glands.</p></disp-quote><p>Short-term sleep deprivation by gentle handling is indeed considered a mild stressor and corticosterone does increase as we had already clarified in the Discussion (“How does wakefulness increase PER2?”). We published the experiment the reviewer suggested a while ago (Mongrain <italic>et al.</italic> Sleep 2010). This study shows that the increase in <italic>Per2</italic> expression during sleep deprivation is not solely due to the sleep-deprivation associated corticosterone increase as in adrenalectomized mice sleep deprivation still significantly increases <italic>Per2</italic> levels. These results, together with the results obtained after spontaneous periods of waking (which are not accompanied by an increase in corticosterone) presented in the current study, strongly argue against the simple scenario proposed by the reviewer. These issues are addressed in the Discussion (l. 499-511).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Their conclusions may be specific to the kidney. All bioluminescence data were obtained through monitoring only the kidney. The authors should justify why they can conclude that sleep deprivation affects &quot;peripheral clocks&quot; only judging from kidney data. To generalize kidney data to other peripheral clocks, they should repeat similar experiments using at least another organ or tissue. Real-time monitoring of bioluminescence from the liver is technically simple because injected adenoviruses (carrying a reporter gene driven by a clock gene promoter) specifically infect the liver.</p></disp-quote><p>In an earlier publication (Curie <italic>et al.</italic> Sleep 2015), using an in vivo imaging approach, we already demonstrated that sleep deprivation increases PER2 in cortex, liver, and kidney, which, for cortex and liver, were confirmed by western blot. The baseline and recovery bioluminescence dynamics obtained in central and peripheral tissue with the RT-Biolumicorder depicted in Figure 1A match remarkably well those reported for cortex and liver and kidney, respectively, with the in vivo imaging method. We are therefore confident that the effects we report can be generalized to other organs peripheral to the SCN.</p><p>When setting up the experiments, we also recorded central (cortical) PER2bioluminescence together with EEG/EMG in 6 C57BL/6J PER2::LUC mice. Because detected bioluminescence levels were somewhat noisier (l. 167-169), for the original manuscript we decided to focus on the better accessible (hairless SKH1 mice) and more robust peripheral (kidney) signals. Nevertheless, also the cortical bioluminescence signals demonstrate that the results we reported are not specific to kidney, albeit with tissue-specific dynamics during spontaneous wake episodes. We have included these central data in Figure 1 and addressed the tissue-specificity in the Discussion (l. 531-551).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper entitled &quot;The sleep-wake distribution contributes to the peripheral rhythms in PERIOD-2&quot;, the authors attempted to find the factor(s) directly contributing to clock gene expression in peripheral tissues. To achieve that, they observed PERIOD-2 (PER2) expression in peripheral tissues of freely moving mice and developed new mathematical models to analyze them. They found that the sleep-wake distribution correlates to the peripheral PER2 dynamics, and that the peripheral PER2 rhythms can be predicted by sleep-wake-state- and peripheral-circadian-dependent factors. Despite the difficulty to dissect the effects of circadian and the sleep-wake cycle on gene expression in vivo, they provided direct evidence that the sleep-wake cycle itself affects peripheral daily rhythms by the unique experimental designs. However, there are still a few points to be addressed before publication including a detailed validation of the PER2 bioluminescence system, which would further support their conclusion.</p><p>All things considered, their findings will have an impact on the chronobiology field, as giving direct evidence on sleep-wake-state-dependent regulation of peripheral clock gene expression. In addition, those methods can be useful to investigate the gene expression not only in the kidney or cerebral cortex but also in other various tissues of freely moving mice.</p><p>In the revised paper, the authors addressed almost all our concerns with proper correction and additional analyses, but it has some points to be improved before publication, which are summarized in the comments below.</p><p>1. The authors assumed that PER2 bioluminescence directly reflected expression of PER2 protein, but it has not been fully confirmed yet especially in the fast (within an hour) dynamics. For further progress of the method, the combination with other techniques to quantify fast and small (&lt; 10%) protein changes would be required, as the authors mentioned in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and if techniques were available that could reliable quantify the small but significant changes in protein levels that we reported on, we would have readily used them. However, for several reasons this is less straightforward as it might seem: (i) Western blots are not sensitive enough to pick up such small differences as this method is semi-quantitative at best and (ii) the design can no longer be longitudinally (i.e. within the same individual) in contrast to our current in vivo <italic>t</italic>echnology. This latter point is important when assessing the effects of spontaneous wakefulness on PER2 as this would require each animal to be closely monitored (using EEG/EMG signals) for periods of either sleep or wake of similar duration to appear at approximately the same circadian phase, before rapidly killing the mouse for tissue extraction such that waking up (if asleep) and stressing the animal does not affect the measurement. Moreover, because of the semi-quantitative nature of Western blots, small effect size, and group instead of within-subject comparisons, we would need to kill a large number of mice for quantifying PER2 for each time point and a time course analyses, as presented here, would be practically impossible. For these reasons, we decided to analyze bioluminescence dynamics in mice with other luciferase reporter constructs to rule out nonspecific sleep-wake related effects on the bioluminescence reaction. See our response to the first comment by Reviewer 2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. This reviewer suggests that the authors should discuss about the controversial results regarding PER2-bioluminescene amplitude and sleep-wake distribution in Figure 3 and Suppl. Figure 7. When the amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution was reduced, PER2-bioluminescence amplitude was reduced in 4/6 mice as the model expected, while it was increased in 2/6 mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that, given the data, we went as far as we could in trying to explain these counterintuitive results. Our model gave us a tool to investigate this issue and the simulation results suggest that the phase of the circadian force relative to the phase of the wake force could be a contributing factor. This scenario was presented and discussed in detail in the Results section (Lines 386-410). However, this explanation follows from an <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and, as we pointed out in that section, it is clear that this hypothesis must be tested by follow-up experiments before making any firmer claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding Figure 3E, the authors showed that the 2hOnOff protocol decreased the amplitude of sleep-wake distribution. However, the sleep-wake distribution during the recovery phase was not assessed. Thus, the reviewer recommends that the authors should add data of recovery day to Figure 3E and compare it to the PER2 bioluminescence trends (Figure 3C).</p></disp-quote><p>We recorded recovery after the 2hOnOff protocol, but did not further analyze the sleep-wake distribution during this period. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we now have analyzed sleep-wake states for 48h of recovery and added the estimated amplitude of the sleep-wake distribution during these two recovery days to Figure 3E. After the reduction of the daily sleep-wake amplitude during the 48h 2hOnOff experiment, during recovery amplitude was restored to baseline levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In lines 290 to 294, the authors concluded that the prediction from the model, the behavioral rhythm reduction reduces PER2 bioluminescence amplitude, which is consistent with their observation in the Figure 3. However, this conclusion could be difficult to understand because the 2hOnOff protocol increases the PER2 bioluminescence amplitude in one-third of mice (there may be no significant change between BSL and the 2hOnOff protocol; see Figure 3C). The authors provided an additional model (Suppl. Figure 7A-C) to explain the individual difference, and thus the reviewer suggests the authors to describe that conclusion after the modeling part to make the logic clearer.</p><p>5. Regarding Suppl. Figure 7A-C, the authors described the increase in PER2 amplitude during the 2hOnOff experiment by advancing the phase of FPERI more than 2.5h. The reviewer suggests that the authors could mention these results in Results or Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>At the group level the reduction in PER2 amplitude during the 2hOnOff protocol did not reach significance, as was clearly stated in the Results section and figure legend. Yet, when inspecting the individual responses, we found an interesting pattern suggesting that the 2hOnOff protocol did affect PER2 amplitude albeit in opposite direction for individual mice (Lines 251-261). With the analysis presented in Suppl. Figure 7A-C (now Figure 4 —figure supplement 2A-C), we did not introduce an additional model to explain this phenomenon. Instead, we used the same model as proposed earlier, but instead of letting the model determine a single (optimal) phase of the circadian force, we systematically varied it to predict the resulting effects on PER2 amplitude. We described the rational and results of this <italic>in silico</italic> experiment in the Results section after the modeling part (Lines 386-410). To enhance clarity, we have now commented after line 256 (now Lines 260-263) on the results of the modelling section, stating that variation in circadian phase could underlie the differential individual response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Hoekstra et al. investigated the relationship between sleep state and PER2::LUC luminescence in freely behaving mice and showed that luminescence acutely changed at sleep/wake transitions. The authors also showed that daily sleep deprivation enhanced the PER2::LUC luminescence rhythm amplitude in SCN ablated mice.</p><p>A strength of this study is the simultaneous recording of EEG/EMG/activity and PER2::LUC luminescence in freely moving mice.</p><p>Weakness: One obvious concern is that acute PER2::LUC luminescence changes occurring at sleep/wake transitions are artifacts (e.g. due to acute change in core body temperature), but not caused by synthesis/degradation of PER2 protein. Because those luminescence changes are relatively large and fast (30-40% change within 30 min), a conventional method may be used for validation. The authors recorded activity and bioluminescence from non-circadian luminescence reporter mice (CAG -luc). Alternatively, the authors can analyze that data and exclude artifact possibility if luminescence change doesn't occur at active/inactive transitions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion. With the reviewer we would have preferred to use a conventional method for confirmation but as explained in our answer to the first comment of Reviewer 1 this is unfortunately less straightforward as it might seem.</p><p>Following your suggestion, we analyzed bioluminescence dynamics at the onset of activity bouts in the CAG-Luc mice. As you can see in and the new Figure 1 —figure supplement 5, activity bouts in CAG-Luc mice are accompanied by robust increases in bioluminescence, even larger in amplitude than those observed in <italic>PER2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> mice. This result is consistent with the CMV major-immediate early enhancer/promotor, which is part of the CAG synthetic promotor driving luciferase, being rapidly activated by large number of transcription factors such as NF-κB, CREB/ATF, and AP-1 (see review by Stinski and Isomura Med Microbiol Immunol 2008; doi: 10.1007/s00430-007-0069-7), a response comparable to that of an immediate early response such as c-FOS (see e.g. Brightwell <italic>et al.</italic> Gene 1997; doi: 10.1016/S0378-1119(97)00178-9 and Collaco and Geusz BMC Physiol. 2003; doi: 10.1186/1472-6793-3-8).</p><p>We used the CAG-Luc mice to verify the effect of the route of luciferin administration on circadian bioluminescence dynamics because we expected this synthetic promotor not to be regulated in a circadian fashion (which we confirmed). We did, however, not chose this mouse line to rule out that PER2bioluminescence changes at sleep-wake transitions are artefacts, an issue that was raised during the review process. After discussing this issue with Prof. David Gatfield, a colleague at my institute studying circadian aspects of translation, he shared some of his recordings with other luciferase-reporter constructs using the same set-up (i.e., osmotic mini-pumps delivering luciferin and the RT-biolumicorder system recording bioluminescence). We recorded bioluminescence in mice expressing luciferase under the control of the promotor of the housekeeping gene <italic>Pgk1</italic> (<italic>Pkg1-Luc</italic> mice). As expected of a housekeeping gene, overall bioluminescence levels do not consistently vary during the recording and no activity-bout related changes were observed (Figure 1 —figure supplement 5). These recordings demonstrate that the increases in PER2 bioluminescence we observed at sleep-wake transitions are not an artifact of the sleep-wake transition as similar activity-related increases should have been observed for all 3 constructs. We have added the <italic>Pgk1-Luc</italic> results together with the CAG-Luc results to the Results section (Lines 177-182) and added a new supplementary figure (Figure 1 —figure supplement 5). For details on the <italic>Pgk1-Luc</italic> mice see Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is the PER2::LUC luminescence measurement from the brain. The authors must show IVIS imaging and show the signal coming from the brain and not from other tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment the reviewer suggested in a previous publication using IVIS imaging (Curie <italic>et al.</italic> Sleep; 2015 doi: 10.5665/sleep.4974). As described in the Results section these experiments were performed in C57BL6/J mice with pigmented pelage absorbing emitted photos. In addition, the substrate luciferin was administrated only centrally and the by far largest (i.e., only) source of photons in this setup is the glass cone directly mounted on top of the skull over the left cortical hemisphere. Moreover, in the same publication in situ immune-histofluorescence indicated the cerebral cortex as the main source of the almost 2-fold increase in brain bioluminescence after a 6h sleep deprivation.

In the manuscript we made no statements on the two substates of sleep (REM sleep and NREM sleep), and their respective possible effects on PER2 bioluminescence. Moreover, adding separate tracks for REM sleep and NREM sleep will clutter the figure and might confuse the reader. We therefore prefer to keep the figure as is but we now give values of REM sleep and NREM sleep obtained in the recordings on which Figure 1B is based in the text (Lines 122-125) to assure the reader that NREM and REM sleep were expressed at expected quantities under the different recording conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C: To avoid confusion, it is better to use the same colors as in A and B (pink: peripheral, purple: central).</p></disp-quote><p>In this figure panel we now have used the same red and purple hues for peripheral and central transition data, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The authors should show individual records in the supplemental information.

As similar dynamics were observed at sleep-wake transitions in both cortex and kidney, we demonstrate that our observations go beyond the kidney and also beyond a mere correlation as PER2 bioluminescence consistently follows spontaneous as well as experimentally induced wakefulness in both tissues. Moreover, we were able to predict the brain dynamics of PER2 with the model parameters set for kidney (Lines 329-331), confirming that at least mathematically sleep-wake driven PER2 dynamics in kidney and cortex underlie similar (but not identical) rules.

Our work highlights the importance of the sleep-wake distribution when evaluating clock-gene rhythms in tissues peripheral to the SCN (including the cortex) in the mouse. Moreover, altered ‘arousal levels’ such as associated with a sleep deprivation (Vassalli and Franken, PNAS 2017; doi: 10.1073/pnas.1700983114) or with food-restriction conditions, which redistributes activity patterns (Damiola <italic>et al.</italic>, Gen Dev 2000; doi: 10.1101/gad.183500), does not affect clock-gene rhythms in the SCN in the mouse (see Discussion Lines 520-521). Therefore, at least under entrained conditions, the phase of clock-gene rhythms in the SCN remains locked to the light-dark cycle, while phase in tissues peripheral to the SCN (including the cortex) can be dissociated from that in SCN by e.g. an altered sleep-wake distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many previous studies have indicated that circadian phase in clock gene expression varies among peripheral organs and tissues, and it is therefore difficult to generalize the temporal correlation between single organ-derived bioluminescence and sleep-wake states to other peripheral and central clocks.

From the example in Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 it seems that the wake-related activation is strongest after consolidated bouts of sleep (i.e. rest phase), and weakest during the active phase, when the fewer and shorter periods of sleep do not appreciatively decrease the CAG-luc signal. Therefore, although CAG-luc bioluminescence increases after sleep-wake transitions, a circadian modulation in this response might explain the lack of a robust modulation of the average hourly bioluminescence levels. If examining the precise dynamics linking the bioluminescence signal of this synthetic promotor to the sleep-wake distribution is considered of interest by the scientific community, this should be addressed experimentally – however this clearly falls outside the scope of our PER2 work. We only invested in recording CAG-luc mice to assess which route of luciferin administration (drinking water <italic>versus</italic> osmotic mini-pumps) was best.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Without showing an absolute luminescence value emitted from the brain, liver, and kidney in the same mouse, it cannot be utterly said that the luminescence signal from the entire mouse is just coming from the cortex. Part of this concern is based on the fact that the Curie et al., 2015 work not only shows signals (in B6 mice) coming from the cortex, but also clear signals coming from the kidney/liver (as visualized with the IVIS signals, whereas the RT-Biolumicorder does not allow sorting those signals).</p></disp-quote><p>In the Curie <italic>et al.</italic> 2015 publication we indeed recorded bioluminescence in the brain, liver, and kidney of B6 mice. However, recording of peripheral and central signals has to be done in separate animals for two reasons. First, where luciferin is delivered (central <italic>versus</italic> peripheral) is key to where bioluminescence is detected, as luciferin does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (Bakhsheshian <italic>et al.</italic> PNAS 2013; PMID: 24297888). To further facilitate central detection of bioluminescence, a glass cone was directly mounted on a thinned skull allowing passage of photons generated by the underlying cortex. Second, the body of the B6 mice, the strain we used specifically to detect central PER2 bioluminescence, was not shaved, thereby preventing the release of photons. In B6 mice thus prepared (not shaved, a cannula to infuse luciferin centrally, and a glass cone placed over the cortex), the PER2-bioluminescence signal by and large represents photons emitted by the brain (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2). The tissue-specific PER2-bioluminescence dynamics observed after sleep deprivation, which were confirmed by western blot analyses and brain immune-histofluorescence, confirm that the bioluminescence originated from different sources. We now have further emphasized in the Results section the specific preparation of the animals used to record central PER2 bioluminescence (Lines 102-106), detailed the IVIS imaging experiment in the Methods (Lines: 681-686), and added to Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 the image of central bioluminescence detected with the IVIS setup, clearly showing that besides the head no other above-background signal could be detected from the animal.</p></body></sub-article></article>
