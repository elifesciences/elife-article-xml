We use functional imaging to demonstrate that lateral hypothalamic parvalbumin-positive (LH<sup>PV</sup>) glutamatergic neurons respond to acute thermal stimuli and a persistent inflammatory irritant. Moreover, their chemogenetic modulation alters both pain-related behavioral adaptations and the unpleasantness of a noxious stimulus. In two models of persistent pain, optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons or their ventrolateral periaqueductal gray area (vlPAG) axonal projections attenuates nociception, and neuroanatomical tracing reveals that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons preferentially target glutamatergic over GABAergic neurons in the vlPAG. By contrast, LH<sup>PV</sup> projections to the lateral habenula regulate aversion but not nociception. Finally, we find that LH<sup>PV</sup> activation evokes additive to synergistic antinociceptive interactions with morphine and restores morphine antinociception following the development of morphine tolerance. Our findings identify LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons as a lateral hypothalamic cell type involved in nociception and demonstrate their potential as a target for analgesia.</p></abstract><kwd-group

environmental stimuli is vital to an organism’s survival. Nociception facilitates survival via the detection of dangerous environmental stimuli, which organisms use to escape and avoid these threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolles and Fanselow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). However, maladaptive processes following injury or infection can cause the transition to chronic pain, a clinical condition with great economic burden that is not well-addressed by current therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Price et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grace et al., 2014</xref>). The widespread failure of preclinical pain therapies to translate to the clinic may be due to the historical focus on studying acute, pain-stimulated nocifensive behaviors in naive animals such as paw withdrawal to heat, which are not maladaptive and necessitate the examination of off-target effects like sedation in separate assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Negus et al., 2015</xref>). Rather than physical sensitization to painful stimuli, the more problematic components of chronic pain in humans are likely the loss of ability to perform standard daily life activities and development of comorbid depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asmundson and Katz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cleeland and Ryan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dworkin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Negus et al., 2006</xref>). As such, rodent studies searching for new analgesics have begun to investigate ethological behaviors like nesting that are suppressed by noxious stimulation (e.g., forgoing standard life activities) as well as the affective/emotional component of nociception with assays of noxious stimulus-induced aversion (e.g., comorbid depression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Negus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johansen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corder et al., 2019</xref>). Identifying specific brain pathways capable of managing these multiple components of chronic pain behavior and developing strategies for targeting them for translational use will advance the search for novel analgesics.</p><p>Decades ago, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) was identified as a brain region responsive to noxious stimuli that is capable of controlling pain-related behavioral responses and modulating neuronal activity in the periaqueductal gray area (PAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox and Valenstein, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lopez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dafny et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs and Melzack, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behbehani et al., 1988</xref>). Pharmacological experiments have implicated various neurotransmitters and receptors in the regulation of nociception by the LH-PAG pathway, including α<sub>1</sub>- and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors, cannabinoid 1 receptors (CNR1), hypocretin 2 receptors (HCRT2), tachykinin 1 receptors (TACR1; neurokinin 1 [NK1] receptor), and substance P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esmaeili et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holden and Naleway, 2001</xref>). However, characterizing the specific LH cell types associated with nociception or other behavioral processes has only recently been enabled by modern neurobiological approaches.</p><p>While the LH circuits controlling food intake and reward have received intense focus over the past several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qualls-Creekmore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Navarro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nieh et al., 2016</xref>), those governing nociception have been understudied by comparison. Thus, with its diverse array of neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>), uncovering genetically defined LH circuits that regulate pain behavior may bring forth novel therapeutic targets. We previously described a small population of fast-spiking glutamatergic LH neurons expressing parvalbumin (LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons) that forms functional excitatory synapses in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray area (vlPAG) and regulates acute thermal and chemical nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siemian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kisner et al., 2018</xref>). However, the broader therapeutic potential of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons and their specific targets within the vlPAG have not yet been fully assessed.</p><p>Using in vivo calcium imaging, we demonstrate that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons exhibit time-locked responses to acute hot or cold stimuli as well as increased activity following the administration of a persistent inflammatory irritant. Additionally, we show that chemogenetic modulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons alters not only reflexive nociceptive behaviors over a timescale of hours but also restores noxious stimulus-suppressed behavior and ameliorates noxious stimulus-associated negative affect. In models of persistent inflammatory or neuropathic pain, optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons or their axonal projections in the vlPAG attenuates nociception. Furthermore, neuroanatomical tracing using modified rabies virus revealed that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons preferentially target nociception-suppressing glutamatergic neurons over nociception-facilitating GABAergic neurons in the vlPAG. Interestingly, we observed that activation of an LH<sup>PV</sup> neuron pathway to the lateral habenula (LHb) can mediate aversion-like behavior but not nociception, suggesting pathway-specific behavioral effects of these neurons. Finally, we report that LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation evokes additive to synergistic antinociceptive interactions with morphine and restores morphine antinociception following the development of morphine tolerance. Our findings identify LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons as a lateral hypothalamic cell type intricately involved in nociception and demonstrate their potential as a novel target for analgesic treatment or for use in combination therapies with current analgesics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vivo functional imaging of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons</title><p>LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons bidirectionally modulate responses to acute noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siemian et al., 2019</xref>), but their activity in response to noxious stimuli in vivo has not yet been studied. To investigate this, we used the combination of in vivo endomicroscopy with a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) to measure intensity fluctuations of calcium-sensitive fluorophores as an indicator of neuronal activity in LH<sup>PV</sup> cells during behavior. First, we expressed a green fluorescent calcium indicator in LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons by injecting a Cre recombinase-dependent viral vector driving the expression of GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in the LH of <italic>Pvalb<sup>Cre</sup></italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>).

Interestingly, activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in LH<sup>PV</sup>:hM3D mice prior to acetic acid injection prevented the reductions in nesting behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, ‘CNO + acid’) as compared to tests without CNO and to LH<sup>PV</sup>:Ctrl mice. In contrast, no changes were observed in LH<sup>PV</sup>:hM4D mice. Thus, LH<sup>PV</sup> activation not only decreases noxious stimulus-evoked behavior but also restores behaviors normally suppressed by noxious stimulation.</p><p>Pain results not only in overt behavioral changes but also negative affect, as made evident by the high comorbidity between pain and mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asmundson and Katz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elman et al., 2013</xref>). We sought to determine the role of LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity on the affective, or emotional, component of a painful experience. For this, we used a place conditioning paradigm in which mice avoid a context paired with an aversive event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johansen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). After assessment of initial side preference of a two-chamber apparatus, we passively conditioned the mice by administering CNO (i.p.) with intra-plantar formalin to induce inflammation in the initially preferred side and CNO with intra-plantar saline in the initially less-preferred side. Mice were conditioned twice in each context on alternating days and then were given free access to both chambers during a post-test to assess changes in place preference. As expected, LH<sup>PV</sup>:Ctrl mice lost preference to the formalin-paired context as compared to pre-formalin preference levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). However, activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons during conditioning attenuated this loss of place preference, whereas inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons during conditioning permitted the loss of place preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Furthermore, the time spent paw licking in these sessions was bidirectionally affected by chemogenetic LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation or inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g, h</xref>). LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation decreased paw licking during the acute but not inflammatory phase, whereas inhibition increased paw licking in the inflammatory but not acute phase. Together, these results support a role for LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons both in pain behaviors and associated negative affect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons attenuates persistent inflammatory pain-associated behaviors</title><p>Since LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons ameliorated moderately long-lasting behavioral effects of pain, we next sought to determine whether they could also alter nociceptive thresholds in traditional models of persistent pain behavior.

Activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons was mildly aversive as mice spent significantly less time on the photostimulation-paired side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), suggesting that these neurons may play a role in reward- and aversion-like behaviors.

For example, the 1:1 ratio consisted of one unit of the morphine ED<sub>50</sub> (10.31 mg/kg) for every one unit of the CNO ED<sub>50</sub> (0.78 mg/kg).

We administered morphine (32 mg/kg, i.p.) twice per day for 3 days, which caused a significant decrease in morphine-induced antinociception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). On day 5, CNO (1 mg/kg) evoked a significant increase in PWL<sub>HP</sub> and restored morphine-induced antinociception as compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). We then treated these mice once per day over the following three days with a combination of 1 mg/kg CNO and 32 mg/kg morphine to assess the potential development of tolerance to this combination. However, no differences were observed on the day 9 test in LH<sup>PV</sup>:hM3D mice as compared to day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). Thus, activating LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons not only increases morphine potency acutely but also rescues morphine tolerance and may prevent subsequent tolerance development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The LH is an important site for numerous survival-critical processes such as sleep, feeding, and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnavion et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stuber and Wise, 2016</xref>). New technologies have enabled the identification of specific lateral hypothalamic populations associated with certain behaviors and the understanding of how the activity of such neurons drives behavior and relates to external factors. However, the cell types mediating many other LH-associated behaviors have received less attention. Nociception has historically been a less LH-prototypical process than one such as feeding, but LH circuits were nevertheless previously shown to respond to noxious stimuli, to control nociception, and to affect downstream circuits in the PAG, a critical brain region for pain regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox and Valenstein, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lopez et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dafny et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs and Melzack, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behbehani et al., 1988</xref>). Cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations showed that a small cluster of fast-spiking glutamatergic LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons projects to the vlPAG and modulates acute nociception in a μ-opioid-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siemian et al., 2019</xref>). However, much remained to be learned as to how LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons respond to noxious events and whether they could be targeted for therapies in scenarios outside of acute sensory stimulation.</p><p>One of the great challenges in understanding how dynamics in neuronal circuits control behavioral output is to determine when specific cell types are active, as well as the nature of the relationship between this activity and behavior. Although direct manipulations of neuronal activity followed by behavioral examination are important for understanding this relationship, measuring changes in the activity patterns of neurons in awake behaving mice provides information as to how this circuit functions in the absence of experimenter-driven input. Using functional imaging to measure calcium dynamics, we gained insight as to how the activity of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons correlates with nociception and show for the first time that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons exhibit an array of time-locked responses to acute noxious thermal events. The involvement of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in holding information related to noxious events is supported by the finding that the neuronal activity could be used to decode noxious from innocuous stimuli. LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity was also altered during formalin-induced inflammation. Formalin injection, which causes discrete phases of acute and inflammatory forms of pain behavior, into the hindpaw contralateral to the imaged LH hemisphere evoked increases in calcium transient frequencies that were more pronounced than those observed during injection of the paw ipsilateral to the imaged LH hemisphere, likely reflecting decussation of the nociceptive signal at the spinal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dafny et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoshida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamada et al., 2012</xref>). It is worthwhile to note the advantages of using a single-photon miniscope, which enables single-cell resolution of neuronal activity. Other methods such as fiber photometry would likely not have revealed the changes we observed in LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity to acute thermal stimuli, for which there were heterogeneous responses across neurons, as well as to formalin, which was reflected as an elevated rate of calcium transients that were asynchronous across neurons. Together, our functional imaging data suggest that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons may become active during noxious events to signal or suppress nociception in mice.</p><p>In chemogenetic experiments designed to assess the broader therapeutic potential of LH<sup>PV</sup> neuron manipulation in pain disorders, we found that these neurons can bidirectionally modulate thermal nociception over long timescales, and thus may represent potential targets for extended duration analgesia. Moreover, activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons significantly attenuated acetic acid-reduced nesting behavior, demonstrating that this manipulation not only decreases sensory pain but also permits the resumption of species-specific natural behaviors that are suppressed by noxious events. This model may be analogous to clinical interventions that allow patients undergoing chronic pain to resume daily activities such as exercising or performing occupational duties as opposed to removing pain at the expense of a reduced motivational capacity. We also observed that inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity in hM4D-expressing mice did not decrease nesting behavior in control tests, suggesting that inhibition of these neurons does not cause pain directly, but likely rather enhances sensitivity to noxious stimuli. In support of this, LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation reduced formalin-associated negative affective pain, whereas this was nearly enhanced by inhibiting LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons. Behavioral scoring showed that sensory pain behavior was also bidirectionally modulated in this experiment, suggesting that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons modulate both sensory and affective experiences.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons decreased both thermal and mechanical nociception following the induction of a commonly used inflammatory pain model. These effects were likely attributable to LH<sup>PV</sup> projections to the vlPAG as LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG activation decreased thermal and mechanical thresholds in neuropathic and inflammatory models. In contrast, projections of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons to the LHb regulated aversion as previously shown for the broader LH glutamatergic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stamatakis et al., 2016</xref>), but not nociception, suggesting that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons regulate different behavioral outputs via different downstream projection areas. While systemic CB1 or µ-opioid antagonism does not affect LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG activation-induced antinociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Siemian et al., 2019</xref>), the finding that sustained antinociception following extended LH<sup>PV</sup> somatic or LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG activation suggests that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons may co-release neuropeptides that interact with downstream receptors to attenuate nociception or that other efferent circuits for antinociception are recruited during such activation that may function to decrease nociception. Importantly, in conjunction with the functional imaging data, the increased sensitivity observed upon inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> somas or the LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG pathway suggests that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons may become active in response to a noxious stimulus to decrease its severity. It is important to briefly note that while a study found that sustained activation of archaerhodopsin evokes spontaneous synaptic release in ex vivo preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>), this phenomenon has not been observed during in vivo electrophysiological recordings or precluded the observation of behavioral effects in the direction associated with the loss of presynaptic input when using photoinhibition times equal to or longer than the ones we employed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rozeske et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are functionally connected to neuronal circuits within the vlPAG, the heterogeneous behavioral effects driven by the intermingled vlPAG neuronal populations made it challenging to draw a clear circuit map from LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons to behavior through the vlPAG pathway. For instance, activation of vlPAG glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons decreased and increased nociception, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samineni et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we used a retrograde monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy to identify the preferred post-synaptic vlPAG targets of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons. We found a higher proportion of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons labeled following uptake of RVdG-mCherry(EnvA) in vlPAG<sup>VGLUT2</sup> compared to vlPAG<sup>VGAT</sup> neurons, suggesting that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons may preferentially, yet not exclusively, target glutamatergic vlPAG neurons. In the context of previous work, excitatory input from LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons to vlPAG<sup>VGLUT2</sup> neurons would thus form a discrete antinociceptive pathway. However, experiments using techniques such as ChR2-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) from LH<sup>PV</sup>:ChR2+ axonal projections onto postsynaptic vlPAG neurons followed by single-cell RT-qPCR analysis will be needed to elucidate how LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons regulate vlPAG microcircuitry and how activation of this LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG pathway modulates nociceptive responses to noxious stimuli. The opposing behavioral outcomes during photostimulation of a GABAergic LH population, LH<sup>LEPR</sup> neurons, in the vlPAG further demonstrate the complex, heterogeneous nature of LH→PAG pathways and highlight the need for future circuit characterizations. Moreover, it is still unknown whether LH<sup>PV</sup> axonal projections to their target regions follow a one-to-one or one-to-many architecture. This is certainly an important question that has yet to be determined. However, our behavioral data suggest that these might be independent LH<sup>PV</sup> populations since we did not observe aversive-like effects during LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG stimulation or antinociception during LH<sup>PV</sup>→LHb stimulation. Furthermore, the LH<sup>PV</sup>→LHb data also demonstrate that the antinociception evoked by activating the LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG pathway was not due to antidromic stimulation effects. Future experiments will be needed to determine that these are indeed independent populations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons.</p><p>In a final series of experiments, we investigated the antinociceptive interactions between LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation and the μ-opioid receptor agonist morphine. For a novel analgesic therapy to be useful, it must meet one of these three criteria: (1) possess analgesic properties alone, (2) facilitate analgesic action of existing treatments, or (3) decrease unwanted effects of existing treatments to make them more suitable for extended use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Zhang, 2011</xref>). Our observation that LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation attenuates nociception suggests that this manipulation meets the first criterion. Therefore, our last experiments were designed to assess the remaining criteria. To address the second criterion, we performed a dose-addition analysis between morphine and LH<sup>PV</sup> DREADD receptor activation by CNO as a standard pharmacological agent. We found that, depending on the proportion of drugs in the mixture, LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation and morphine produced additive to synergistic interactions on thermal antinociception. The combination exhibiting the highest level of synergism required only a small stimulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity to greatly enhance morphine’s potency. Importantly, we included a group of control mice without hM3D receptors, in which CNO did not alter morphine’s potency. To address the third criterion above, we last investigated the effects of activating LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons following the development of tolerance to morphine-induced antinociception effect in the hot plate test. Here, chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons evoked significant antinociception in morphine-tolerant mice, and more importantly, significantly restored morphine-induced antinociception. Remarkably, similar antinociceptive effects were maintained through another period of concurrent LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation and morphine administration. Together, these findings show that LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation can synergistically enhance acute morphine antinociception and restore its antinociceptive effects following the development of tolerance. Thus, activation of these LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons could be used to reduce the effective antinociceptive dose of morphine, helping to attenuate unwanted side effects such as respiratory depression and slow the rate of morphine tolerance.</p><p>An important point warranting further discussion is the contrast between our observations of divergent clusters of response patterns in LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity during the hot and cold plate tests and the dominant behavioral phenotype of pain suppression when bulk activating these neurons. First, there is precedent to this contrast between diverse spontaneous activity patterns and more uniform behaviors driven by causal manipulations. For instance, LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons responded to food locations, appetitive, or consummatory behaviors in a heterogeneous manner by either increasing or decreasing in activity at each event, yet when these neurons were bulk activated, mice ate voraciously, and when these neurons were ablated, mice ate less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>). In the current study, we observed that most neurons identified as cluster 1 or 2 in the hot plate assay did not maintain the same designation in the cold plate assay, and vice versa. Therefore, it seems likely that, in general, the responses of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are either not consistent over time or dependent on the type of stimulus applied. For instance, some LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons may specifically suppress heat pain, others may suppress cold pain, others may suppress chemical pain, and so on. As such, we think that the bulk activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons with optogenetics or chemogenetics during stimulation with one specific noxious stimulus (e.g., heat) likely activates a stimulus-specific cluster of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons (heat) as well as the clusters specific for other stimuli (cold, chemical, mechanical, etc.) to evoke antinociception, as opposed to having populations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons that are exclusively pronociceptive or antinociceptive, the effects of which could be potentially diluted during bulk activation of these neurons. However, further work will be needed to elucidate how noxious stimuli are responded to and encoded by LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity.</p><p>Here, we provide a detailed characterization of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons, clearly demonstrating that these neurons modulate nociception through a distinct downstream circuit. Moreover, we measured and correlated LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity patterns during noxious events. Finally, we found that chemogenetic modulation of these neurons could potentially be used as a standalone analgesic therapy or in combination with current analgesics such as morphine. These results support the continued investigation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons as a target for novel analgesics and warrant new efforts to identify neuronal populations in humans for targeting in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus;</italic> male/female)</td><td><italic>Pvalb<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008069">IMSR_JAX:008069</ext-link></td><td>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus;</italic> male/female)</td><td><italic>Slc32a1<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:028862">IMSR_JAX:028862</ext-link></td><td>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus;</italic> male/female)</td><td><italic>Slc17a6<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:028863">IMSR_JAX:028863</ext-link></td><td>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus;</italic> male/female)</td><td><italic>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></italic></td><td>M.G.

LH<sup>PV</sup>:GCaMP6s mice underwent five imaging sessions (hot plate, cold plate, ipsilateral formalin, contralateral formalin, and no formalin). Before each imaging session, GRIN lenses were briefly cleaned with isopropanol and mice were gently restrained while the snap-in microscope was secured to the baseplate for alignment with the implanted GRIN lens. Mice were then given approximately 5 min to acclimate to the microscope and tether.

Principal component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the averaged traces while maintaining 99% of the variance. 80% of the resulting traces from each cluster of neurons (see above) were used to train an SVM classifier in MATLAB (built-in function) to distinguish between activity resulting from a neutral stimulus and a hot or cold plate stimulus. The resulting classifier was used to predict which stimulus generated the remaining traces, and the predictions were compared to the known stimuli labels to determine the accuracy of the classifier. This process was repeated 100 times with random subsets of training data to obtain a distribution of test accuracies. To determine the significance of the test accuracy distribution, the labels of the testing dataset were randomly shuffled 100 times. Each label permutation was compared to the predictions obtained from one of the previously trained classifiers to form a null distribution of chance accuracies.

The other chamber had a smooth white floor, walls decorated with white circles on a tan background, and orange scent. The front wall of each chamber remained clear, and sessions were recorded using video cameras aimed through this wall using ANY-maze software. Pilot experiments showed that mice consistently preferred the metal grid side at a rate of 60–70% per 15 min test.

When administered alone, CNO was tested across a dose range of 0.1–3.2 mg/kg, and morphine was tested across a dose range of 3.2–32 mg/kg. For combination tests, these dose-measurement cycles continued until near 100% maximal effect was achieved corresponding to the predetermined cutoff time of 20 s. Raw PWL<sub>HP</sub> values for CNO and morphine were transformed into percent maximum possible effect (%MPE) values according to the formula %MPE = [(post-drug PWL<sub>HP</sub> – pre-drug PWL<sub>HP</sub>) / (cutoff time – pre-drug PWL<sub>HP</sub>) × 100]. %MPEs were averaged within each group (± s.e.m.) and plotted as a function of dose. Log(ED<sub>50</sub>) values were determined from the %MPE dose-response curve via linear regression and averaged within the group to calculate the ED<sub>50</sub> (±95% confidence interval [CIs]) for each drug, except for CNO in the mCherry control group, which did not produce 50% effect levels. Morphine was obtained from the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program (PUBCHEM:5288826).</p><p>To examine the antinociceptive interactions between CNO and morphine, a fixed-proportion dose-addition analysis method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siemian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tallarida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Negus et al., 2009</xref>). For this analysis, CNO and morphine were combined in fixed proportions (1:1, 1:3, and 3:1) and administered using the cumulative dosing procedure as described. The actual doses of the drugs in the combination were determined by the relative potencies of each drug (based on the ED<sub>50</sub> values) in the LH<sup>PV</sup>:hM3D group. For example, the 1:1 ratio consisted of one unit of the morphine ED<sub>50</sub> (10.31 mg/kg) for every one unit of the CNO ED<sub>50</sub> (0.78 mg/kg). By this method, the 1:3 ratio contained 0.5 × ED<sub>50</sub> of morphine and 1.5 × ED<sub>50</sub> of CNO and the 3:1 ratio contained 1.5 × ED<sub>50</sub> of morphine and 0.5 × ED<sub>50</sub> of CNO. Fractions of these mixtures (the combined 0.125 ×, 0.25 ×, 0.5 ×, 1 ×, and 2 × ED<sub>50</sub> values of morphine and CNO) were administered consecutively by the cumulative dosing procedure to complete one dose-effect curve test. At least 1 week separated each test to avoid the development of tolerance and inter-test effects. Furthermore, a morphine-alone dose-response curve was taken 1 week after the last combination test, which showed that the morphine ED<sub>50</sub> had not significantly changed (mCherry mice first morphine ED<sub>50 </sub>10.51 mg/kg, second morphine ED<sub>50 </sub>10.26 mg/kg; hM3D mice first morphine ED<sub>50 </sub>10.31 mg/kg, second morphine ED<sub>50 </sub>10.45 mg/kg). The shared dose-response curves were used to calculate the ED<sub>50</sub> of each drug within each mixture. Isobolograms plotting the ED<sub>50</sub> values of each drug were constructed to visually represent the nature of the drug interactions as additive, infra-additive, or supra-additive (synergistic).</p><p>Dose-addition analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siemian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tallarida, 2000</xref>). When both drugs were active in an assay, expected additive ED<sub>50</sub> values (±95% CL) (Z<sub>add</sub>) were calculated from the equation Z<sub>add</sub> = <italic>fA</italic> + (1 − <italic>f</italic>)<italic>B</italic>, where <italic>A</italic> is the ED<sub>50</sub> of morphine alone, <italic>B</italic> is the ED<sub>50</sub> of CNO alone, and <italic>f</italic> is the fractional multiplier of <italic>A</italic> in the computation of the additive total dose (e.g., <italic>f</italic> = 0.5 when fixed ratio was 1:1). When only one drug was active (i.e., morphine in the mCherry control group), the hypothesis of additivity predicts that the inactive drug (i.e., CNO) should not contribute to the effects of the mixture, and the equation reduces to Z<sub>add</sub> = <italic>A</italic>/<italic>ρA</italic>, where <italic>ρA</italic> is the proportion of morphine in the total drug dose. Experimental ED<sub>50</sub> values (Z<sub>mix</sub>) were determined from the 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 combinations and were defined as the sum of the ED<sub>50</sub> values of both drugs in the combination.

After exposing the skull by a minor incision, a small hole (&lt;1 mm diameter) was drilled unilaterally for helper virus injection. 40 nl of Cre-dependent AAV8/hSyn-FLEX-TVA-Rabies B19G (TVA+) was injected unilaterally (rate: 10 nl/min; titer: 4 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml) into the vlPAG (bregma, −3.90 mm; midline, ±0.2 mm; skull surface, −3.20 mm) by a 25-gauge Hamilton syringe (500 nl). 3–4 weeks later, mice were injected with 100 nl of the recombinant rabies viral vector (EnvA-∆G-Rabies-mCherry; titer: 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> pfu/ml) at the same vlPAG coordinate. Both viruses were graciously provided by the Michigan Diabetes Research Center Molecular Genetics Core, University of Michigan. 3–4 weeks after the recombinant rabies virus injection, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 1× PBS followed by 4% <sc>PFA</sc> in 1× PBS. Whole brains were removed and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C and subsequently cryoprotected by equilibration in 30% sucrose in 1× PBS at 4°C, flash frozen in isopentane on dry ice, and stored at −80°C. Tissue was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc, Torrance, CA, USA) for cryosectioning. Coronal brain sections (50 µm thick) were collected in 1× PBS using a Leica CM3050 S cryostat (Leica Biosystems GmBH, Wetzlar, Germany). Sample size estimates were derived from a previous study using the same methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>For parvalbumin (PVALB) immunostaining, sections containing the hypothalamus were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 1× PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100% and 3% normal donkey serum.

Sections were mounted with Fluoromount-G aqueous mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences) onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (VWR International). Z-stacks (30 µm) containing the LH<sup>PV</sup> region were imaged with an LSM 700 microscope using a 20× air objective (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC). Maximum intensity projections were manually counted using Fiji v1.52p software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>) with the cell counter plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Sections were anatomically matched to ensure that the same regions were analyzed across samples. Additionally, sections containing the PAG were mounted as described, and images were taken with an AxioZoom.V16 fluorescence stereomicroscope using a 7× digital magnification to assess the injection site for mistargeted or lacking virus expression. After PAG assessment, one <italic>Slc32a1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and one <italic>Slc17a6<sup>Cre</sup></italic> sample was excluded from the analysis as viral expression was not observed in the vlPAG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Graphs and statistics for behavioral experiments were prepared with GraphPad Prism 8 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are plotted as mean ± s.e.m., except for Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency data and isobolograms, which are plotted as mean ± 95% CI, and cell counts, which are plotted in ‘part-of-whole’ format. Paired or unpaired Student’s two-tailed t-tests, one-way, two-way, or three-way mixed model ANOVAs with Bonferroni or Dunnett’s post-tests for multiple comparisons corrections were used to analyze all behavioral data, as appropriate. Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests with Holm–Sidak correction for multiple comparisons were used to analyze Ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency data from the formalin tests. A chi-square test was used to compare cell counts in the rabies tracing experiment. For all statistical tests, p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge with gratitude C Lupica for discussions and comments on the manuscript, MG Myers Jr for kindly providing the <italic>Lepr<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, BT Laing for performing SNI surgeries, T Larson for assistance with imaging, the NIDA IRP Histology Core, in particular L Shen and C Mejias-Aponte, for technical assistance with histology, and NIDA IRP Visual Media, in particular A Russell and L Brick, for brain slice drawings.

I commend the authors on the thorough characterization of their behaviors and detailed exploration of the optogenetic stimulation frequency space – which is largely missing in most papers. There are a number of technical questions that should be addressed to further strengthen the manuscript, and it is worth considering whether some of the data presented here would be better reserved for a future publication to make the present manuscript more focused on the main points outlined in the manuscript title.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. The imaging studies in figure 1 are intriguing and provide some very interesting insights – but the presentation raises a number of questions.</p><p>a. Overall – the data show that there are LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons that seem to show increased activity to heat and cold, and some that show decreased activity. The authors call this cluster 1 and 2 respectively. This is interesting, and points to the importance of using the miniscope approach to get cellular level resolution, as it appears that simple fiber photometry may have shown no change in activity in response to these stimuli. This should be highlighted.</p><p>b. Similar trends are seen for hot plate and cold plate. If you look at the single cell level – are neurons that classify as cluster 1 for hot plate also in cluster 1 for cold plate? Presumably the same mice were tested for both assays. This is not clear.</p><p>c. The z scores show something rather interesting – there is clearly a period of suppressed activity in cluster 1 cells and increased activity in cluster 2 cells preceding contact with the plate. This is evident also in the &quot;control&quot; group. What do the authors think of this? The inclusion of the control groups here was absolutely critical, as it shows that there are indeed differences. Related – the post-hoc analysis states significant differences are illustrated by the bold line – but this is not easy to see. Am I correct in seeing that there is no significant differences in cluster 2 for the cold stimulus vs. control? The manuscript states significant differences, but the posthoc either does not support this or it is not clear from the bold shading of the line in Figure 1l.</p><p>d. The cluster 1 neurons are more prevalent, and the authors comment that the response magnitude is larger than those for cluster 2. This should be supported by statistical comparisons validating this claim.</p><p>e. For the formalin data – given the results from the hot and cold plate, it is difficult to know how to interpret these findings. Were these cells recorded here specifically cluster 1 cells as determined from the hot and cold plate? Again- were these the same mice tested for hot and cold plate? An analysis of these data for formalin separately for neurons defined as cluster 1 and 2 for hot/cold would be much more informative than including all together.</p><p>f. The interpretation of formalin responses as &quot;long-term&quot; seems unwarranted. In fact, the response to formalin is ongoing. So – this would suggest sustained responses to ongoing nociception.</p><p>g. Related – it would be of interest to analyze the formalin data as Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients time-locked to nocifensive responses (flinching, lifting, licking). Did you collect videos of the mice that would allow this analysis? Are there also &quot;cluster 1&quot; and &quot;cluster 2&quot; type responses associated with flinching/licking?</p><p>2. The authors go on to study the impact of manipulating LH<sup>PV</sup> activity on behaviors, but sort of ignore the fact that there are these two populations of neurons with respect to activity in response to noxious stimulation. It is unfortunate that the interesting findings of the two different clusters of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons – one inhibited by noxious stimulation and one activated – is not built upon here – but is largely ignored. The subsequent studies go about activating or inhibiting all LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons to test their effects on sensory and affective aspects of pain. The challenge with this approach, based on the imaging data, is that there is a mixture of activity patterns in response to noxious stimuli. For example – heat responses. As you are targeting LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons globally – you will be hitting both cluster 1 and cluster 2 neurons. I know that it would be a huge task to sort out what is different about these two populations – but this caveat at least needs significant discussion. It would be very interesting to be able to determine what is different about the cluster 1 and cluster 2 neurons. This is not addressed here, and I think may be beyond the scope of this study. However – this should be discussed. Why are some neurons inhibited, some activated? Do these neurons have different projection targets?</p><p>3. Activating the LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons leads to reductions in responses to painful stimuli, and reversal of pain-suppressed behaviors. Given that the majority of these neurons are activated by painful stimuli, what does this mean for the role of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in pain? You allude to this briefly in the discussion, but this is the major question in my mind in terms of the major conclusions we can make from this nice study. Are LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons mediating endogenous analgesia during painful stimuli? If so, then this could be mediating a DNIC type response. It would be very interesting to know if you can elicit DNIC in mice, and block this by inhibiting these LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons.</p><p>4. The use of ArchT for photoinhibition of the LH<sup>PV</sup> → vlPAG terminals is problematic given reports that activation of Arch actually produces increases in spontaneous synaptic release at some terminals. It is imperative that the authors characterize the effects of Arch activation on synaptic transmission (evoked and spontaneous) at this synapse to allow interpretation of the findings.</p><p>5. The results re: the projections to the LHb are also very interesting. Are the neurons that project to the LHb and vlPAG distinct, or do individual neurons send process to both LHb and vlPAG? A double retrograde tracing experiment would expand the scope of what we learn here significantly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a thorough, multipronged study which supports a role for parvalbumin-positive neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-Pv+) in modulating the nocifensive and affective / motivational consequences of noxious stimulation and morphine suppression of the same. The authors provide evidence that both nocifensive and affective / motivational consequences are suppressed by activation of glutamatergic LH-PV+ neurons whereas activation of GABAergic LH projections (expressing the leptin receptor) result in place aversion.</p><p>Experiments also demonstrate that LH-PV+ activation combines in an additive and at one ratio in a synergistic manner with morphine and that activation of LH-PV+ neurons reverses tolerance to morphine.</p><p>The nociceptive-specific nature of the sensory responses is not convincing given that there is a comparison between stimulus and not-stimulus rather than between innocuous stimulus and noxious stimulus. The authors may argue that room temperature is a thermal stimulus and perhaps that is true, depending on the animal's skin temperature which was not measured. But a better comparison would be between a 45C or so stimulus and the 51C used. I am not suggesting that the authors add such expts rather I recommend a more careful interpretation of the data collected. This concern is strengthened by the response to ipsilateral formalin which raises the issue of whether the &quot;responses&quot; may be in fact correlates of efferent function involved in autonomic or state arousal. Yet, the remaining experiments mitigate this concern.</p><p>In pairing the (idiosyncratically) preferred side with CNO-inhibition, the preference for either side goes to 50%. Thus inhibition of LH-PV+ neurons takes away side preference but does NOT produce side avoidance as is stated in lines 153-54.</p><p>Please jog the gray symbols in Figure 4 supp 1, 2 laterally so they can be seen.</p><p>The LH-PV+ preference for vglut2 over vgat PAG neurons is by less than a factor of 3. Given what we know about the unimportance of absolute numbers of synapses in dictating the responses of lemniscal pathways in the thalamus, this result is interesting but with this amount of information uninterpretable. Tone this down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Siemian and co-authors significantly expand upon their previous work (Siemian et al., 2019) examining the role of parvalbumin-positive glutamatergic neurons in the LH (LH<sup>PV</sup>), and their projections to the vlPAG, in the modulation of pain responses. In their previous work, the authors showed that optogenetic activation or inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons suppresses or potentiates, respectively, responses to a noxious thermal stimulus and that this effect may be mediated by an excitatory projection to the vlPAG. The current manuscript is exciting in that it describes a much more detailed investigation of this circuit, using in vivo activity monitoring and manipulation (both chemo- and optogenetic) in multiple models of pain and pain-related behavior (both acute and chronic) as well as a neuroanatomical elucidation of this circuitry. Overall, this work uses a wide-spectrum of modern tools to address the circuit-basis of LH<sup>PV</sup> modulation of pain states and pain-associated behavior. This well-executed work contributes to filling a significant gap in our understanding of the role of LH neurons in modulating pain responses and pain behavior.</p><p>In their current work, the authors start by observing in vivo calcium signals with single cell resolution using GRIN-lens endomicroscopy of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in PV-cre mice in several pain assays. They found that a subset of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons were activated by an acute thermal stimulus (hotplate), a much smaller subset were inhibited and large proportion did not respond. In another set of experiments, a subset of neurons were found to be activated by an acute noxious cold stimulus (coldplate), a small subset were inhibited and large proportion did not respond. They also found that some LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons responded to formalin injection over longer time-scales. These experiments successful provide solid evidence that at least a subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons respond to noxious stimuli which is a key finding. Less clear is how the heterogeneity observed in these responses may be linked to the circuit manipulations in the subsequent experiments, which engage the whole population of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons, and how specific LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are in modulating pain pathways.</p><p>In the next series of experiments, the authors manipulate LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons using chemogenetic and optogenetic methods in PV-cre mice, in a variety of standard pain assays. They first found that chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons suppressed pain responses, while inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons potentiated pain responses (increases and decreases in thermal pain thresholds respectively). In an interesting assay of homecage behavior, they further found that chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons prevented a pain-associated reduction in both nesting behavior and place aversion, which strengthens the argument that activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons is antinociceptive and seems to diminish pain-associated aversion. Finally, optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons appeared to diminish thermal and inflammatory pain, consistent with their chemogenetic results. However, optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons also produced mild place avoidance in an RTPP assay, somewhat at odds with their chemogenetic results. Overall, the chemo and optogenetic manipulation experiments succeeded in showing that activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons has antinociceptive effects.</p><p>Next, the authors significantly extended their previous work by further probing the role of LH<sup>PV</sup> projections to both the vlPAG and LHb. Optogenetic stimulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> inputs to the vlPAG increased both acute thermal pain and more chronic neuropathic pain thresholds while inhibition decreased it, consistent with direct somatic manipulations. Interestingly, these manipulations did not appear to affect place preference leading to their examination of LH<sup>PV</sup> projections to the LHb, activation of which was aversive, consistent with previous work showing that the broader population of LH-VGLUT2 to LHb pathway is aversive. To address whether excitatory or inhibitory vlPAG populations may be targeted by LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons, the authors used rabies tracing and found that although a very small percentage of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons appeared to innervate the vlPAG, a greater proportion of excitatory than inhibitory neurons were targeted. Finally, the authors found that LH<sup>PV</sup>-induced antinociception enhanced and morphine-induced antinociception and rescues morphine tolerance.</p><p>Overall these data are novel and suggest that even a very tiny cluster of LH neurons has a rather outsized role to play in pain modulation. These findings would contribute to our limited understanding of both the role of hypothalamic circuits in pain modulation and the intersection of reward, aversion and pain.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>– Although the in vivo GRIN lens experiments provide evidence that a subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons respond to noxious stimuli, there's less clarity on the following questions:</p><p>1. Does the subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons activated by noxious thermal stimulation overlap with the subpopulation of neurons activated by noxious cold stimulation, ie is a specific subset of these neurons broadly tuned to respond to noxious thermal and cold stimuli or are they separate? The authors could provide more clarity on whether the cold/hot assays were done in the same animals and if not, provide some commentary on this question.</p><p>2. What is the degree of inter-animal variability in the data? Did some animals contribute more or less to the population(s) that responded to thermal/cold stimuli?</p><p>3. Given that only a relatively small subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are activated by noxious stimuli, with another subpopulation inhibited, how does one interpret the chemo- and optogenetic data in which all LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are either activated or inhibited? This should be addressed as a caveat in the discussion.</p><p>– The rabies tracing experiment is well-done and informative but is a somewhat indirect way of showing preferential innervation of different vlPAG populations. Directly addressing this is a technically difficult problem and perhaps the subject of a follow-up study but a discussion of the caveats would be helpful. One possible caveat in this experiment is that, for the sake of argument, a simply larger population of excitatory vlPAG neurons may skew the representation of retrogradely-labeled LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons despite perhaps an equal rate of connectivity with excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p><p>– Another outstanding question is whether the same population of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are innervating both the vlPAG (antinociception) and the LHb (aversion) or if they are entirely different subpopulations. One way of approaching this experimentally is to inject two different conjugated CTBs, one in the vlPAG and the other in the LHb to determine if retrogradely-labeled LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons overlap or not. If this experiment is not possible, addressing this in the discussion would be helpful.</p><p>– In the Discussion, the authors refer to LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons as a whole in the context of pain modulation when their data actually implicates only a comparatively small subpopulation of these neurons in modulating pain responses, evidenced by their in vivo monitoring and rabies tracing. This language should be adjusted in the discussion given that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are clearly not functionally monolithic. Furthermore, a short discussion of any known heterogeneity among LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons would be useful here.</p><p>– Finally, in terms of the writing, the manuscript is overall quite well-written.</p><p>However, the introduction could be improved. The authors start with a general description of pain and pain behavior and quickly transition to the role of the lateral hypothalamus in pain. It would be useful to make that transition more fluid and more detailed given that this is rationale for studying these cells in the context of pain. This could be accomplished by a more general description of the LH and how the repertoire of behaviors associated with the LH are relevant to pain responses. For example, the section of text: &quot;While the LH circuits controlling food intake and reward have received intense focus over the past several years, those governing nociception have gone understudied by comparison. Thus, with its diverse array of neuronal populations, uncovering genetically defined LH circuits that regulate pain may bring forth a novel therapeutic target&quot; should be expanded upon somewhat and include some key references. At the moment, there are no references here.</p><p>– Also, the description of the role of the LH in pain in the introduction is sparse and should include a slightly more detailed description of the literature with key references. This can be included either as part of the introduction or in the discussion. Also, there are some key references missing here. An example includes a set of papers describing a role for an LH substance P projection to the PAG in mediating antinociception (Holden and Naleway, 2001; Holden et al., 2002; Pizzi and Holden, 2008; Pizzi et al., 2009)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>The miniscope calcium imaging data are excellent. For all imaging studies, summary statistics on which cells or how many cells are from which specific animal should be graphically shown somewhere. From the current display one cannot tell if the active and inhibited cells are from just one animal or are observed in all animals. It would beneficial to see several &quot;per animal&quot; metrics, i.e. showing the data in Figure 1 E and I not as a merge of all neurons across animals but for each individual mouse, as well as show the proportion of active and inhibited cells per subject.</p><p>1. The title states &quot;sensory and affective pain&quot;, which I read initially as the paper would present data on the dichotomy of the sensory and emotional qualities of pain perception, as originally defined by Melzack 1968. However, the assays used (primarily reflexive tests of hypersensitivity) measure only sensory aspects of behavior. In the text though (in comparison to the title), the authors use &quot;affect&quot; to refer to &quot;pain suppressed behaviors&quot; / &quot;pain induced co-morbidities&quot;, which I agree are partly captured by the nest building assay. The title to more accurately reflect the data, and remove &quot;affective pain&quot;.</p><p>2. The miniscope data find two Clusters of cell-types functionally defined by being active or inhibited to noxious stimuli. This result is nice. However, it is disconnected from the remainder of the data, and as currently presented is a very elaborate, but far superior, Fos-like experiment showing that some cells are active while others are not, but it is not clear how and to what function these cell-types contribute to results presented after Figure 1. To avoid a difficult and time-consuming miniscope experiment to image projection neurons to PAG vs. habenula, I suggest a tracing-topology study to link this data to the other very important and interesting results in Figure 6 on differential results seen in the LH projections to the PAG vs habenula. For example, injection of a retrograde-AAV-FlpO recombinase into the PAG (and in a separate cohort, injection into habenula) of Pv-Cre mice with a Cre-ON/Flp-On intersectional fluorophore into the hypothalamus plus a noxious stimulus to induce FOS in these cells. Several conclusions could be drawn to compliment the miniscope functional data and the behavioral data, namely 1) are there collateral projections from LH◊PAG that also project to the habenula; 2) what proportion of these projection cells are nociceptive (FOS+); 3) are there functionally distinct cell-types (e.g. Clusters 1 and 2) that preferentially send projections to PAG or habenula (i.e. Fluorphore+ and FOS+/FOS-). This type of minor experiment might also provide additional insight to understand the two activity Clusters and how the bulk optogenetic/chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>Pv</sup> vlPAG neurons is antinociceptive when this experimental design &quot;turns on&quot; the nociception-inhibited Cluster-2.</p><p>3. I would consider not referring to the 7-day timepoint post Spared Nerve Injury, a model of &quot;chronic neuropathic pain&quot;. This is still an acute surgical neuropathy model, whereas most &quot;chronic&quot; designations should be reserved for the 3+ week timepoint, at a minimum.</p><p>4. No axonal terminals can be seen in the image of Figure 4A nor Supp Figure 3. Are there other images from these mice illustrating that this projection connects with this more posterior portion of the vlPAG? The group's prior 2019 paper shows dense LH<sup>PV</sup> innervation of the very anterior PAG (superocularmotor region), in contrast to some fiber placements in this article, which are almost 1.0 mm apart. In addition to the new images to confirm axons under the fiber tracts, I would request that images and quantification be provided for LH-PV axon densities across the anterior-posterior axis of the PAG. This will also be very helpful for the reader to link the past work with the current manuscript, as well as make sense of the choice of A-P coordinates for the fibers (-4.0 and -4.8 [Leptin-Cre study]) and for the RABV tracing experiment (which was done at the anterior -3.8 coordinate which was also used in the 2019 paper). Alternatively, performing a patch-clamp experiment (as done by the group in the 2019 paper) of Vglut2 or Vgat PAG neurons in the posterior PAG would confirm this connection, since the provided images do not show any axons in this region.</p><p>5. Even though it was stated by the authors that it created some clutter, I would still suggest to show all individual dots and lines for behavior throughout the figures (perhaps make the lines 50% transparent)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5:</italic></p><p>In 2019 the Aponte lab (10.1038/s41598-019-48537-y) reported that a small cluster of lateral hypothalamic neurons that express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (LH-PV neurons) modulate nociception in mice. They showed that photostimulation of these neurons suppresses nociception to an acute, noxious thermal stimulus, and that photoinhibition potentiates thermal nociception. They also showed that these neurons form functional excitatory synapses on neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and that photostimulation of these axons mediates antinociception. Finally, they showed that the anti-nociceptive effect appears to occur independently of opioidergic mechanisms. Many of these findings are replicated here.</p><p>In the present study they add to these findings by demonstrating, with the use of calcium imaging from behaving mice, that the LH-PV neurons respond to noxious stimuli. They also demonstrate that projections of these neurons to vlPAG affect both sensory and affective aspects of pain, whereas projections to the habenula appear to affect only the affective/aversive components.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly supported by the data, but some detailed aspects could to be clarified (laid out below).</p><p>1. Some of the effects reported appear rather small, and some reported differences might be driven by outliers. For example, data in Figure 1 d,g,h,k,l represent changes smaller than 2 standard deviations, or less than one Z score. Data in Figure 4i suggest very small effects on paw withdrawal thresholds. A consideration of whether these small changes are functionally meaningful would be particularly useful. Differences depicted in data in Figure 1 o,p,q appear to driven by a small number of outliers; even if these data survive tests of statistical outliers, one wonders why the vast majority of experiments show no differences.</p><p>Related to this, it would be useful to know what criteria were used to ensure that parametric analyses are appropriate. It is not clear why, in some comparisons, both Bonferroni and Dunnett's multiple comparisons are used on the same datasets. And, depicting variances as confidence intervals, instead of SEM, will likely be more informative.</p><p>Sample sizes are quite small. Although a large number of neurons are depicted, they were collected from a small number (e.g. 3) mice. At the very least, showing data from individual mice (instead of pooling data from all mice) will help determine how reproducible the results are.</p><p>2.

For this, we performed cell registration across the five calcium imaging sessions (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We found 33 neurons detected in both the hotplate and coldplate sessions in which we examined time-locked responses. Of those 33 neurons, only 6 neurons remained in a particular cluster in both sessions (e.g., cluster 1 in both the coldplate and hotplate), and an additional 2 neurons switched to the opposite cluster. Therefore, it seems likely that, in general, the responses of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are either not consistent over time or dependent on the type of stimulus applied. As such, we think that the bulk activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons with optogenetics or chemogenetics likely activates more than the necessary number of them (hot responders + cold responders) to evoke uniform antinociception effects in a given assay, as opposed to having populations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons that are exclusively pronociceptive or antinociceptive, the effects of which could be potentially diluted during bulk activation of these neurons. We have added a narrative for these points in the Discussion section (Discussion, page 23 – 24, lines 459 – 476).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are there dual projections to PAG and LHab (if no data, then a thorough acknowledgment and discussion of this issue)?</p></disp-quote><p>It is still unknown whether LH<sup>PV</sup> axonal projections to their target regions follow a one-to-one or one-to-many architecture. This is certainly an important question that has yet to be determined. We thank the reviewers for suggesting various ways to address this point. However, these concerns seem to have mainly arisen from the assumption that certain LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons consistently comprise the cluster 1 or cluster 2 archetype. Our cell registration analysis now demonstrates that this is not the case. Furthermore, our behavioral data suggest that these might be independent populations since we did not observe aversive-like effects during LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG stimulation or antinociception during LH<sup>PV</sup>→LHb stimulation. Future experiments will be needed to firmly draw this conclusion, combined with elucidating the functional roles of each of these potentially independent populations. Of note, we have added some significant discussion regarding this issue (Discussion, page 21 – 22, lines 426 – 433).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Concerns over mixed effects of Arch on synaptic transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed acknowledge the findings of Mahn et al. 2016 on silencing thalamocortical synapses with archaerhodopsin (eArch3.0). This study is commonly cited to discourage the use of eArch3.0 at axonal projections. We are certainly aware of the biophysical limitations of optogenetic inhibition at terminals. However, during that study Mahn and colleagues concluded that halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) is the most suitable tool for silencing synaptic terminals even though eNpHR3.0 also shows strong light-off rebound responses. Thus, when outlining our experiments, we checked whether other rigorous studies in the hypothalamus and other brain regions used eArch3.0 as silencer. For example, Jennings et al., 2013 used eArch3.0 to inhibit BNST<sup>VGAT</sup> neurons projecting to the lateral hypothalamus. While their validation experiments tested 5 s photoinhibition, the behavioral experiments used 10 min of constant photoinhibition. This robustly suppressed feeding behavior in food-deprived mice without affecting food intake during the light-off periods. Of note, their findings have been the precedent of many subsequent impactful primary research and review articles. Another remarkable example is a study showing the recordings of postsynaptic lateral/ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) neurons while photoinhibiting ArchT-expressing dmPFC terminals over a duration of 3 min (Rozeske et al., 2018). Please notice that this was the same duration of photoinhibition that we used in our present study. Additionally, Rozeske and colleagues observed a sustained reduction in l/vlPAG post-synaptic firing rates over the duration of photoinhibition in over half of the recorded neurons (probably due to some neurons that were not connected), and this finding is strengthened by the inclusion of a channelrhodopsin (ChR2) group which showed the opposite direction of effect. In further support, their behavioral experiments showed that photostimulation and photoinhibition of the mPFC to l/vlPAG pathway produced opposing effects in a contextual fear discrimination paradigm, whereby photostimulation and photoinhibition decreased and increased freezing behavior, respectively. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that archaerhodopsin activation at axonal terminals silences synaptic transmission and evokes the predicted overall inhibitory effect on neuronal circuits <italic>in vivo</italic> and during behavior.</p><p>Once more, we would like to emphasize the biophysical constraints of photoinhibition at terminals but also cite a few other points from our own findings. First, we demonstrated that archaerhodopsin works when used for LH<sup>PV</sup> somatic inhibition, both during electrophysiological and behavioral experiments (Siemian et al., 2019). Second, archaerhodopsin and channelrhodopsin manipulations evoked opposite behavioral effects when used in either LH<sup>PV</sup> somas or their axonal terminals in the vlPAG. Furthermore, these effects mirror what we observed during chemogenetic manipulations of these neurons. Together, we hope that the cited previous studies <italic>in vivo</italic> using archaerhodopsin at axonal terminals in combination with the consistency of our current behavioral findings are sufficient to ease concerns regarding this issue. We have added a discussion for this point and cited both studies Mahn et al. 2016 and Rozeske et al., 2018 to highlight our awareness of this issue (Discussion, page 20, lines 403 – 408).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Persistent over chronic is preferred for the time scales used here.</p><p>– Small sample sizes from low numbers of animals and small effects make the presentation of raw data points all the more desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions and understand their preference for displaying raw data points.

The imaging studies in figure 1 are intriguing and provide some very interesting insights – but the presentation raises a number of questions.</p><p>a. Overall – the data show that there are LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons that seem to show increased activity to heat and cold, and some that show decreased activity. The authors call this cluster 1 and 2 respectively. This is interesting, and points to the importance of using the miniscope approach to get cellular level resolution, as it appears that simple fiber photometry may have shown no change in activity in response to these stimuli. This should be highlighted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a narrative in the Discussion section to emphasize the advantage of using a single-photon miniscope, which enables single-cell resolution analysis (Discussion, page 19, lines 366 – 371).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Similar trends are seen for hot plate and cold plate. If you look at the single cell level – are neurons that classify as cluster 1 for hot plate also in cluster 1 for cold plate? Presumably the same mice were tested for both assays. This is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this ambiguity. The same three mice were indeed used for both assays. Per request, we used the CellReg pipeline to register cells across sessions. While a fair number of the same cells overall were detected during the hotplate and coldplate tests (<italic>n</italic> = 33), only 6 neurons remained in the same cluster between both sessions. We also observed 2 additional neurons that flipped from cluster 1 in the hotplate test to cluster 2 in the coldplate test. Thus, it appears that largely different populations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are modulated by hot and cold noxious stimuli. This information has been added together with mouse-by-mouse breakdown data in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The z scores show something rather interesting – there is clearly a period of suppressed activity in cluster 1 cells and increased activity in cluster 2 cells preceding contact with the plate. This is evident also in the &quot;control&quot; group. What do the authors think of this? The inclusion of the control groups here was absolutely critical, as it shows that there are indeed differences. Related – the post-hoc analysis states significant differences are illustrated by the bold line – but this is not easy to see. Am I correct in seeing that there is no significant differences in cluster 2 for the cold stimulus vs. control? The manuscript states significant differences, but the posthoc either does not support this or it is not clear from the bold shading of the line in Figure 1l.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the suppressed or increased activity preceding contact with the surfaces may be related to the nature of the Z-score calculation. What we show in the figures is the Z-score extracted from the entire session-long trace of these neurons, averaged across trials to create the peri-stimulus trace. A neuron that greatly increases in activity in confined epochs throughout the test (e.g., when contacting the hotplate) will by rule lower its resting Z-score baseline into negative values. The opposite would be true for neurons that presumably have some baseline amount of activity and pause for confined epochs during the test; the resting Z-score will be pushed into positive values. A resting Z-score of zero would indicate a neuron that either did not have much of a dynamic range during that session or had relatively the same amount of increases and decreases in fluorescence throughout the session. It has become popular to normalize the pre-stimulus period to zero, but we chose not to do this here to depict the traces in a less-processed form. Z-scoring the extracted fluorescent traces was important to normalize responses across neurons (some brighter than others), but to re-zero the Z-score traces would cause the neurons that had a lower resting Z-score to be overweighted in the Z-score space.</p><p>Furthermore, the fact that these pre-stimulus phenomena occurred on control trials, but then increase/decrease to around 0 suggests that perhaps there was some expectation of the mice to feel something noxious upon contact with the surface. However, despite this increase from pre-stimulus to post-stimulus during control trials, the neurons do not increase/decrease their activity to the same degree as the noxious trials.</p><p>Addressing the significant differences illustrated by bold lines for cluster 2 in Figure 1l—we apologize for this oversight as we realized that the bold segments were not shown on the submitted version of this figure. We corrected the panel in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The cluster 1 neurons are more prevalent, and the authors comment that the response magnitude is larger than those for cluster 2. This should be supported by statistical comparisons validating this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s interest in these data. After rereading our discussion on the response magnitude of each cluster, we realized that our discussion was more appropriate for the initially submitted version of this figure. For that previous version we used unsupervised k-means clustering instead of the thresholding method used in the full submission that was sent to reviewers. Since inclusion into cluster 1 or cluster 2 was defined at thresholds at equivalent absolute values on either side of 0 (e.g., ± 1 Z-score), this causes the magnitude of the clusters to be very similar. Thus, we have removed the section of the sentence comparing the magnitudes between clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. For the formalin data – given the results from the hot and cold plate, it is difficult to know how to interpret these findings. Were these cells recorded here specifically cluster 1 cells as determined from the hot and cold plate? Again, were these the same mice tested for hot and cold plate? An analysis of these data for formalin separately for neurons defined as cluster 1 and 2 for hot/cold would be much more informative than including all together.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this ambiguity. The same three mice were used for the hotplate, coldplate, and formalin tests. The neurons reported for the formalin test are all recorded neurons, not specifically cluster 1 or 2 as determined from the hot and cold plate experiments. As stated above we found only 6 neurons that consistently classified as cluster 1 or 2 across the hot and cold plate tests, suggesting that the responses of these neurons are either dependent on the noxious stimulus or variable over time.</p><p>That being said, when we performed CellReg analysis within each mouse across all five tests (i.e., hotplate, coldplate, contralateral formalin, ipsilateral formalin, no injection) we found that neurons were predominantly only detected in 1 session, and that only 1 neuron was detected in all 5 sessions (please see the pie chart in panel g of Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). Thus, our current data again suggest that the neuronal responses are either (a) determined on an individual basis according to the stimulus, (b) variable across time due to GCaMP-expressing cell turnover, or (c) that some combination of these factors occurred. In any case, our current data do not suggest that these neurons can consistently be labeled as “cluster 1” or “cluster 2” in one test and expect similar phenotypes in a different test. Future work should examine the responses to multiple different noxious stimuli within the same test, which would help to decrease the impact of cell turnover and determine whether different neurons in fact do respond to different types of stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. The interpretation of formalin responses as &quot;long-term&quot; seems unwarranted. In fact, the response to formalin is ongoing. So – this would suggest sustained responses to ongoing nociception.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to phrasing on this section. We have changed the Results section to remove “long-term” (page 7, lines 122 – 123) and instead indicate that the neuronal activity changes by an ongoing stimulus (page 8, line 138).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. Related – it would be of interest to analyze the formalin data as Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients time-locked to nocifensive responses (flinching, lifting, licking). Did you collect videos of the mice that would allow this analysis? Are there also &quot;cluster 1&quot; and &quot;cluster 2&quot; type responses associated with flinching/licking?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a great suggestion. We recorded the contralateral formalin behavioral sessions from two out of the three mice presented here. However, we did not proceed with undertaking the suggested type of analysis since the weight of the miniscope appeared to burden the neck muscles of the mice over the duration of the 45 min formalin test. During the first few minutes of the experiment the mice licked their paws as normal untethered mice do. However, they soon began to take breaks to rest their heads, during which time they did not lick their paws or otherwise perform standard formalin-associated behaviors. As such, we did not think that these behavioral events accurately represented the level of chemical irritation the mice were experiencing. For this reason, we simplified this analysis and binned the activity into the well-defined acute/interphase/inflammatory epochs.</p><p>For the sake of speculation, it seems fair to assume that at least some neurons would show time-locked responses. However, even in the hot/cold plate tests, the main increase in activity occurs upon contact with the surface, not necessarily upon paw withdrawal. As such, LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity may precede bouts of licking/flinching at times when the mouse is sensing the buildup of irritation but not yet performing the behavior. Interestingly, these would likely ‘look’ more like cluster 2 neurons when time-locked to the actual behavior, as the fluorescence would be lower post-behavior than pre-behavior. In future work we plan to optimize these types of assays for finer-grained integration of neuronal activity and spontaneous behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors go on to study the impact of manipulating LH<sup>PV</sup> activity on behaviors, but sort of ignore the fact that there are these two populations of neurons with respect to activity in response to noxious stimulation. It is unfortunate that the interesting findings of the two different clusters of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons – one inhibited by noxious stimulation and one activated – is not built upon here – but is largely ignored. The subsequent studies go about activating or inhibiting all LHPV neurons to test their effects on sensory and affective aspects of pain. The challenge with this approach, based on the imaging data, is that there is a mixture of activity patterns in response to noxious stimuli. For example – heat responses. As you are targeting LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons globally – you will be hitting both cluster 1 and cluster 2 neurons. I know that it would be a huge task to sort out what is different about these two populations – but this caveat at least needs significant discussion. It would be very interesting to be able to determine what is different about the cluster 1 and cluster 2 neurons. This is not addressed here, and I think may be beyond the scope of this study. However – this should be discussed. Why are some neurons inhibited, some activated? Do these neurons have different projection targets?</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize this important point and greatly appreciate the reviewer’s understanding of the challenges to dissect the differences between these two populations. Moreover, we agree that presently, this is beyond the scope of our current study. However, we would like to acknowledge that there is some precedent for observing heterogeneity (increasing/decreasing cells) upon single-cell calcium imaging, but a singular dominant behavioral phenotype driven by bulk activation of all neurons. For example, Jennings et al., 2015 showed that LH<sup>GABA</sup> neurons respond to food locations in a heterogeneous manner by either increasing or decreasing in activity (Figure 5), and further that while the neurons typically increase in activity during appetitive or consummatory behaviors (Figure 6), sizable populations were found decreasing in activity during such behaviors (Figure S7). Yet, when these neurons are bulk activated, mice eat voraciously (Figure 1-2) and when the neurons are ablated, mice eat less (Figure 3).</p><p>In the context of our study, we agree that it would be great to further subdivide our manipulations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons on the basis of the cluster 1 and 2 responses. However, our analysis included with this revision in fact found that the recorded LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons did not consistently remain in cluster 1 or 2 across the hot and coldplate tests, suggesting that their responses are either dependent upon the noxious stimulus or otherwise somewhat variable on an individual basis across testing. Nevertheless, future work using the same noxious stimuli over multiple sessions may indeed identify constant neurons that classify as cluster 1 or 2. In the event that neurons could be distinguished based on consistent response properties, then as stated, it would require several experiments to determine whether those would be identifiable on the basis of projection field, gene expression, tonic activity patterns, or some other factor, with the caveat that the distinguishing factor would enable us to selectively target one or both clusters for manipulation of neuronal activity using optogenetics or chemogenetics. Moreover, the small number of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons and their restricted location within the most lateral part of the lateral hypothalamus makes such “functional dissection” endeavors more challenging than for larger, more broadly distributed, and more overtly heterogeneous neuronal populations. However, we agree that this will be an important question to address in future work. Using retrograde Cre-dependent GCaMP from different output regions to record projection-specific LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons is one method that comes to mind to elucidate whether these clusters can be segregated based on projection. We have added some additional discussion to take this single cell heterogeneity versus bulk manipulation conflict more into account (Discussion, page 23, lines 459 – 476).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Activating the LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons leads to reductions in responses to painful stimuli, and reversal of pain-suppressed behaviors. Given that the majority of these neurons are activated by painful stimuli, what does this mean for the role of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in pain? You allude to this briefly in the discussion, but this is the major question in my mind in terms of the major conclusions we can make from this nice study. Are LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons mediating endogenous analgesia during painful stimuli? If so, then this could be mediating a DNIC type response. It would be very interesting to know if you can elicit DNIC in mice, and block this by inhibiting these LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Our current impression is that LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons, at least those in cluster 1, become active in response to pain, thus temporarily inhibiting it. When this ability is lost, mice become more sensitive to pain, whereas when this is bolstered, mice become less sensitive to pain. Thus, we would speculate that these neurons are a source of endogenous analgesia. It does not appear to quite be a DNIC response since activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons does not cause pain (see Results of nesting experiment) or cause robust place aversion (particularly during stimulation of axonal terminals in the vlPAG, which did reduce pain responses). However, future investigations of the role of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in the DNIC response could certainly be warranted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The use of ArchT for photoinhibition of the LH<sup>PV</sup> → vlPAG terminals is problematic given reports that activation of Arch actually produces increases in spontaneous synaptic release at some terminals. It is imperative that the authors characterize the effects of Arch activation on synaptic transmission (evoked and spontaneous) at this synapse to allow interpretation of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed acknowledge the findings of Mahn et al. 2016 on silencing thalamocortical synapses with archaerhodopsin (eArch3.0). This study is commonly cited to discourage the use of eArch3.0 at axonal projections. We are certainly aware of the biophysical limitations of optogenetic inhibition at terminals. However, during that study Mahn and colleagues concluded that halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) is the most suitable tool for silencing synaptic terminals even though eNpHR3.0 also shows strong light-off rebound responses. Thus, when outlining our experiments, we checked whether other rigorous studies in the hypothalamus and other brain regions used eArch3.0 as silencer. For example, Jennings et al., 2013 used eArch3.0 to inhibit BNST<sup>VGAT</sup> neurons projecting to the lateral hypothalamus. While their validation experiments tested 5 s photoinhibition, the behavioral experiments used 10 min of constant photoinhibition. This robustly suppressed feeding behavior in food-deprived mice without affecting food intake during the light-off periods. Of note, their findings have been the precedent of many subsequent impactful primary research and review articles. Another remarkable example is a study showing the recordings of postsynaptic lateral/ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) neurons while photoinhibiting ArchT-expressing dmPFC terminals over a duration of 3 min (Rozeske et al., 2018). Please notice that this was the same duration of photoinhibition that we used in our present study. Additionally, Rozeske and colleagues observed a sustained reduction in l/vlPAG post-synaptic firing rates over the duration of photoinhibition in over half of the recorded neurons (probably due to some neurons that were not connected), and this finding is strengthened by the inclusion of a channelrhodopsin (ChR2) group which showed the opposite direction of effect. In further support, their behavioral experiments showed that photostimulation and photoinhibition of the mPFC to l/vlPAG pathway produced opposing effects in a contextual fear discrimination paradigm, whereby photostimulation and photoinhibition decreased and increased freezing behavior, respectively. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that archaerhodopsin activation at axonal terminals silences synaptic transmission and evokes the predicted overall inhibitory effect on neuronal circuits <italic>in vivo</italic> and during behavior.</p><p>Once more, we would like to emphasize the biophysical constraints of photoinhibition at terminals but also cite a few other points from our own findings. First, we demonstrated that archaerhodopsin works when used for LH<sup>PV</sup> somatic inhibition, both during electrophysiological and behavioral experiments (Siemian et al., 2019). Second, archaerhodopsin and channelrhodopsin manipulations evoked opposite behavioral effects when used in either LH<sup>PV</sup> somas or their axonal terminals in the vlPAG. Furthermore, these effects mirror what we observed during chemogenetic manipulations of these neurons. Together, we hope that the cited previous studies <italic>in vivo</italic> using archaerhodopsin at axonal terminals in combination with the consistency of our current behavioral findings are sufficient to ease concerns regarding this issue. We have added a discussion for this point and cited both studies Mahn et al. 2016 and Rozeske et al., 2018 to highlight our awareness of this issue (Discussion, page 20, lines 403 – 408).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The results re: the projections to the LHb are also very interesting. Are the neurons that project to the LHb and vlPAG distinct, or do individual neurons send process to both LHb and vlPAG? A double retrograde tracing experiment would expand the scope of what we learn here significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>It is still unknown whether LH<sup>PV</sup> axonal projections to their target regions follow a one-to-one or one-to-many architecture. This is certainly an important question that has yet to be determined. We thank the reviewer for suggesting a way to address this point. However, our behavioral data suggest that these might be independent populations since we did not observe aversive-like effects during LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG stimulation or antinociception during LH<sup>PV</sup>→LHb stimulation. Of note, our LH<sup>PV</sup>→LHb data also demonstrates that the anticonception evoked by activating the LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG pathway was not due to antidromic stimulation effects. Future experiments will be needed to determine that these are indeed independent populations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons.

But a better comparison would be between a 45C or so stimulus and the 51C used. I am not suggesting that the authors add such expts rather I recommend a more careful interpretation of the data collected.

Tone this down.</p></disp-quote><p>Determining how LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons regulate vlPAG microcircuitry is indeed a subject for our future studies. In our previous work and current study, we extensively discussed previous experiments in mice using selective chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in the vlPAG. Such work demonstrated that glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons play opposing roles in nociception and defensive behaviors (Samineni et al., 2017; Tovote et al., 2016). Thus, we would speculate that glutamatergic LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons modulate nociceptive processing by excitatory control of glutamatergic neurons in the vlPAG to attenuate nociception. Our findings that more vlPAG<sup>VGLUT2+</sup> neurons (15%) than vlPAG<sup>VGAT</sup> (7%) neurons are synaptically targeted by LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons further support this idea. Alternatively, LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons may function by activating inhibitory interneurons in the vlPAG that provide local inhibitory control of vlPAG<sup>VGAT</sup> neurons to suppress nociception. Future experiments will use techniques such as ChR2-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) from LH<sup>PV</sup>-ChR2<sup>+</sup> axonal projections onto postsynaptic vlPAG neurons followed by single-cell RT-qPCR analysis to elucidate how LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons regulate vlPAG microcircuitry. We have expanded this narrative in the revised version of the Discussion (Discussion, page 21, lines 419 – 423).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study, Siemian and co-authors significantly expand upon their previous work (Siemian et al., 2019) examining the role of parvalbumin-positive glutamatergic neurons in the LH (LH<sup>PV</sup>), and their projections to the vlPAG, in the modulation of pain responses. In their previous work, the authors showed that optogenetic activation or inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons suppresses or potentiates, respectively, responses to a noxious thermal stimulus and that this effect may be mediated by an excitatory projection to the vlPAG. The current manuscript is exciting in that it describes a much more detailed investigation of this circuit, using in vivo activity monitoring and manipulation (both chemo- and optogenetic) in multiple models of pain and pain-related behavior (both acute and chronic) as well as a neuroanatomical elucidation of this circuitry. Overall, this work uses a wide-spectrum of modern tools to address the circuit-basis of LH<sup>PV</sup> modulation of pain states and pain-associated behavior. This well-executed work contributes to filling a significant gap in our understanding of the role of LH neurons in modulating pain responses and pain behavior.</p><p>In their current work, the authors start by observing in vivo calcium signals with single cell resolution using GRIN-lens endomicroscopy of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons in PV-cre mice in several pain assays. They found that a subset of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons were activated by an acute thermal stimulus (hotplate), a much smaller subset were inhibited and large proportion did not respond. In another set of experiments, a subset of neurons were found to be activated by an acute noxious cold stimulus (coldplate), a small subset were inhibited and large proportion did not respond. They also found that some LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons responded to formalin injection over longer time-scales. These experiments successful provide solid evidence that at least a subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons respond to noxious stimuli which is a key finding. Less clear is how the heterogeneity observed in these responses may be linked to the circuit manipulations in the subsequent experiments, which engage the whole population of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons, and how specific LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are in modulating pain pathways.</p><p>In the next series of experiments, the authors manipulate LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons using chemogenetic and optogenetic methods in PV-cre mice, in a variety of standard pain assays. They first found that chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons suppressed pain responses, while inhibition of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons potentiated pain responses (increases and decreases in thermal pain thresholds respectively). In an interesting assay of homecage behavior, they further found that chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons prevented a pain-associated reduction in both nesting behavior and place aversion, which strengthens the argument that activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons is antinociceptive and seems to diminish pain-associated aversion. Finally, optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons appeared to diminish thermal and inflammatory pain, consistent with their chemogenetic results. However, optogenetic activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons also produced mild place avoidance in an RTPP assay, somewhat at odds with their chemogenetic results. Overall, the chemo and optogenetic manipulation experiments succeeded in showing that activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons has antinociceptive effects.</p><p>Next, the authors significantly extended their previous work by further probing the role of LH<sup>PV</sup> projections to both the vlPAG and LHb. Optogenetic stimulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> inputs to the vlPAG increased both acute thermal pain and more chronic neuropathic pain thresholds while inhibition decreased it, consistent with direct somatic manipulations. Interestingly, these manipulations did not appear to affect place preference leading to their examination of LH<sup>PV</sup> projections to the LHb, activation of which was aversive, consistent with previous work showing that the broader population of LH-VGLUT2 to LHb pathway is aversive. To address whether excitatory or inhibitory vlPAG populations may be targeted by LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons, the authors used rabies tracing and found that although a very small percentage of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons appeared to innervate the vlPAG, a greater proportion of excitatory than inhibitory neurons were targeted. Finally, the authors found that LH<sup>PV</sup>-induced antinociception enhanced and morphine-induced antinociception and rescues morphine tolerance.</p><p>Overall these data are novel and suggest that even a very tiny cluster of LH neurons has a rather outsized role to play in pain modulation. These findings would contribute to our limited understanding of both the role of hypothalamic circuits in pain modulation and the intersection of reward, aversion and pain.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>– Although the in vivo GRIN lens experiments provide evidence that a subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons respond to noxious stimuli, there's less clarity on the following questions:</p><p>1. Does the subpopulation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons activated by noxious thermal stimulation overlap with the subpopulation of neurons activated by noxious cold stimulation, ie is a specific subset of these neurons broadly tuned to respond to noxious thermal and cold stimuli or are they separate? The authors could provide more clarity on whether the cold/hot assays were done in the same animals and if not, provide some commentary on this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this ambiguity. The same three mice were indeed used for both assays. For better clarification, we used the CellReg pipeline to register cells across the hotplate and coldplate sessions. While a fair number of the same cells overall were detected during the hotplate and coldplate tests (<italic>n</italic> = 33), only 6 neurons remained in the same cluster between both sessions. We also observed 2 additional neurons that flipped from cluster 1 in the hotplate test to cluster 2 in the coldplate test. Thus, it appears that largely different populations of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are modulated by hot and cold noxious stimuli.

Directly addressing this is a technically difficult problem and perhaps the subject of a follow-up study but a discussion of the caveats would be helpful.

The authors start with a general description of pain and pain behavior and quickly transition to the role of the lateral hypothalamus in pain. It would be useful to make that transition more fluid and more detailed given that this is rationale for studying these cells in the context of pain. This could be accomplished by a more general description of the LH and how the repertoire of behaviors associated with the LH are relevant to pain responses. For example, the section of text: &quot;While the LH circuits controlling food intake and reward have received intense focus over the past several years, those governing nociception have gone understudied by comparison. Thus, with its diverse array of neuronal populations, uncovering genetically defined LH circuits that regulate pain may bring forth a novel therapeutic target&quot; should be expanded upon somewhat and include some key references.

For all imaging studies, summary statistics on which cells or how many cells are from which specific animal should be graphically shown somewhere. From the current display one cannot tell if the active and inhibited cells are from just one animal or are observed in all animals. It would beneficial to see several &quot;per animal&quot; metrics, i.e. showing the data in Figure 1 E and I not as a merge of all neurons across animals but for each individual mouse, as well as show the proportion of active and inhibited cells per subject.</p><p>1. The title states &quot;sensory and affective pain&quot;, which I read initially as the paper would present data on the dichotomy of the sensory and emotional qualities of pain perception, as originally defined by Melzack 1968. However, the assays used (primarily reflexive tests of hypersensitivity) measure only sensory aspects of behavior. In the text though (in comparison to the title), the authors use &quot;affect&quot; to refer to &quot;pain suppressed behaviors&quot; / &quot;pain induced co-morbidities&quot;, which I agree are partly captured by the nest building assay. The title to more accurately reflect the data, and remove &quot;affective pain&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern for our use of these terms. However, in addition to the nest building assay we would also suggest that the effects of LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation on formalin-induced changes in place preference also capture changes in affective pain; this has been interpreted as such by others in previous work (e.g., Alhadeff et al., 2018 Cell, Figure 4: “Hunger attenuates negative affective components of pain”) even though the same manipulation had a primary effect of reducing formalin-induced paw licking (measure of sensory pain; Figure 1: “Hunger attenuates response to inflammatory pain).</p><p>We acknowledge that several studies have demonstrated that affective pain can be selectively manipulated without having effects on sensory pain per se (e.g., Johansen et al., 2001; Corder et al., 2019). Yet, our work attempts to emphasize that simply treating sensory pain neither implies that (a) affective/motivational effects of pain are also improved nor that (b) normal behaviors are resumed. Thus, we wanted to highlight that we incorporated the nest building and place preference experiments to specifically examine these issues, but we acknowledge that LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activation likely reduces sensory pain first, which then has secondary effects on affective pain. Clearly, pain is generally multifaceted and its different components interact substantially to evoke a physically painful, emotionally unpleasant experience. However, even some clinical studies have shown that certain manipulations can induce changes in sensory but not affective pain descriptors (Schilder et al., 2018). Thus, we think that to postulate that the effects of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are <italic>specific</italic> for sensory pain would also not be technically accurate, given that the assays of affective pain did yield positive effects. To avoid confusion, we have changed the title to “An excitatory lateral hypothalamic circuit orchestrating pain in mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The miniscope data find two Clusters of cell-types functionally defined by being active or inhibited to noxious stimuli. This result is nice. However, it is disconnected from the remainder of the data, and as currently presented is a very elaborate, but far superior, Fos-like experiment showing that some cells are active while others are not, but it is not clear how and to what function these cell-types contribute to results presented after Figure 1. To avoid a difficult and time-consuming miniscope experiment to image projection neurons to PAG vs. habenula, I suggest a tracing-topology study to link this data to the other very important and interesting results in Figure 6 on differential results seen in the LH projections to the PAG vs habenula. For example, injection of a retrograde-AAV-FlpO recombinase into the PAG (and in a separate cohort, injection into habenula) of Pv-Cre mice with a Cre-ON/Flp-On intersectional fluorophore into the hypothalamus plus a noxious stimulus to induce FOS in these cells. Several conclusions could be drawn to compliment the miniscope functional data and the behavioral data, namely 1) are there collateral projections from LH◊PAG that also project to the habenula; 2) what proportion of these projection cells are nociceptive (FOS+); 3) are there functionally distinct cell-types (e.g. Clusters 1 and 2) that preferentially send projections to PAG or habenula (i.e. Fluorphore+ and FOS+/FOS-). This type of minor experiment might also provide additional insight to understand the two activity Clusters and how the bulk optogenetic/chemogenetic activation of LH<sup>Pv</sup> vlPAG neurons is antinociceptive when this experimental design &quot;turns on&quot; the nociception-inhibited Cluster-2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this experiment would yield several interesting findings. However, it is based on the idea that cluster 1 or 2 neurons remain constant over time and across stimuli. For our revision, we performed cell registration across the five calcium imaging sessions (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We found 33 neurons detected in both the hotplate and coldplate sessions in which we examined time-locked responses. Of those 33 neurons, only 6 neurons remained in a particular cluster in both sessions (e.g., cluster 1 in both the coldplate and hotplate), and an additional 2 neurons switched to the opposite cluster. Therefore, it seems likely that, in general, the responses of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are either not consistent over time or dependent on the type of stimulus applied. Thus, FOS-induced cells would likely be different depending on the applied stimulus, which further limits the interpretability of the proposed experiment if cells cannot rigidly be classified into these cluster designations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I would consider not referring to the 7-day timepoint post Spared Nerve Injury, a model of &quot;chronic neuropathic pain&quot;. This is still an acute surgical neuropathy model, whereas most &quot;chronic&quot; designations should be reserved for the 3+ week timepoint, at a minimum.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to phrasing on this part. As suggested, we changed these occurrences to “persistent”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. No axonal terminals can be seen in the image of Figure 4A nor Supp Figure 3. Are there other images from these mice illustrating that this projection connects with this more posterior portion of the vlPAG? The group's prior 2019 paper shows dense LH<sup>Pv</sup> innervation of the very anterior PAG (superocularmotor region), in contrast to some fiber placements in this article, which are almost 1.0 mm apart. In addition to the new images to confirm axons under the fiber tracts, I would request that images and quantification be provided for LH-PV axon densities across the anterior-posterior axis of the PAG. This will also be very helpful for the reader to link the past work with the current manuscript, as well as make sense of the choice of A-P coordinates for the fibers (-4.0 and -4.8 [Leptin-Cre study]) and for the RABV tracing experiment (which was done at the anterior -3.8 coordinate which was also used in the 2019 paper). Alternatively, performing a patch-clamp experiment (as done by the group in the 2019 paper) of Vglut2 or Vgat PAG neurons in the posterior PAG would confirm this connection, since the provided images do not show any axons in this region.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this ambiguity. We wanted to depict a general example for fiber placement given that we have four different groups (i.e., ArchT + GFP control and ChR2 + GFP control). For better clarification, we have included images for LH<sup>PV</sup> axonal projections in the vlPAG in the revised version.</p><p>Related to the vlPAG coordinates for the <italic>Pvalb<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice studies, the discrepancy between vlPAG targets of AP −3.87 in the previous study, AP −3.9 for RABV, and AP −4.0 for behavior in the current study was a trivial adjustment in our opinion (≤ 130 µm difference; smaller than standard virus spread). We made this adjustment in order to try to get the optical fibers to be closer to the center of the terminal field in the PAG. The LH<sup>PV</sup> terminal field is quite longitudinally dispersed. Therefore, the difference of ∼0.1 mm will not make any difference and is not a basis for anterior/posterior delineation of the LH<sup>PV</sup> terminal field. The requested axonal density study has fortunately already been done by Marco Celio’s group in this publication [Celio et al., 2013 J Comp Neurol. “Efferent connections of the parvalbumin-positive (PV1) nucleus in the lateral hypothalamus of rodents”]. Note especially Figure 9a-d (where axons are observed between AP −3.9 and AP −4.24) and the schematic in Figure 11. Therefore, the AP −4.0 mm coordinate is justified to use.</p><p>For the LH<sup>LEPR</sup>→PAG experiments, we implanted the optical fibers at (AP −4.8 mm) because LH<sup>LEPR</sup> neurons project to a more posterior area of the PAG compared to the LH<sup>PV</sup> axonal projections. Of note, we and others previously mapped the axonal projections of LH<sup>LEPR</sup> neurons (Schiffino et al., 2019; Leinninger et al., 2009). We have included this narrative in the Results and Methods sections on the revised version for better clarification (Results, page 14, line 273; Methods, page 31, lines 556 – 558).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

They showed that photostimulation of these neurons suppresses nociception to an acute, noxious thermal stimulus, and that photoinhibition potentiates thermal nociception. They also showed that these neurons form functional excitatory synapses on neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and that photostimulation of these axons mediates antinociception. Finally, they showed that the anti-nociceptive effect appears to occur independently of opioidergic mechanisms. Many of these findings are replicated here.</p><p>In the present study they add to these findings by demonstrating, with the use of calcium imaging from behaving mice, that the LH-PV neurons respond to noxious stimuli. They also demonstrate that projections of these neurons to vlPAG affect both sensory and affective aspects of pain, whereas projections to the habenula appear to affect only the affective/aversive components.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly supported by the data, but some detailed aspects could to be clarified (laid out below).</p><p>1. Some of the effects reported appear rather small, and some reported differences might be driven by outliers. For example, data in Figure 1 d,g,h,k,l represent changes smaller than 2 standard deviations, or less than one Z score. Data in Figure 4i suggest very small effects on paw withdrawal thresholds. A consideration of whether these small changes are functionally meaningful would be particularly useful. Differences depicted in data in Figure 1 o,p,q appear to driven by a small number of outliers; even if these data survive tests of statistical outliers, one wonders why the vast majority of experiments show no differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the statement “the vast majority of experiments show no difference.”</p><p>For Figure 1d, these sample traces depict some relatively large (2-3 SD) transients occurring after hotplate contacts, comparable to previous publications showing individual representative traces (see Jennings et al., 2015 Figure 4i).</p><p>For Figure 1g,h,k,l, please note that one criterion used to select cells into these clusters were that they achieved ± 1 Z-score, on average across trials, at some point following the stimulus (note the range of the red/blue values in the heatmaps plotting individual neuron activity, range ± 2.5 Z-score). When these traces are averaged within each cluster to plot the activity traces, since the time of the maximal Z-score was asynchronous across neurons, this has the effect of creating a constant Z-score value lower than the absolute maximum of any of the neurons during their time of highest activity.</p><p>For Figure 4i, we specifically acknowledged this small effect in the original text – “Due to the modest effects of LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG activation on mechanical thresholds, we predicted that this pathway may be more effective during inflammatory than neuropathic pain conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, it would be useful to know what criteria were used to ensure that parametric analyses are appropriate. It is not clear why, in some comparisons, both Bonferroni and Dunnett's multiple comparisons are used on the same datasets. And, depicting variances as confidence intervals, instead of SEM, will likely be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns. Our original analysis used a two-way ANOVA, with the repeated measure factor of treatment (i.e., the same cell was tracked across phases of the formalin test). The QQ plot of residuals appeared mostly linear, with a few points at one tail indicating perhaps a slight left skew. Since a non-parametric version of a mixed-model (or even unmatched) two-way ANOVA is unavailable in our statistical software, we proceeded with this report since we felt the matching values over the test was a vital factor and more appropriate than switching to independent tests.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have conducted non-parametric analyses, comparing each phase of these formalin test data to control in independent tests (i.e., contralateral vs no injection and ipsilateral vs no injection) with Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests corrected for multiple comparisons with the Holm-Sidak method and found that the results from our two-way ANOVA remain. While contralateral formalin induced significant increases in calcium transients over no injection in the acute (<italic>p</italic> = 0.048), interphase (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0078) and inflammatory (<italic>p</italic> = 0.048) phases, ipsilateral formalin did not. We have substituted these comparisons in the revised version. Thus, the inclusion of the Bonferroni comparison has been removed from that analysis. It was a feature of a previous version of Prism to conduct post-hoc tests between overall group data but that appears to have been recently removed. It was not a critical piece of information regarding the interpretation of these data, and the Dunnett’s post-tests, which were more important, are now essentially replaced by the Mann-Whitney tests.</p><p>Of note, we have changed the error bars of the formalin calcium transient dataset to 95% confidence intervals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sample sizes are quite small.

Do individual LH-PV neurons project to both vlPAG and habenula?

This is certainly an important question that has yet to be determined. We thank the reviewers for suggesting various ways to address this point. However, these concerns seem to have mainly arisen from the assumption that certain LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons consistently comprise the cluster 1 or cluster 2 archetype. Our cell registration analysis now demonstrates that this is not the case. Furthermore, our behavioral data suggest that these might be independent populations since we did not observe aversive-like effects during LH<sup>PV</sup>→vlPAG stimulation or antinociception during LH<sup>PV</sup>→LHb stimulation. Of note, we have added some significant discussion regarding this issue (Discussion, page 21 – 22, lines 426 – 433).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The revisions have exacerbated a problem in terminology. Pain is a percept. Noxious stimulation is a stimulus. Pain behavior is a package of skeletal muscle-mediated behaviors that ambiguously may include (or not) autonomic reactions. Thus, the title is problematic – you have little information on the pain percept (CPP and that is it). The bulk of your data speaks to pain behavior. And stimuli are not painful until proven so. Stimuli should be described as noxious (if they are indeed in that range).</p><p>Many of these issues converge in the sentence &quot;As such, rodent studies searching for new pain interventions have begun to investigate ethological behaviors like nesting that are suppressed by pain (e.g., forgoing standard life activities) as well as the affective/emotional component of pain with assays of pain-induced aversion (e.g., comorbid depression) (5, 11, 12) identifying specific brain pathways capable of managing these multiple components of chronic pain and developing strategies for targeting them for translational use will advance the search for novel pain therapies.&quot;</p><p>Possible changes include: new pain interventions/therapies → new analgesic interventions therapies; suppressed by pain → suppressed during pain behavior; assays of pain-induced aversion → assays of noxious stimulus-induced aversion; components of chronic pain → components of chronic pain behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the importance of semantics in this context and in the preclinical literature at large. We have adjusted the wording throughout the manuscript as suggested above when discussing the results from this study in mice. However, in cases where we allude to future potential treatments or discuss conditions in humans, we have left the word “pain” intact. In addition, we have changed the title to “An excitatory lateral hypothalamic circuit orchestrating pain behaviors in mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The suggestion that &quot;the bulk activation of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons with optogenetics or chemogenetics likely activates more than the necessary number of them (hot responders + cold responders) to evoke uniform antinociception effects in a given assay&quot; is not clear. Please explain how this could work. Related to this, if the responses to the noxious stimulation are so easily dismissed in favor of &quot;bulk activation,&quot; what are the implications, the import, if any, of these responses? If without import, then why are they shown?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this section of the discussion as follows:</p><p>“Therefore, it seems likely that, in general, the responses of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are either not consistent over time or dependent on the type of stimulus applied. […] However, further work will be needed to elucidate how noxious stimuli are responded to and encoded by LH<sup>PV</sup> neuronal activity.” (Discussion, page 24)</p><p>These findings are important for at least three reasons. First, they demonstrate that responding during noxious stimulation is part of the “natural repertoire” of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons. Thus, activating them via optogenetics or chemogenetics likely does not induce some primary effect totally unrelated to nociception (e.g., fear) which then has a secondary effect of suppressing nociception. Rather, suppressing nociception is likely directly affected via these manipulations. Second, they indicate that different types of stimuli engage different individual LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons. As such, future investigations may link specific LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons to specific noxious stimuli for targeted antinociception to that specific stimulus. For example, in an arthritis patient, reducing mechanical hypersensitivity (maladaptive) without affecting thermal sensing (normal) could be an ideal way to selectively manage pathological pain. Third, they replicate the broad phenomenon throughout the single-cell literature that even genetically similar neurons do not generally respond in a homogenous manner. We elaborated on the divergence of LH<sup>VGAT</sup> neuronal responses to food-oriented behaviors in the discussion and rebuttal already. Similarly, although arcuate hypothalamic AGRP neurons are commonly discussed to uniformly decrease in neuronal activity upon access to food (when using fiber photometry; Su et al., 2017; Beutler et al., 2020; Mazzone et al., 2020), the only manuscript that directly measured AGRP neuronal activity using in vivo extracellular electrophysiology showed that ∼30% of AGRP neurons do not show a decrease in activity upon presentation of food/feeding (Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015), a finding also somewhat visible when using a single-photon miniscope to record AGRP neuronal activity (Betley et al., 2015). Likewise, neurons in the MnPO that control fluid homeostasis respond in a heterogeneous manner to oral fluid access or intragastric infusion (Zimmerman et al., 2019). Thus, we do not think our findings here on the responses of LH<sup>PV</sup> neurons are at all discordant with the general findings of how neuronal populations respond to certain stimuli.</p></body></sub-article></article>
