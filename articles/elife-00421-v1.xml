offspring. Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) constitute a widespread group of defensive plant volatiles that convey a herbivory-specific message via their isomeric composition: feeding of the tobacco hornworm <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> converts (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- to (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs thereby attracting predatory insects. Here we show that this isomer-coded message is monitored by ovipositing <italic>M. sexta</italic> females. We detected the isomeric shift in the host plant <italic>Datura wrightii</italic> and performed functional imaging in the primary olfactory center of <italic>M. sexta</italic> females with GLV structural isomers. We identified two isomer-specific regions responding to either (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- or (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenyl acetate. Field experiments demonstrated that ovipositing <italic>Manduca</italic> moths preferred (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-perfumed <italic>D. wrightii</italic> over (<italic>E</italic>)-2-perfumed plants. These results show that (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs and/or specific (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratios provide information regarding host plant attack by conspecifics that ovipositing hawkmoths use for host plant selection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00421.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00421.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00421.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants have developed a variety of strategies to defend themselves against herbivorous animals, particularly insects. In addition to mechanical defences such as thorns and spines, plants also produce compounds known as secondary metabolites that keep insects and other herbivores at bay by acting as repellents or toxins. Some of these metabolites are produced on a continuous basis by plants, whereas others—notably compounds called green-leaf volatiles—are only produced once the plant has been attacked. Green-leaf volatiles—which are also responsible for the smell of freshly cut grass—have been observed to provide plants with both direct protection, by inhibiting or repelling herbivores, and indirect protection, by attracting predators of the herbivores themselves.</p><p>The hawkmoth <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> lays its eggs on various plants, including tobacco plants and sacred Datura plants. Once the eggs have hatched into caterpillars, they start eating the leaves of their host plant, and if present in large numbers, these caterpillars can quickly defoliate and destroy it. In an effort to defend itself, the host plant releases green-leaf volatiles to attract various species of <italic>Geocoris</italic>, and these bugs eat the eggs.</p><p>One of the green-leaf volatiles released by tobacco plants is known as (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenal, but enzymes released by <italic>M. sexta</italic> caterpillars change some of these molecules into (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenal, which has the same chemical formula but a different structure. The resulting changes in the ‘volatile profile’ alerts <italic>Geocoris</italic> bugs to the presence of <italic>M. sexta</italic> eggs and caterpillars on the plant.</p><p>Now Allmann et al. show that adult female <italic>M. sexta</italic> moths can also detect similar changes in the volatile profile emitted by sacred Datura plants that have been damaged by <italic>M. sexta</italic> caterpillars. This alerts the moths to the fact that <italic>Geocoris</italic> bugs are likely to be attacking eggs and caterpillars on the plant, or on their way to the plant, so they lay their eggs on other plants. This reduces competition for resources and also reduces the risk of newly laid eggs being eaten by predators. Allmann et al. also identified the neural mechanism that allows moths to detect changes in the volatile profile of plants—the <italic>E</italic>- and <italic>Z</italic>- odours lead to different activation patterns in the moth brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00421.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00421.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Manduca sexta</italic></kwd><kwd>plant volatiles</kwd><kwd>oviposition</kwd><kwd>Ca imaging</kwd><kwd><italic>Datura wrightii</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allmann</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name><name><surname>Späthe</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Bisch-Knaden</surname><given-names>Sonja</given-names></name><name><surname>Kallenbach</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinecke</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Sachse</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansson</surname><given-names>Bill S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sachse</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of Manduca moths to recognize changes in the profile of volatile compounds released by plants being attacked by Manduca caterpillars allows them to lay their eggs on plants that are less likely to be attacked by insects and other predators, and to avoid competing against other caterpillars of the same species for resources.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insects rely on olfaction in most aspects of life: volatile signals guide them to food sources, mating partners and oviposition hosts. Especially for herbivorous insects, plant volatiles provide important cues to locate and identify appropriate host plants for their offspring. Upon herbivory, plants respond with an increased release and de novo synthesis of several volatile compounds from their vegetative tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mumm and Dicke, 2010</xref>). These so-called herbivore induced plant volatiles can provide significant information to the surrounding environment as composition and abundance reflect several biotic and abiotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takabayashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Moraes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gouinguené et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schuman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hare, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Due to the context dependent composition of plant volatile signals, the ability to detect and discriminate volatile compounds is crucial for insects to generate appropriate behavioral responses. In insects and more specifically in the hawkmoth <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (Lepidoptera/Sphingidae), olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located on the antennae detect odorant molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalinová et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shields and Hildebrand, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fraser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spaethe et al., 2013</xref>) and convey this information to the antennal lobe (AL), the first olfactory processing center. The AL of <italic>M. sexta</italic> females consists of about 70 structural and functional subunits called olfactory glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grosse-Wilde et al., 2011</xref>). OSNs expressing the same receptor, and thus responding to the same set of odorants, converge onto the same glomerulus in the AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vosshall, 2000</xref>) as has been demonstrated for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and indirectly also in several moth species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansson, 1997</xref>). Spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity representing sensory input to the AL can be visualized by optical imaging methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hansson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Skiri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silbering and Galizia, 2007</xref>) enabling identification of compound- and blend-specific responses in the AL of <italic>M. sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hansson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bisch-Knaden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuebler et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) constitute a large group of herbivore-induced plant volatiles characterized by a C6-backbone. While emitted only in trace amounts from healthy, undamaged plant tissue, they are emitted instantly after cell disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turlings et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D’Auria et al., 2007</xref>). GLVs are generated from C18-fatty acids via the enzymes lipoxygenase (LOX) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allmann et al., 2010</xref>). One of the most abundant GLVs, (<italic>Z)</italic>-3-hexenal, originates from the cleavage of α-linolenic acid through the activity of HPL and it partly rearranges to (<italic>E)</italic>-2-hexenal. Both alkenals can be further metabolized by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and alcohol acyltransferase (AAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D’Auria et al., 2007</xref>) to the corresponding alcohols and their esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsui, 2006</xref>).</p><p>GLVs have been assigned various plant defense-associated functions by directly inhibiting phytopathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hamilton-Kemp et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamura and Hatanaka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prost et al., 2005</xref>) and repelling several herbivore species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Moraes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vancanneyt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang and Schlyter, 2004</xref>). Remarkably, GLVs also function as indirect plant defenses by attracting foraging predators and host-seeking parasitoids to the plant and its attacker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shiojiri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Halitschke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schuman et al., 2012</xref>) reminiscent of the role of other herbivore induced plant volatiles.</p><p>Due to their ubiquity and instant release, GLVs are thought to act as nonspecific signals of plant damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hatanaka et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoballah et al., 2002</xref>). We recently showed that an enzymatic component of the oral secretions (OS) of <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae adds an herbivory-specific feature to the GLV signal. Mechanically damaged leaves of <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> released large amounts of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs and low amounts of (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs. However, when the plant was attacked by <italic>M. sexta</italic> caterpillars or when puncture wounds of plant leaves were treated with <italic>M. sexta’s</italic> OS, the amount of (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs released increased, while the amount of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs decreased, resulting in a distinct change in the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratio of GLV emissions. This herbivore-induced change in the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratio attracted the generalist hemipteran predator <italic>Geocoris</italic> spp., which decreased the herbivore load on the plant by feeding on herbivore eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery of a (3<italic>Z</italic>):(2<italic>E</italic>)-enal isomerase in the OS of <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae raises many questions. Why does <italic>Manduca</italic> produce an enzyme that generates volatiles which betray the insect to its enemies, and why did evolution not select against this isomerase? The enzyme might be maladaptive and therefore is, or will be, under negative selection. The occurrence of this specific isomerase activity in at least two other lepidopteran species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>) however, suggests that it may have a beneficial function that outweighs the larva’s net costs of maintaining such an enzyme. It is well known that plants exchange information above ground by releasing volatiles into the air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldwin, 2010</xref>), which can be perceived by insects as well. Insects can use plant derived volatiles for communication by giving the herbivore induced volatile blend a ‘personal’ note—in our case, by converting (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs to their structural isomers and by changing the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2 ratio. Which message could <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae thereby communicate? In this study we hypothesized that the altered GLV emission might serve to reduce the number of competitors on their host plant by informing conspecific ovipositing moths that this plant is already occupied and, possibly, receiving increased predation. Reduced oviposition of <italic>Manduca</italic> moths in response to feeding damage has been shown in field experiments with <italic>M. quinquemaculata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kessler and Baldwin, 2001</xref>) as well as under laboratory conditions with <italic>M. sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spaethe et al., 2013</xref>). Deviating from the previous study, we chose <italic>Datura wrightii</italic> (Solanaceae) for our experiments. <italic>Datura</italic> is a highly preferred host plant of both <italic>M. sexta</italic> and the congeneric <italic>M. quinquemaculata</italic> for both nectar feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcón et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kessler, 2012</xref>) and oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spaethe et al., 2013</xref>). Its distribution covers southwestern USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avery, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Munz, 1973</xref>) overlapping with the occurrence of both <italic>Manduca</italic> species. The perennial shrub is repeatedly described to quickly regrow leaves after herbivore damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bronstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reisenman et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2013</xref>). Laboratory experiments failed to find reduced oviposition on damaged <italic>D. wrightii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reisenman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spaethe et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting flexibility in oviposition choice of <italic>Manduca</italic> females. As the previously examined <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaquerel et al., 2009</xref>)<italic>, D. wrightii,</italic> respond to <italic>Manduca</italic> herbivore attack by emitting GLVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hare and Sun, 2011</xref>). While we investigated GLV emission during the day when focusing on the diurnal egg predator <italic>Geocoris</italic> ssp., <italic>Manduca</italic> moths oviposit at twilight and night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Madden and Chamberlin, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lingren et al., 1977</xref>). Therefore, we decided to collect volatiles during these times instead. We expected the shift to occur also during the night, as in several plant species GLV emission has been shown to occur also in the dark period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loughrin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arimura et al., 2008</xref>), and the respective shift in the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratio is caused by <italic>M. sexta</italic> oral secretions and not by the plant itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). However, volatile emissions vary with light regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Halitschke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Moraes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gouinguene and Turlings, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morker and Roberts, 2011</xref>), and we therefore chose two nocturnal light conditions differing by moonlight intensity to examine whether light intensity affects GLV emission in <italic>D. wrightii</italic>. We performed functional imaging in the antennal lobe of female <italic>M. sexta</italic> moths asking whether (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-structural isomers of any of the tested GLVs can be discriminated by the olfactory system. In classical host recognition experiments the Colorado potato beetle <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> has been shown to recognize and avoid altered ratios of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs emitted by its host plant <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Visser and Avé, 1978</xref>). Furthermore, enantioselectivity has been reported for projection neurons in the female AL of <italic>M. sexta</italic> in response to (+)- and (−)-linalool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reisenman et al., 2004</xref>).

Due to our sample size, it remains to be shown by further experiments whether moonlight is sufficient to regulate volatile emissions.</p><p>The herbivore-induced volatile blend comprises several groups of compounds such as GLVs, terpenoids and/or aromatics, all of which have been shown to mediate plant-insect interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mumm and Dicke, 2010</xref>). GLVs, which were investigated in the present study, seem to play an important role in volatile ‘communication’ as almost every green plant releases them upon various stress conditions. Furthermore, GLVs are released instantly from plant tissue upon damage, independent of the time of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turlings et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D’Auria et al., 2007</xref>), while terpenoids are released with a delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kant et al., 2004</xref>) and several terpenoids not at all during the night as they are linked to photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arimura et al., 2008</xref>). This makes GLVs an important cue for ovipositing <italic>Manduca</italic> moths as they are active during sunset and night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Theobald et al., 2010</xref>) and thus need to rely on signals that are released during the scotophase.</p><p>The use of volatile blends for host location by insects depends heavily on the ability to detect and process olfactory signals. The insect’s olfactory system is highly sophisticated and enables detection of odors at very low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hansson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>). However, in a redolent world, insects must distinguish host odors from a high background noise. Plant volatiles are detected by OSNs and these can be tuned to highly specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruce and Pickett, 2011</xref>) or to ubiquitous host plant compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hansson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruce et al., 2005</xref>). We found that stimulations with hexenal- and hexenol-structural isomers led to activation of a distinct region in the AL (ROI 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). However, calcium signals evoked by (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs were significantly stronger compared with those evoked by (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This difference in activation intensity is likely a result from different binding affinities of the structural isomers to the olfactory receptor expressed by OSNs targeting the activated glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hooper et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Of all tested compounds, only the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-isomers of hexenyl acetate activated two different discrete regions in the AL of <italic>M. sexta</italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4B,C and 5A,B</xref>) strongly suggesting different isomer-specific OSN populations on the insect antenna. This leads to the proposition that for <italic>M. sexta</italic> females, changes in the volatile emission of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs might primarily be detected via hexenyl acetate. Given that all other tested GLVs activated only ROI 2, the investment in isomer-specific receptors and consequently glomeruli to detect and process ubiquitous GLV compounds such as (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenyl acetate indicates the importance of the information content transferred by these compounds and their respective ratios. Specific responses to different types of green leaf volatiles have been reported both at physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hansson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Røstelien et al., 2005</xref>) and behavioral levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reinecke et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>For hexenyl acetate, AL activation patterns elicited by stimulations with mixtures of both structural isomers were purely additive suggesting no mixture interaction at the OSN and AL input levels, which is consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deisig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silbering and Galizia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuebler et al., 2012</xref>). When comparing the ratio of ROI activation, we did not find any difference between the mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This result is not surprising when taking the different response characteristics of ROI 3 and 4 into account. Calcium activity of ROI 4 in response to mixtures with increasing percentages of the (<italic>E</italic>)-2-isomer were dose-dependent, whereas the activation of ROI 3 to the same mixtures resembled more an ‘on–off’ mechanism and was thus solely dependent on the presence of the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-isomer, leading to a constant bias towards (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5B and 6B</xref>). We can, however, not neglect the possibility that the logarithmic, dose-dependent phase in the neural dynamics of the neurons innervating ROI 3 lies at a concentration range below what was tested here.</p><p>The different response characteristics of ROI 3 and 4 might mirror the relevance of the odors for <italic>M. sexta</italic> females. (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate is a rather ubiquitously occurring plant volatile, which is released in large amounts after damage irrespective of its origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mumm and Dicke, 2010</xref>). Electrophysiological experiments revealed that this compound elicited many responses in OSNs on the female <italic>M. sexta</italic> antenna: 60% of the tested sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spaethe et al., 2013</xref>) as well as 21 of 34 cells in the female AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kuebler et al., 2011</xref>) responded to this compound. (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenyl acetate, in contrast, has rarely been reported in insect-plant interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Whitman and Eller, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quiroz and Niemeyer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2010</xref>), aside from its release among other GLVs after larval feeding of <italic>M. sexta</italic> on <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>) as an indication of actual larval damage. Thus, the presence of each structural isomer contains specific information but at different levels of resolution and in different contexts. In the case of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate, the detected signal might also be relevant in long-range host location and host choice. Information about (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenyl acetate gained by ROI 4 in a dose-dependent fashion should, on the other hand, be most valuable at a short distance to the plant, possibly to locate the best spot for oviposition depending on the actual amounts emitted by different plant sites or to choose among neighboring plants with different levels of (conspecific) herbivory.</p><p>Numerous studies suggest that the ratio of plant volatiles is an important component of the olfactory signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Visser and Avé, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cha et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Visser and Avé (1978)</xref> found several GLVs playing important roles in host recognition of <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic>. Augmenting the volatile emission of a potato host plant with the single GLV components (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- or (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenol, (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexanal or 1-hexanol resulted in a disruption of the orientation of <italic>L. decemlineata</italic> to the potato plant. Further studies found neurons specifically responding to these GLVs both at the periphery and in the AL of <italic>L. decemlineata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Jong and Visser, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1988b</xref>). In the case of the oriental fruit moth, <italic>Grapholita molesta,</italic> the ratio of a minor compound to the remaining components of a plant-derived synthetic mixture determined behavioral acceptance of this mixture, which could be associated with the response of two glomeruli in the female AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Piñero et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Najar-Rodriguez et al., 2010</xref>). We found that ovipositing <italic>Manduca</italic> moths distinguished between different (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratios and that they used these volatile cues to choose oviposition sites associated with less feeding competition and predation. However, independent of whether the mixtures tested were rather complex in their composition (9:1 vs 1:1 ratios), or less complex (only (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs vs only (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs), or consisted of only a single compound ((<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate vs (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenyl acetate) ovipositing <italic>Manduca</italic> moths continuously made a choice and always preferred the side of the plant that smelled more of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs, or less of (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). From our results we cannot conclude whether a complex GLV bouquet of different ratios provides more reliable information than do single compounds, but our results demonstrate that by adding a single component to the volatile bouquet of native <italic>D. wrightii</italic> plants one can alter the choice of ovipositing <italic>Manduca</italic> moths.</p><p>How did this behavior evolve? It has been shown that <italic>M. sexta</italic> moths learn to feed from flowers of non-hosts due to olfactory conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Riffell et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2013</xref>). Experience could as well shape female oviposition choice as it has been shown in other moth species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rietdorf and Steidle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>). During oviposition <italic>M. sexta</italic> females might encounter the herbivory-specific signal, but can never experience the reward of oviposition success associated with it. A <italic>M. sexta</italic> larva feeding on plants, however, is continuously surrounded by GLVs emitted from wounded plants and more importantly encounters almost continuously a low (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratio caused by its own oral secretions. The retention of odor memory learned at the larval stage onto the adult stage has been shown to occur in <italic>M. sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackiston et al., 2008</xref>). However, in such a case you would rather expect a preference for OS-elicited bouquets, as the larva grew up in these. More experiments are needed to solve whether experience and learning are involved in the avoidance of herbivory-specific (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratios.</p><p>Almost every green plant releases volatiles in highly variable amounts and compositions. This makes it a challenge for host searching insects to simultaneously extract useful information while flying through the odor plumes from multiple sources. Our results show that the AL, the first odor processing center of the insect brain, has the capacity to resolve the composition of GLV blends as emitted by highly relevant host plants. Correspondingly, gravid females make an informed choice. They prefer oviposition sites with reduced predation and competition risks for their offspring, as indicated by the plant volatile bouquet. Future work will reveal whether increasing amounts of (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs or rather changes in the (<italic>Z</italic>)-3/(<italic>E</italic>)-2-ratio at the background of other host odors provide crucial information for female <italic>Manduca</italic> moths.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growing conditions</title><p><italic>Datura wrightii</italic> seeds were initially purchased from B &amp; T World Seeds (Paguignan, France) and subsequently harvested from plants propagated in the glasshouse.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Marcel Dicke, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The effect of herbivory on plant volatile emission has been investigated for some 30 years, and green leaf volatiles have been the subject of many studies. Recently, Allmann &amp; Baldwin showed that <italic>Manduca</italic> oral secretions alter the Z/E ratio of green leaf volatiles in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, with a shift towards E isomers. The present manuscript merges Baldwin’s field program in which wild hawkmoths are major selective agents on <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> plants, with Hansson’s lab-oriented program of using <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> as a model system for olfactory coding, perception, and behaviour. This is an exciting prospect for chemical ecologists, synergizing the potential of these model systems in the field. The premise is that a subtle shift in stereochemistry provides information for the insects (friends and foes alike) interacting with wounded/induced plants.</p><p>All three reviewers find the study interesting, especially because of the combination of methodologies used. The study is a valuable follow-up of the paper by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1191634">Allmann and Baldwin</ext-link> in <italic>Science</italic> that provides information on the perception of the GLVs by <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> females and behavioural choices under field conditions by females of two <italic>Manduca</italic> species.</p><p>However, the reviewers also identify several important issues to be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. The major issues are:</p><p>1) Explaining the rationale of the study and the arguments for setting up this study, such as the connection to the 2010 <italic>Science</italic> paper by Allmann and Baldwin, as well as linking the study better to the study by Visser and Ave in 1978 and subsequent work by JH Visser &amp; R De Jong that also concern neurobiological aspects and behavioural studies of the role of individual GLVs in a total blend.</p><p>2) The aspect of light, which is not well introduced and sounds like a post-hoc aspect, which in connection with the fact that there is only a single replicate for the silver moon and full moon weakens the conclusions rather than strengthening them.

Visser &amp; R. De Jong that also concern neurobiological aspects and behavioural studies of the role of individual GLVs in a total blend</italic>.</p><p>While our study and results are very much placed in an ecologically relevant background, the studies of Visser and colleagues covered fundamentals in host recognition and odor processing. Of course, there are some parallels between these classical studies and our experiments, like the focus on GLV compounds; however, the underlying questions differ fundamentally. Thus, care must be taken when comparing our results with those of Visser &amp; de Jong. We were asking whether <italic>M. sexta</italic> is able to differentiate between wounding signals and detect the difference between feeding-damaged and mechanically wounded plants via different ratios of (<italic>E</italic>)-2-and (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- GLVs. We did not apply an arbitrary manipulation to the host plant, but an ecological relevant and naturally occurring variation in the volatile blend of a host plant. We did not compare intact with manipulated plants; we used a paired design testing two different variations of volatile blends of damaged host plants.</p><p>The pioneering studies by Visser &amp; Ave and Visser &amp; de Jong focused on general principles in host recognition and ratio-dependent odor processing of GLV blends. They showed how ratios of volatiles are used by the olfactory system for host recognition. Intracellular recordings of OSNs revealed differences in the coding of single GLVs and binary mixes, and highlighted the role of suppression during odour processing.</p><p>We revised the Introduction and Discussion to clarify the motivation of the study, and to incorporate the work of Visser &amp; de Jong &amp; colleagues.</p><p><italic>2) The aspect of light, which is not well introduced and sounds like a post-hoc aspect, which in connection with the fact that there is only a single replicate for the silver moon and full moon weakens the conclusions rather than strengthening them. You may consider eliminating this aspect altogether</italic>.</p><p>We are convinced that the light regime is a very strong candidate to explain the variation in our data. We admit that the small sample size is unsatisfactory and more experiments will be needed to shed more “light” onto the effect of light on GLV emissions. However, we feel that these experiments are beyond the scope of our present manuscript. We now emphasize the possible effect of light in our Introduction to avoid post-hoc concerns.</p><p><italic>3) The ecological relevance of the study (origin of seeds, combining two different moth species, comparison with plants with feeding damage in the field)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would have been better to work with <italic>D. wrightii</italic> seeds from the field site in Utah. However, the collection of wild seeds at our field site during the last 3 years was impeded by a greatly expanded rodent population tracking the brome grass invasion. The animals showed exceptional seed eating behavior, making wild seeds mostly unavailable. Thus, we had to search for alternatives. Unfortunately, B&amp;T World Seeds do not indicate a clear origin of their <italic>D. wrightii</italic> seeds. However, plants grown from purchased seeds phenotypically matched those grown from the few available wild seeds in the glass house. We have added this information to the manuscript.</p><p>We are convinced that differences between plant seed origins are not the cause of our variation in the emission of (<italic>E</italic>)-2- and (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-GLVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allmann and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). The elicitor of the altered (Z)/(E)-ratio is in the oral secretions of M. sexta larvae. Consequently, as long as the plants respond with the release of GLVs, the expected shift in the (<italic>Z</italic>)/(<italic>E</italic>)-ratio should occur. Hare (2007) reported differences in emission of induced volatiles between glandular and non-glandular phenotypes of <italic>D. wrightii</italic>. He, however, collected volatiles 48 h after damage and focused on the emission of sesquiterpenes. In the only assessed GLV, (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenyl acetate, no difference was observed as the (<italic>Z</italic>)/(<italic>E</italic>)-ratio is in the oral secretions of <italic>M. sexta</italic> larvae. Since we were interested in the GLV emission, we collected the treated leaves immediately after they were damaged, which is the ecologically relevant time to do so, as this GLV emission provides ovipositing hawkmoths with accurate information about intraspecific competition and potential predation risk for their offspring.</p><p>Concerning the two moth species, we admit that we could not assign the deposited eggs to one single species with certainty. In the field experiments it is not possible to separate the two <italic>Manduca</italic> species from each other; both moths fly at the same time and their eggs look exactly the same.</p><p>However, our behavioral data show that whichever species oviposited on our experimental plants, they clearly differentiated between both treatments. Thus, we can conclude that either only <italic>M. sexta</italic> or both species use the (<italic>Z</italic>)/(<italic>E</italic>)-GLVs as information to choose appropriate host plants. Controlled laboratory experiments with each species could unambiguously reveal whether both species use the signal. However, it is extremely difficult to rear <italic>Manduca quinquemaculata</italic> and controlled greenhouse/growth chamber experiments with moths do not always produce the same results found in field experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reisenman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spaethe et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The integration of a treatment applying <italic>M. sexta</italic> larval feeding to <italic>D. wrightii</italic> plants in the field would very nicely complement our dataset, but under field conditions this is extremely difficult to establish. The occurrence of ovipositing moths is barely predictable both in time and location. To compare the treatments on one plant, the feeding larvae would need to be restrained to a certain area to allow the evaluation of a distinct radius. Furthermore, the number of larvae previously reared on <italic>D. wrightii</italic> needed for this experiment would probably exceed the scope of the field station.</p><p><italic>4) Explaining methodological aspects, with a focus on those aspects that may have affected the conclusions (e.g., different adsorbents for lab and field experiments, and differences in headspace composition), and on the choice for the methods used while not using other methods, such as peripheral recordings or controls such as sham control plants</italic>.</p><p>The use of volatile traps with different adsorbents is a concession to the challenging group-organized fieldwork conditions and economic factors. Throughout the short but experimentally dense field season we need hundreds of traps for numerous experiments. Since these traps are stored at −20°C at the field location and transported to the laboratory before elution and analysis, it is organizationally and economically not possible to use the costly reusable traps filled with SuperQ that we use in the lab.</p><p>The absence of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenal in our field samples is most probably associated with the unstable nature of this compound. Volatile collections using active charcoal are not the cause for this previously reported variation between field and lab volatile collections. We attach new data showing that under laboratory conditions, both SuperQ and activated charcoal traps are capable of collecting (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexenal (Table 6).</p><p>Concerning the physiological experiments, we were asking whether <italic>M. sexta</italic> females are able to differentiate between wound signals and detect the difference between feeding-damaged and mechanically wounded plants. This ability necessitates specific OSNs to distinguish between the emitted (<italic>E</italic>)-2- and (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-conformers. We employed functional imaging to investigate the spatial patterns of glomerular activation in the antennal lobe. This technique is very powerful as it visualizes the complete input to the antennal lobe, i.e., the responses of thousands of OSNs at the same time. Due to the principles of OSN targeting, i.e., that OSNs expressing the same receptor type innervate one and the same glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vosshall, 2000</xref>), the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging technique reveals the involvement of different OSN types in an odor response. Electrophysiological experiments like single-sensillum or intracellular recordings show responses of single neurons and can provide information about information detection and processing via their response characteristics. This, however, was not the focus of our study. Since the <italic>Manduca</italic> AL receives input from roughly 250,000 OSNs from more than 20,000 sensilla, the search for specific OSN types by peripheral recordings would result in hitting neurons by chance to find differentially responding cells. Imaging provides the best of two worlds: specificity and completeness. Instead of registering the activity of single neurons, the specific response of the complete OSN population can be observed after a single odor stimulation.</p><p>Regarding sham controls, we were asking whether Manduca moths can distinguish between a damaged and a feeding-damaged plant, which were represented by two different ratios of (<italic>Z</italic>)-3- and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-GLVs. We focused on the sophisticated evaluation of host quality as it is likely to occur in nature, where plants are rarely free of damage or herbivory. We did not perform any sham controls, because they are not the focus of our study. One can speculate that a sham control would have received considerably more eggs than our treated plants, but how would that relate to the scientific question?</p></body></sub-article></article>
