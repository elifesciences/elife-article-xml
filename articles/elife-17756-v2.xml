RNA world in which RNA enzymes (ribozymes) catalyze replication of the RNA genomes of primordial cells. However, the plausibility of nonenzymatic RNA replication is undercut by the lack of a protocell-compatible chemical system capable of copying RNA templates containing all four nucleotides. We show that short 5′-activated oligonucleotides act as catalysts that accelerate primer extension, and allow for the one-pot copying of mixed sequence RNA templates. The fidelity of the primer extension products resulting from the sequential addition of activated monomers, when catalyzed by activated oligomers, is sufficient to sustain a genome long enough to encode active ribozymes. Finally, by immobilizing the primer and template on a bead and adding individual monomers in sequence, we synthesize a significant part of an active hammerhead ribozyme, forging a link between nonenzymatic polymerization and the RNA world.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17756.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17756.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17756.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Though defining what makes something “alive” has proved challenging, one crucial feature of living things is the ability to copy genetic information and pass it on to the next generation. Nowadays, enzymes called polymerases copy genetic information encoded within the DNA of living cells. However, when life on Earth began approximately four billion years ago, polymerases had not evolved yet. This means that the genetic information of the first cells had to be copied some other way.</p><p>The earliest life on Earth is unlikely to have used DNA to store its genetic information, and probably used a closely related molecule called RNA instead. Like DNA, RNA is made up of four smaller building blocks joined together to form long chains. The building blocks of RNA are commonly referred to using single letters: A, C, G and U. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to copy RNA without enzymes, but for only two of the four RNA letters, namely C and G.</p><p>Prywes et al. wanted to know if it was possible to create a chemical system, without polymerases, in which all four RNA letters could be copied. The experiments showed that strings of RNA that were three letters long could catalyze RNA copying, just as long as they were chemically activated. That is to say, these short RNA strings allowed RNA to be copied without enzymes if they had a chemical group at one end that made them more reactive.Each short catalyst helped copy one of the four RNA letters, and adding several into one reaction meant that longer sequences containing all four RNA letters could be copied.</p><p>Prywes et al. then used these short catalysts to copy an RNA molecule that itself acts a bit like an enzyme, and confirmed that a significant portion of this molecule could be copied without any polymerases. Further work is now needed to see if it is possible to copy other RNA sequences, and especially longer ones, without enzymes. Another challenge for the future would be to attempt to copy an RNA sequence multiple times without enzymes; a challenge that the earliest ancestors of cells on Earth must have overcome to pass their genetic information down through the generations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17756.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17756.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>origin of life</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerization</kwd><kwd>information copying</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>290363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prywes</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name><name><surname>Blain</surname><given-names>J Craig</given-names></name><name><surname>Del Frate</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name><name><surname>Szostak</surname><given-names>Jack W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1144152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prywes</surname><given-names>Noam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nonenzymatic polymerization can copy templates containing all four RNA monomers, a prerequisite for the transition to the RNA world.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to serve as a bridge from prebiotic chemistry to the RNA world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Powner et al., 2009</xref>), the nonenzymatic copying of RNA templates by suitably activated nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) must occur quickly enough to replicate functional RNA sequences faster than they degrade. However, the nonenzymatic copying of sequences containing all four nucleotides has not yet been possible for a number of reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Szostak, 2012</xref>), most notably the slow rate of primer extension with adenosine and uridine monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joyce et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deck et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, two adjacent A or U residues in the template will stop polymerization entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</xref>) under normal conditions; even partial copying requires extreme conditions, such as the eutectic phase of frozen samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Vogel and Richert, 2007</xref>), which are not compatible with replication within protocells. Extensive optimization of reaction conditions with the aim of improving the rate of primer extension with all four monomers, including varying the choice of divalent cation and leaving group, improved the rate and regiospecificity of polymerization for G and C but not A and U (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Inoue and Orgel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hagenbuch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lohrmann et al., 1980</xref>). Recent biophysical studies suggest that low A and U monomer affinity for the template is not the only reason for this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Szostak, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Izgu et al., 2015</xref>) since A binds only three-fold more weakly than G, but primer extension with A is at least 100-fold slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Joyce et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Heuberger et al., 2015</xref>) than with G. Moreover, Deck et al. have shown that downstream helper oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deck et al., 2011</xref>) that provide incoming monomers with an additional binding surface improve the binding of A and U monomers, but the underlying difference in rates remains. The use of helper oligonucleotides allowed primer extension to proceed on a template containing all four bases over the course of several weeks, where previously such templates could not be copied at all.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17756.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Catalysis of nonenzymatic primer extension by activated downstream nucleotides.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structure of 2-methylimidazole-activated guanosine-5′-monophosphate, and its schematic representation.

Finally, when a template is immobilized by attachment to a bead, sequential addition of activated monomers and helper oligonucleotides successfully promoted the synthesis of a significant part of an active hammerhead ribozyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Given the historical and continuing problems in demonstrating efficient nonenzymatic template directed primer extension, one might wonder whether this biologically inspired model is appropriate for replication within primordial cells. An alternative scenario that might seem more reasonable in the context of prebiotic chemistry involves template copying by the initial formation of short oligonucleotides, followed by ligation events that generate longer oligonucleotide intermediates and eventually a full length copy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Szostak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">James and Ellington, 1999</xref>). To test the viability of this hierarchical assembly model, we compared the rate of primer extension with activated monomers to the rate of ligation of two template bound oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref> reactions 1 and 3). Nucleotides activated with 2-methylimidzole on the 5′-phosphate have been used extensively to model nonenzymatic template copying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu and Orgel, 1992c</xref>), irrespective of their prebiotic plausibility, and were used in all experiments reported here. In both the nucleotide polymerization and the oligonucleotide ligation reactions, the chemical reaction is the same, i.e. attack of the 3′-hydroxyl of an oligonucleotide on the 5′-phosphate of a downstream nucleotide, with displacement of the 2-methylimidazole leaving group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Moreover, the reacting nucleotides are the same in both cases: a G at the 3′-end of the primer and a G monomer or a G at the 5′-end of an oligonucleotide. We expected the ligation reaction to be faster, because the oligonucleotides to be ligated are both stably bound to the template, and because the fully base-paired nicked duplex should be largely in the optimal A-type conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kozlov and Orgel, 2000</xref>), whereas the primer/template complex with template bound monomers would be significantly more disordered. To our surprise, the primer extension reaction proceeded almost 100 times more rapidly than the ligation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This was true for a variety of trimer sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In our search for an explanation for this unexpected observation, we reasoned that one of the major differences between the two scenarios was the presence of multiple adjacent 5′-activated nucleotides downstream of the primer in the case of monomer addition, but not ligation, where there is only a single activated nucleotide. Indeed, the case for a role of a second downstream activated nucleotide is consistent with the well known difficulty of extending a primer to the last nucleotide of a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wu and Orgel, 1992c</xref>). Furthermore, Orgel et al. showed over 20 years ago that efficient primer extension requires the presence of two activated monomers adjacent to the primer. Remarkably, the reaction is fastest when both monomers are activated with 2-methylimidazole instead of either or both being activated with imidazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wu and Orgel, 1992a</xref>), suggesting a possible catalytic role for a physical interaction of the leaving groups of adjacent monomers.</p><p>In order to directly test the possibility that a 2-methylimidazole leaving group on the 5′-phosphate of a downstream monomer or oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) would increase the rate of reaction between a primer and an adjacent monomer, we designed a series of templates for nonenzymatic RNA polymerization and ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We then measured the rate of addition of a monomer to a primer in the presence or absence of downstream nucleotides, with or without 5′-activation of the downstream nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>). Rates were calculated assuming a pseudo-first order rate equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), because the concentrations of primer and template were far below that of the monomer, which would not change significantly during the reaction. Primer extension by addition of a single monomer, in the absence of any additional downstream mono- or oligo-nucleotides, was very slow and comparable in rate to the ligation of the primer to a 5′-activated GAG trinucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>, reactions 2 and 3). The binding of an unactivated AGC trimer, with either a 5′ hydroxyl or a 5′ phosphate, downstream of an activated G monomer conferred only a modest increase in the rate of addition of the G monomer to the primer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>, reactions 4 and 5), consistent with previous reports of unactivated downstream ‘helper’ oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jauker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kervio et al., 2010</xref>). Such helper oligonucleotides are thought to act largely by increasing monomer affinity to the primer/template complex by providing an additional base-stacking surface. In contrast, when the same AGC trimer was activated as a 5′-phosphoro-2-methylimidazolide and used as a downstream helper oligonucleotide, the rate of primer extension (by addition of a G monomer) was increased by over two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>, reaction 6) compared to reactions with unactivated trimers. The rate of primer extension with a single G in the presence of an activated downstream trinucleotide was about twice as fast as the rate when the primer was followed by up to four sequential activated G monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>, reaction 1 and 6).</p><p>To systematically study the rate of nonenzymatic primer extension as a function of the length of the downstream activated ‘helper’ oligonucleotide, we synthesized a series of activated oligonucleotides of different lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At saturating concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) of each of the oligonucleotides, the rate of primer extension improved as the length of the helper increased from mononucleotide to dinucleotide to trinucleotide, and then stayed approximately constant with the tetranucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At subsaturating concentrations of helper oligonucleotide, the rate of the primer extension reaction increased with increasing concentrations of di- or tri-nucleotide helper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the maximum rate of the trimer-assisted reaction was significantly faster than that of the dimer-assisted reaction, we proceeded with trimers as the downstream helper oligonucleotides for the remainder of this study.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17756.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nonenzymatic primer extension using all four monomers.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) RNA primer extension assay using alternative 'helper' oligomers and corresponding, complementary templates.

Remarkably, whereas the rate of primer extension with A and U monomers was previously too slow to measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wu and Orgel, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Heuberger et al., 2015</xref>) – conservatively estimated to be at least three orders of magnitude slower than primer extension with G or C monomers – the difference in polymerization rates was reduced to roughly one order of magnitude when assisted by downstream activated trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>In order to assess the fidelity of nonenzymatic trimer-assisted primer extension, we measured the rates of monomer addition for all monomer-template combinations, including both matches and mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We calculated the fidelity for each template as the rate of matched monomer addition divided by the sum of matched and mismatched monomer addition rates. By averaging the fidelities of the four templates we found the overall fidelity of trimer-assisted polymerization to be 98%. Assuming an error threshold of one mutation per genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Eigen, 1971</xref>), this value of fidelity allows for effective genome sizes of 50 nucleotides, long enough to produce functional ribozymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferré-D'Amaré and Scott, 2010</xref>). The fastest mismatch reaction was primer extension by G during copying of a template U, which was approximately 5% as fast as primer extension with A on the same template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is likely due to the formation of a G:U wobble base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Heuberger et al., 2015</xref>), and is consistent with previous studies of nonenzymatic primer extension reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rajamani et al., 2010</xref>). All other mismatches were at least two orders of magnitude slower than their matched counterparts. We also tested the effect of replacing the canonical U monomer with 2-thiouridine and 2-thioribothymine on the polymerization rate and found, in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Heuberger et al., 2015</xref>), that this sulfur substitution improved the rates by approximately one order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), bringing the rate of primer extension closer to the rates of G and C addition. More rigorous tests of fidelity, in which monomers can compete for binding on a template in all possible sequence contexts, are ongoing.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17756.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fidelity of trimer-assisted primer extension.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the fidelity assay.

In order to iterate the process of trimer assisted monomer addition, after a downstream activated trimer catalyzes the addition of the first monomer to the primer, the helper trimer must dissociate to allow for the binding of the next monomer-trimer pair. To test the feasibility of this mode of primer extension, we designed a template that contained binding sites for all four monomers and synthesized the appropriate activated trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We used 2-thiouridine monomer in place of uridine (see above), and all four monomers (A, G, C and 2-thiouridine) were present in every reaction. In the absence of activated trimers, we observed almost no primer extension (lane 1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>); even though all four monomers were present, their combined rate of addition was not measurable. Adding just the first helper trimer resulted in rapid addition of the first monomer (C) to the primer, followed by slow addition of the first trimer (AGC) to the growing primer. Similarly, adding two, three or four trimers together resulted in the generation of primers extended by two, three or four monomers respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). These reactions converted primer into a product with four sequentially added monomers with an ~80% yield after 16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>); single monomer addition reactions reached &gt;95% yield after only 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The difference between the fast rates observed in the trimer-assisted addition of a single base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and the slower rate of trimer-assisted polymerization of all four bases simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) may be due to the competition of trimers for overlapping binding sites on the template. This hypothesis is supported by the decreased rate of trimer assisted primer extension with a single monomer in the presence of additional overlapping downstream trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The copying of templates containing two consecutive A or U monomers is also made possible by the use of activated helper oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17756.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Primer extension with all four monomers in a one-pot reaction.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of a primer extension reaction incorporating all four RNA monomers, with four respective downstream helper trimers.

While our method can only produce sequences &gt;7 nucleotides in one reaction in low yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) due to the cross-inhibitory effect of trimers with overlapping binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), we reasoned that a ribozyme could be synthesized by this approach if monomers were added, along with their attendant trimers, one at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). To that end, we immobilized a template that codes for the sequence of one half of the hammerhead ribozyme (HH2) – on a bead and added matched pairs of monomers and trimers sequentially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Primer extension was monitored by gel electrophoresis. Despite the fact that no 2-thiouridine monomers were used (in order to protect the catalytic capacity of the ribozyme) a high conversion rate was observed at each step (75–95%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The reaction durations required to achieve these conversion rates varied widely, for example, the seventh monomer addition required 21 hr to reach 95% while the eighth addition reached the same level of conversion after just 30 min. Generally, G and C additions were much faster than A or U additions; the reason for the discrepancy between the rates of these reactions on beads and those in solution is unknown. The use of s<sup>2</sup>U or s<sup>2</sup>T might offset some of the discrepancy. The final product was released from the bead by hybridization of an excess of a DNA oligonucleotide of identical sequence to the immobilized template.

Short, activated oligonucleotides – themselves plausibly generated by either templated or untemplated monomer polymerization – are efficient catalysts of high fidelity primer extension with all four RNA monomers. Thus short activated oligonucleotides can play dual roles, acting either as catalysts of chain growth by monomer addition, or directly as replication intermediates, since they can also be incorporated into a growing chain by ligation. Template copying in a complex but realistic milieu containing both activated monomers and oligomers could therefore occur via a hybrid process combining primer extension with monomers and oligonucleotide ligation.</p><p>The disparity in rates between the reactions catalyzed by activated vs. unactivated trimers indicates a key role for the leaving group downstream of the polymerizing monomer. The slow rate of activated oligonucleotide ligation is also explained by the lack of a leaving group one base downstream of the site of the primer extension reaction: in this case the downstream position corresponds to the second monomer in the oligonucleotide which necessarily has no leaving group as it is linked to the upstream monomer by a phosphodiester linkage. The nature of the interaction between the downstream leaving group and the reacting monomer remains unclear. It is possible that the downstream leaving group interacts attractively with the reacting leaving group, positioning it optimally for attack by the 3′ hydroxyl of the primer. As observed by Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wu and Orgel, 1992a</xref>) this interaction could be very sensitive to steric effects, such that 2-methylimidazole at the downstream position would facilitate polymerization much more effectively than imidazole, though the authors ultimately concluded that such subtle effects are not likely to adequately explain the strength of the interaction. Wu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wu and Orgel, 1992a</xref>) also suggested that the catalytic effect could be due to acid-base catalysis. Another possibility is that the upstream leaving group forms a covalent bond with the phosphate of the downstream monomer, a reaction that is only possible if there is a leaving group on the downstream monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kervio et al., 2016</xref> and T. Walton and J.W. Szostak, unpublished data). This covalent bond could form before the attack of the 3′ hydroxyl of the primer, creating an imidazolium intermediate, or in a concerted reaction where the leaving group of the upstream monomer replaces the leaving group of the downstream monomer. Further understanding of the reaction mechanism could lead to concomitant improvements in the rate and extent of template copying.</p><p>Further advances are required to enable the copying of longer and potentially functional RNA sequences in one pot, protocell-compatible conditions. However, the copying of long mixed template sequences under our conditions compares favorably, both in terms of rate and efficiency with reactions in which arbitrary RNA templates are copied by highly evolved ribozyme polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wochner et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, if the rates and fidelities of nonenzymatic RNA polymerization were sufficiently high, the need for a ribozyme polymerase in the RNA world may be circumvented: RNA could be copied by nonenzymatic chemistry alone until the advent of protein polymerases.</p><p>We suggest that the identification of a plausible source of chemical energy that could drive the re-activation of monomers and oligomers following hydrolytic loss of the leaving group is a key missing component in efforts to reconstitute nonenzymatic RNA replication. A chemical environment that could maintain a fully activated pool of substrates, and avoid accumulation of the inhibitory by-products resulting from hydrolysis, might be sufficient to drive high yielding and complete copying of longer RNA templates in one pot, thus setting the stage for the emergence of Darwinian evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Guanosine 5′-monophosphate was purchased as the free acid from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). 2-thiouridine-5′-phosphoro-2methylimidazolide and 2′,3′-diacetyl-nucleosides were purchased from ChemGenes (Wilmington, MA).

Primer (Cy3 - 5′- GCG UAG ACU GAC UGG - 3′) and template (biotin - 5′- AAC CCC GCG CCU CAU CAG CCA GUC AGC UCU ACG C - 3′) were bound to the beads at 250 μM and 275 μM, respectively, in 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7. Monomer additions were conducted under the following conditions: 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 25 mM monomer and 2 mM trimer. The beads were washed between steps in 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7. For steps 2, 5 and 7, 50 mM monomer and 4 mM trimer were added. Each step was monitored by gel electrophoresis until it reached &gt;75% yield. Steps varied in length from 30 min to 22 hr; the total time required was 150 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Hammerhead ribozyme cleavage assay</title><p>10% of the product of the bead-immobilized reactions was washed twice in 100 μL water containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20. 174 μM DNA complement was added in 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 and the beads were incubated at 95°C for 1 min. The solution was removed from the beads and 2 units of DNaseI along with DNaseI buffer (NEB) were added. Finally, the reaction was incubated at room temperature with 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 250 nM Cy5 labeled HH1 RNA (Cy5 - 5′ - CGC GCC GAA ACA CCG UGU CCC AGU C - 3′) for 20 hr. The products of both the bead immobilized reactions and the hammerhead reaction were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide denaturing urea gel).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Christian Hentrich, Aaron Engelhart, Ben Heuberger, Matthew Powner, Tony Jia, Alison Liou, Dipti Jasrasaria, Jeffrey Bessen, Alix Chan, Fred Rubino, Daniel Strassfeld and Holly Rees for helpful discussions and their contribution to this work.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Catalysis of nonenzymatic template copying by activated oligonucleotides allows synthesis of an active RNA enzyme&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen, Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gerald Joyce (Reviewer #2); Christopher Switzer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Here Szostak and coworkers describe a major advance in the non-enzymatic template-directed polymerization of RNA, achieving dramatically faster reaction rates and much broader sequence generality compared to what has been achieved over the past 40 years of investigation. The authors uncover and exploit a heretofore unrecognized aspect of the templated polymerization of nucleoside 5'-phospho-2-methylimidazolides, involving catalysis by the nucleotide at the +1 position relative to the reacting nucleotide. Remarkably, the same 2-methylimidazole moiety that is the leaving group on the reacting nucleotide also has a catalytic effect at the +1 position. Furthermore, this catalytic effect can be provided by an adjacent oligonucleotide that has the same modification, thereby ensuring template occupancy of the adjacent catalyst. Employing a set of trinucleotide catalysts that cover successive reading frames, it now is possible to add sequentially all four nucleotides in good yield. Furthermore, if the trinucleotide catalysts are provided sequentially rather than as a mixture, even longer sequences can be synthesized, including 12 nucleotides that constitute a portion of the hammerhead ribozyme.</p><p>All of the referees felt that this work was an important contribution to nucleic acid chemistry and origins of life research.</p><p>Despite their enthusiasm all of the reviewers felt that the paper could be improved and each has spelled out a number of points that should be addressed via revision. In particular, all thought the statement in the manuscript that reacting nucleotides are the same for reactions 1 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> needs to be addressed given that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> indicates the reacting nucleotides are different, G/G and G/A, respectively, and given that these experiments are together a key test of the &quot;hierarchical assembly model.&quot; Please address this point as well as the other comments as thoroughly as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>A long-standing question in origins research, and in the efforts to test/support the RNA World hypothesis specifically, is how RNA monomers (i.e., nucleotides) could have polymerized into polymeric RNA. This was the focus of the works of Orgel, Ferris, and several others and still remains unsatisfactorily solved. The current paper proposes a possible mechanism that partially addresses some of the chemical problems inherent to abiotic polymerization of nucleotides, namely that certain nucleotides (e.g., A and U) are recalcitrant towards non-enzymatic polymerization, and that in general such polymerization is slow, to the point of being ineffectual in the face of the back reaction (hydrolysis).</p><p>Here, the authors provide data that nucleotide activation can serve not only the canonical activation role that provides the free energy for polymerization, but also a catalytic role in that &quot;downstream&quot; activating groups can actually boost the rates up &quot;upstream&quot; ligation (polyermization) reactions. Specifically, the authors show that helper activated trinucleotide oligomers are particularly effective in enhancing rates of polymerization. In the extreme, they show that an RNA of sufficient length to be a catalyst itself, i.e., a ribozyme, can be made using this methodology, albeit with some help.</p><p>When I started reading the manuscript I immediately ran into a conceptual flaw that temporarily tempered my enthusiasm for the work. In the first paragraph of the Results, the authors use an (apparent) observation that, when activated with a specific &quot;high-energy&quot; leaving group (2-methylimidizole), the efficiency of mononucleotide polymerization is greater than that of oligonucleotide ligation. This would be somewhat unexpected because of several reasons including a perceived enhanced stability of the oligo on the template strand during the ligation reaction, compared to the stability of a single nucleotide on the template strand. But to show this, the authors compare the reactions #1 and #3 depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. The accompanying text states that, &quot;[…]the reacting nucleotides are the same in both cases: a G at the 3´ end of the primer and a G monomer or a G at the 5´ end of an oligonucleotide.&quot; But this is <italic>not</italic> the case: the oligomer in reaction #3 has an A on its 5´ end. This is particularly problematic because the authors make a big point about the lowered ability of A nucleotides to participate in ligation (or polymerization; the chemistry is the same) reactions compared to G. At first I thought it might be just a typo, but the same 5´-A appears in all of the subsequent helper trinucleotide oligomers. Unless I am reading this wrong, it appears as though the rationale for the rest of the project was thus based on a flawed premise.</p><p>Nevertheless, the balance of the manuscript did serve to convince me of the main result: that the activating group, and especially when placed on the 5´ ends of helper trinucleotides, can greatly facilitate monomer polymerization. This is indeed a significant result that should ultimately be meritorious of publication. I am always troubled by the artificiality of such imidazole-based activating groups, and thus I would ask the authors to comment on this more explicitly, and perhaps try other such activating groups. Would this work with a triphosphate or even with a 2´-3´-cyclic phosphate, the later has a clear prebiotic route to its synthesis as shown by Sutherland?</p><p>Obviously the flaw mentioned above about the G vs. A should also be addressed; this could be done for example by reformulating the rationale for the study (or showing me how I misunderstand the Figure/text correspondence).</p><p>On another point, the mechanism suggested by these data is reminiscent of &quot;substrate assisted catalysis&quot;, which at one point was posited to be involved in the mechanism of RNA-directed peptide-bond formation in the PTC of the ribosome. This could be discussed.</p><p>The fact that a trinucleotide emerges as the best catalyst (and in fact I disagree with the characterization in the third paragraph of Results that the reaction rate stays &quot;constant&quot; with the tetranucleotide; from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> there appears to be a significant drop) is intriguing. Could this be related to the thermodynamic &quot;sweet spot&quot; for iterative information transfer, as seen in the 3-bp codon-anticodon interaction?</p><p>I wonder what the effect of hot/cold or wet/dry cycles would have on polymerization as assisted in the proposed scheme.</p><p>My last major point is that the authors, in showing these data and proposing this chemistry, miss an opportunity to note that perhaps the elusive RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ribozyme (RNA replicase ribozyme) never existed. With substrate-assisted non-enzymatic template-directed RNA replication, one could envisage moving from a abiotic RNA monomer world to a protein world in a manner that obviates the need for an RNA replicase ribozyme.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Prywes et al. describe a major advance in the non-enzymatic template-directed polymerization of RNA, achieving dramatically faster reaction rates and much broader sequence generality compared to what has been achieved over the past 40 years of investigation. The authors uncover and exploit a heretofore unrecognized aspect of the templated polymerization of nucleoside 5'-phospho-2-methylimidazolides, involving catalysis by the nucleotide at the +1 position relative to the reacting nucleotide. Remarkably, the same 2-methylimidazole moiety that is the leaving group on the reacting nucleotide also has a catalytic effect at the +1 position. Furthermore, this catalytic effect can be provided by an adjacent oligonucleotide that has the same modification, thereby ensuring template occupancy of the adjacent catalyst. Employing a set of trinucleotide catalysts that cover successive reading frames, it now is possible to add sequentially all four nucleotides in good yield. Furthermore, if the trinucleotide catalysts are provided sequentially rather than as a mixture, even longer sequences can be synthesized, including 12 nucleotides that constitute a portion of the hammerhead ribozyme.</p><p>This manuscript is an important contribution to nucleic acid chemistry and origins-of-life research.

The system described enabled the template directed synthesis of an active hammerhead ribozyme. This work is the first to report the nonenzymatic synthesis of a catalytic RNA using activated monomers. Prebiotic chemists have sought the means to simply and robustly copy all four RNA monomers for decades, with mostly limited success, for A and U in particular. Moreover, it has become increasingly apparent that the limitations imposed by A and U are nuanced, extending beyond simply diminished binding affinities. In keeping with the subtle nature of these systems, the authors have taken a known, but poorly understood, feature of 2-Me-imidazolide activated nucleoside phosphate monomers noted by Orgel, and applied it in a heretofore unanticipated manner. The authors surprising initially discovered that the rate of 2-MeImpN oligomerization exceeded the rate of activated trinucleotide ligation by nearly 100-fold, despite the greater template binding affinity of the trimer. On further investigation it became evident that consecutive 2-MeImp groups in subsequent monomers led to the enhanced rate, and, ultimately, the unusual discovery that an 2-MeImp activated trinucleotide enhanced the rate of monomer addition due to the neighboring 2-MeImp group. Thus, while Orgel had earlier shown that at least two consecutive 2-MeImpN monomers were required for efficient template directed synthesis, it was not possible to anticipate the effectiveness of the presently reported system for a variety of reasons, not least because it involves an activated trinucleotide rather than activated monomers, and historically there appeared little hope for efficient synthesis with A and U, consecutive 2-MeImp activating groups notwithstanding. The prospects of simplifying the reported system even further in future work are very exciting for the field.</p><p>Introduction, first and second paragraphs.
