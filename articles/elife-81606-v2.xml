Such host–virus interactions can drive host gene adaptation, leaving signatures of pathogen-driven evolution in host genomes. Here, we leverage these genetic signatures to identify the dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like (NINL), as a critical component in the antiviral innate immune response and as a target of viral antagonism. Unique among genes encoding components of active dynein complexes, NINL has evolved under recurrent positive (diversifying) selection, particularly in its carboxy-terminal cargo-binding region. Consistent with a role for NINL in host immunity, we demonstrate that NINL knockout cells exhibit an impaired response to interferon, resulting in increased permissiveness to viral replication. Moreover, we show that proteases encoded by diverse picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave and disrupt NINL function in a host- and virus-specific manner. Our work reveals the importance of NINL in the antiviral response and the utility of using signatures of host–virus genetic conflicts to uncover new components of antiviral immunity and targets of viral antagonism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans and viruses are locked in an evolutionary arms race. Viruses hijack cells, using their resources and proteins to build more viral particles; the cells fight back, calling in the immune system to fend off the attack. Both actors must constantly and quickly evolve to keep up with each other. This genetic conflict has been happening for millions of years, and the indelible marks it has left on genes can serve to uncover exactly how viruses interact with the organisms they invade.</p><p>One hotspot in this host-virus conflict is the complex network of molecules that help to move cargo inside a cell. This system transports elements of the immune system, but viruses can also harness it to make more of themselves. Scientists still know very little about how viruses and the intracellular transport machinery interact, and how this impacts viral replication and the immune response.</p><p>Stevens et al. therefore set out to identify new interactions between viruses and the transport system by using clues left in host genomes by evolution. They focused on dynein, a core component of this machinery which helps to haul molecular actors across a cell. To do so, dynein relies on adaptor molecules such as 'Ninein-like', or NINL for short.</p><p>Closely examining the gene sequence for NINL across primates highlighted an evolutionary signature characteristic of host-virus genetic conflicts; this suggests that the protein may be used by viruses to reproduce, or by cells to fend off infection.</p><p>And indeed, human cells lacking the NINL gene were less able to defend themselves, allowing viruses to grow much faster than normal. Further work showed that NINL was important for a major type of antiviral immune response. As a potential means to sabotage this defence mechanism, some viruses cleave NINL at specific sites and disrupt its role in intracellular transport.</p><p>Better antiviral treatments are needed to help humanity resist old foes and new threats alike. The work by Stevens et al. demonstrates how the information contained in host genomes can be leveraged to understand what drives susceptibility to an infection, and to pinpoint molecular actors which could become therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>host–virus evolution</kwd><kwd>innate antiviral immunity</kwd><kwd>microtubule-based transport</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>viral antagonist</kwd><kwd>viral protease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM133633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daugherty</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM141825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Donté Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reck-Peterson</surname><given-names>Samara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Donté Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stevens</surname><given-names>Donté Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biomedical Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daugherty</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daugherty</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolution-guided functional analyses identify an activating adaptor of the dynein intracellular transportation machinery, NINL, as a novel component of the antiviral immune response and reveal a mechanism by which viruses antagonize NINL function in a species-specific manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses interact directly with host proteins at nearly every step of their replication cycle. Such molecular interactions can either benefit the host (e.g<italic>.,</italic> immune recognition) or the virus (e.g<italic>.,</italic> viral co-option of host machinery or viral antagonism of host immunity) and are thus critical determinants of the outcome of a viral infection. Competing genetic innovations on both sides of these host–virus conflicts result in signatures of recurrent adaptation that have been described as molecular ‘arms races’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duggal and Emerman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tenthorey et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, many host antiviral factors that directly interact with viral proteins display signatures of recurrent positive (diversifying) selection over evolutionary time, and genetic variation in these host–virus interactions shapes species-specific susceptibility to circulating and emerging pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duggal and Emerman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tenthorey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothenburg and Brennan, 2020</xref>). These data suggest that there is great potential to use evolutionary signatures of rapid evolution not only as an approach to more deeply understand known host–virus conflicts but also as a means to discover new proteins engaged in viral interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>). Compellingly, it is estimated that around 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in humans result from viral selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enard and Petrov, 2018</xref>), suggesting that many host–virus conflicts remain undescribed.</p><p>One potential source of host–virus conflicts is over the active transport of macromolecules within the cell. The relatively large size of eukaryotic cells, coupled with the density of macromolecules in the cytoplasm, limits the effectiveness of diffusion to localize and transport large intracellular components, such as organelles, membrane vesicles, RNAs, and protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luby-Phelps, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seksek et al., 1997</xref>). Eukaryotic cells overcome this problem by actively transporting large intracellular cargos using dynein and kinesin motors, which move on microtubules in opposite directions. Aspects of viral infection, viral replication, and the host immune response all require microtubule-based transport. For example, viruses co-opt the microtubule cytoskeleton for cell entry, transport of viral components to sites of replication, remodeling of cellular compartments, and viral egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenburg and Zhuang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodding and Way, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Döhner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radtke et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, in response to infection, the host adaptive and innate immune response require movement of signaling components, transport of endocytic and exocytic vesicles, organelle recycling, and cellular remodeling, all of which require the microtubule-based trafficking machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ilan-Ber and Ilan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kast and Dominguez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Man and Kanneganti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mostowy and Shenoy, 2015</xref>). Despite the clear role of microtubule-based transport in both aiding and inhibiting viral replication, the degree to which host–virus genetic conflicts shape the basic biology of this machinery is poorly understood.</p><p>To uncover the role of this machinery in viral replication and the immune response, we set out to determine whether there were undescribed genetic conflicts between viruses and the intracellular transport machinery. Specifically, we focused on the dynein transport machinery, which traffics dozens of cellular cargos towards microtubule minus-ends (generally anchored to centrosomes near the nucleus). In human cells, only one dynein motor-containing gene, cytoplasmic dynein-1 (<italic>DYNC1H1</italic>), is responsible for long-distance transport in the cytoplasm. However, the active cytoplasmic dynein-1 complex (hereafter dynein) is composed of multiple dynein subunits, the multisubunit dynactin complex, and one of a growing list of activating adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, it is the activating adaptors that provide cargo specificity for dynein in addition to their essential role in activating robust processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olenick and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). However, the specific biological functions of most activating adaptors remain unknown.</p><p>We now show that one activating adaptor, ninein-like protein (NINL, also known as NLP), has evolved under recurrent positive selection in primates, making it unique among all analyzed dynein, dynactin, and activating adaptor genes. Based on the hypothesis that such an evolutionary signature in NINL could be the result of a previously undescribed host–virus interaction, we explored the function of NINL in the antiviral immune response. Using NINL knockout (KO) cells, we find that NINL is important for limiting viral infection, especially in the presence of the antiviral signaling cytokine, type I interferon (IFN). We further demonstrate that this attenuation of the antiviral efficacy of IFN in NINL KO cells is due to a dramatic reduction in interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) production, likely as a consequence of decreased nuclear localization of phosphorylated STAT1 following IFN treatment. Finally, we show that diverse proteases from picornaviruses and coronaviruses cleave NINL at several host-specific sites, resulting in a disruption of NINL’s ability to traffic cargo. Together, our results reveal a novel immune function for NINL as well as a means by which viruses may antagonize NINL function in a virus- and host-specific manner. More broadly, our work implicates a component of the dynein transport machinery as a rapidly evolving barrier to viral replication and highlights the utility of an evolution-guided approach for discovery of new host–virus interactions and the genetic conflicts that may arise from them.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The dynein activating adaptor, NINL, has evolved under positive selection</title><p>Active dynein complexes in human cells are large, multisubunit machines. The dynein/dynactin complex is composed of two copies of the ATPase-containing heavy chain, two copies of five additional dynein chains, the 23-subunit dynactin complex, and an activating adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olenick and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To generate hypotheses about potential genetic conflicts between the dynein machinery and pathogens, we searched for signatures of positive selection during primate evolution in genes for all dynein/dynactin subunits and the 13 activating adaptors known at the time of this analysis. Each human dynein gene was compared to orthologs in 13–20 diverse simian primates, and a gene-wide dN/dS (also known as omega) value was calculated, which compares the gene-wide rate of nonsynonymous changes (i.e., amino acid altering) to the rate of synonymous (i.e., silent) changes. Consistent with the critical role of dynein-mediated intracellular transport, most genes we analyzed were extremely well conserved with dN/dS values of &lt;0.1, while one dynein activating adaptor, NINL, showed an elevated rate compared to the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To determine whether any genes had individual codons that have been subject to recurrent positive selection, we performed codon-based analyses of positive selection. Consistent with their low dN/dS values, we observed that most dynein, dynactin, and activating adaptor genes showed no evidence for positive selection (p-value&gt;0.05). In contrast, NINL showed strong evidence for recurrent positive selection in primates, consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), establishing the possibility that NINL could be at the interface of a host–pathogen interaction.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The dynein activating adaptor, ninein-like (NINL), has evolved under positive selection in primates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the cytoplasmic dynein-1 transport machinery, which includes dynein and dynactin subunits (blue) and an activating adaptor (orange).

Most (24 of 30) of these codons are excluded from the known dynein/dynactin-binding region of NINL (residues 1–702) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>) and instead are located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein that is expected to interact with cargo (residues 703–1382). When we analyzed individual domains on their own, we found no evidence for positive selection in the amino-terminus alone, while the carboxy-terminus retained a significant signature of positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Taken together, our evolutionary analyses indicate that NINL stands out among components of the active dynein complex by having evolved under recurrent positive selection in primates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Viral replication is increased in cells lacking NINL</title><p>Our observation that NINL displays a signature of positive selection that is unique among dynein components led us to hypothesize that NINL may be co-opted by viruses for viral replication or may play a role in the immune response to viruses. To evaluate this hypothesis, we generated a human A549 cell line that lacked NINL (NINL KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) as A549 cells are susceptible to infection with many viruses and mount an effective antiviral response after treatment with IFN. At a qualitative level, these cells appeared to have a normal microtubule architecture and centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In parallel, we generated cells that lacked ninein (NIN KO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the closest human paralog to NINL, which shares a similar domain architecture with NINL and is also a dynein activator adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>), but shows no evidence for positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To evaluate the effect that NINL or NIN have on viral replication or the innate immune response to viral infection, we infected WT, NINL KO, or NIN KO A549 cells with a model enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), with and without pretreatment with the antiviral signaling cytokine interferon alpha (IFNα). Consistent with the strong antiviral effect of IFNα, we observed a &gt;100-fold decrease in viral replication in WT and NIN cells that had been pretreated with IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, we observed that the effect of IFNα was significantly attenuated in NINL KO cells, where we found that IFNα pretreatment reduced VSV replication &lt;10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To attribute the changes in viral replication to the absence of NINL rather than off-target perturbations or cell-line specific effects, we generated additional NINL KO cell lines in human U-2 OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). We again observed that NINL KO cells had a significant reduction in the antiviral effects of IFNα pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), although the magnitude of the IFN effect varied between cell types likely due to cell type-specific differences in basal and induced ISG expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rusinova et al., 2013</xref>). We also noted that VSV replication was higher in NINL KO cell lines compared to WT even in the absence of IFN, which may indicate either a basal defect in the antiviral response in NINL KO cells or a second function of NINL that is IFN independent. To test whether the NINL-dependent effect on IFN antiviral potency was specific to VSV replication, we tested two positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses: Sindbis virus (SinV) – an enveloped virus – and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) – a non-enveloped virus in both A549 and U-2 OS cells. Each virus was sensitive to the antiviral effect of IFN in WT and NIN KO cells, although the degree of sensitivity was different for each virus as would be expected due to known differences in viral sensitivity to different ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schoggins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). However, with both SinV and CVB3, as we observed with VSV, the antiviral effect of IFN was reduced in NINL KO cells compared to WT or NIN KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).

Type I IFNs, such as IFNα, activate the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway to trigger the expression of ISGs, which include potent antiviral effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoggins, 2019</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether there was a defect in the JAK/STAT signaling cascade by western blot analysis of the phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT1 (pSTAT1(Y701)) and STAT2 (pSTAT2(Y690)) as well as the induction of ISG expression following IFNα pretreatment. Despite robust phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to IFNα pretreatment in WT, NINL KO, and NIN KO cells, protein expression of the canonical ISGs–MX1, IFIT3, OAS1, and ISG15 was greatly reduced in NINL KO cells relative to WT or NIN KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To again confirm that this was not specific to cell type, we showed that this lack of ISG protein expression was independent of cell background or the choice of CRISPR guide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We then compared the transcriptional profiles of these ISGs between IFNα-treated WT, NINL KO, and NIN KO cells.

We found the same differential response to the J3 VacV mutant between WT and NINL KO cells in U-2 OS cells, showing that this phenotype is not cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that NINL plays a critical role during the IFN-mediated antiviral immune response, further substantiating our hypothesis that NINL is at the center of an antagonistic host–pathogen interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NINL KO cells have reduced pSTAT1 nuclear localization</title><p>Based on our observations that NINL KO cells have an attenuated IFN-mediated antiviral immune response, we next sought to determine where in the IFN signaling cascade NINL acts. Upon initiation of JAK/STAT signaling, STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated, heterodimerize, and bind to IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the heterotrimeric interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). ISGF3 then translocates to the nucleus and binds to the IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) found in the promoters of ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Thus far, our data suggest that NINL acts after the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but before ISG transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine whether pSTAT1 translocates to the nucleus normally in NINL KO cells, we next examined the localization of pSTAT1 in WT, NIN, and NINL KO A549 cells. In both WT and NIN KO cells, pretreatment with IFNα led to the translocation of pSTAT1 to the nucleus as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, in NINL KO cells we observed diffuse cytoplasmic staining of pSTAT1 after treatment with IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To quantify this observation, we measured the mean nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity of pSTAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We then plotted the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic mean fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Thus, viruses have developed many strategies to evade or subvert the host IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beachboard and Horner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoffmann et al., 2015</xref>). Our data indicating that NINL is important for the IFN response, combined with the observation that NINL is evolving under positive selection, led us to hypothesize that viruses may antagonize NINL function. One such viral antagonism strategy is to deploy virus-encoded proteases to cleave components of the host antiviral defense system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lei and Hilgenfeld, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsu et al., 2021b</xref>). Thus, we next investigated whether viral proteases cleave NINL. Using a predictive model of enteroviral 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>) target specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsu et al., 2021a</xref>), we identified three high-confidence sites of potential cleavage within NINL at residues 231, 827, and 1032 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) in which amino acid diversity within primates is expected to alter 3C<sup>pro</sup> cleavage susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, upon transfection of NINL and CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> into HEK293T cells, which were used for their ease of transfection and protein expression, we observed an overall reduction of full-length NINL and the appearance of two cleavage products at sizes that correspond to predicted cleavage at sites 827 and 1032 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). We also observed a weaker product at a size that corresponds to the predicted size of NINL after cleavage at site 231. To confirm cleavage site specificity, we generated NINL point mutants that take advantage of the diversity of these sites found in primates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Specifically, we replaced the glutamine immediately preceding the site of cleavage (the P1 position) with an arginine found in non-human primates that we predicted would prevent cleavage by 3C<sup>pros</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsu et al., 2021a</xref>) for each of the predicted sites. Co-transfection of CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> with NINL containing these mutations individually (Q1032R) or in combination (double mutant Q827R/Q1032R [Double] and triple mutant Q231R/Q827R/Q1032R [Triple]) confirmed the sites of cleavage, with the NINL triple mutant eliminating all cleavage products by CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also noted that two of these sites (Q827 and Q1032), along with many of the codons predicted to be evolving under positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), reside in a single exon (exon 17) within the carboxy-terminal region of NINL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Intriguingly, this exon is lacking in an alternatively spliced isoform of NINL (isoform 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kersten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Wijk et al., 2009</xref>). We, therefore, tested whether isoform 2 is cleaved by CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup>.

Interestingly, while we found that all proteases tested were able to cleave NINL to some degree, the strength and position of cleavage was variable, even among proteases from closely related viruses such CVB3, enterovirus 71 (EV71), poliovirus (PV1), enterovirus D68 (EV68), and human rhinovirus A (HRVA), all of which are members of the enterovirus genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also tested a panel of 3C-like proteases (3CL<sup>pros</sup>) from members of the Coronaviridae family, including proteases from the betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and an alphacoronavirus, NL63-CoV.

Such host- and virus-specificity of cleavage is a hallmark of host–virus arms races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsu et al., 2021b</xref>), further supporting the model that NINL’s role in the interferon response positions it in evolutionary conflict with viruses.</p><p>We next aimed to confirm that infection-mediated cleavage efficiency and specificity recapitulated results we observed from transiently transfected viral proteases.

However, in the context of the interferon response, we have not yet identified a NINL cargo. Thus, we chose to reconstitute NINL’s role in dynein-mediated microtubule transport using a heterologous approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kapitein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Passmore et al., 2021</xref>). This well-established method uses an inducible heterodimerization system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) to induce the movement of normally immotile peroxisomes by recruiting dynein via an activating adaptor to the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, a rapamycin-binding FKBP domain was targeted to peroxisome membranes via the peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS1) of human PEX3. Another rapamycin-binding FRB domain was fused to the NINL and the NINL triple mutant constructs. We truncated the NINL constructs at residue 1062 because some activating adaptors are autoinhibited via interactions between their amino- and carboxy-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Terawaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>). Co-transfection of cells with CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup>, PEX3-mEmerald-FKBP, and WT NINL or the uncleavable NINL triple mutant confirmed that WT NINL is cleaved by CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup>, while the NINL triple mutant is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When we introduced these constructs into human U-2 OS cells, taking advantage of their flat epithelial-like morphology that is ideal for imaging, we found that peroxisomes were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), but redistributed to the centrosome upon the addition of the rapamycin analog, rapalog (which induces dimerization of FRB and FKBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). In contrast, when NINL was co-expressed with CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup>, peroxisomes no longer localized to the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>).

Finally, to determine whether viral infection could also disrupt NINL-mediated trafficking, we infected cells with CVB3 following transfection of PEX3-mEmerald-FKBP, and WT NINL or the uncleavable NINL triple mutant. Similar to transfection with viral protease, live CVB3 infection led to a significant reduction in peroxisomes that localized to the centrosome in cells expressing NINL, but not in cells expressing the uncleavable NINL triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Each of these points of conflict, which center on direct interactions between viral and host proteins, has the potential to determine the degree to which a virus replicates and causes pathogenesis in a host cell, and the degree to which the immune system can inhibit viral replication. As such, evolutionary adaptation in both host and viral genomes shapes these molecular interactions, leaving behind signatures of rapid evolution that can serve as beacons for points of host–virus interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duggal and Emerman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tenthorey et al., 2022</xref>). Here we use this evolutionary principle to reveal an antiviral role for the dynein activating adaptor NINL. Unique among 36 analyzed dynein, dynactin, and activating adaptor genes, we found that NINL displays a signature of recurrent positive selection in primates. Based on this unusual evolutionary signature in an otherwise highly conserved cellular machine, we hypothesized that NINL may be engaged in an undescribed host–pathogen genetic conflict. Using multiple cell types and knockout clones, we reveal that loss of NINL results in reduced activation of the antiviral innate immune response following IFNα treatment. Consequently, in NINL KO cells several RNA and DNA viruses show significantly increased replication after IFNα pretreatment relative to WT cells. These results indicate that NINL plays an important role in the antiviral immune response.</p><p>Further work will be required to determine the mechanistic basis for NINL’s antiviral function. The role of activating adaptors in inducing processive dynein motility was only described in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schlager et al., 2014</xref>). Since that time, the number of established activating adaptors has rapidly expanded, as has our understanding of the molecular interactions between activating adaptors and dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cason et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaaban and Carter, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olenick and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>). However, for many activating adaptors, including NINL, much less is known about cargo specificity. Our observation that NINL KO cells have a defect in ISG production following IFNα treatment suggests a role for NINL in the IFN signaling pathway. These results are consistent with recent gene enrichment analyses implicating NINL in several immune pathways, including JAK-STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). We further showed that despite normal phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 transcription factors following IFNα treatment, pSTAT1 nuclear accumulation is reduced in NINL KO cells, suggesting that NINL is important for the nuclear localization of pSTAT1. However, whether a signaling complex is a direct cargo of NINL, or whether NINL’s interaction with dynein and dynactin is required for this function, remain to be determined. Notably, we observe several transcriptional changes in NINL KO cells relative to WT cells, suggesting that NINL plays regulatory roles in the cell beyond our observation of its role in the IFN effect. Like other activating adaptors, understanding the full range of cargos and biological functions of NINL will require additional studies.</p><p>Despite the uncertainty of NINL’s mechanistic role in the antiviral immune response, we find that several viruses can antagonize NINL function through proteolytic cleavage. Using the model enterovirus, CVB3, we show that the virally encoded 3C protease (3C<sup>pro</sup>) cleaves human NINL at three independent sites, all of which toggle between cleavable and uncleavable even among closely related primates. These changes within the cleavage sites of NINL in primates suggest that virally encoded proteases are one potential evolutionary pressure that is driving the rapid evolution of NINL, similar to other molecular arms races between viral proteases and host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsu et al., 2021b</xref>). Related 3C<sup>pros</sup> from other picornaviruses, as well as 3CL<sup>pros</sup> from coronaviruses, also cleave NINL. Intriguingly, even closely related proteases, for instance, 3C<sup>pros</sup> within the enterovirus clade, have different site preferences within NINL, suggesting that viral protease evolution may be shaping its interactions with NINL. Indeed, among the diversity of picornavirus and coronavirus proteases we tested, we find that NINL cleavage is almost universally maintained despite a wide array of site preferences and cleavage efficiencies. These data indicate that numerous viral proteases convergently cleave NINL, reminiscent of other convergently antagonized targets in the innate antiviral response such as MAVS, TRIF, and NEMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsu et al., 2021b</xref>). Compellingly, cleavage of NINL by 3C<sup>pro</sup> during viral infection disrupts the NINL-mediated transport of a heterologous cargo. Along with our data indicating that one function of NINL is to potentiate the innate immune response, these data suggest that cleavage of NINL could be a host-specific mechanism employed by viruses to disrupt the antiviral immune response and promote their own replicative success.</p><p>Altogether, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging genetic signatures of pathogen-driven evolution to identify new components of host innate immunity. Our insights into the species-specific interactions between viruses and NINL provides a glimpse into the impact that viruses may have on the evolution of the intracellular transport machinery and identify a new role for a dynein activating adaptor in the antiviral immune response. These results indicate that components of the otherwise conserved cytoplasmic dynein transport machinery can be engaged in host- and virus-specific interactions and suggest intracellular transport could be an important battleground for host–virus arms races.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

analysis</title><p>For evolutionary analyses of dynein, dynactin, and activating adaptor genes, UniProt reference protein sequences were used as a search query against NCBI’s non-redundant (NR) database using tBLASTn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>). For each primate species, the nucleotide sequence with the highest bit score was downloaded and aligned to the human ORF nucleotide sequence using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>) implemented in Geneious software (Dotmatics; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.geneious.com/">https://www.geneious.com/</ext-link>). Poorly aligning sequences or regions were removed from subsequent analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) tests were performed with codeml in the PAML software suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang, 2007</xref>). Aligned sequences were subjected to ML tests using NS sites models disallowing (M7) or allowing (M8) positive selection. The p-value reported is the result of a chi-squared test on twice the difference of the log likelihood (lnL) values between the two models using two degrees of freedom. Analyses were performed using two models of frequency (F61 and F3x4) and both sets of values are reported. For each codon model, we confirmed convergence of lnL values by performing each analysis using two starting omega (dN/dS) values (0.4 and 1.5). For evolutionary analyses of the isolated NINL amino-terminal (dynein/dynactin binding) and carboxy-terminal (cargo binding) regions, the full-length alignment was truncated to only include codons 1–702 or 703–1382, respectively, and PAML analyses were performed as described above.</p><p>We used three independent methods to estimate codons within NINL that have been subject to positive selection. PAML was used to identify positively selected codons with a posterior probability greater than 0.90 using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis and the F61 codon frequency model. The same NINL alignment was also used as input for FEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005</xref>) and MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murrell et al., 2012</xref>) using the DataMonkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weaver et al., 2018</xref>) server. In both cases, default parameters were used and codons with a signature of positive selection with a p-value of &lt;0.1 are reported. In all cases, codon numbers correspond to the amino acid position and residue in human NINL (NCBI accession NM_025176.6).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>For the plasmid-based CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of NIN and NINL, we designed gRNA target sequences with the web tool CHOPCHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Labun et al., 2016</xref>), available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/</ext-link>, and synthesized oligonucleotides from Eton Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Each oligonucleotide pair was phosphorylated and annealed using the T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Duplexed oligonucleotides were ligated into BbsI (New England Biolabs) digested pSpCas9(BB)-2A- Puro (pX459) V2.0, a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid #62988), using the Quick Ligase kit (New England Biolabs). For cleavage assays, the coding sequence of human NINL isoform 1 (NCBI accession NM_025176.6) was subcloned from the previously described pcDNA5/FRT/TO-BioID-NINL-3xFLAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>) and inserted into pcDNA5/FRT/TO with as part of the following cassette: mCherry-P2A-3xFLAG-NINL-Myc. NINL mutants (Q1032R, Q827/1032R, Q231/827/1032R), human NINL isoform 2 (NCBI accession NM_001318226.2) and the NINL isoform 2 mutant (Q231R) were mutagenized using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). The plasmids encoding 3C proteases (coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, catalytically inactive [C147A] CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup>, enterovirus A71 [EV71] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, poliovirus 1 [PV1] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, enterovirus D68 [EV68] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, human rhinovirus A [HRVA] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, encephalomyocarditis virus [EMCV] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, parechovirus A [Parecho] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, hepatitis A virus [HepA] 3C<sup>pro</sup>, and salivirus A [Sali] 3C<sup>pro</sup>) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsu et al., 2021a</xref>). To ensure that 3CL<sup>pros</sup> have precise amino- and carboxy-termini as a result of self-cleavage, sequences for 3CL proteases (SARS2 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, SARS1 3CL<sup>pro</sup>, and NL63 3CL<sup>pro</sup>), including nine residues from the upstream coding region (nsp4) and downstream coding region (nsp6), were ordered as gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and cloned into the pQCXIP backbone flanked by an N-terminal eGFP and a C-terminal mCherry-HA sequence. Catalytically inactive (C145A) SARS2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> was made using overlapping stitch PCR. For the peroxisome trafficking assay, the peroxisomal membrane-targeting sequence (amino acids 1–42) of human PEX3 (NCBI accession NM_003630) with a carboxy-terminal mEmerald fluorescent protein and FKBP was subcloned from the previously described pcDNA5-PEX3-Emerald-FKBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Htet et al., 2020</xref>) and into the pcDNA3.1(+) backbone. 3xFLAG-Halo-NINL(1–1062)-Myc-FRB was synthesized as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) backbone. To generate an uncleavable mutant of this construct, we used sequential Q5 mutagenesis to achieve Q231/827/1032R. Following cloning, all plasmids were verified with whole plasmid sequencing. Plasmids and primers used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.

Transfected cells were enriched 48 hr post-transfection by culturing them with complete growth media supplemented with 1 μg/mL puromycin for 48 hr and then were allowed to recover for 24 hr in complete growth media without puromycin. Following enrichment of transfected cells, monoclonal cell lines were obtained by expanding single-cell clones isolated by limiting dilution. The resulting clones were screened via immunoblotting with gene-specific antibodies anti-NINL rabbit polyclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and anti-NIN mouse monoclonal antibody (LSBio, Seattle, WA). Clones determined to be knockouts via immunoblotting were screened further to confirm the presence of CRISPR-induced indels in each allele of the targeted gene.

A whole cell ROI was then manually drawn by adjusting the brightness/contrast module’s ‘Maximum’ slider to saturate cellular boundaries. The fluorescence intensity at the centrosome and throughout the cell was then quantified by applying each ROI to the PEX3-Emerald-FKBP/488 channel. The percentage of total fluorescence present at the centrosome was calculated by dividing the intensity of fluorescence at the centrosome by the intensity of fluorescence throughout the cell. The area of the centrosome ROI was then divided by the area of the whole cell ROI to calculate the percentage of the cell’s area that the centrosome ROI comprised. The fluorescence intensity ratio was then divided by the area ratio and plotted using GraphPad Prism.

However additional clarifications are required as outlined by the reviewers. In addition to the clarifications two additional experiments should be performed. First, the biochemical assay suggested by Reviewer #3. Second, it would be important to show where in the interferon signaling pathway NINL impacts. Epistasis experiments would clarify where NINL works to better understand the findings in the context of antiviral interferon signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the very positive comments on our work. We have amended our text and figures and performed additional experiments where appropriate at the suggestion of the reviewers to improve our paper.</p><p>In response to the biochemical assay suggested by Reviewer #2, please see our detailed explanation below. Briefly, we have encountered substantial solubility issues when attempting to purify full-length NINL from heterologous expression systems. As a result, in our manuscript we relied on in-cell cleavage assays with many specificity controls to establish that viral 3C<sup>pro</sup> activity is both necessary and sufficient for the site-specific cleavage of NINL. Trouble-shooting methods to obtain soluble NINL, which may not even be possible, would be well beyond the revision period that <italic>eLife</italic> aims for.</p><p>In response to the suggestion to determine where in the interferon signaling pathway NINL impacts, we have now included new figures (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), which demonstrate that NINL is required for the robust nuclear localization of pSTAT1. By finding that pSTAT1 nuclear localization is disrupted in NINL KO cells, these data provide a plausible mechanism by which NINL KO negatively impacts ISG production. These data also suggest that NINL facilitates nuclear localization of pSTAT1, which is consistent with its role as a cellular trafficking protein. Future experiments beyond the scope of this paper are required to understand the exact molecular interactions and molecular mechanism of this function of NINL. However, we believe these new data reveal that NINL impacts the interferon signaling pathway at the point of nuclear translocation of pSTAT1, following STAT phosphorylation but prior to ISG transcription. We have illustrated this new conclusion in Figure 4C.</p><p>Inclusion of these data prompted us to add Dr. Hiroyuki Hakozawki as an additional author on the manuscript. Dr. Hakozawki helped us with the analysis of the microscopy data shown in Figure 4. All authors approve of the addition and place in the author list.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper indicates the role of NINL in the IFN signaling pathway.

According to the context, this word can mean &quot;Co-evolution&quot; (Line 54), &quot;interaction&quot; (Line 105) or &quot;viral exposure&quot; (Line 94).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have modified the manuscript throughout to clarify when we are referring genetic conflicts (i.e. two genomes competing against each other) versus specific host-virus molecular interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2-supplement 1G, the lines indicating cell types may need to be corrected to match the lanes.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer is referring to Figure 2—figure supplement 1D. We have adjusted these lines and thank the reviewer for noticing this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4D: It would be better to enlarge the Myc panel to match the lanes to the other three.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. This change is now reflected in the new Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Tagging affects protease activities or not.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5 (previously Figure 4), we test the cleavage of NINL by tagged and overexpressed CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> (panel D) compared to cleavage of NINL during CVB3 infection (panel E). In this case, the protease expressed during viral infection (without any epitope tags) cleaves with similar specificity and intensity as tagged overexpressed protease. These results indicate that a tagged 3C<sup>pro</sup> has similar protease activity as the protease expressed during viral infection. We have not tested the effect of tagging on other 3C<sup>pros</sup>, although we believe this result with CVB3 suggests tagging is unlikely to impact 3C<sup>pro</sup> activity. Our 3CL<sup>pros</sup> are expressed as fusion proteins flanked by their natural polyprotein cleavage sites. As a result, after the protease cleaves itself out of the fusion construct, it is untagged since the HA tag remains on the liberated C-terminal mCherry domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. What is the indication of the smaller change of NINL isoform 2 upon cleavage by CVB3 3Cpro?</p></disp-quote><p>We are somewhat unclear on what the reviewer is asking for. One possibility is the reviewer is asking why there is little to no decrease in the band intensity of full length NINL isoform 2 after cleavage by CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> relative to the obvious decrease in band intensity of full length NINL isoform 1 after cleavage. If that is the question, then we would point out that isoform 2 lacks the two strongest cleavage sites for CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> (Q827 and Q1032) since the exon (exon 17) containing those sites is spliced out of isoform 2. As a result, the only site remaining in isoform 2 for cleavage by CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> is Q231, which we find to be only weakly cleaved relative to Q827 and Q1032 as observed in the Figure 5D and 5E (previously Figure 4D and 4E). A schematic of this, including positions of cleavage, position of the spliced out exon, and the expected molecular weight of full length and cleaved isoform 1 and isoform 2 are shown in Figure 5C (previously 4C). If the reviewer is instead asking about the size differences in the cleavage products observed in isoform 2 after cleavage, the observed sizes of the cleavage products match those predicted and illustrated in Figure 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lines 299 to 301: add a figure illustration of the truncation on NINL and the autoinhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a schematic in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 (previously Figure 5 —figure supplement 1) to illustrate the comparison of full length NINL to the construct we used in the peroxisome assay as the reviewer suggested. We did not include information about the autoinhibition because it has not been formally shown that the carboxy-terminal region of NINL is autoinhibitory. The decision to truncate NINL at amino acid 1062 was made based on the fact that some dynein activating adaptors are regulated by autoinhibition by carboxy-terminal coiled coils. For example, the BICD family of dynein activating adaptors have a carboxy-terminal region that folds back on itself and interacts with the amino-terminal region, occluding the dynein/dynactin binding interface. While we have preliminary data that NINL could exist in a similar autoinhibited state, further studies outside of the scope of this paper are required to prove that autoinhibition is occurring with NINL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. For the trafficking assay in Figure 5 and 6, did the transportation of peroxisome affect cell proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>The induced peroxisome motility assays are done in a time frame of one hour prior to fixation. This timeframe is too short for us to determine the effect of peroxisome motility on cell proliferation, which would require days. Based on this timing, we also believe that any effects we see in the peroxisome assay are not confounded by any potential cell proliferation effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. For the trafficking assay, did you try another viral 3Cpro and corresponding viral infection? The 3Cpro of CVB3 has the highest cleavage activity among the 3Cpros tested in the previous cleavage assay. Although the result may not be as clear-cut, it would be good to be included to see similar peroxisome re-distribution with another 3Cpro-viral infection example.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention with the inducible peroxisome trafficking assay was to establish that site-specific cleavage of NINL by a viral protease could disrupt NINL’s role in cargo transport. As the reviewer mentions, CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> was ideal for these experiments as we show that it has some of the highest cleavage activity of the proteases tested. Additionally, we have extensively mapped and verified the site specificity of CVB3 3C<sup>pro</sup> over the NINL amino acid sequence, allowing us to generate uncleavable mutants that serve as essential controls. As noted in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A (previously Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), the cleavage position was variable amongst the picornaviral 3C<sup>pros</sup> tested. Thus, to perform the suggested experiment, we would need to iteratively map, clone, and verify NINL mutants resistant to cleavage by specific viral 3C<sup>pros</sup>, something that we feel is beyond the scope of <italic>eLife’s</italic> suggested revision time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
