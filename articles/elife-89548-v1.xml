in each cell cycle. The origins are believed to be specified by binding of factors like the origin recognition complex (ORC) or CTCF or other features like G-quadruplexes. We have performed an integrative analysis of 113 genome-wide human origin profiles (from five different techniques) and five ORC-binding profiles to critically evaluate whether the most reproducible origins are specified by these features. Out of ~7.5 million union origins identified by all datasets, only 0.27% (20,250 shared origins) were reproducibly obtained in at least 20 independent SNS-seq datasets and contained in initiation zones identified by each of three other techniques, suggesting extensive variability in origin usage and identification. Also, 21% of the shared origins overlap with transcriptional promoters, posing a conundrum. Although the shared origins overlap more than union origins with constitutive CTCF-binding sites, G-quadruplex sites, and activating histone marks, these overlaps are comparable or less than that of known transcription start sites, so that these features could be enriched in origins because of the overlap of origins with epigenetically open, promoter-like sequences. Only 6.4% of the 20,250 shared origins were within 1 kb from any of the ~13,000 reproducible ORC-binding sites in human cancer cells, and only 4.5% were within 1 kb of the ~11,000 union MCM2-7-binding sites in contrast to the nearly 100% overlap in the two comparisons in the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Thus, in human cancer cell lines, replication origins appear to be specified by highly variable stochastic events dependent on the high epigenetic accessibility around promoters, without extensive overlap between the most reproducible origins and currently known ORC- or MCM-binding sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>origins of replication</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>ORC</kwd><kwd>MCM2-7</kwd><kwd>integrative analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA60499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dutta</surname><given-names>Anindya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM133712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zang</surname><given-names>Chongzhi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 CA259526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Zhangli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ~20,000 origins of replication in human cell lines that are reproducibly identified by multiple techniques in multiple cell lines are distant from known origin recognition complex and MCM2-7-binding sites.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA replication is essential for the duplication of a cell and the maintenance of the eukaryotic genome. To replicate the human diploid genome of~3billion base pairs, efficient cellular programs are coordinated to ensure genetic information is accurately copied. In each human cell cycle, replication starts from~50,000 genomic locations called replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu and Stillman, 2023</xref>). At an origin of replication, the double-stranded DNA is unwound, and primase-DNA polymerase alpha lays down the first RNA primer extended as DNA. Once replication is initiated, the helicase involved in unwinding the origin continues to unwind DNA on either side and the replication proteins, including DNA polymerases, help copy the single-stranded DNA. Unlike yeast origins, human and most eukaryotic origins do not seem to have a clear DNA sequence preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu and Stillman, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard and Méchali, 2013</xref>). Yet it becomes clear that chromatin context and other DNA-based activity are important factors for human and non-yeast eukaryotic origin selection. A great amount of effort has been spent to understand how human origins are specified and sometimes different trends are observed regarding genomic features enriched at human origins. For example, G-quadruplex motifs were found to be associated with human origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besnard et al., 2012</xref>), but can only explain a small subset of origins even after controlling for technical biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foulk et al., 2015</xref>). To better resolve these issues, we reasoned that a systematic analysis of all available human origin-mapping datasets will help uncover potential technical and biological details that affect origin detection.</p><p>To profile replication origins genome-wide, several sequencing-based methods have been developed, including short nascent strand (SNS)-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foulk et al., 2015</xref>), Repli-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>), Rerep-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menzel et al., 2020</xref>), and Bubble-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mesner et al., 2013</xref>). SNS-seq assays across different human cell types identified a subset of origins that can explain ~80% of origins in any tested cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerman et al., 2020</xref>); however, no study has systematically examined the consistency within and between different origin-mapping techniques. These methods are based on different molecular capture strategies and therefore are expected to have technical biases. For instance, SNS-seq utilizes lambda exonuclease (λ-exo) to enrich RNA-primed newly replicated DNA by removing parental DNA fragments. However, the products may be contaminated with chromosomal DNA fragments or be affected by the cutting bias of λ-exo against guanine-cytosine (GC)-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foulk et al., 2015</xref>), although it has been proposed that one can experimentally correct and control for such biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerman et al., 2020</xref>). SNS-seq is the only method that yields origins at a resolution of a few hundred base pairs, with all other methods delineating larger initiation zones (IZs) that may have multiple origins. Repli-seq relies on nucleotide pulse labeling and antibody enrichment of newly replicated DNA superimposed on cells fractionated at different parts of the S phase by flow cytometry. Here the results may be contaminated by DNA non-specifically associated with the antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Rerep-seq only captures the new synthesized sequences that replicate more than once when replication is dysregulated, and these origins tend to be enriched in the early replicating, epigenetically open parts of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menzel et al., 2020</xref>). Bubble-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mesner et al., 2013</xref>) generates long reads because it captures the origin-containing replication intermediates by selection of DNA bubbles, and so may enrich origins that are flanked by pause sites. Okazaki-seq (OK-seq) identifies sites where the direction of the Okazaki fragments changes from leftward to rightward on the chromosome-revealing sites where the two lagging strands diverge from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>). Because the technical biases mentioned above are associated with specific techniques, we suspect that origins captured across different techniques are less likely to be affected by those biases. Given the large number of datasets in the public domain (&gt;100 datasets for human origins), this is an opportune time to study the reproducibility between the studies and determine the most reproducible and consistent origins identified by SNS-seq and confirmed by each of the other methods. This most reproducible group of origins (shared origins) from different research groups using different techniques and different cell lines will be far fewer than all the origins reported to date and minimize complications from stochastic (noisy) firing of origins, but they are the best expected to fit the current hypotheses regarding origin specification.</p><p>Yeast origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to double-stranded DNA with sequence specificity, helps load minichromosome maintenance protein complex (MCM), and thus prepares the origins for subsequent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell and Dutta, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa and Diffley, 2022</xref>). Consistent with this, the role of ORC in loading MCM proteins was also described in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rowles et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman et al., 1996</xref>). All of this leads to the expectation that in human cells there will be significant concordance between ORC-binding sites and efficient origins of replication. Efforts to define double-stranded DNA sequences bound specifically by human ORC find very little sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vashee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshina et al., 2013</xref>), and this may be responsible for the lack of sequence specificity in human origins. This difference between yeast and human ORC is attributed to sequence features in ORC4, one of the subunits of the ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). When a yeast-specific 19 amino acid insert was removed from yeast ORC4 to make it more like the human ORC4, the sequence specificity of ORC binding was lost even in yeast. Despite this loss of sequence specificity, the mutant yeast ORC loaded MCM proteins, and the yeast replicated DNA and survived. Thus, even if human origins of replication do not have specific sequences, one should expect some concordance between ORC-binding sites and the most reproducible origins of replication. An additional complexity is that genome-wide analysis found active origins and dormant origins determined by SNS-seq and OK-seq have little difference in ORC or MCM density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sugimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirstein et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, a few publications have reported significant MCM2-7 loading and DNA synthesis after genetic mutation of <italic>Drosophila ORC1</italic> and human <italic>ORC1</italic>, <italic>ORC2,</italic> or <italic>ORC5</italic> genes that reduce the expressed proteins to near undetectable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park and Asano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okano-Uchida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shibata and Dutta, 2020</xref>). In two of the instances, the DNA replication seen was in the context of endo-reduplication, a process that is still believed to require the loading of MCM2-7 and the activation of the same into an active CMG helicase. It should be noted, however, that sgRNA screens revealed that the <italic>ORC2</italic> gene was essential for viability in the cancer cell lines mutated for <italic>ORC2</italic>, suggesting that vanishingly small amounts of the <italic>ORC2</italic> gene product are required for some processes essential for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou et al., 2021</xref>). Definition of the most reproducible and consistent origins identified by different methods from different research groups in different cell lines thus provide a unique opportunity to determine how much overlap is seen between the highly reproducible human origins and the ORC-binding sites reported in the literature from ChIP-seq studies.</p><p>To understand the genome-wide distribution patterns of replication origins in an unbiased way, we performed an integrative analysis of 113 DNA replication origin datasets. Because SNS-seq is unique in identifying origins of a few hundred bases long, while the other methods identify larger IZs that contain origins, we first prepared a list of high-resolution SNS-seq origins that have been identified in at least 20 of the 66 SNS-seq datasets in this study. We next determined those reproducible SNS-seq origins that overlap with IZs identified by each of the three techniques (Repli-seq, OK-seq, and Bubble-seq) to identify 20,250 high-confidence origins that are shared between SNS-seq and every other method identifying IZs. Using these shared origins, which overlap significantly with transcription promoters, we tested whether G-quadruplex sites, CTCF-binding sites, ORC-binding sites, or MCM-binding sites help specify origins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A total of 7,459,709 origins from 113 datasets show similar but different genomic features associated with each origin-mapping technique</title><p>We collected 113 publicly available replication origin identification datasets in different human cell types from five different techniques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), including SNS-seq, Repli-seq, Rerep-seq, OK-seq, and Bubble-seq.

This is confirmed by pairwise correlations of the datasets, where it is evident that each method identifies origins that are best correlated with origins identified by that method alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the most popular technique, SNS-seq, shows some internal variability in the PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), it is also the one that is best correlated with origins identified by other SNS-seq datasets. Rerep-seq and Bubble-seq seem to identify IZs that are also better correlated with SNS-seq origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since Rerep-seq tends to identify the origins that are enriched in early replicating, gene-rich parts of the genome, this result suggests that SNS-seq and Bubble-seq also have some bias for origins in early replicating, gene-rich parts of the genome. However, we did not observe clear trends of clustering of origins identified in similar cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>), even when we focused only on SNS-seq origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). The one exception was the SNS-seq origins from T lymphoblasts, which were very closely clustered with each other in six datasets, but these were all done in the CCRF-CEM cell line (or a derivative) by one group at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murai et al., 2018</xref>). We only examined SNS-seq data from 2018 onward when the lambda exonuclease-based digestion step had been incorporated into SNS-seq protocols, but wondered whether there was a steady improvement of reproducibility as one progressed through the years. However, SNS-seq datasets do not become progressively more reproducible as one goes year-by-year from 2018 to 2022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). The results suggest that there is a significant difference in origins captured by different techniques that cannot be explained by differences in cell choices. For the most popular technique (SNS-seq), the variability may be least when confined to a single cell line studied at the same time by the same group.</p><p>We next checked the genomic characteristics of origins defined by each technique. Regardless of the technique used, around half of the detected origins fall in intergenic regions, followed by 30–40% allocated to introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We recently reported 40,110 genomic regions are routinely bound by more than 3000 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data, named as TF-binding hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2021</xref>). These TF-binding hotspots likely represent highly active open chromatin regions. Despite the differences among techniques, the origins in general have lower overlap with TF-binding hotspot (&lt;0.5%) compared to the 16% overlap of gene promoter regions (transcription start sites [TSS]± 100bp) with such TF-binding hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We further focused on one specific TF, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which is important in organizing DNA structure and reported to be associated with replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Su et al., 2020</xref>). Origins show significantly lower overlap with constitutive CTCF sites, defined as those that are conserved across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2020</xref>), compared to promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). G-quadruplexes are found to be correlated with both replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipps and Rhodes, 2009</xref>). However, compared to promoters, origins defined by these techniques show significantly lower GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). In addition, there is a significantly lower overlap of these origins with G-quadruplex sites identified from the predicted G-quadruplex motif regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedrat et al., 2016</xref>) compared to the overlap of promoters with G-quadruplex sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Thus, the reported correlations between CTCF-binding sites or G-quadruplexes with origins are not as striking as that of these features with promoters.</p><p>We found that all origins, regardless of the technique by which they are identified, are slightly enriched at gene promoters, exons, or introns compared with the genome background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Among the five different techniques, origins defined by Rerep-seq show the highest level of enrichment with promoters, TF hotspots, constitutive CTCF-binding sites and G-quadruplexes, and the highest GC content. This is consistent with our knowledge that areas of the genome that are re-replicated when the cell cycle is disturbed are enriched in parts of the genome that replicate early in the S phase, regions that are enriched in transcriptionally active (and thus epigenetically open) genes and their promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Shared origins are associated with active chromatin and transcription regulatory elements</title><p>To address the potential biases caused by each technique, we investigated how many of the ~5 million union SNS-seq origins are reproducible in SNS-seq data and confirmed by other sequencing-based techniques. As we will describe below, these shared origins show significant overlap with promoters. Because the Rerep-seq origins appear to be slightly different from the origins identified by other techniques, with the highest overlap with transcriptionally active genes and promoters, we decided to exclude the Rerep-seq from the analysis of shared origins and still reached the conclusion summarized above.</p><p>SNS-seq origins have the highest resolution. We used the following strategy to determine how many independent confirmations of an SNS-seq origin are sufficient for selecting an SNS-seq origin as a reproducible origin. The occupancy score of each origin defined by SNS-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>) counts the frequency at which a given origin is detected in the datasets under consideration. Plotting the number of union SNS-seq origins with various occupancy scores with all SNS-seq datasets published after 2018, we sought to determine whether the curve deviates from the random background at a given occupancy score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). For the random background, we assumed that the number of origins confirmed by increasing occupancy scores decreases exponentially (see ‘Methods’ and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The threshold occupancy score, to determine whether an origin is a reproducible origin, is the point where the observed number of origins deviates from the expected background number (with an empirical FDR &lt; 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), an occupancy score of 20. Thus, the reproducible SNS-seq origins (with an FDR &lt; 0.1) were those observed in at least 20 SNS-seq datasets.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The shared origins are enriched with certain transcription factors and active histone marks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Short nascent strand-seq (SNS-seq) origin-fitting distribution to an exponential model shows an occupancy score ≥20 is selected for reproducible SNS-seq origins.

These high-confidence shared origins consist of 0.27% of all ~7.5 million union origins. The coordinates of the shared origins are available in the supplementary files.</p><p>The shared origins have a greater overlap rate with gene promoters and exons compared to union origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). This is in line with the previous observation that replication and transcription are highly coordinated and enrichment of origins at TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karnani et al., 2010</xref>). Shared origins also have a substantially higher overlap rate than union origins with TF-binding hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Moreover, shared origins have a higher overlap rate with constitutive CTCF-binding sites compared to union origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and have a higher GC content and overlap with G-quadruplexes than union origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>).</p><p>BART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) analyzes the enrichment of TF-binding sites (determined experimentally by ChIP-seq) with areas of interest in the genome. We used BART to perform TF-binding site enrichment analysis on the shared origins and union origins and identified potential TFs or components of chromatin remodeling factors (e.g., PAF1, EZH2, ZNF282, POLR2A, GTF2I) whose binding sites are associated with the shared origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). The high enrichment of activators or repressors of transcription in the factors that have binding sites near the shared origins provides more support that the shared origins have properties similar to transcriptional promoters.</p><p>To investigate whether the shared origins have a specific chromatin epigenomic signature compared to union origins, we used 5711 publicly available ChIP-seq datasets for 29 different histone modifications and generated a comprehensive map of histone modification enrichment at shared origins compared to union origins. A substantial enrichment of activating histone marks, including H3K4me3 and H3/H4 acetylation, was observed at shared origins compared to union origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). The enrichment of H3K14ac is interesting given the enrichment in the BART analysis of binding sites of BRPF3, a protein involved in this specific acetylation and reported to stimulate DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2016</xref>), but this modification was not uniquely enriched at the shared origins. These results show that as we move from all origins to a small set of high-confidence shared origins, we see a progressive increase in the enrichment of TSS in epigenetically active parts of the genome.</p><p>However, transcriptional and epigenetic activators are not the whole story. H3K27me3, a repressive mark, is also enriched at shared origins, although this enrichment is not as high as that of the activating marks. The enrichment of EZH2-binding sites near the shared origins is consistent with this observation because EZH2 is part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, known to be a writer of H3K27me3. The paradoxical enrichment of repressive marks is consistent with the shared origins also being near the binding sites of MBD (binds methylated DNA and represses transcription), PATZ1 and ZNF282, proteins known to be repressors of transcription.</p><p>Having identified a small group of highly reproducible origins (independent of cell type and technique), we asked whether in a given cell line was one technique superior to the others in identifying such origins. K562 cells have been interrogated for origins by three different techniques: SNS-seq, OK-seq, and Repli-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Among the 20,250 high-confidence shared origins, 9901 (48.9%) overlapped with SNS-seq origins in K562, 3872 (19.1%) overlapped with OK-seq IZs in K562, and 1163 (5.7%) overlapped with Repli-seq origins in K562. This suggests that in one cell line even the large IZs defined by OK-seq or Repli-seq do not capture most of the high-confidence origins. In the opposite direction, where we estimate what fraction of origins found by a given technique fall in a reproducible origin, the opposite result emerges: 2.7% of SNS-seq origins, 17.2% of OK-seq IZs, and 7.7% of Repli-seq IZs overlapped with the 20,250 shared origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The following conclusions were reached: the shared (highly reproducible) origins are only a small subset of all origins identified and are in epigenetically active chromatin with a strong preference for promoters. However, G-quadruplexes, CTCF-binding sites, and ORC-binding sites are also enriched near the promoters, so although these genomic features are enriched near the shared origins, it is not clear whether these genomic features actually specify origins or whether they are simply enriched near origins because the origins are near the promoters. Finally, our results suggest that the co-localization of the shared origins with ORC- or MCM2-7- binding sites is very low, much lower than that in yeast, and so (a) the currently known binding sites of these proteins should not be used as surrogate markers of origins in human cells and (b) there is a great need to improve our methods of identifying isoforms of these proteins that are strictly functional for origin firing. The current models of origin firing require ORC to bind near origins, to load MCM2-7 nearby, and the latter to be converted into active helicase to fire origins. To rigorously test this model, we need examples of reproducible origins where these conditions are met, and our study helps identify 74 such sites where such experimental verification can be carried out.</p><p>A careful analysis shows that individual methods produce origin datasets that are more correlated with each other than across methods. The extensive variation of origins between datasets is likely because of background noise in all current techniques and because there is extreme stochasticity of origin selection during DNA replication in individual cells and cell cycles in the same population of cells from a human cell line in culture. There are also differences that are created due to the differences in cell lineage. Despite this, we could cut through those differences to focus on the small subset of shared origins that seem to be active in multiple cell lineages.</p><p>The shared origins are enriched with active histone marks and enriched in early replicating parts of the genome that are overwhelmingly in an active epigenetic environment. H3K4me3 has been reported to be enriched at replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cayrou et al., 2015</xref>), and it has also been reported that demethylation of H3K4me3 by KDM5C/JARID1C promotes origin active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rondinelli et al., 2015</xref>). H3ac/H4ac are also reported to be enriched at replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadoret et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2009</xref>), and this is regulated by various histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, H3K27me3 has also been reported to be enriched at replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cayrou et al., 2015</xref>). The higher enrichment of <italic>all</italic> activating histone modifications relative to the repressive histone modifications (including H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>) rather than individual types of modification suggests that the shared, highly reproducible origins are preferentially in epigenetically active euchromatin. This aligns well with the general enrichment of shared origins with TSSs and TF hotspots – which are concentrated in gene-dense, epigenetically open parts of the chromosomes. This also aligns well with the fact that the shared origins were not enriched for H3K9me3. H3K9me3 has been reported to be enriched near late replicating origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), while the shared origins are biased toward those that are in euchromatin. That origins, like TSS, prefer areas of the chromatin marked by activating epigenetic marks has been reviewed in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prioleau and MacAlpine, 2016</xref>). We arrive at the same conclusion even though we worked with the origins identified after this review, presumably with significant improvements in method and even though we focused on the most reproducible origins.</p><p>We characterized the genomic features of origins and found that the shared origins are more co-localized with TSS. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows a summary of the overlap of union origins, shared origins, and shared origins overlapping ORC-binding sites with various genomic features and compares this with the overlap of TSS with the same genomic features. Overall, these results suggest that as we proceed from all origins to shared origins to the highest confidence origins that are proximate to the ORC-binding sites, we see increasing overlap with promoters and early replicating, transcriptionally active, epigenetically open parts of the genome and that features thought to be important for origin selection (like G-quadruplexes, CTCF-binding sites, active chromatin, ORC-binding sites) could simply co-occur with origins because of their enrichment near the promoters (TSS).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Overlap of origins, transcription start sites (TSS), and origin recognition complex (ORC)-binding sites with the indicated features.</title><p>Summary of data to show the number of origins of different types, extent of overlap of each with different genomic features, and comparison with TSS (or promoters).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="5">% overlap with</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Number</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Promoter</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>TF hotspot</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>CTCF</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>GC content</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>G quad</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Union origins</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7,459,709</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.7</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">41.3333</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shared origins</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">20,250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">21.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.82</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">53</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">43.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shared origins with shared ORC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1300</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">46.7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.54</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">54</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">45.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">TSS ±-100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">26,237</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15.9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6.4</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">61.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">48.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shared ORC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">12,712</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">32.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">20.7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">53.1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">44.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To rigorously test whether the overlaps of shared origins that we observe with various genomic features are significantly above the background, we performed a permutation test that evaluates whether the observed overlap is significantly above the mean expected overlap when the experimental dataset is randomized 1000 times (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

because they have been experimentally shown to dictate origin specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prorok et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Valton et al., 2014</xref>). Although there is a higher overlap of shared origins than union origins with G-quadruplexes (43.5% vs 15%), this overlap is not higher than that between promoters and G-quadruplexes (48.1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). This may suggest that the overlap between origins and G-quadruplexes may be secondary to the overlap between origins and promoters. However, the overlap of shared origins with G-quadruplexes is 3.5-fold above random while that of promoters with G-quadruplexes is only 1.3-fold above random, which would be consistent with the idea that G-quadruplexes have a role in specifying origins and the overlap is not simply due to the proximity of origins with promoters.</p><p>Similarly, CTCF-binding sites have been proposed to contribute to origin specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emerson et al., 2022</xref>). Here again, the 2.2% of shared origins that overlap with constitutive CTCF-binding sites is less than the 6.4% of promoters that overlap with CTCF-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Here, though, the permutation test in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> reveals that the enrichment of origins near the CTCF-binding sites (4.3-fold above random background) is comparable to the enrichment of promoters near the same sites (4.5-fold). This may, thus, suggest that the overlap of the CTCF-binding sites with origins is secondary to the overlap of origins with promoters.</p><p>Since ORC is an early factor for initiating DNA replication, shared human origins should be proximate to the reproducible ORC-binding sites. The vast majority of ORC-binding sites are not proximate to the shared origins and conversely only about 6.4% of the shared origins are proximate (within 1 kb) to the reproducible (shared) ORC-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Even with the most relaxed criteria, nearly 85% of the most reproducible origins in human cells are not proximate to any ORC-binding site (union, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). This low level of proximity contrasts with the ~100% of yeast origins that are within 1 kb of a yeast ORC-binding site. Even when we examined cell line-specific origins with the ORC ChIP-seq datasets from the same cell lines, the co-localization between origins and ORC-binding sites remained poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Another study also noted that only 13% of SNS-seq origins in K562 cells are near the ORC2-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>), but the authors suggested that this could occur if many SNS-seq sites are not real origins but arose from DNA breaks. Vast contamination of SNS-seq origins by sites of DNA breaks is discounted in our analysis because of the reproducibility of the shared origins in multiple labs, multiple lineages and multiple different techniques.</p><p>Instead of an unbiased determination of origins mapped by multiple groups to create a small set of reproducible origins, we could also empirically select a few well-curated origin datasets. Toward that end we used the core origins identified by lambda exonuclease SNS-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerman et al., 2020</xref>) and the Ini-seq2 origins identified by labeling nuclei in vitro to identify the earliest replicated parts of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilbaud et al., 2022</xref>). The shared origins were only a small subset of these origin datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a and c</xref>). The percentage of these origins that were near ORC was still far less than what we observed in yeast: 13.7% for core origins and 30.4% for Ini-seq2 origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b and d</xref>). The higher overlap with Ini-seq2 origins could be because in vitro initiation of replication in isolated nuclei in Ini-seq preferentially identifies origins in early replicating, euchromatic parts of the genome, areas that have already been reported to be more enriched for the ORC2-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>There could be other explanations for the poor overlap of shared origins with the ORC-binding sites. We tested whether increasing the stringency of reproduction in SNS-seq data will produce more reproducible origins that are better co-localized with the ORC-binding sites. However, when we reduced the shared origins based on their reproduction by 30, 40, or 50 (out of 66) SNS-seq datasets, we did not see a marked improvement of their co-localization with currently known ORC-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>) and MCM-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4c and d</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the permutation test in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> demonstrates that the co-localization of origins with ORC-binding sites was 6.5-fold (p&lt;0.001) greater than random expectation but this was less than the co-localization of promoters with ORC-binding sites, 10.6-fold greater than random (p&lt;0.001). Thus, the co-localization data cannot conclusively say whether ORC binding near an origin is because ORC specifies origins, or whether this is secondary to origins being co-localized near promoters. Note that the co-localization of ORC1-binding sites and origins in HeLa cells with highly active TSS has been noted in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dellino et al., 2013</xref>). In human lymphoblast Raji cells, ORC was enriched in promoters and MCM was depleted from gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirstein et al., 2021</xref>). ORC1 has also been reported to bind to RNA near promoters and stimulate replication from such sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mas et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, our observation that ORC is highly enriched near promoters is expected, the main advance being that the random permutation test suggests that co-localization of TSS with ORC is more than the co-localization of shared origins with ORC.</p><p>The question arises, are our results contradicting past studies? To the best of our knowledge, no one has taken such a comprehensive and quantitative approach to assess the proximity of origins with the ORC-binding sites genome-wide. We determined the percentage of origins that are within 1 kb of ORC-binding sites genome-wide and did a random permutation test to test whether the observed overlap is greater than random expectation. This showed that only a small percentage of the origins are within 1 kb of the currently known ORC-binding sites on a genome-wide scale, although the selected browser shots as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> might suggest otherwise. Furthermore, even though origins were enriched near the ORC-binding sites relative to random expectation, this enrichment is not more than that of TSS near the ORC-binding sites.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest three possibilities: (a) the ORC ChIP-seq or origin determination datasets in humans are very noisy and that the ChIP-seq data in particular fail to identify functional ORC-binding sites; (b) the MCM2-7 loaded at the ORC-binding sites move very far to initiate origins, farther than 1 kb from the ORC-binding sites; and (c) there are as yet unexplored mechanisms by which many of the most reproducible origins are specified, mechanisms that might include ORC-independent modes of origin specification, similar to the DnaA-independent modes of origin specification in bacteria that use R-loops or DNA breaks to initiate replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Itoh and Tomizawa, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leela et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goswami and Gowrishankar, 2022</xref>).</p><p>There is significant evidence for possibility (b). MCM2-7 are either loaded far from the ORC-binding sites or move significant distances after loading in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harvey and Newport, 2003</xref>). In yeasts, there is evidence that MCM2-7 are pushed far away from the bodies of transcriptionally active genes by the RNA polymerase II and initiate replication at sites distant from where they are loaded on chromatin by ORC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gros et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is worth noting that despite this, nearly 100% of the origins in yeast are within 1 kb of the ORC-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Similar observations have been made in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where cyclin E/cdk2 kinase activity promotes the loading of a vast excess of MCM2-7 on chromatin relative to ORC, and the MCM2-7 complexes move away from their loading sites due to the activity of the transcriptional apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Powell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since most models of replication initiation propose that a stably bound MCM2-7 complex is converted into an active CMG helicase at the time of origin firing, we hoped that even if ORC-binding sites are not necessarily close to the shared origins, MCM2-7-binding sites will be more proximate to the shared origins in human cells. However, only 4.5% of shared origins are near any MCM2-7-binding site in human cells and again this is in contrast to the 96.5% of origins in yeast being near any MCM2-7-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Even if we focus on the limited data from the same cell line (K562 or HCT116), only 3.8% (union origins) or 5.5% shared origins overlap with union MCM3-7-binding sites in K562 cells and 19.5% of union origins overlap with any MCM2-binding sites in HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c, and e</xref>). As with ORC, we also did the analysis with two selected origin datasets – the core origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerman et al., 2020</xref>) and the Ini-seq2 origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guilbaud et al., 2022</xref>) – and found that still a small percentage of these origins (6.6 and 10.7%, respectively) were near any MCM2-7-binding sites. Finally, a recent paper reported the binding sites of phosphorylated isoforms of MCM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thakur et al., 2022</xref>), and since phosphorylation of MCM2 is a prerequisite for MCM2-7 being activated as a helicase, we asked whether any of the phospho-MCM2-binding sites showed better co-localization with the shared origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Phospho-S108 MCM2 showed the best result among the phospho-isoforms tested, with 22% of the shared origins being proximate to the phospho-S108 MCM2-binding sites. Thus, phosphorylation on S108 of MCM2 may indeed mark MCM2-7 complexes that become active helicases that fire origins, but even then the co-localization was seen in a disappointingly low percentage of shared origins.</p><p>MCM2-7 ChIP-seq data is biased by a lot of noise as human MCM2-7 slides around after initial loading and due to contamination from the actively replicating CMG helicase that moves all over the genome (and pauses at many sites) during the S phase, but this should increase the number of MCM2-7-binding sites and not decrease the percentage of origins that are near the MCM2-7 sites. Better co-localization of shared origins with phospho-S108 MCM2 suggests that the ChIP methods can be improved to identify a small but critical pool of MCM2-7 that are engaged with the DNA stably in a way that permits origin specification. Alternatively, mapping of the sites bound to the active CMG helicase (MCM2-7, CDC45, and GINS), before the active helicase moves too far from the initiation site, may better enrich sites that are destined to be origins.</p><p>A by-product of our analysis of ORC ChIP-seq data was the discovery that ORC1 and ORC2 are not strictly co-located as expected for the subunits of one ORC complex. Only 1363 (21%) of the 6501 ORC1 peaks overlapped with the 29,930 ORC2 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), and the vast majority (68%) of ORC1 peaks are far away (≥2 kb) from the closest ORC2 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). As a positive control, we checked other proteins that form well-established complexes like SMARCA4 and ARID1A in SWI/SNF complex, SMC1A and SMS63 in cohesion complex, EZH2 and SUZ12 in PRC2 complex, and found that they show a high proportion of overlap between their peaks as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). A possible explanation of the low overlapping rate between ORC1 and ORC2 peaks could be that the datasets are from different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). However, even in ChIP-seq peaks from different cell types, we found continued high overlap between SMC1A and SMC3 peaks as would be expected for complexes that do not have high inter-cell-line variability in binding sites. In contrast, there was a low overlap between EZH2 and SUZ12 peaks taken from different cell lines, suggesting that for other complexes there is significant inter-cell-line variability in binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Thus, the lack of overlap between the ORC1 and ORC2 association sites on chromatin could be explained by inter-cell-line variation of binding sites for ORC (like the PRC2 complex) or could be explained by the ORC subunits binding to chromatin independent of one another. We prefer the latter explanation because of our experimental result that a substantial fraction of ORC2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 bind to chromatin in the absence of ORC1, and ORC2, 3, and 6 bind to chromatin normally in the absence of ORC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park and Asano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Okano-Uchida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shibata and Dutta, 2020</xref>). We and others have also noted that human ORC2, 3, 4, and 5 form a stable subcomplex, with much looser association of the subcomplex with ORC1 and ORC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dhar et al., 2001</xref>). Note that lineage-specific variation of where ORC may bind to the chromatin or the binding of ORC subcomplexes to chromatin may explain why so few of the ORC-binding sites overlap with the shared origins but does not explain why only 6.4% of the shared origins (identified reproducibly in different cell lines) is proximate to any ORC-binding sites.</p><p>Our analysis provides a characterization of origins in the human genome using multisource data in the public domain. The sequencing-based profiles from different techniques have different biases in detecting DNA replication origins and show different genomic features. As one adds criteria to identify the most reproducible experimentally determined origins that are close to the ORC-binding sites, the overlap with TSS, TF hotspots, constitutive CTCF-binding sites, and G-quadruplexes increases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), but in general the overlap with the latter three genomic features does not exceed that of the same features with TSS. Thus, although the overlaps are statistically significant, this correlation analysis cannot determine whether the same genomic features <italic>independently</italic> specify the origins of replication and promoters of transcription. This is a question that should be asked experimentally, and the 74 experimentally reproduced origin datasets with proximity to ORC and MCM2-7 ChIP-seq sites provide a starting list for such experimental queries. Finally, although our datasets for origins were large, as with all integrative data analyses, we are limited by the quality of the data, which can be improved as experimental techniques for both origin identification and ORC- or MCM2-7-binding site determination continue to improve.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data processing</title><p>We collected all publicly available human sequencing datasets of replication origin profiling and ORC ChIP-seq from the GEO database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2013</xref>).

Sam files were converted into bam files using samtools (v1.12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and only high-quality reads (q-score ≥ 30) were retained for subsequent analyses.

The OK-seq-defined Izs were generated from previously published papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petryk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), and the coordinate information was provided by Drs.

SNS-seq origins have the highest resolution, and so we start with them. We identified 5,069,432 union SNS-seq origins using the same approach. We focus on the union SNS-seq origins that appear above a threshold number of SNS-seq origin datasets (high-confidence SNS-seq origins) and then determine those that overlap with any IZ identified by each of the three different techniques to delineate a set of ‘shared origins’, which initiate replication all the time and can be detected by multiple approaches. Note that this approach does not lose the high resolution of the SNS-seq origins, but it merely finds those SNS-seq origins that are most reproduced and detected by each of the other three techniques. Rerep-seq is not included in defining shared origins because it is very different from the other techniques in many ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p><p>To identify the most commonly shared origins between SNS-seq samples, we use an occupancy score for each union SNS-seq origin to show how many samples identify that specific origin. A higher occupancy score means the origin is more commonly present in many samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). High-confidence SNS-seq origins are those that occur in a sufficient number of SNS-seq samples at a false discovery rate (FDR) of &gt;0.1. We used an exponential model for the background (green line) and plotted the distribution of occupancy scores (blue dotted curve) for origins from all SNS-seq samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The exponential model can be expressed as<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>x</italic> is the occupancy score, and <italic>y</italic> is the expected number of origins. Origins that are reproduced by multiple samples have higher occupancy scores than the background distribution. An empirical FDR of 0.1 was used to determine the cutoff of occupancy score so that the number of observed origins with occupancy score greater than the cutoff should be 10 times more than expected in the background model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2020</xref>). The high-confidence SNS-seq origins were thus those with occupancy score ≥20 in all 66 SNS-seq samples.

These motifs, or ARS elements, are bound by the origin recognition complex (ORC). ORC is required for loading of the initially inactive MCM helicase during origin licensing in G1. In human cells, ORC does not have a specific sequence binding domain and origin specification is not specified by a defined motif. There have thus been great efforts over many years to try to understand the determinants of DNA replication initiation in human cells using a variety of approaches, which have gradually become more refined over time.</p><p>In this manuscript Tian et al. combine data from multiple previous studies using a range of techniques for identifying sites of replication initiation to identify conserved features of replication origins and to examine the relationship between origins and sites of ORC binding in the human genome. The authors identify (a) conserved features of replication origins e.g. association with GC-rich sequences, open chromatin, promoters and CTCF binding sites. These associations have already been described in multiple earlier studies. They also examine the relationship of their determined origins and ORC binding sites and conclude that there is no relationship between sites of ORC binding and DNA replication initiation. While the conclusions concerning genomic features of origins are not novel, if true, a clear lack of colocalization of ORC and origins would be a striking finding. However, the majority of the datasets used do not report replication origins, but rather broad zones in which replication origins fire. Rather than refining the localisation of origins, the approach of combining diverse methods that monitor different objects related to DNA replication leads to a base dataset that is highly flawed and cannot support the conclusions that are drawn, as explained in more detail below.</p><p>Methods to determine sites at which DNA replication is initiated can be divided into two groups based on the genomic resolution at which they operate. Techniques such as bubble-seq, ok-seq can localise zones of replication initiation in the range ~50kb. Such zones may contain many replication origins. Conversely, techniques such as SNS-seq and ini-seq can localise replication origins down to less than 1kb. Indeed, the application of these different approaches has led to a degree of controversy in the field about whether human replication does indeed initiate at discrete sites (origins), or whether it initiates randomly in large zones with no recurrent sites being used. However, more recent work has shown that elements of both models are correct i.e. there are recurrent and efficient sites of replication initiation in the human genome, but these tend to be clustered and correspond to the demonstrated initiation zones (Guilbaud et al., 2022).</p><p>These different scales and methodologies are important when considering the approach of Tian et al. The premise that combining all available data from five techniques will increase accuracy and confidence in identifying the most important origins is flawed for two principal reasons. First, as noted above, of the different techniques combined in this manuscript, only SNS-seq can actually identify origins rather than initiation zones. It is the former that matters when comparing sites of ORC binding with replication origin sites, if a conclusion is to be drawn that the two do not co-localise.</p><p>Second, the authors give equal weight to all datasets. Certainly, in the case of SNS-seq, this is not appropriate. The technique has evolved over the years and some earlier versions have significantly different technical designs that may impact the reliability and/or resolution of the results e.g. in Foulk et al. (Foulk et al., 2015), lambda exonuclease was added to single stranded DNA from a total genomic preparation rather than purified nascent strands, which may lead to significantly different digestion patterns (ie underdigestion). Curiously, the authors do not make the best use of the largest SNS-seq dataset (Akerman et al., 2020) by ignoring these authors separation of core and stochastic origins. By blending all data together any separation of signal and noise is lost.

The importance of this study is in highlighting that there is either significant problems with the data collected till now (preventing the co-localization of ORC or MCM binding sites with the most reproducible origins) or ORC and MCM binding sites are often far away from where the most reproducible origins fire, which should make us consider ways in which origins could be activated kilobases away from ORC and MCM binding sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>All suggestions and recommendations were described in a previous review.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The most significant omission is a contextualization of the results in the discussion and an explanation of why these results matter for the biology of replication, disease, and/or our confidence in the genomic techniques reported on in this study.

I suggest that the authors revise their discussion to fill this important gap.</p><p>A second important, unresolved point is whether replication origins identified by the various methods differ due to technical reasons or because different cell types were analyzed. Given the correlation between TSS and origins (reported in this study but many others too), it is somewhat expected that origins will differ between cell types as each will have a distinct transcriptional program. This critique is partly addressed in Figure S1C. However, given the conclusion that the techniques are only rarely in agreement (only 0.27% origins reproducibly detected by the four techniques), a more in-depth analysis of cell type specific data is warranted. Specifically, I would suggest that cell type-specific data be reported wherever origins have been defined by at least two methods in the same cell type, specifically reporting the percent of shared origins amongst the datasets. This type of analysis may also inform on whether one or more techniques produces the highest (or lowest) quality list of true origins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done what has been suggested: used K562 cell type-specific data because here the origins have been defined by at least two methods in the same cell type and reported the percent of shared origins amongst the datasets (Supp. Fig. S4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other MINOR comments include:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 215: the authors show that shared origins overlap with TF binding hotspots more often than union origins, which they claim suggests &quot;that they are more likely to interact with transcription factors.&quot; As written, it sounds like the authors are proposing that ORC may have some direct physical interaction with transcription factors.

If we only showed this figure, we could conclude that ORC and MCM binding sites are very close to reproducible origins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 394: &quot;Since ORC is an early factor for initiating DNA replication, we expected that shared human origins will be proximate to the reproducible ORC binding sites.&quot; This is only expected if one disbelieves the prior literature that shows that ORC and origins are not, in many cases, proximal. This statement should be revised, or the previous literature should be cited, and an explanation provided about why this prior work may have missed the mark.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We do not know of any genome-wide study in mammalian cell lines where ORC binding sites and MCM binding have been compared to highly reproducible origins, or that show that these binding sites and highly reproducible origins are mostly not proximal to each other. Most studies cherry pick a few origins and show by ChIP-PCR that ORC and/or MCM bind near those sites. Alternatively, studies sometimes show a selected browser shot, without a quantitative measure of the overlap genome wide and without doing a permutation test to determine if the observed overlap or proximity is higher than what would be expected at random with similar numbers of sites of similar lengths. In the revised manuscript we have discussed Dellino, 2013; Kirstein, 2021; Wang, 2017; Mas, 2023. None of them have addressed what we are addressing, is the small subset of the most reproducible origins proximal to ORC or MCM binding sites?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Line 402-404: given the lack of agreement between ORC binding sites and origins the authors suggest as an explanation that &quot;MCM2-7 loaded at the ORC binding sites move much further away to initiate origins far from the ORC binding sites, or that there are as yet unexplored mechanisms of origin specification in human cancer cells&quot;.
