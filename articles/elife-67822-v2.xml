Our understanding of the role of CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing neurons in CRF-mediated behaviors has been largely limited to mouse experiments due to the lack of genetic tools available to selectively visualize and manipulate CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in rats. Here, we describe the generation and validation of a transgenic CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat. We report that <italic>Crhr1</italic> and <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA expression are highly colocalized in both the central amygdala (CeA), composed of mostly GABAergic neurons, and in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), composed of mostly glutamatergic neurons. In the CeA, membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and responses to CRF bath application in <sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons are similar to those previously reported in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in CRFR1-GFP mice. We show that stimulatory DREADD receptors can be targeted to CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells via virally delivered Cre-dependent transgenes, that transfected Cre/<sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> cells are activated by clozapine-n-oxide in vitro and in vivo, and that activation of these cells in vivo increases anxiety-like and nocifensive behaviors. Outside the amygdala, we show that Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato is expressed in several brain areas across the brain, and that the expression pattern of Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells is similar to the known expression pattern of CRF<sub>1</sub> cells. Given the accuracy of expression in the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre rat, modern genetic techniques used to investigate the anatomy, physiology, and behavioral function of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons can now be performed in assays that require the use of rats as the model organism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRF</kwd><kwd>crf1 receptor</kwd><kwd>central amygdala</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>nociception</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AA023305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilpin</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AA026022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herman</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilpin</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 AA023002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herman</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Research Service Award AA027145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weera</surname><given-names>Marcus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional Training Grant AA007577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weera</surname><given-names>Marcus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>United States Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Merit Award #I01 BX003451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilpin</surname><given-names>Nicholas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel transgenic rat for studying the role of specific corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptor-expressing cell populations in physiology and behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a 41 amino acid neuropeptide that acts on various cell populations in the brain and elicits stress-related behavioral (e.g. anxiety) and physiological (e.g. sympathomimetic) responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vale et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henckens et al., 2016</xref>). In the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, CRF released by neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) into the hypophyseal portal system stimulates adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary, which in turn stimulates release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoids released into the circulatory system serve as effectors of the HPA axis by modulating various physiological (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune) functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Vale, 2006</xref>). Extrahypothalamic CRF neurons are located in many brain areas that modulate affective states and behaviors, such as the amygdala, cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). Among these brain areas, the extended amygdala, particularly the central amygdala (CeA) and bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), contain the highest densities of CRF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>CRF type-1 (CRF<sub>1</sub>) receptors are G<sub>s</sub>- or G<sub>q</sub>-coupled metabotropic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milan-Lobo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wanat et al., 2008</xref>) that are highly expressed in brain areas that contain high densities of CRF fibers and/or CRF neurons, including the CeA, BNST, and medial amygdala. CRF signaling via CRF<sub>1</sub> modulates neurophysiological processes underlying stress reactivity, anxiety-related behaviors, learning and memory processes including fear acquisition and/or expression, pain signaling, and addiction-related behaviors (see reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dedic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henckens et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, elucidation of the circuit-specific and cell-specific mechanisms by which CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling mediates these processes represents an important avenue of research for understanding behaviors related to stress, anxiety, fear, pain, and addiction.</p><p>The central amygdala (CeA) is a key nucleus in modulating affective states and behaviors related to stress, anxiety, fear, pain, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilpin et al., 2015</xref>). Functionally, the CeA serves as a major output nucleus of the amygdala and can be anatomically divided into lateral (CeAl) and medial (CeAm) subdivisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</xref>). In mice and rats, CRF-expressing (CRF<sup>+</sup>) neurons are densely localized to the CeAl, whereas CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing (CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>) neurons are mostly localized to the CeAm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Day et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jolkkonen and Pitkänen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Justice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomrenze et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to receiving CRF input from CRF<sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeAl, the CeAm receives CRF inputs from distal brain areas such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dabrowska et al., 2016</xref>) and dorsal raphe nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Commons et al., 2003</xref>). CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling plays an important role in modulating affective states and behaviors. For example, pharmacological blockade of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> attenuates stress-induced increases in anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henry et al., 2006</xref>), nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoga et al., 2016</xref>), and alcohol drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roberto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weera et al., 2020</xref>), as well as fear acquisition and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanford et al., 2017</xref>). Work using transgenic CRF and CRF<sub>1</sub> reporter and Cre-driver mice have shed light on circuit- and cell-specific mechanisms by which CeA CRF<sup>+</sup> and CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells mediate affective behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanford et al., 2017</xref>). However, mice have a limited behavioral repertoire when compared to rats, making the study of more complex behaviors (e.g. drug self-administration and social interaction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Homberg et al., 2017</xref>) difficult.</p><p>Here, we describe the generation of a novel CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato transgenic rat line. We show that <italic>Crhr1</italic> and <italic>iCre</italic> mRNA are expressed in the same neurons in the CeA and BLA using hybridization histochemistry. In the CeA, we show that <sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons are abundant in the CeAm, and that they are surrounded and in contact with CRF-containing puncta. We recorded membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and spontaneous firing in CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells and show that these cells are sensitive to CRF. In addition, we show that Cre-dependent DREADD receptors can be targeted for expression by CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> cells such that DREADD stimulation of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> CeA neurons increases nociception and anxiety-like behaviors, recapitulating prior work using pharmacological strategies. Outside the amygdala, we analyzed the expression of CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells in several brain areas across the rostrocaudal axis and show that these cells are found in brain areas known to contain CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing cells. These anatomical, electrophysiological, and functional data support the utility of this CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato transgenic rat line for the study of CRF<sub>1</sub> neural circuit function, and will be an important new resource that will complement CRFR1:GFP and CRFR1:Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Justice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanford et al., 2017</xref>), and CRF-Cre rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomrenze et al., 2015</xref>) for the study of CRF signaling in physiology and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats and validation of iCre (<sup>Td</sup>Tomato) expression in CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing cells in the CeA</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Design of CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene</title><p>Please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a schematic of the BAC generation. The design of the CRF<sub>1</sub>:Cre rat BAC transgene is similar to the design used to generate CRFR1:Cre BAC transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>), with the exception that a BAC clone from rat was used (clone RNB2-336H12 from Riken Rat genomic BAC library). The BAC clone used lacks any other identified protein encoding genetic sequences, reducing the possibility that other genes will be expressed from BAC when introduced into the rat genome. We obtained the RNB2-336H12 clone from the Riken Rat BAC clone collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">STAR Consortium et al., 2008</xref>). This BAC was inserted using recombineering techniques such that sequences encoding <italic>Crhr1</italic> were replaced, beginning at the translation ATG start site, with sequences encoding a bicistronic <italic>iCre-2A-<sup>td</sup>Tomato</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>iCre</italic> is a codon-optimized Cre that produces consistent Cre activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koresawa et al., 2000</xref>). <sup>td</sup>Tomato encodes a red fluorescent protein that allows cells expressing the transgene to be visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>). The poly A and WPRE sequences stabilize the mRNA to achieve more robust expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glover et al., 2002</xref>). To insert the iCre-p2A-tdTomato cassette into the BAC, we transformed bacterial cells that contain the BAC with a helper plasmid (Portmage-4) which contains a heatshock-inducible element that drives expression of lambda red recombinase and confers chloramphenicol resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). These cells were then transformed with the iCre-p2A-<sup>td</sup>Tomato homology arm targeting cassette, after a 15 min heatshock. Cells were selected on kanamycin (for neoR) and colonies were screened by PCR for insertion of the cassette at the site of <italic>Crhr1</italic> in the BAC. BAC DNA from a single clone that contained the correct insertionwas purified, then transformed into EL250 cells, which carry an arabinose inducible flipase construct. Cultures of EL250 carrying the inserted BAC were induced to express flp recombinase by incubating in L-arabinose for 1 hr, then selected on ampicillin (the resistance of the BAC) and screened for loss of kanamycin resistance (removed by flp recombinase; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Colonies were PCR screened to confirm that they contained BAC DNA containing the Cre-2A-Tom transgene inserted in the <italic>Crhr1</italic> locus, and lacked the f3 flanked neoR cassette. A single bacterial clonecontaining the final full-length inserted BAC construct was sent to the University of North Carolina (UNC) Transgenic Core, where BAC DNA was purified, checked for integrity by DNA laddering with EcoR1 and XbaI followed bypulsed-gel electrophoresis, and by PCR, linearized, then injected into single-cell Wistar rat oocytes.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of the Crhr1-Cre2aTom BAC transgene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)<italic>Crhr1</italic> is located on chromosome 10 in the rat.

We report that, within the CeA of CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats, CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells are located in the medial subdivision (CeAm), consistent with previous reports of <italic>Crhr1</italic> expression in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Potter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Pett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Day et al., 1999</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Pett et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Justice et al., 2008</xref>), and that there is strong concordance ( &gt; 90%) between <italic>Crhr1</italic> and <italic>iCre</italic> mRNA expression in the CeAm of male and female CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats. We also characterized the basal membrane properties, inhibitory synaptic transmission, and validated the CRF sensitivity of <sup>td</sup>Tomato-expressing CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in male and female rats. In addition, we showed that stimulatory DREADD receptors [hM3D(Gq)] can be targeted to CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato cells using a Cre-dependent expression strategy, that systemic CNO treatment induces c-Fos in hM3D(Gq)-transduced CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in CeA, and that CNO induces membrane depolarization and spontaneous firing activity in hM3D(Gq)-transduced CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in CeA. We showed that hM3D(Gq)-mediated stimulation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells increases anxiety-like behavior, as measured by EPM and open field tests, as well as mechanical nociception as measured by the Von Frey test. Finally, we report that <italic>Crhr1</italic> and <italic>iCre</italic> mRNA expression are highly colocalized in the BLA, and that Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato is expressed in several brain areas across the rostrocaudal axis of the rat brain in expected patterns. Collectively, this work provides cellular, electrophysiological, and behavioral data demonstrating the validity and reliability of a new transgenic rat model for the identification and selective manipulation of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA.</p><p>CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats were generated by modifying a BAC clone derived from F344 rats, that was injected into oocytes derived from Wistar rats. Because the originating strain of the BAC DNA differs from the strain used for transgenesis, DNA sequence differences between F344 and Wistar rats in the 200 + kb region surrounding the <italic>Crhr1</italic> genomic locus may impact expression of iCre-2A-<sup>td</sup>Tomato in the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre transgenic rat. Moreover, because transgenic BAC DNA insertion was not directed, position effect, copy number, and fragmentation of the BAC insertion may possibly alter expression of reporter genes. These sources of variability were minimized by the expertise of the UNC Transgenic Core Facility, where BAC DNA was prepared, cleaved at a single site to produce full-length single stranded BAC DNA, then injected into oocytes. Two transgenic founders were isolated that contained unique DNA sequences near the <italic>Crhr1</italic> genomic locus in the BAC, as well as DNA sequence from both terminal ends of the injected BAC, indicating insertion of full-length BAC DNA. Of these two rats, one displayed expression of <sup>td</sup>Tomato in a pattern reflecting <italic>Crhr1</italic> expression patterns reported in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Potter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Pett et al., 2000</xref>), as well as transgenic expression of reporter genes reported in similarly designed BAC transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Justice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>). The genomic locus and copy number of transgenic BAC insertion have not been further characterized. However, the high degree of alignment of Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato expression with known CRF<sub>1</sub> expression patterns broadly throughout the brain suggests that position, copy number, or fragmentation did not substantially alter expression of the transgene. In addition, the behavioral and physiological phenotypes of CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats reported here closely resemble those seen in wild-type Wistar rats (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrechet-Souza et al., 2020</xref>; see below), suggesting that BAC insertion did not produce observable anomalous phenotypes.</p><p>The intrinsic properties of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> (<sup>td</sup>Tomato<sup>+</sup>) CeA neurons in CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats are similar to those reported in wild-type rat CeA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herman and Roberto, 2016</xref>), suggesting that the transgene did not significantly impact the overall health or activity of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> CeA neurons. Previous studies have employed a CRFR1:GFP transgenic mouse model to examine CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> CeA neurons in local CeA microcircuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herman et al., 2016</xref>). Although prior work was conducted in mouse and some species differences would be expected, the electrophysiological properties of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA are relatively consistent between the mouse and rat transgenic models. Recent work specifically examining sex differences in CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons from CRFR1:GFP mice reported similar intrinsic membrane properties, cell-typing, and baseline inhibitory transmission as reported here and noted no sex differences in basal properties between male and female CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoglia et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with our current findings. In contrast to previous work, however, we found no sex differences in CRF sensitivity of CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in CeA. Although CRF was previously found to increase firing in CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> CeA neurons in both male and female mice, CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> CeA neurons from male mice displayed a significantly greater increase in firing in response to CRF application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoglia et al., 2020</xref>). This discrepancy may be driven by differences in sampling size (although the current study was not sufficiently powered to detect sex differences), high variability in male baseline firing rates observed here, sex differences in baseline firing rates observed here, or it may reflect a species difference in sex-dependent sensitivity to CRF. Additional studies are required for a more comprehensive examination of sex- and/or species-specific differences in CRF-stimulated CRFR1<sup>+</sup> neuronal activity in distinct brain regions. CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons in the CeA have also previously been implicated in the neuroplastic changes associated with acute and chronic ethanol exposure in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herman et al., 2016</xref>), and future work will determine if this is also the case in rats.</p><p>To test the feasibility of using Cre-dependent stimulatory DREADDs to interrogate the role of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in behavior, we targeted Gq-coupled DREADD receptors [DIO-hM3D(Gq)] to CeA CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre cells and first tested the effects of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cell stimulation on nociception. We showed that DREADD stimulation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells increases mechanical sensitivity as measured by the Von Frey test, but not thermal sensitivity measured by the Hargreaves test. Numerous studies have implicated CeA CRF-CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling in nociception. For instance, pain induced by carrageenan injection into the knee joint produces hyperactivity of CeA neurons in rats, a phenomenon that is CRF<sub>1</sub> dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji and Neugebauer, 2007</xref>). Conversely, latency for hind limb withdrawal reflex induced by knee joint pressure application is decreased (reflecting hyperalgesia) by CRF infusion into the CeA, a phenomenon that is blocked by co-infusion of a CRF<sub>1</sub> antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ji et al., 2013</xref>). With regard to mechanical sensitivity, our finding that DREADD activation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> neurons produces mechanical hypersensitivity extends previous work showing that ablation or inhibition of CeA CRF neurons blocks neuropathic pain-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, as measured by the Von Frey test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreoli et al., 2017</xref>). Various studies have also previously reported that CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> antagonism attenuates mechanical hypersensitivity produced by chronic drug or alcohol exposure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edwards et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, this prior work suggests that activation of CeA CRF-CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling by chronic injuries or insults facilitates a hyperalgesic state, which was recapitulated in the current study via chemogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> cells. It should be noted that chemogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF<sup>+</sup> cells has been shown to potentiate stress-induced analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreoli et al., 2017</xref>), although this effect may be due to CRF release outside the CeA (e.g. locus coeruleus) or due to changes in GABA release from CRF<sup>+</sup> cells. Within the CeA, pharmacological studies suggest that pro- and anti-nociceptive effects of CRF signaling may be mediated by CRF<sub>1</sub> and CRF<sub>2</sub> receptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ji and Neugebauer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji and Neugebauer, 2008</xref>), but further studies are required to delineate the precise mechanisms by which CeA CRF signaling supports hyperalgesia and analgesia. The CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat described here represents a useful tool for these studies.</p><p>Our lab has shown that predator odor stress-induced hyperalgesia, as measured by the Hargreaves test, is mediated by increased CRF-CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling in the CeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Itoga et al., 2016</xref>). Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe any effect of DREADD activation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> cells on thermal sensitivity. It is not clear why CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre rats exhibited mechanical hypersensitivity but not thermal hyperalgesia in this study. It is possible that specific CeA cell populations are involved in specific types of nociceptive processing, or it is possible that the engagement/recruitment of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells in mediating specific types of nociception depends on the animal’s history or affective state. Using the CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat line reported here, future work will elucidate the role of specific CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> circuits in mechanical and thermal sensitivity (which may or may not be partially overlapping) under basal and challenged conditions such as neuropathic or inflammatory pain, stress exposure and/or withdrawal from chronic exposure to drugs or alcohol.</p><p>CeA CRF-CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling generally promotes anxiogenic responses, particularly under challenged conditions such as stress or withdrawal from chronic exposure to drugs of abuse. For instance, in mice, intra-CeA infusion of a CRF<sub>1</sub> antagonist attenuates anxiety-like behavior, as measured by open field and light-dark box tests, following immobilization stress but not under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henry et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, blockade of CRF-CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling in the CeA attenuates alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety in rats, as measured by the EPM test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rassnick et al., 1993</xref>). Exposure to stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merlo Pich et al., 1995</xref>) and alcohol withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zorrilla et al., 2001</xref>) both increase extracellular CRF levels in the CeA. Messing and colleagues used CRF-Cre rats to show that CeA CRF cell activation (using DREADDs) increases anxiety-like behavior and that this effect is blocked by CeA CRF knockdown using RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pomrenze et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies show that increased CRF-CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling in CeA, whether produced by stress exposure, drug withdrawal, or the use of viral genetic tools, supports anxiogenesis. Here, we showed that chemogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells increases anxiety-like behavior, as measured by EPM and open field tests. Interestingly, we did not observe an effect of chemogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells on light-dark box measures, including time spent in the light vs. dark boxes, latency to enter light box, and number of crosses between the two compartments. Previous studies reported that the light-dark box test may be more suited for detecting anxiolytic rather than anxiogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crawley and Davis, 1982</xref>), and that animals’ responses in this test is affected by the intensity of illumination in the animal’s regular housing room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">File et al., 2004</xref>). Future studies will test if Cre-dependent expression of inhibitory chemogenetic or optogenetic strategies can be applied to inhibit CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> cells, and if inhibition of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> cells reduces anxiety-like behavior at baseline or after stress exposure.</p><p>Although the CeA is generally not thought to exhibit strong sexual dimorphism, sex differences have been reported for CRF and CRF<sub>1</sub> properties in the CeA. For example, female rats in proestrus have higher levels of CeA <italic>Crf</italic> mRNA than male rats and footshock stress induces greater CeA <italic>Crf</italic> expression in female proestrus than in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iwasaki-Sekino et al., 2009</xref>). However, using autoradiography, Cooke and colleagues reported no sex differences in CRF<sub>1</sub> receptor binding in the CeA of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weathington et al., 2014</xref>). Using a transgenic CRFR1:GFP mouse line, the CeA of male animals was shown to contain more CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cells than female animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoglia et al., 2020</xref>). In the current study, although underpowered to detect sex effects, we found that male CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats tend to have more CRF1<sup>+</sup> cells within the CeA than female rats, as detected via RNAscope in situ hybridization. Previous work using CRFR1:GFP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoglia et al., 2020</xref>) and our current work using CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rats revealed no sex differences in basal membrane properties and inhibitory synaptic transmission in CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons. Our previous work in CRFR1:GFP mice showed that, while CRF application increased firing in CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> CeA neurons from both female and male mice, larger increases were observed in CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> neurons from male mice, an effect that we did not observe in rats potentially due to differences in variability or sex differences in firing rate.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of published studies examining the role of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub> signaling in nocifensive and anxiety-like behaviors has employed only male subjects. Here, we used both sexes in tests of nociception and anxiety-like behavior and we did not detect any sex differences. However, we observed that the anxiogenic effect of CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cell activation in the EPM test was driven by stronger effects in male subjects. One interpretation is that CeA CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cell activation affects specific components of anxiety-related behavior, that these components are aligned with specific ‘anxiety-like behavior’ phenotypes in male versus female rats that are more or less detectable by these various tests. In support of this idea, a meta-analysis of studies of anxiety-like behavior in rats and mice revealed a discordance in results between the EPM and open field tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohammad et al., 2016</xref>). However, due to the small number of studies testing female animals, the role of sex in this discordance is still unknown. Within the EPM literature, studies have shown that the EPM test is more reliable for detecting anxiogenic effects in male rather than female rodents (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scholl et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of behavioral assay selection and of using both male and female subjects.</p><p>In summary, we present a novel CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre-<sup>td</sup>Tomato rat line that allows for the visualization and manipulation of CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing cells. The CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre rat can be used to study the role of distinct CRF<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> cell populations and circuits in physiology and behavior. In addition, the expression of the fluorescent reporter <sup>td</sup>Tomato in CRF<sub>1</sub>-expressing cells will allow for high resolution, detailed analysis of the expression pattern of CRF<sub>1</sub> that has not been possible due to the lack of CRF<sub>1</sub>-specific antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BAC containing the <italic>Crfr1</italic> genomic locus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Riken Gene Engineering Division</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNB2-336H12</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>iCre-2a-tdTomato</italic> BAC transgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Results, Design of CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre BAC;

Slice electrophysiology experiments were conducted in a single pass, such that one experiment was performed in each slice and each experimental group contained neurons from a minimum of three rats. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the respective institutions at which procedures occurred (LSUHSC IACUC Protocol #3749; UNC IACUC Protocol #19–190; UTHSC IACUC Protocol #21–075) and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotaxic surgeries</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2 min at 4% for induction, 1%–3% for maintenance) and mounted into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments) for all stereotaxic surgeries.

Briefly, the Von Frey apparatus consists of clear chambers placed on top of a mesh floor. To measure sensitivity to mechanical nociception, each hind paw was perpendicularly stimulated with a Von Frey filament (Electronic Von Frey 38450, Ugo Basile, Gemonio, Italy) calibrated to measure the amount of force applied using the up-down method and the force (g) threshold required to elicit a paw withdrawal response was recorded. Force thresholds were measured twice for each hind paw in alternating fashion, with at least 1 min between measurements, and an average threshold was calculated for each animal.

Rats were individually placed in the center of the maze facing an open arm and were given 5 min to explore the maze. Time spent in the open and closed arms of the maze was measured. The OF consists of a square arena with a checkerboard patterned floor (4 × 4 squares). Rats were individually placed in one corner of the arena and were given 5 min to explore the arena. Time spent in the periphery and the center of the arena (defined as the 3 × 3 squares in the center of the arena) was measured. The LD box consists of a two compartments; one with black walls and a black floor, and the other with white walls and a white floor. The black compartment was protected from light (dark box) and the white compartment was illuminated (light box; ~ 1000 lux). Rats were able to freely explore both dark and light boxes through an opened door. Rats were individually placed in the dark box and were given 5 min to explore the apparatus. Time spent in dark and light boxes, as well as the latency to enter the light box were measured. EPM, OF, and LD tests were recorded via a camera mounted above the apparatus and videos were scored by an experimenter blinded to treatment groups.

the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cellular, physiological, and behavioral validation of a CRFR1:Cre-td Tomato rat for use in basic neuroscience research&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James P Herman (Reviewer #2); Eric Zorrilla (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. (We suggest resubmitting as a Tools and Resources paper.)</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As previous transgenic rat lines have shown some issues with cell specific fidelity, and since this is the initial characterization paper of the rat line, it was felt that a broader characterization of the expression in different cell types and in different brain regions was necessary. For example, the Pomerenze Crh-Cre rat was found to only express in GABAergic but not glutamatergic neurons, and so for the field to be able to understand the breadth of utility of this model and the fidelity across cell types, more characterization is required. This does not need to involve in depth electrophysiology as was done in the CeA, but could be done by mapping the expression of iCre/tdTomato in brain regions beyond the CeA, such as prefrontal cortex, hypothalamic nuclei and the BNST, where CRHR1 neurons are widely expressed. Ideally this would be compared to ISH quantification as is done in the CeA but if this is unfeasible then comparing to established in situ hybridization maps of expression of CRHR1 would still provide an idea of the fidelity with endogenous CRFR1 expression. It was felt necessary that at least in one other brain region, preferably one where CRHR1 is expressed in glutamatergic neurons, a side by side comparison of tdTomato and CRFR1 would be necessary to be sure it is not restricted to discrete cell types. It would also be good to establish if expression of tdTomato is seen in microglia or astrocytes to know if this model recapitulates the cell type specificity of CRFR1 expression.</p><p>Concerns that require addressing but can be dealt with via reanalysis of existing data or modifications within the manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors contextualize the necessity of developing a rat model of the CRFR1-Cre line because they state that this will allow more for the investigation of more complex behaviors then mice engage in. While this point may have some validity, it was felt that this statement and justification also required more validity. Please expand this rationale including examples of complex behavioral assays that can only be performed in rats and not mice.</p><p>2) The manuscript does not discuss possible genetic strain of origin issues. The rat was generated using a BAC that involves DNA from a different strain (F344) than that bred into (Wistar), so potential strain of origin differences in regulatory or enhancer elements for the Crhr1 gene might co-segregate in early generations with the transgene. Similar considerations are true with respect to linked alleles if the strain of the gamete donors, which was not specified, differed from Wistar. Such issues would become of lesser concern with continued Wistar breeding but are not mentioned.</p><p>Additionally, the location, copy #, fidelity or potential mosaicism of BAC transgene insertions after germline transmission was not mentioned. It is recommended that analysis of F1 or F2 offspring to establish location, copy #, fidelity and mosaicism of transgene insertion in order to disseminate the most desirable pedigree from this line (e.g., PMID: 17882484, 29703985, 30354251). If already done, please add relevant findings.</p><p>3) For the electrophysiology studies, adding the resting potential on the rep traces in Figure 5 and describing if Vm was adjusted for these experiments would provide clarity and is requested. Also, it could be very useful to compare intrinsic membrane results with published work on these cells to establish the normality of these measures in this line and see if the transgene expression impacted the physiological properties of these cells. It was also felt that the many of the traces used in the figures didn't seem representative and these should be modified to include genuine representative traces.</p><p>4) The reviewers all appreciate the authors inclusion of both sexes, but there are some issues here that need to be addressed. First, it is likely that this study was not appropriately powered for identifying sex differences. This is recognized in some experiments, such as the anxiety behavior experiments, but it was agreed that the same level of preliminary interpretation should be exercised with the Cre fidelity data and the impacts of CRF in firing rates. However, sex differences in baseline firing rates are important and it would benefit the manuscript to discuss this in greater depth.</p><p>5) The statistics on the behavior (Figure 7) should be checked as it was felt that repeated measures ANOVA would be more appropriate for these then t-tests.</p><p>6) Consistent with IUPHAR consensus (p.24, PMID: 12615952), the receptor protein should be referred to as CRF(subscript)1. Per both IUPHAR and RGD (RGD ID: 61276) nomenclature, the gene should be referred to as Crhr1.</p><p>7) As the DREADD studies performed did not include an approach that inhibited these cells, the discussion should clarify that it remains to be determined if this approach will work for inhibition of cell activity using actuators like DREADDs.</p><p>8) Some aspects of histochemical concordance were not provided or explored. For example, the proportion of Cre-expressing neurons that expressed CRF1 mRNA was not reported to confirm specificity (it appears to be even higher which would be good)? Cellular co-expression of Tomato with CRF1 mRNA also was not explicitly quantified.</p><p>To address this, it is recommended to: (a) justify the current binary thresholds for + vs. – expression similar to PMID: 31451604, (b) analyze whether there is a semi-continuous, rather than only binary, relation between puncta expression of CRF1 vs. iCre, (c) clarify whether there are statistically significant sex differences in binary or continuous concordance (CRF1-iCre), and (d) discuss concordance of Tomato with CRF1 mRNA.</p><p>9) While anxiety-like behavior was viewed as an appropriate behavioral readout for validation of the rats, it was felt that the consensus around the role of the CeA in pain was less widely accepted and had more nuance. As such, it is requested that authors to cite the work on CeA CRF and analgesia and acknowledge that their chemogenetic manipulation seem to mimic injury-induced hyperalgesic states but not stress-induced analgesic states. The authors can use this opportunity to highlight that the transgenic rat would be an excellent tool for future studies aimed at studying stress-induced analgesia.</p><p>10. If you have not already done so, please attend to the important information below &quot;Information to help as you revise your submission&quot; including inclusions of a key resource table and statistical reporting.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Generation of a CRF<sub>1</sub>-Cre transgenic rat and the role of central amygdala CRF<sub>1</sub> receptors in nociception and anxiety-like behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors did an adequate job in answering many of the reviewer’s concerns, however, it does seem that the author response fell short in answering two of the reviewers' concerns.</p><p>Specifically, there was a consensus amongst reviewers that analysis of the penetrance and specificity of transgene across several regions should be included in this first demonstration of a new transgenic tool. While the inclusion of the BLA is an improvement, it still does not survey several regions. Rather the authors indicate that a full analysis of the specificity and penetrance of the transgene across brain regions will be reserved for a follow-up manuscript. While this may be, the reviewers agreed that it is paramount to this first publication to include more than two regions. From discussion, it was agreed amongst the reviewers that the authors should include characterization of the following brain regions: BNST, Hippocampus, VTA, LC, RN, PAG, PVN, and at least one cortical region.</p><p>The second concern that does not seem to be sufficiently addressed in the revision is the need to perform experiments to determine where the BAC incorporated in the genome in the CRF1-Cre rat. This is particularly important when considering fluorescent reporter expression. The reviewers appreciated the additional discussion of potential caveats but agreed that additional experiments and analysis to validate this component of a new tool are needed. The issues that have arisen from other BAC mice and rats are believed to be a result of less than rigorous validation upon their initial introduction. As such, it seems incumbent on the authors to be as rigorous as possible in this first publication in order to avoid these recurrent issues with this particular rat tool.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67822.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As previous transgenic rat lines have shown some issues with cell specific fidelity, and since this is the initial characterization paper of the rat line, it was felt that a broader characterization of the expression in different cell types and in different brain regions was necessary.

Per both IUPHAR and RGD (RGD ID: 61276) nomenclature, the gene should be referred to as Crhr1.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been edited throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) As the DREADD studies performed did not include an approach that inhibited these cells, the discussion should clarify that it remains to be determined if this approach will work for inhibition of cell activity using actuators like DREADDs.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been clarified in the Discussion (please see page 23, line 339; page 25, lines 399-401).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Some aspects of histochemical concordance were not provided or explored. For example, the proportion of Cre-expressing neurons that expressed CRF1 mRNA was not reported to confirm specificity (it appears to be even higher which would be good)? Cellular co-expression of Tomato with CRF1 mRNA also was not explicitly quantified.</p><p>To address this, it is recommended to: (a) justify the current binary thresholds for + vs. – expression similar to PMID: 31451604, (b) analyze whether there is a semi-continuous, rather than only binary, relation between puncta expression of CRF1 vs. iCre, (c) clarify whether there are statistically significant sex differences in binary or continuous concordance (CRF1-iCre), and (d) discuss concordance of Tomato with CRF1 mRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see edits on page 35, line 590 for information on our RNAscope quantification thresholding. Beyond counting cells as being positively or negatively labeled with an RNAscope probe, we did not quantify the number of puncta within each cell as this re-analysis would be difficult without specialized software. We feel that this level of analysis is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Regarding potential sex differences, we did analyze RNAscope data with sex as a factor, using binary thresholds (page 9, lines 161-153). Regarding concordance between <sup>td</sup>Tomato and Crhr1 mRNA expression, we probed for iCre and not <sup>td</sup>Tomato because iCre and <sup>td</sup>Tomato are expressed as a single polypeptide (please see edits on page 9, lines 154-156). Therefore, there is no reason to suspect any difference between iCre and <sup>td</sup>Tomato expression, and we probed for iCre because it is more relevant for functional studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) While anxiety-like behavior was viewed as an appropriate behavioral readout for validation of the rats, it was felt that the consensus around the role of the CeA in pain was less widely accepted and had more nuance. As such, it is requested that authors to cite the work on CeA CRF and analgesia and acknowledge that their chemogenetic manipulation seem to mimic injury-induced hyperalgesic states but not stress-induced analgesic states. The authors can use this opportunity to highlight that the transgenic rat would be an excellent tool for future studies aimed at studying stress-induced analgesia.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see Discussion, page 24, lines 355-365.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

While the inclusion of the BLA is an improvement, it still does not survey several regions. Rather the authors indicate that a full analysis of the specificity and penetrance of the transgene across brain regions will be reserved for a follow-up manuscript. While this may be, the reviewers agreed that it is paramount to this first publication to include more than two regions. From discussion, it was agreed amongst the reviewers that the authors should include characterization of the following brain regions: BNST, Hippocampus, VTA, LC, RN, PAG, PVN, and at least one cortical region.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, and we have performed additional experiments to image and quantify Cre-tdTomato-expressing cells in multiple areas across the CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rat brain. We now show that Cre-tdTomato-expressing cells are found in brain areas known to contain CRF1 cells, including the prelimbic and infralimbic cortex, piriform cortex, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular thalamus, ventral tegmental area, dorsal raphe, and locus coeruleus (Pg. 19-22, Figure 9). We compared the density of Cre-tdTomato cells in these areas to expression levels of Crhr1 mRNA in wild type rats (Van Pett et al., 2001), and density of GFP cells in CRF<sub>1</sub>-GFP mice (Justice et al.,2008), and found that they are similar (Pg. 22, Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second concern that does not seem to be sufficiently addressed in the revision is the need to perform experiments to determine where the BAC incorporated in the genome in the CRF1-Cre rat. This is particularly important when considering fluorescent reporter expression. The reviewers appreciated the additional discussion of potential caveats but agreed that additional experiments and analysis to validate this component of a new tool are needed. The issues that have arisen from other BAC mice and rats are believed to be a result of less than rigorous validation upon their initial introduction. As such, it seems incumbent on the authors to be as rigorous as possible in this first publication in order to avoid these recurrent issues with this particular rat tool.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this concern and we performed additional experiments to try to identify the genomic insertion site of the BAC. Unfortunately, these experiments were not successful, and we were not able to conclusively determine the insertion site. We explored a commercial sequencing option, but we currently do not have the resources for this option. Given that the expression pattern of the fluorescent reporter in CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rats is consistent with the known expression pattern of CRF1 cells throughout the brain, we are confident that genomic incorporation of the transgene produced expected Cre-tdTomato expression patterns. In addition, the behavioral and physiological phenotypes of CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rats reported in this manuscript closely resemble those seen in wild-type Wistar rats, suggesting that BAC insertion into the genome did not produce observable anomalous phenotypes (added to Discussion on Pg. 24).</p></body></sub-article></article>
