The presence of foreign DNA in the cytoplasm signals a danger for the cell. This DNA is recognized by specialized enzyme, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which generates cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diner et al., 2013</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). CDNs bind to STING activating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burdette et al., 2011</xref>), and the following signaling cascade results in NF-κB- and IRF3-dependent expression of immune response molecules such as type I interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ishikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>). Bacteria that invade the cell are also known to produce CDNs that directly activate STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Woodward et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Danilchanka and Mekalanos, 2013</xref>). Additionally, DNA that has leaked from the damaged nuclei or mitochondria can also activate STING signaling and inflammatory response, which, if excessive or unchecked, might lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawane et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jeremiah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>STING homologs are present in almost all animal phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Margolis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kranzusch et al., 2015</xref>). This protein has been extensively studied in mammalian immune response; however, the role of STING in the innate immunity of insects has been just recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Fruit fly <italic>D. melanogaster STING</italic> homolog is encoded by the <italic>CG1667</italic> gene, which we hereafter refer to as <italic>dSTING</italic>. dSTING displays anti-viral and anti-bacterial effects that however are not all encompassing. Particularly, it has been shown that dSTING-deficient flies are more susceptible to <italic>Listeria</italic> infection due to the decreased expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) – small positively charged proteins that possess antimicrobial properties against a variety of microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). However, no effect has been observed during <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goto et al., 2018</xref>). dSTING has been shown to attenuate Zika virus infection in fly brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and participate in the control of infection by two picorna-like viruses (DCV and CrPV) but not two other RNA viruses FHV and SINV or dsDNA virus IIV6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). All these effects are linked to the activation of NF-κB transcription factor Relish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kleino and Silverman, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Immune system is tightly linked with metabolic regulation in all animals, and proper re-distribution of the energy is crucial during immune challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Odegaard and Chawla, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwarawrah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee and Lee, 2018</xref>). In both flies and humans, excessive immune response can lead to a dysregulation of metabolic stores. Conversely, the loss of metabolic homeostasis can result in weakening of the immune system. The mechanistic links between these two important systems are integrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arrese and Soulages, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly to mammalian liver and adipose tissue, insect fat body stores excess nutrients and mobilizes them during metabolic shifts. The fat body also serves as a major immune organ by producing AMPs during infection. There is an evidence that the fat body is able to switch its transcriptional status from ‘anabolic’ to ‘immune’ program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2013</xref>). The main fat body components are lipids, with triacylglycerols (TAGs) constituting approximately 90% of the stored lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Canavoso et al., 2001</xref>). Even though most of the TAGs stored in fat body comes from the dietary fat originating from the gut during feeding, de novo lipid synthesis in the fat body also significantly contributes to the pool of storage lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Parvy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garrido et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Maintaining lipid homeostasis is crucial for all organisms. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism leads to a variety of metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. Despite the difference in physiology, most of the enzymes involved in metabolism, including lipid metabolism, are evolutionarily and functionally conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lehmann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Toprak et al., 2020</xref>). Major signaling pathways involved in metabolic control, such as insulin system, TOR, steroid hormones, FOXO, and many others, are present in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Oldham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jünger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">King-Jones and Thummel, 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that <italic>Drosophila</italic> has become a popular model system for studying metabolism and metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Teleman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Owusu-Ansah and Perrimon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Musselman and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker and Thummel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Huang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graham and Pick, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diop and Bodmer, 2015</xref>). With the availability of powerful genetic tools, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has all the advantages to identify new players and fill in the gaps in our understanding of the intricacies of metabolic networks.</p><p>In this work, we describe a novel function of dSTING in lipid metabolism. We report that flies with a deletion of <italic>dSTING</italic> are sensitive to the starvation and oxidative stress. Detailed analysis reveals that <italic>dSTING</italic> deletion results in a significant decrease in the main storage metabolites, such as TAG, trehalose, and glycogen. We identified two fatty-acid biosynthesis enzymes – acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) – as the interacting partners for dSTING. Moreover, we also found that FASN and ACC interacted with each other, indicating that all three proteins might be components of a large complex. Importantly, <italic>dSTING</italic> deletion leads to the decreased FASN activity and defects in ACC cellular localization suggesting a direct role of dSTING in lipid metabolism of fruit flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila STING</italic> mutants are sensitive to starvation and oxidative stress</title><p>Previously, we described a large genomic deletion that included <italic>orc6</italic> gene and the neighboring <italic>CG1667 (dSTING</italic>) gene, which at that time was not characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balasov et al., 2009</xref>).

Dietary glucose absorbed from the gut is quickly converted to trehalose, which is a main hemolymph sugar in insects. Glycogen is another form of a carbohydrate storage that accumulates in the fat body and muscles.

However, recent studies showed that the core components of STING pathway evolved more than 600 million years ago, before the evolution of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Margolis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Morehouse et al., 2020</xref>). This raises the question regarding the ancestral functions of STING. In this study we found that STING protein is involved in lipid metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The deletion of <italic>Drosophila STING (dSTING</italic>) gene rendered flies sensitive to the starvation and oxidative stress. These flies have reduced lipid storage and downregulated expression of lipid metabolism genes. We further showed that dSTING interacted with the lipid synthesizing enzymes ACC and FASN suggesting a possible regulatory role in the lipid biosynthesis. In the fat body, main lipogenic organ in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dSTING co-localized with both ACC and FASN in a cortical region of the ER. <italic>dSTING</italic> deletion resulted in the disturbed ACC localization in fat body cells and greatly reduced the activity of FASN in the in vitro assay.</p><p>Importantly, we also observed that ACC and FASN interacted with each other. Malonyl-CoA, the product of ACC, serves as a substrate for the FASN reaction of fatty acid synthesis. Enzymes that are involved in sequential reactions often physically interact with each other and form larger multi-enzyme complexes, which facilitates the substrate channeling and efficient regulation of the pathway flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schmitt and An, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kastritis and Gavin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sweetlove and Fernie, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang and Fernie, 2021</xref>). There are several evidences of the existence of the multi-enzyme complex involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. ACC, ACL (ATP citrate lyase), and FASN physically associated in the microsomal fraction of rat liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gillevet and Dakshinamurti, 1982</xref>). Moreover, in the recent work, a lipogenic protein complex including ACC, FASN, and four more enzymes was isolated from the oleaginous fungus <italic>Cunninghamella bainieri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shuib et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that a similar multi-enzyme complex exists in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other metazoan species, and it would be of great interest to identify its other potential members.</p><p>How does STING exerts its effect on lipid synthesis? Recently, the evidence has emerged for the control of the de novo fatty acid synthesis by two small effector proteins – MIG12 and Spot14. MIG12 overexpression in livers of mice increased total fatty acid synthesis and hepatic triglyceride content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). It has been shown that MIG12 protein binds to ACC and facilitates its polymerization thus enhancing the activity of ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Park et al., 2013</xref>). For Spot14, both the activation and inhibition of de novo lipogenesis have been reported, depending upon the tissue type and the cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rudolph et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">LaFave et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knobloch et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, there is an evidence that all four proteins – ACC, FASN, MIG12, and Spot14 – exist as a part of a multimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">McKean, 2016</xref>). It is plausible to suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> STING plays a role similar to MIG12 and/or Spot14 in regulating fatty acid synthesis. We propose that dSTING might ‘anchor’ ACC and FASN possibly together with other enzymes at the ER membrane. The resulting complex facilitates fatty acid synthesis by allowing for a quicker transfer of malonyl-CoA product of ACC to the active site of FASN. In <italic>dSTINGΔ</italic> mutants, ACC loses its association with some regions of the ER resulting in the weakened interaction between ACC and FASN. We did observe less FASN immunoprecipitated with ACC in <italic>dSTINGΔ</italic> mutants compared to control flies, and the opposite effect was found in flies expressing GFP-tagged dSTING (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that de novo synthesis of fatty acids continuously contributes to the total fat body TAG storage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wicker-Thomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Parvy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garrido et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that the reduced fatty acid synthesis due to the lowered FASN enzyme activity in <italic>dSTINGΔ</italic> deletion mutants might be responsible for the decreased TAG lipid storage and starvation sensitivity phenotypes. Sensitivity to oxidative stress might also be explained by the reduced TAG level. Evidences exist that the lipid droplets (consisting mainly of TAGs) provide protection against reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jarc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>). Furthermore, flies with ACC RNAi are found to be sensitive to the oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katewa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its direct role in ACC/FASN complex activity, STING might also affect a phosphorylation status of ACC and/or FASN. Both proteins are known to be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brownsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). In mammals, STING is an adaptor protein that transmits an upstream signal by interacting with kinase TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1). When in a complex with STING, TBK1 activates and phosphorylates IRF3 allowing its nuclear translocation and transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tanaka and Chen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, STING recruits a yet unidentified kinase that phosphorylates ACC and/or FASN thereby changing their enzymatic activity.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> STING itself could also be regulated by the lipid- synthesizing complex. STING palmitoylation was recently identified as a posttranslational modification necessary for STING signaling in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mukai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). In this way, palmitic acid synthesized by FASN might participate in the regulation of dSTING possibly providing a feedback loop.</p><p>The product of ACC – malonyl-CoA – is a key regulator of the energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saggerson, 2008</xref>). During lipogenic conditions, ACC is active and produces malonyl-CoA, which provides the carbon source for the synthesis of fatty acids by FASN. In <italic>dSTING</italic> knockout, FASN activity is decreased and malonyl-CoA is not utilized and builds up in the cells. Malonyl-CoA is also a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase CPT1, the enzyme that controls the rate of fatty acid entry into the mitochondria, and hence is a key determinant of the rate of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/beta-oxidation">fatty acid oxidation</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McGarry and Brown, 1997</xref>). Thus, a high level of malonyl-CoA results in a decreased fatty acid utilization for the energy. This might explain the down-regulation of lipid catabolism genes that we observed in <italic>dSTINGΔ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A reduced fatty acid oxidation in turn shifts cells to the increased reliance on glucose as a source of energy. Consistent with this notion, we observed an increased glucose level in fed <italic>dSTINGΔ</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as well as increased levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). PEP is produced during glycolysis, and its level was shown to correlate with the level of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Moreno-Felici et al., 2019</xref>). A reliance on glucose for the energy also has a consequence of reduced incorporation of glucose into trehalose and glycogen for storage, and therefore, lower levels of these storage metabolites, which we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). To summarize, based on our findings, we propose a model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, which suggests a direct involvement of dSTING in the regulation of lipid metabolism.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of <italic>dSTING</italic> deletion effect on <italic>Drosophila</italic> metabolism.</title><p>Based on our data, dSTING interacts with lipid synthesizing enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). In the absence of dSTING, the activity of FASN is reduced which results in decreased de novo fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride (TAG) synthesis. Low TAG level in turn lead to sensitivity to starvation and oxidative stress. Reduced FASN activity in <italic>dSTING</italic> mutants also results in ACC product malonyl-CoA build-up in the cells leading to the inhibition of the fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. Reduced fatty acid oxidation shifts cells to the increased reliance on glucose as a source of energy resulting in reduced glycogen and trehalose levels in <italic>dSTING</italic> mutants. Palmitic acid synthesized by FASN might participate in the regulation of dSTING via palmitoylation possibly providing a feedback loop.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67358-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Recent studies show that in mammals, the STING pathway is involved in metabolic regulation under the obesity conditions. The expression level and activity of STING were upregulated in livers of mice with high-fat diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2017</xref>). STING expression was increased in livers from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients compared to control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis mouse livers, STING mRNA level was also elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, STING deficiency ameliorated metabolic phenotypes and decreased lipid accumulation, inflammation, and apoptosis in fatty liver hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iracheta-Vellve et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petrasek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Qiao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the accumulating evidences, the exact mechanism of STING functions in metabolism is not completely understood. The prevailing hypothesis is that the obesity leads to a mitochondrial stress and a subsequent mtDNA release into the cytoplasm, which activates cGAS-STING pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bai and Liu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). The resulting chronic sterile inflammation is responsible for the development of NAFLD, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. In this case, the effect of STING on metabolism is indirect and mediated by inflammation effectors. The data presented in the current study strongly suggest that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, STING protein is directly involved in lipid metabolism by interacting with the enzymes involved in a lipid biosynthesis. This raises the question if the observed interaction is unique for <italic>Drosophila</italic> or it is also the case for mammals. Future work is needed to elucidate the evolutionary aspect of STING role in metabolism. Understanding the relationships between STING and lipid metabolism may provide insights into the mechanisms of the obesity-induced metabolism dysregulation and thereby suggest novel therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Dried polar samples were resuspended in 60 μl of 50% acetonitrile, vortexed for 10 s, and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 g at 4°C, and 5 μl of the supernatant was injected onto the LC/MS system in a randomized sequence. Mobile phase A consisted of 20 mM ammonium carbonate with 0.1% (vol/vol) ammonium hydroxide (adjusted to pH 9.3), and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. Chromatographic separation was achieved using the following gradient (flow rate set at 0.15 ml min<sup>−1</sup>): gradient from 90% to 40% B (0–22 min), held at 40% B (22–24 min), returned to 90% B (24–24.1 min), equilibrating at 90% B (24.1–30 min). The mass spectrometer was operated in polarity switching mode for both full MS and data-driven aquisition scans. The full MS scan was acquired with 70,000 resolution, 1× 106 automatic gain control (AGC) target, 80 ms max injection time, and a scan ranges of 110–755 m/z (neg), 805–855 m/z (neg), and 155–860 m/z (pos). The data-dependent MS/MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 17,500, 1× 105 AGC target, 50 ms max injection time, 1.6 Da isolation width, stepwise normalized collision energy of 20, 30, and 40 units, 8 s dynamic exclusion, and a loop count of 2, scan range of 110–860 m/z.</p><p>Relative quantitation of polar metabolites was performed using Skyline Daily56 (v.20.1.1.158) with the maximum mass and retention time tolerance were set to 2 ppm and 12 s, respectively, referencing an in-house library of chemical standards. Metabolite levels were normalized to the total protein amount for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Membrane and cytoplasmic protein extraction</title><p>Membrane fractionation was performed following the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abas and Luschnig, 2010</xref> with modifications. Flies were either fed or starved for 24 hr. Thirteen abdomens (guts and testes removed) from 5-day-old males of flies expressing GFP-dSTING (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup>;dSTINGΔ/dSTINGΔ;GFP-dSTING/GFP-dSTING</italic>) were ground in 100 µl of EB (30 mM Tris pH 7.5, 25% sucrose, 5% glycerol, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, aprotinin, leupeptin, PMSF), spun down at 600 g for 3 min to remove debris. Supernatant after centrifugation represents total protein fraction. Supernatant was diluted twice with 100 µl H<sub>2</sub>O and centrifuged at 21,000 g for 2 hr at 4°C. Resulting supernatant represents cytoplasmic fraction. Pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of EB supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, resulting in membrane fraction sample. Proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE and western blotting. Total protein fraction was used for assessing the levels of ACC and FASN. Cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were used to analyze GFP-dSTING localization. Antibodies used were as follows: ACC (1:1000, C83B10, Cell Signaling, #3676), FASN (1:2000, generously provided by A.Teleman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moraru et al., 2018</xref>]), Gapdh1 (1:2000, Sigma-Aldrich, #G9545), ATPβ (1:1000, Abcam, cat. ab14730), and GFP (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, B2, cat. sc-9996).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Adult fat body and guts were dissected in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100), and blocked with PBST supplemented with 10% goat serum for 1 hr at RT. Tissue were stained with primary antibodies in PBST +10% goat serum overnight at 4°C, washed three times with PBST, and incubated with secondary antibodies in PBST + 10% goat serum for 2 hr at RT. Antibodies used were as follows: ACC (1:200, C83B10, Cell Signaling, #3676), Calnexin (1:30, DSHB, Cnx99A, 6-2-1-s), FASN (1:150, generously provided by A.Teleman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moraru et al., 2018</xref>]), and GFP (Proteintech, cat. 50430–2-AP). After three washes with PBST, tissues were stained with DAPI, washed with PBS, and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, cat. 0100–01).

its ability to regulate metabolism in animals.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> STING protein has a role in lipid metabolism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A central message of this study is a direct role of dSTING in regulating metabolism, independent of its role in immunity. The potential chronic infection status of the flies in the experiments presented contributing to the metabolic changes observed is an important concern – reduced immunity in dSTING mutants could produce a higher pathogen load, which would consume energy. Please perform the storage metabolite assays (TAG, glycogen) under axenic conditions would help show that the two are or are not linked.</p><p>2. Cg-Gal4 expresses in fat body/circulation as well as lymph gland hemocytes. yolk-gal4 (adult-specific fat body driver) should be used to exclude the contribution of hemocytes. This is mandatory to exclude the contribution of non-fat body cells towards the phenotype.</p><p>3. In the manuscript experiments on both adult and larval fat body are shown in various figures. Reasons for the stages used and timeline of the experiments need to be stated clearly. The larval and adult stages cannot be used interchangeably. Assuming that the larval and adult fat body are equivalent is not advisable. Uniformity of the experimental set up is mandatory.</p><p>4. Spatiotemporal analysis of STRING across tissues is needed to further endorse/support the function proposed.</p><p>5.

The authors find that altered sensitivity to starvation and oxidative stress is accompanied by changes in the levels of neutral fat (triglyceride) storage in the fat body, a key metabolic organ in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, thought to be equivalent to the lever and adipose tissue in mammals. To understand the basis of this phenotype, the authors performed a gene expression analysis and report alterations in the expression of immune response genes (as previously reported) and metabolic processes such as fatty acid metabolism. Metabolomics analysis indicates alterations in a range of cellular metabolites in STING mutants. Finally, they find that two enzymes that are essential for fatty acid synthesis engage in protein-protein interactions and co-localize with STING in fat body cells. Depletion of STING results in the mis-localization of one of the enzymes ACC and reduced activity of the other, FAS.</p><p>If STING is a direct regulator of metabolism, it would be interesting to know how it couples cellular state and environmental cues to fatty acid biosynthesis. These remain to be discovered and a broader role for STING in regulating fatty acid metabolism outside the fat body also awaits discovery and will be stimulated by this study.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1.

Although dSTING deleted flies show no error in metabolism, they are sensitive to starvation and oxidative stress. The authors discovered that upon starvation/ oxidative stress, there is a significant decrease in the storage metabolites, such as TAG, trehalose and glycogen in dSTING deleted flies.</p><p>They identified two essential fatty-acid biosynthesis enzymes – Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) – as interacting partners through molecular and biochemical approaches for dSTING.</p><p>They propose that dSTING, FAS and ACC interacted with each other, and probably all three proteins are components of a large complex. In the absence of dSTING, there is a decrease in FAS activity and defects in ACC cellular localization, suggesting a direct role of dSTING in the lipid metabolism of fruit flies.</p><p>These data add an interesting insight into our understanding of stress-induced altered metabolism. Data mostly well support this paper's conclusions, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended. Following points should be addressed.</p><p>1) Title: &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> STING protein has a role in lipid metabolism&quot;. The title is misleading as a total loss of STING does not have a phenotype. The phenotypes are detectable upon stress. It emphasizes the fact that the dSTING function enables the organism to tide over stress. This thought should be reflected in the title.</p><p>2) The timeline for starvation/ oxidative stress should be schematically present or mentioned at least once in the text.</p><p>3) the dSTING starved larvae do they have a delay in pupation? Do the pupae eclose? Since pupae is a non-feeding state, the effect that we see in larvae will be nice to extend in the pupal stage.</p><p>4) &quot;The expression of GFP-dSTING partially or entirely rescued the sensitivity of dSTINGΔ deletion flies to both starvation and oxidative stress (Figure 1B,C), suggesting that observed phenotypes are caused by dSTING deficiency. &quot; Can it rescue larval defects…it needs to be shown.</p><p>5) &quot;the age-related mortality was slightly reduced, especially for females (Figure 1D)&quot;. A possible explanation needs to be mentioned.</p><p>6) &quot;Two RNAi screens for obesity and anti-obesity genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> did not reveal any significant changes in TAG level in dSTING-deficient flies (Pospisilik et al., 2010) (Baumbach et al., 2014). The potential discrepancy with our data might be explained by the fact that in both mentioned studies RNAi was induced only 2-8 days after eclosion, whereas in our study dSTING was absent from the very beginning of the development&quot; – Question: was the starvation in the current study not limited to the adulthood? To avoid confusion, the regime of starvation, a scheme is needed. If RNAi is done from the very beginning, will it endorse the current findings?</p><p>That might resolve the discrepancy.</p><p>7) Additional marker for neutral lipid should be used (LipidTOX).</p><p>8) &quot;fat body specific RNAi of dSTING resulted in starvation sensitivity and reduced TAG level in adult flies (Supplementary Figure 4), highlighting the role of dSTING in fat body functions.&quot; Cg-Gal4 expresses in also in blood/hemocytes. A more specific driver for the fat body like yolk-gal4 (adult-specific) should be used to exclude the contribution of hemocytes.</p><p>9) &quot;Consequently, we did not observe the increase in nuclear FoxO which is a characteristic of FoxO activation (Supplementary Figure 6)&quot;. Upon starvation, both dSTING lof and control upregulated nuclear FoxO</p><p>compared to fed.…any comments?</p><p>10) (Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure 7) Please mention the loading control, not as pnut but peanut or cpr=NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase in the figure legend or the panel itself.</p><p>11) &quot;Both ACC and FAS partially co-localized with GFP-dSTING at the cell periphery region of the ER (Figure 6B,C)&quot;. The Calnexin labeling performed is not convincing.</p><p>It needs to be repeated and a higher magnification to be included.</p><p>12) 7A: higher magnification to be included.</p><p>13) Strangely enough, how can ACC activity remain unchanged even though it is mislocalized upon loss of dSTING? ACC localization is not essentially related to its activity?</p><p>14) The FAS protein is normal, but activity is decreased. Is it due to its partial colocalization with the aggregates of ACC in the absence of STRING? It needs to be discussed.</p><p>15) &quot;Reliance on glucose for energy also has a consequence of reduced incorporation of glucose into trehalose and glycogen for storage, and therefore, lower levels of these storage metabolites, which we observed (Figure 2B,C)&quot; – what happens if we inhibit glucose by 2DG or genetically in String loss: will there be an increase in the levels of glucose into trehalose and glycogen?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Akhmetova et al. describe a novel role for an immune protein, dSTING, in the regulation of lipid metabolism. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> STING protein is required for energy storage in triglycerides, glycogen, and trehalose. The mechanism underlying dSTING's effects on lipogenesis appear to include direct interactions between dSTING and the lipogenic enzymes fatty acid synthase and acetyl coA carboxylase. Loss of dSTING had surprising effects on gene expression, including that of FASNs and ACC. How dSTING affects carbohydrate metabolism is unclear, but may be an indirect result of reducing the conversion of acetyl carbons into lipids. The direct effect of an immune protein on lipid homeostasis is a novel finding. One strength is that the authors use a broad range of approaches (expression profiling, microscopy, protein and metabolite mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, and enzymology) to develop a fascinating and impressive model of how dSTING controls lipogenesis.</p><p>I really liked this story – it's one of the most exciting recent findings in the field and it links immunity and metabolism in an unexpected way. There is a stunning amount of work that explores many facets of dSTING function and taken together, I found their data quite compelling. The work will be of interest to those studying immunity, immunometabolism, and metabolism. It serves as an example of how protein localization can affect metabolism and is also a potential platform to study how lipid metabolism can affect gene expression and carbohydrate flux.</p><p>There are some flaws in the experimental design and analyses that are of concern and prevent me from recommending acceptance.</p><p>1. The genetic background of the control flies should match the mutant alleles being used. For the deletion, there should be a precise excision of the P element used to generate the deletion, so that the genetic background is matched between the two. The genetic background of this insertion is not <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> but y[1] w[67c23]. For UAS crosses, the correct control should be a cross between the driver and an empty insertion site and/or the UAS crossed into the driver background. It is not clear to me if this was used consistently. The <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> stock control used throughout the paper is not the correct control and therefore it is difficult to interpret your results.</p><p>2. For some experiments, there seem to be low replicate #s (3-5) and the bar graphs showing the means instead of individual data points make it difficult to determine whether the data are normally distributed. Scatter plots with each data point would help the reviewers better assess the rigor of these experiments.</p><p>3. The survival analyses in 1B, C, D and elsewhere should use Mantel-Cox statistics, not t tests. And comparisons of more than two sample types should probably use an ANOVA, not a student's t-test.</p><p>4. It would also be great if quantitative data were presented for the Western blots. A couple of the blots seem unevenly loaded (5B', S6 fed) and in Figure S6, a nuclear protein should have been used as a loading control for nuclear fractions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> STING protein has a role in lipid metabolism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

A central message of this study is a direct role of dSTING in regulating metabolism, independent of its role in immunity. The potential chronic infection status of the flies in the experiments presented contributing to the metabolic changes observed is an important concern – reduced immunity in dSTING mutants could produce a higher pathogen load, which would consume energy. Please perform the storage metabolite assays (TAG, glycogen) under axenic conditions would help show that the two are or are not linked.</p></disp-quote><p>The data on starvation stress and oxidative stress of axenic flies are included and supplemented with genetic rescue data (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B).

IT cannot also be assumed that the larval and adult fat body are equivalent.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript is rewritten and reorganized to address this concern. Some of the experiments regarding larval fat body were removed from the manuscript to avoid confusion such as autophagy data (previous Supplementary Figure 5) and lipid staining of larval fat body (previous Supplementary Figure 2C) as suggested. We also added the description of the age and sex of the flies used in the experiments in Figure legends.</p><p>As for the mass spec, we performed the mass spec experiment on larvae as one of our initial experiments, since larval fat body is very easy to dissect relative to the adult fat body. Most prominent hits were then confirmed using IP from adult carcasses extracts (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Supp Figure 7.

Although dSTING deleted flies show no error in metabolism, they are sensitive to starvation and oxidative stress. The authors discovered that upon starvation/ oxidative stress, there is a significant decrease in the storage metabolites, such as TAG, trehalose and glycogen in dSTING deleted flies.</p><p>They identified two essential fatty-acid biosynthesis enzymes – Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) – as interacting partners through molecular and biochemical approaches for dSTING.</p><p>They propose that dSTING, FAS and ACC interacted with each other, and probably all three proteins are components of a large complex. In the absence of dSTING, there is a decrease in FAS activity and defects in ACC cellular localization, suggesting a direct role of dSTING in the lipid metabolism of fruit flies.</p><p>These data add an interesting insight into our understanding of stress-induced altered metabolism. Data mostly well support this paper's conclusions, but some aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified and extended. Following points should be addressed.</p><p>1) Title: &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> STING protein has a role in lipid metabolism&quot;. The title is misleading as a total loss of STING does not have a phenotype. The phenotypes are detectable upon stress. It emphasizes the fact that the dSTING function enables the organism to tide over stress. This thought should be reflected in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the title accurately represents our findings. We also would like to point out that <italic>dSTING</italic> mutant flies have phenotype of decreased TAG, glycogen and trehalose levels even under fed conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The timeline for starvation/ oxidative stress should be schematically present or mentioned at least once in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We added following sentences to the manuscript: “After the eclosion, flies were kept on regular food for 5 days and then transferred to vials containing wet Whatman paper (starvation stress) or to vials containing regular food supplemented with 5% hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress)”. Also, we added the description of the age and sex of the flies used in the experiments in Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) the dSTING starved larvae do they have a delay in pupation? Do the pupae eclose? Since pupae is a non-feeding state, the effect that we see in larvae will be nice to extend in the pupal stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have preliminary data on slightly reduced pupation rate for <italic>dSTING</italic> mutants even in fed conditions (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). However, in this manuscript we concentrate on adult stage. Future experiments will be needed to explore the effect of <italic>dSTING</italic> mutation at larval and pupae stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;The expression of GFP-dSTING partially or entirely rescued the sensitivity of dSTINGΔ deletion flies to both starvation and oxidative stress (Figure 1B,C), suggesting that observed phenotypes are caused by dSTING deficiency. &quot; Can it rescue larval defects…it needs to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We added genetic rescue data to larval starvation and oxidative stress tests (Figure 1—figure supplement 2AB).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;the age-related mortality was slightly reduced, especially for females (Figure 1D)&quot;. A possible explanation needs to be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>There are multiple evidences that the reduced TAG level correlates with the increased lifespan (PMID: 16434470, PMID: 21930912, PMID: 22870336, PMID: 12543978, PMID: 31560163). One possibility is that increased longevity is the direct result of altered insulin signaling. Mutations that reduce signaling through the insulin-like signaling pathway can increase lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (eg PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11292874/?utm_source=gquery&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=CitationSensor?otool=None">11292874</ext-link>, PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11292875/?utm_source=gquery&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=CitationSensor?otool=None">11292875</ext-link>).

The potential discrepancy with our data might be explained by the fact that in both mentioned studies RNAi was induced only 2-8 days after eclosion, whereas in our study dSTING was absent from the very beginning of the development&quot; – Question: was the starvation in the current study not limited to the adulthood? To avoid confusion, the regime of starvation, a scheme is needed. If RNAi is done from the very beginning, will it endorse the current findings?</p><p>That might resolve the discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript we concentrated on the role of <italic>dSTING</italic> in mature 5-days-old adults.

Is it due to its partial colocalization with the aggregates of ACC in the absence of STRING? It needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The result is also puzzling for us. We hypothesize that FASN activity is improved when in the complex with ACC (for example by a faster transfer of malonyl-CoA product of ACC to the active site of FASN). When ACC is mislocalized from FASN in <italic>dSTING</italic> mutants, ACC activity remains unchanged but FASN activity is decreased.
