Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to downregulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1α phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3’ supplementary regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are the chemical ‘workhorses’ of the cell: some help maintain a cell’s shape or structure, while others carry out the chemical reactions necessary for life. Organisms therefore need to keep tight control over the production of proteins in their cells, so that the right amount of each protein is made at the right time, in the right place.</p><p>Instructions for making new proteins are encoded in a type of molecule called messenger RNA. Each messenger RNA contains the instructions for one protein, which are then ‘read’ and carried out by special cellular machinery called ribosomes. The cell can control how much protein it produces by regulating both the levels of different messenger RNA and the amount of protein ribosomes are allowed to make from those instructions.</p><p>The main way to regulate the levels of messenger RNA is through their transcription from the genome. However, this needs fine tuning. Cells can do this in a highly specific way using molecules called microRNAs. A microRNA works by directing a protein called Argonaute to the messenger RNA that it targets. Once Argonaute arrives, it can call in additional ‘helper proteins’ to shut down, or reduce, protein production from that messenger RNA, or alternatively to break down the messenger RNA altogether.</p><p>Cells can use an enzyme called CK1α to attach bulky chemical groups onto a specific part of the Argonaute protein, in a reaction termed phosphorylation. The ability to carry out this reaction (and to reverse it) also seems to be important for microRNAs to do their job properly, but why has remained unknown. Bibel et al. wanted to determine what triggers CK1α to phosphorylate Argonaute, and how this affects interactions between microRNAs, Argonaute and their target messenger RNAs.</p><p>A series of ‘test tube’ experiments looked at the interaction between purified CK1α and Argonaute under different conditions. These demonstrated that CK1α could only carry out its phosphorylation reaction when Argonaute was already interacting with a microRNA and its corresponding messenger RNA. Further measurements revealed that phosphorylation of Argonaute made it detach from the messenger RNA more quickly. This suggests that phosphorylation might be a way to let Argonaute seek out new messenger RNAs after blocking protein production at its first ‘target’.</p><p>These results shed new light on a fundamental mechanism that cells use to control protein production. Bibel et al. propose that this mechanism may be shared across many different species and could one day help guide the development of new medical therapies based on microRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>Argonaute</kwd><kwd>gene silencing</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joshua-Tor</surname><given-names>Leemor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1938105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bibel</surname><given-names>Brianna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NCI CSHL Cancer Center Support Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P30CA045508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joshua-Tor</surname><given-names>Leemor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Shared Instrumentation Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD016234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>A Komives</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The central RNA interference protein, human Argonaute-2, releases its target following phosphorylation on a critical loop in the protein, freeing microRNA-bound Argonaute-2 to seek out and repress additional targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most metazoan genes are regulated post-transcriptionally by RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). RNAi is a conserved process whereby an Argonaute (Ago) protein binds to a small RNA, such as a microRNA (miRNA) or a small interfering RNA (siRNA), ~22 nt in length, and uses it as a guide to seek out and bind target mRNAs containing regions of partial complementarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel, 2018</xref>). Binding of the core RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), consisting of Ago and a guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rivas et al., 2005</xref>), to an mRNA can lead to recruitment of cofactors and decreased translation of protein from that mRNA through a number of mechanisms including: preventing translation initiation and elongation; promoting mRNA decay; triggering premature termination and co-translational protein degradation; and sequestering targets from the translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichhorn et al., 2014</xref>). Ago has a high affinity for miRNAs with a very slow off-rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kingston and Bartel, 2019</xref>). Consequently, most Ago/guide complexes are long-lived, with average half-lives on the order of days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gantier et al., 2011</xref>) and some complexes stable for at least 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olejniczak et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, once loaded with a guide, Ago can repress countless matching mRNA sites, as long as it is able to efficiently release these targets once silencing is achieved. This turnover is crucial because potential target sites are present in large excess compared to the corresponding miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denzler et al., 2016</xref>). miRNA-binding sites are typically located within the target mRNA’s 3’ UTR and are primarily determined by perfect complementarity in a 6–8 nt ‘seed sequence’ corresponding to nucleotides 2–8 of the guide miRNA (g2–8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartel, 2009</xref>), augmented by additional pairing beyond this region. In the core RISC, the subseed region of the miRNA (g2–5) is preorganized for base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkayam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schirle and MacRae, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klum et al., 2018</xref>), which allows Ago to rapidly sample potential target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klum et al., 2018</xref>). Binding to a fully complementary seed induces conformational changes in Ago that expose more of the miRNA and widen Ago’s RNA-binding channel, allowing for further pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>). Target sites vary in their amount of complementarity to a guide outside of the seed sequence, and additional pairing can influence a site’s repression efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>). This pairing often occurs in the more solvent-exposed 3’ supplementary region (corresponding to g12–17) through a second nucleation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019b</xref>). 3’ supplementary pairing, most effectively with 3–4 contiguous base pairs centered around g13–16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>), can strengthen repression by increasing guide/target affinity through a decrease in <italic>K<sub>off</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao and MacRae, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>). It also allows miRNAs of the same family (miRNAs that share the same seed sequence) to preferentially repress different sets of targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broughton et al., 2016</xref>). More common for siRNAs, full guide-target complementarity is rare among metazoan miRNA targets, but when present it results in ‘slicing’ by some Ago proteins, a process in which the target mRNA is cleaved between nucleotides across from g10 to g11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meister et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Ago proteins are part of a larger Ago superfamily, which includes Piwi- and Wago-clade proteins. Members of the superfamily show high structural conservation throughout evolution and have four main structural domains: N, PAZ, MID, and PIWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2004</xref>). The MID and PIWI domains form an almost continuous lobe which, together with the N domain, forms a crescent-shaped base above which the PAZ domain is able to move more freely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ming et al., 2007</xref>). The 5’ end of the small RNA is bound by a pocket created by the MID and PIWI domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frank et al., 2010</xref>) and the 3’ end is held by the PAZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2004</xref>), with the length of the small RNA cradled in a groove traversing the crescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkayam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schirle and MacRae, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The PAZ domain is the most flexible and, sometimes in concert with the N domain, undergoes rigid body movements along linker regions (L1 and L2) in order to accommodate RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ming et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faehnle et al., 2013</xref>). Humans have four Ago orthologs (hAgo1–4) in addition to four Piwi-clade Agos, with hAgo2 being the most highly expressed in most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valdmanis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hauptmann et al., 2015</xref>). Although particular functions have been attributed to specific hAgo proteins, hAgo1–4 are largely considered functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2009</xref>). The lone exception is hAgo2; knock-out of hAgo2 is lethal in early mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morita et al., 2007</xref>), whereas knock-out of the other hAgos, and even knock-out of all three, is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hajarnis et al., 2018</xref>). This essentiality is attributed largely to the fact that, under most circumstances, only hAgo2 has slicer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meister et al., 2004</xref>). Although slicing is not required for miRNA-mediated regulation, it is necessary for the maturation of rare but important Dicer-independent miRNAs including miR-451 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheloufi et al., 2010</xref>) and miR-486 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jee et al., 2018</xref>), which play essential roles in erythrocyte development.</p><p>Although the core architecture is conserved among all Ago proteins, they are subject to multiple types of post-translational modification, including ubiquitylation, PARylation, and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jee and Lai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gebert and MacRae, 2019</xref> ). For example, S837 undergoes stress-induced p38/MAPK-mediated S837 phosphorylation, which, among other effects, is thought to contribute to hAgo2 localization in processing bodies (P-bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeng et al., 2008</xref>). There is a span of residues on the surface of the PIWI domain in eukaryotic miRNA-specialized Ago proteins that is absent in prokaryotic Ago proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This region, corresponding to residues ~820–837 in hAgo2 numbering, is termed the eukaryotic insertion (EI), and it contains four to five highly conserved potential phosphorylation sites: four serine residues (in hAgo2 numbering, S824, S828, S831, and S834) as well as a threonine (T830) which is only conserved in Ago2 homologs. This cluster was recently found to be heterogeneously phosphorylated in multiple Ago homologs in a variety of cell types and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>) and its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were attributed to the kinase CK1α and the phosphatase PP6/ANKRD52, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Target binding triggers phosphorylation of the hAgo2 eukaryotic insertion (EI).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Conservation of the EI in eukaryotic miRNA-handling Argonaute proteins.

Additionally, disruption of the hAgo EI phosphorylation cycle led to dysregulation of mRNA levels, as determined by RNA-seq. In the absence of EI phosphorylation, hAgo2 associated with a more diverse pool of mRNA targets, but with decreased coverage of individual targets as determined by eCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, reporter assays showed that increased phosphorylation or its mimicking led to reduced repression of reporter targets in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheloufi et al., 2010</xref> and in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jee et al., 2018</xref>). These silencing defects could be rescued by tethering Ago to the target, indicating that phosphorylation impaired a step upstream of repression, preventing productive Ago-guide/target interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>). Together with their findings that miRNA production and guide association appeared unaffected, these results point to a role of EI phosphorylation in mediating Ago-guide/target interactions, but key questions remained about the molecular events associated with this process.</p><p>Using a combination of biochemical and biophysical assays, we determined that binding of miRNA-bound hAgo2 to targets containing 3’ supplementary pairing triggers hierarchical phosphorylation of the EI by CK1α. The added negative charge electrostatically repels the negatively charged target RNA, leading to target release. Such regulation could help explain how cells maintain tight and consistent miRNA-mediated regulation despite there being a large excess of miRNA target sites compared to Ago and miRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denzler et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Target binding promotes CK1α-mediated EI phosphorylation in vitro</title><p>As noted above, EI is a feature that is characteristic of eukaryotic miRNA-specialized Ago proteins and is absent in prokaryotic Ago proteins.

This suggested that, within cells, EI phosphorylation is stimulated by target binding. This stimulatory effect could be due to features inherent to the ternary Ago-miRNA/target complex itself, or caused by binding of external mediators, for example, repression-mediating proteins that are recruited after target binding such as GW-182, PAN2-PAN3, and CCR4-NOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>). To determine if target-binding alone could stimulate phosphorylation in the absence of cofactors, we tested CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of recombinant, dephosphorylated, hAgo2 in its apo state (RNA-free), when bound to a guide miRNA (miR-200b), and when bound to guide and a partially complementary target in vitro. For this target, we used a 30-nt RNA we will refer to as ZT1, which corresponds to a natural, highly conserved, miR-200-binding site in the 3’ UTR of the transcription factor ZEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gregory et al., 2008</xref>). This guide/target combination was chosen because the target’s genomic location was identified as bound to 5XA but not wild-type (wt) hAgo2 in previous eCLIP experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting it was sensitive to EI phosphorylation in vivo. It was also chosen because of its functional relevance in helping regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gregory et al., 2008</xref>). We did not detect any phosphorylation of RNA-free hAgo2 above background and detected very low levels of phosphorylation with guide-only-bound hAgo2, 0.14 ± 0.07 mol phosphorylation per mol Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, when we added target RNA, we observed substantial phosphorylation, 2.6 ± 0.2 mol phosphorylation per mol hAgo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). No phosphorylation was observed when all five phosphorylatable EI residues were mutated to alanine hAgo2(5XA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), confirming that the observed phosphorylation of the wt hAgo2 occurs and is dependent upon EI residues. To test whether the other human Ago orthologs behave in a similar fashion, we tested hAgo1 and hAgo3 using this assay. We found that these Agos are also subject to target-binding-triggered CK1α-mediated phosphorylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings that hAgo1 and hAgo3 are phosphorylated on multiple residues in the EI in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphorylation is promoted by pairing in the supplementary region</title><p>Because of the observed effects of target binding, we decided to further investigate what features of the target RNA affect EI phosphorylation.

Therefore, to further investigate the importance of supplementary pairing, we tested phosphorylation of hAgo2-guide-traget ternary complexes with varying amounts of complementarity to the guide miRNA. Length-matched (30 nt) target with complementarity to the seed region alone was incapable of stimulating robust hAgo2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). However, targets with full complementarity also failed to trigger phosphorylation in either wt or catalytically inactivated hAgo2 (Ago2(D669N)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). The latter was included to control for potential confounding effects caused by slicing, which occurs with hAgo2 and fully complementary guide/target pairs. This result is consistent with our finding that EI phosphomimetics do not significantly affect slicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, targets with extended 3’ complementarity, resembling target-directed miRNA decay (TDMD) targets, which are known to lead to an altered conformation of hAgo2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019a</xref>), triggered significantly less phosphorylation than the original target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Therefore, length and supplementary region complementarity are not sufficient to maximally trigger phosphorylation. Instead, a more particular target site configuration of seed + supplementary pairing (i.e. without central or extensive 3’ pairing) serves as a trigger.</p><p>These findings may be explained by the unique conformations Ago adopts to accommodate varying amounts of base pairing. Binding to short targets is known to lead to a shift in hAgo2’s PAZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>), which could make the EI more accessible for CK1α. There are no structures of hAgo2 bound to a full-length ‘canonical’ miRNA target containing seed and supplementary pairing. However, the crystal structure of a catalytically inactivated hAgo2 bound to a target RNA with complementary to nucleotides 2–16 of the guide (g2–16) was recently determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019b</xref>). In this structure, likely due to Ago’s inability to cleave the target, the RNA is not base paired in the central region (g9–11) and instead pairs only in the seed and supplementary regions, a conformation which the authors posit could represent one that is adopted by Ago upon binding traditional miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019b</xref>).

In order to obtain structural information regarding conformational changes that the EI might be undergoing during these events, we turned to hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), which measures conformational dynamics and solvent accessibility by analyzing the exchange of hydrogens for deuterium over time. The measured deuterium uptake corresponds primarily to exchange from backbone amides, and thus regions with stable secondary structure have high levels of protection (low deuterium uptake) whereas more flexible and/or exposed regions are less protected and thus have higher deuterium uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wales and Engen, 2006</xref>). Samples of hAgo2 in RNA-free (RF), guide-bound (G-bound), and guide + target-bound (GT-bound) states were analyzed to investigate whether guide- and/or target-binding influence the structure of the EI or the surrounding residues. Since no reliable peptides covering the EI could be measured for wt hAgo2, we used the 5XA mutant, which has a similar target-binding affinity compared to dephosphorylated wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), yet did have reliable coverage of the EI. The 5XA mutant showed minimal differences in exchange compared to the dephosphorylated wt RNA-free hAgo2 over the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Very minor, yet statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01), differences were only seen at one of the four timepoints (2 min) and were restricted to 10 (out of 255) peptides, none of which were in the region surrounding the EI. Thus, 5XA is a good proxy for the dephosphorylated wt protein. Near-complete (99.4%) sequence coverage was achieved, with a total of 262 peptides and an average redundancy of 5.29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Seven peptides covering the EI were detected in all datasets, the shortest being 811–842 and 812–842.

Importantly, they showed no statistically significant differences between the G-bound and the GT-bound at any timepoint (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The G-bound showed slight protection compared to the RF, however taking overlapping peptides into account to increase resolution, this increase can be attributed to higher uptake in the region downstream of 834, outside of the EI itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The EI showed a moderately high level of exchange, suggesting little defined secondary structure in any state, and no detectable differences in secondary structure content between the states. If maximal exchange was already realized at the earliest timepoint (30 s), we would not be able to detect an increase in flexibility nor solvent accessibility, only a decrease. Since we do not see any such decrease, we can conclude that neither guide- nor target-binding offer protection to phosphorylatable residues. However, we cannot rule out conformational changes occurring that do not involve strong changes in secondary structure content.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) of the hAgo2(5XA) eukaryotic insertion (EI).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Deuterium uptake plots for the shortest peptide covering the EI shows no significant difference between the guide-bound (<bold>G-bound</bold>) and guide + target-bound (GT-bound) states.

CK1α has a canonical sequence preference of pS/pT-x-x-S/T* or (E,D)<sub>n</sub>-x-x-S/T*-x where ‘p’ indicates a phosphorylated site, * indicates the site to be phosphorylated, and ‘x’ indicates any amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Venerando et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, prior phosphorylation (by CK1α or another kinase) can prime for subsequent phosphorylation, making CK1α capable of hierarchical phosphorylation. This has been proposed to occur at the EI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>), however heterogeneity has hindered past attempts to characterize EI phosphorylation status at the amino acid level. In addition to differences in phosphorylation status among Ago molecules, identical charged states (e.g. 1P, 2P, 3P, or 4P) can be formed with different combinations of phosphorylated residues. Furthermore, due to the close clustering of the sites, as well as the tendency of phosphorylations to be lost during processing and mass spectrometry, proteomic studies have been unable to identify every phosphorylation combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine which EI residues get phosphorylated in vitro, we addressed this ambiguity by performing in vitro phosphorylation assays on hAgo2 constructs in which we prevented phosphorylation at specific sites by mutating each potentially phosphorylatable serine or threonine to alanine, individually or in various combinations. Since we had previously determined that target binding is required for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we carried out these assays in the presence of guide (miR-200) and target (ZT1). We started by looking at which residues could get phosphorylated by CK1α in vitro without priming phosphorylation by way of creating a series of five ‘single o’ hAgo2 mutations in which only a single residue is ‘open’ for phosphorylation, with the others changed to alanine. For example, to check for S824 phosphorylation, we designed an Ago2(S828A/T830A/S831A/S834A) mutant, abbreviated to ‘824o’. We observed phosphorylation of the 828o mutant, but not of any of the other four (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Thus, only S828 can get phosphorylated by CK1α in vitro in the absence of prior priming phosphorylation. An upstream acidic cluster in the EI was proposed to provide a non-primed canonical recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>) however, we found that phosphorylation was not impacted when we mutated those acidic residues to neutral ones (i.e. E821Q/D823N/E826Q) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of the hAgo2 eukaryotic insertion (EI) occurs hierarchically.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of miR-200/ZT1-bound wild-type (wt), 5XA, and ‘single open’ mutants in which only a single potential phosphosite is open for phosphorylation by CK1α, with the rest mutated to alanine, shows that S828 is the only site capable of CK1α-mediated phosphorylation without previous priming phosphorylation.

Therefore, we engineered ‘double o’ hAgo2 EI constructs in which 828 and only one other residue are open for phosphorylation, while the other three sites are mutated to alanine.

The ‘double o’ mutant in which S828 and S831 were open (i.e. Ago2(T830A, S831A, S834A)) showed significantly increased phosphorylation, whereas the mutants with 824, 830, or 834 open showed only minor increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

We saw an increase in phosphorylation in all three cases, suggesting that, after the second phosphorylation at S831, the EI phosphorylation pattern can follow different routes and is more heterogenous than the initial S828 followed by S831 phosphorylation pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Individual mutation of S824, S828, or S834 to alanine did not significantly affect phosphorylation compared to the wt, suggesting that, in our in vitro system, multiple third/fourth sites can be phosphorylated but likely never all five at the same time. An alternative explanation is that only 828 and 831 get phosphorylated in our system; however, the ‘triple o’ mutants show a lower degree of phosphorylation than the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Therefore, this alternative explanation would imply that alanine mutations at two sites make the EI a worse substrate overall, decreasing 828 and/or 831 phosphorylation. Importantly, mutation of S828 to alanine prevented almost all detectable phosphorylation and mutation of S831 to alanine substantially decreased phosphorylalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), supporting their key roles in the hierarchy of EI phosphorylation.

Most human genes contain at least one evolutionarily conserved miRNA target site, and many genes are under regulation by multiple families of miRNAs. Each miRNA family, in turn, typically has hundreds of targets; the 90 most broadly conserved miRNA families have over 400 conserved targets each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). At the same time, the number of miRNA target sites is much greater than the number of miRNA-Ago complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denzler et al., 2014</xref>) and the half-lives of mRNAs are, on average, significantly shorter than those of RISC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kingston and Bartel, 2019</xref>). Therefore, it appears that each core RISC targets multiple mRNAs throughout its lifetime. On the other hand, repression efficacy is largely related to binding stability, with stronger binding correlating with enhanced repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGeary et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, ensuring robust mRNA repression at the global level is a balancing act between enabling strong binding at individual sites and binding to a large number of sites. 3’ supplementary pairing increases binding affinity and thus can lead to enhanced repression at cognate sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2019</xref>), but high affinity may come with the risk of effectively sequestering RISC. CK1α-mediated EI phosphorylation provides a mechanism to counterbalance this added affinity, freeing RISC to repress additional targets. Indeed, Golden et al. found that hAgo2 which could not be phosphorylated in the EI associated with a more diverse pool of mRNA targets, but with decreased coverage of individual targets, accompanied by global dysregulation of miRNA-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This may help explain discrepancies between the in vitro and in vivo effects of 3’ supplementary pairing. In vitro, 3’ supplementary pairing can significantly enhance the stability of Ago/target interactions, with 3–4 contiguous canonical base pairs in the supplementary region increasing affinity over 20-fold for some miRNA/target pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao and MacRae, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>). This effect is more pronounced for miRNAs with weak, low GC-content, seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao and MacRae, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>). However, several reports concluded that the contributions of supplementary pairing in vivo and in cell culture are less substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>). Some of this discrepancy has been attributed to differences in cell types and measurement conditions, as well as the large effects of a small number of miRNA/targets being diluted out in large datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao and MacRae, 2020</xref>). Additionally, the precise position and composition of optimal pairing in the 3’ region has been found to differ for different miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McGeary et al., 2022</xref>), complicating classifications and predictions.</p><p>However, as we have shown in this study, supplementary pairing triggers phosphorylation of the EI, which could offset added binding affinity. Therefore, in vivo, the overall effects of supplementary pairing on target repression would appear to be less pronounced. This would be consistent with supplementary pairing functioning primarily to distinguish between target sites for the same miRNAs. Phosphorylation of targets with supplementary pairing <italic>after</italic> repression is established, freeing RISC to repress additional targets, would allow for the most efficient use of supplementary pairing for such discriminatory purposes.</p><p>CK1α phosphorylation likely occurs in a distributive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebel et al., 2020</xref>). Because phosphorylation of multiple residues would require CK1α to actively interact with Ago multiple times, supplementary pairing might be expected to increase phosphorylation by way of added affinity. However, we found that target retention time is not the primary driver of CK1α-mediated EI phosphorylation, as demonstrated by the minimal levels of phosphorylation observed upon binding to the fully complementary or TDMD-like target. Our findings instead suggest that the conformation of the RISC complex is of primary importance with regard to triggering phosphorylation. Compared to 3’ supplementary targets, fully complementary targets require different conformational changes due to base pairing of the central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sheu-Gruttadauria et al., 2019b</xref>), and these changes might make Ago’s EI a poorer substrate for CK1α.</p><p>Recently, a study linked a variety of germline single amino acid mutations in hAgo2 to RNAi deficits and neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lessel et al., 2020</xref>). These mutations clustered in helix 7, L1, and a loop in the PIWI domain, and, when expressed in cell culture, some of the mutated Agos had decreased EI phosphorylation and a slight increase in quantity of select target mRNAs. This, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, led the authors to propose that reduced phosphorylation prevents efficient target release. Based on our findings that target binding promotes phosphorylation, prolonged target binding in the usual conformation would be expected to increase rather than decrease phosphorylation. Therefore, it appears possible that the identified mutations may cause hAgo2 to adopt a suboptimal target-bound conformation which disfavors, or at least fails to promote, phosphorylation.</p><p>There are multiple examples in the literature where substrate tertiary structure has been shown to be critical for promoting CK1-mediated phosphorylation. For example, T-antigen is phosphorylated by CK1 at non-canonical sites at its N-terminus in a manner that is dependent on proper folding and an intact C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cegielska et al., 1994</xref>). Similarly, conformational changes induced by target binding may cause Ago to adopt a conformation which is structurally preferable for CK1α. However, this preference cannot solely be attributed to the changes making the EI more accessible. Despite the high degree of flexibility and solvent accessibility of the EI and the surrounding area in the RNA-free hAgo2, as seen from our HDX-MS results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and through limited proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkayam et al., 2012</xref>), we were unable to phosphorylate it in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests there must be an additional factor required. Since the EI shows no significant changes in deuterium exchange neither upon guide- nor upon target-binding, the additional information needed to enable phosphorylation stems from outside of the EI. Such information could come from a different part of the hAgo2 protein that is now in a more suitable conformation to interact with the kinase. Alternatively and/or additionally, factors outside of hAgo2 may assume this role, potentially the target RNA itself.</p><p>As we show in this study, target binding triggers the CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of S828 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, this residue is a non-canonical target for CK1α, deviating from its preferred consensus sequence, as determined largely through peptide-based studies. Numerous examples have now come to light in which CK1α phosphorylates non-canonical sites, and additional consensus sequences have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marin et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, CK1 kinases are thought to generally prefer primed substrates. Binding of the phosphorylated, priming residue, or a cluster of acidic residues to a basic patch on the kinase, named Anion Binding Site 1, is thought to stabilize the kinase in an active conformation and position the downstream phosphorylation site in the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Philpott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Longenecker et al., 1996</xref>). However, phosphorylation was not impacted when we neutralized the acidic residues previously proposed to serve as a priming cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We would like to suggest that it is the target RNA’s backbone, being negatively charged, that may be able to bind to this site and prime for S828 phosphorylation. The need for seed + supplementary pairing as opposed to other complementarity combinations in order to trigger robust phosphorylation supports a role for conformational change. These changes might position the RNA to interact with the kinase properly, rather than making the EI more accessible.</p><p>The need for target binding could explain findings from previously reported in vitro phosphorylation assays testing CK1α’s ability to phosphorylate peptide substrates spanning hAgo2’s EI region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). Golden et al. reported that an unphosphorylated EI peptide could not be phosphorylated by recombinant CK1α, leading them to propose that contextual features in the full-length hAgo2 were required in order to make S828 a suitable CK1α substrate. Our work shows that it is not only full-length hAgo2 that is required, but rather hAgo2 bound to a guide and target RNA with seed and supplementary region pairing.</p><p>All the in vitro phosphorylation experiments that have been reported point to a central importance of S828. Our finding that S828 phosphorylation is required for subsequent hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α in full-length hAgo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is consistent with previous experiments using phosphorylated peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). Golden et al. showed that peptides phosphorylated at S828 were able to be phosphorylated at S831 and those phosphorylated at S831 were able to be phosphorylated at S834. They suggested that pS828 primes for hierarchical phosphorylation of the EI at S831 and S834, consistent with our experiments with full-length hAgo2. This was further supported by their finding that S828A mutation, but not a single A mutation at any of the other phosphorylatable residues in the EI, eliminated detectable phosphorylation of hAgo2 in HCT116 cells lacking expression of ANKRD52, a regulatory subunit of PP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). The central importance of S828 is also reflected in functional data from in vivo experiments. Huberdeau et al. found that mutating the corresponding serine in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hAgo2 homolog ALG-1 (S992) to alanine led to severe developmental defects similar to those seen when mutating all EI phosphorylation sites to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, Golden et al. reported that expression of hAgo2(S828A), but not wt hAgo2, was able to rescue repression of a miR-19 EGFP reporter in ANKRD52-deficient cells. Phosphorylation of S828 thus appears to serve as a key gatekeeper regulating further phosphorylation and its consequent functional effects, implying its regulation would be critical. We now show that this gatekeeper is directly regulated by target binding.</p><p>Because miRNA-mediated repression does not involve slicing of the targets, additional cofactors are required to carry out silencing of miRNA targets. After miRNA-bound Ago binds a target mRNA, Ago binds a scaffolding protein of the GW182 family (TNRC6A/B/C in humans), which in turn recruits deadenylation complexes (PAN2-PAN3 and/or CCR4-NOT) and decapping complexes to promote target degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>). Previous studies have found that EI phosphorylation does not impact hAgo2/GW182 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that one of the recruited proteins recruits CK1α. However, since we are able to observe Ago phosphorylation in the absence of additional proteins, they are not required for CKα-mediated phosphorylation. Importantly, because we did not observe phosphorylation until after target binding, and even then, can only detect initial phosphorylation of a single site, the in vitro system appears to recapitulate a regulated system having high specificity.</p><p>Because Ago must be dephosphorylated by PP6 before it can optimally repress additional targets, phosphorylation also has the potential to serve as a global regulatory measure. Knocking out PP6 in human cell lines led to a global decrease in RISC binding to mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). Under normal conditions, however, CK1α-mediated EI phosphorylation is rapidly countered by dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this, neither 5XA nor 5XE hAgo2 could rescue miRNA-mediated repression in Ago2<sup>-/-</sup> cells, indicating that the phosphorylation cycling process itself is important, not merely the presence or absence of phosphorylation.</p><p>Our findings that <italic>only</italic> S828 can be phosphorylated in our in vitro system without priming phosphorylation, and that this phosphorylation only occurs after binding to targets meeting certain criteria reveal novel structural and sequence determinants of highly specific CK1α-mediated phosphorylation. We therefore propose that target binding serves as a means for regulating CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of Ago, which, in turn, regulates RISC turnover and thus miRNA-mediated mRNA repression. The presence of multiple phosphorylation sites with decreasing target affinity may merely reflect the biophysical requirements for establishing sufficient negative charge to repel the target RNA. However, it might also provide a way for a cell to titrate the Ago/target affinity and/or to serve as a ‘checkpoint’ in order to ensure that targets aren’t spuriously released. Our work doesn’t address the temporal dynamics of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and repression. However, given the previous in vivo findings showing widespread regulatory defects with both hyper- and hypophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quévillon Huberdeau et al., 2017</xref>), we speculate that phosphorylation, or at least phosphorylation of enough sites to efficiently promote target release, happens after target repression is established. The requirement for multiple phosphorylations could help ensure that there is enough time for the initiation of repression to occur before the target is released. Direct tethering of GW182 family proteins to mRNA can bypass the need for RISC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zipprich et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that if enough Ago-independent interactions between repressive machinery and the mRNA are formed, Ago may even be able to be released while repression is ongoing.</p><p>This mechanism appears specialized for repression mediated by miRNA, as opposed to siRNA, as binding to fully complementary sites only triggers minimal phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and phosphomimicking does not impair slicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with the evolutionary conservation of the phosphosites among miRNA-specialized Ago proteins (e.g. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Ago1 [dmAgo1]) but not among siRNA-specialized Agos (e.g. dmAgo2), and our work provides a mechanistic explanation. With siRNA, slicing of the fully complementary target promotes its release by destabilizing the guide/target duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>), but partially-complementary miRNAs with high affinity, such as those with 3’ supplementary pairing, could get stuck on a target and phosphorylation could serve as a mechanism to promote their release in the absence of slicing. However, we found that extending 3’ pairing in the absence of central pairing also decreased EI phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Such targets can induce TDMD in vivo, which resolves the interaction through degradation of the RISC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2020</xref>), and therefore these targets would not need phosphorylation-promoted release to resolve RISC/target interactions.</p><p>Though we showed that hAgo1 and hAgo3 are also subject to target-binding-triggered CK1α-mediated phosphorylation in vitro similar to hAgo2<italic>,</italic> we did not investigate the functional impact of this phosphorylation; however, based on the high homology between the human Ago’s and their apparent redundancy in most instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2009</xref>), we would expect the effects of hAgo1 and hAgo3 phosphorylation to be similar to those we observed with hAgo2. Therefore, this regulatory mechanism is likely shared by these miRNA-handling Ago orthologs, suggesting a potentially broad impact on post-transcriptional regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings show that Ago EI phosphorylation is a post-target-binding regulatory mechanism that promotes target release, freeing guide-bound Ago, namely RISC, from the mRNA target and dissuading it from binding more targets until it gets dephosphorylated by PPP6C/ANKRD52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). This dephosphorylation was previously shown to be rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden et al., 2017</xref>), therefore the released Ago-guide complex is likely to quickly be able to seek out and repress additional targets. Although we did not investigate in vivo temporal dynamics, we suggest that phosphorylation occurs once repression has already been established and Ago’s presence is no longer required. As long as the cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is not disrupted, this would allow cells to strike a balance between the increased efficacy and specificity provided by stronger binding sites and the quest for efficiency, allowing a single miRISC to repress multiple mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This mechanism of promoting miRNA target release appears specialized for miRNA-mediated repression and the broad conservation of the phosphorylation sites suggests that its use is widespread among miRNA-handling Ago proteins.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation plays a regulatory role in silencing.</title><p>In order to repress a target mRNA, Ago binds to a small RNA guide to form the core RISC complex, which subsequently binds to target mRNAs containing sequence complementarity to the guide to effect repression. The core RISC complex (Ago/guide) is incredibly stable but would have to release target mRNA prior to repression of additional targets. We propose that this release is facilitated by CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic insertion (EI). We showed that phosphorylation is triggered by binding to targets that are not fully complementary, but that contain complementarity to the seed and 3’ supplementary pairing regions of the guide. Binding to such targets results in the complex adopting a productive conformation for EI phosphorylation. We suggest this may be due to orienting of the RNA backbone phosphates to serve as non-canonical priming phosphates. EI phosphorylation occurs hierarchically starting at S828 and the additive negative charges of the phosphates electrostatically repel the target RNA, leading to target release. The phosphorylated RISC has reduced affinity for further target binding. However, the system is quickly reset by dephosphorylation. This allows the RISC complex to bind to and repress additional sites, helping to explain how RISC can function efficiently and effectively in the context of excess target sites.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76908-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Recombinant hAgo2 was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elkayam et al., 2012</xref>), with the addition of a dephosphorylation step.

At each timepoint, free and protein-bound RNA were separated via slot blot, followed by autoradiography and quantification using GeneTools. Data were fit to a One-Phase Exponential Decay equation using GraphPad Prism and plotted ± SE. Reactions carried out in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Slicer assays</title><p>Slicer assays were carried out as previously described with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faehnle et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, reactions were performed in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10% glycerol. hAgo2 protein was loaded with at miR-200 at a 1:1 ratio and incubated for 30 min at at RT. 20 μL slicing reactions were initiated by mixing 5’ <sup>32</sup>P-labeled target RNA (2 nM final concentration) in the reaction buffer with 8 nM loaded hAgo2:miR200 complex. After 60 min, the reaction quenched in formamide loading buffer and incubated at 95°C for 5 min. The radiolabeled slicing products were separated using urea PAGE, visualized by phosphorimaging, and quantified with GeneTools.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>HDX-MS</title><p>HDX-MS was carried out by the HDX Core of the University of California, San Diego Biomolecular/Proteomics Mass Spectrometry Facility (UCSD BPMSF) (NIH shared instrumentation grant S10 OD016234). Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was performed using a Waters Synapt G2Si equipped with nanoACQUITY UPLC system with H/DX technology and a LEAP autosampler. Individual proteins were purified by size exclusion chromatography in 10 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol immediately prior to analysis. The final concentrations of proteins in each sample were 5 μM. For each deuteration time, 4 μL complex was equilibrated to 25°C for 5 min and then mixed with 56 μL D<sub>2</sub>O buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol in D<sub>2</sub>O) for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 min. The exchange was quenched with an equal volume of quench solution (3 M guanidine hydrochloride, pH 2.66).</p><p>The quenched sample (50 μL) was injected into the sample loop, followed by digestion on an in-line pepsin column (immobilized pepsin, Pierce, Inc) at 15°C. The resulting peptides were captured on a BEH C18 Vanguard pre-column, separated by analytical chromatography (Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 1.7 μM, 1.0 × 50 mm, Waters Corporation) using a 7–85% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid over 7.5 min, and electrosprayed into the Waters SYNAPT G2Si quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was set to collect data in the Mobility, ESI + mode; mass acquisition range of 200–2000 (m/z); scan time 0.4 s. Continuous lock mass correction was accomplished with infusion of leuenkephalin (m/z = 556.277) every 30 s (mass accuracy of 1 ppm for calibration standard). For peptide identification, the mass spectrometer was set to collect data in MS<sup>E</sup>, ESI + mode instead.</p><p>The peptides were identified from triplicate MS<sup>E</sup> analyses of 10 μM solution of protein in (10 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol), and data were analyzed using PLGS 3.0 (Waters Corporation). Peptide masses were identified using a minimum number of 250 ion counts for low energy peptides and 50 ion counts for their fragment ions. The peptides identified in PLGS were then analyzed in DynamX 3.0 (Waters Corporation) and, for displaying uptake, the deuterium uptake was corrected for back-exchange as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumpkin and Komives, 2019</xref>) using DECA Software,ver1.12 [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/komiveslab/DECA">https://github.com/komiveslab/DECA</ext-link>, copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:0b0e5b946973bd5ec839f4cbee951f32a1f0434b;origin=https://github.com/komiveslab/DECA;visit=swh:1:snp:ef2110304ae5882d9e9d99405f46f61a99c88b66;anchor=swh:1:rev:ec7a72e54aa1d025342fcdcb3f61840e08cd456f">swh:1:rev:ec7a72e54aa1d025342fcdcb3f61840e08cd456f</ext-link>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">komiveslab, 2020</xref>)].

Briefly, in the first stage, the mean deuterium uptake ± SEM for each peptide was subjected to a t-test (n = 3, p ≤ 0.05, two-sided, unpaired) and peptides that passed for at least three timepoints were taken to the second stage. In this stage, the summed differences for the peptides were subjected to a second t-test (n = 4, p ≤ 0.01, two-sided, unpaired) to test for overall uptake differences in the dynamic uptake curve.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Pablo A Manavella as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrea Ventura (Reviewer #2); Jeremy Dufourt (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see from the reviewer's comments we are all positive about your manuscript and the suggestions are, from my point of view, helpful and simple. I do believe you will be able to address all of them without problems. Still, if you consider that some of them are not feasible in a reasonable amount of time or that are unlikely to yield a meaningful outcome don't hesitate to point it.</p><p>You will also find some requests for in vivo experiments. We discussed this point with the reviewers and even when we agreed that these experiments would be a great addition to the paper we are conscious that it may demand way too much time and effort. If you feel that you can contribute with some experiments in this direction we encourage you to add them but those experiments are not essential for the paper acceptance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The results in figure 2 are quite interesting. Overall, you suggest that EI phosphorylation favour charge repulsion to release the miRNA/target association; however, this is especially true for some pairing degree with neither an extensive pairing nor a low pairing being the ideal. Can you discuss this better? Why do you think miRNA/target resolution depend on EI phosphorylation in some case more than others? Wouldn't all the cases need a negative charge to release the interaction? How do you think extensive pairing is resolved?</p><p>Figure 5, what happens if you only mutate S828 to Alanine, leaving the rest open? Can you prevent EI phosphorylation in vitro, and ideally in vivo, by mutating only S828? Even when it may be a little bit hard to test, it would be interesting to see whether S828 priming occurs in vivo.</p><p>Would it be possible to reanalyze data from ref 41 and see whether there is a bias toward the extent of miRNA/target pairing? Based on your hypothesis and discussion, one could expect more targets with 3' supplemental pairing in non-phosphorylated AGO2 mutants than in WT? If the reasoning of your discussion paragraph starting at Line 389 is correct, the in vivo results in this mutant should mimic better the in vitro data showing an increased affinity for more extensive pairing.</p><p>The main open question here is the in vivo dynamics. When does the EI phosphorylation initiate and when the miRNA/target association is resolved? one would expect this is not immediate as the main RISC function is to suppress gene translation. Thus, quick phosphorylation and resolution wouldn't be ideal. Studying this aspect is beyond the scope of this paper and will need extensive analysis, but it would be nice if you discuss this point further.</p><p>Out of personal curiosity, do you know how is EI Serine conservation in plant' AGOs (AGO1)? miRNA/target pairing is extensive in plants, so I would expect that this mechanism is not conserved? There is no need to discuss this on the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a few suggestions for the authors:</p><p>a) The use of purified components in an in vitro system is certainly a strength of this work, but it is also a limitation, since in vivo additional factors are known to interact with Argonaute (GW182 proteins as well as other effectors) and these interactions could significantly affect Ago phosphorylation. It would be perhaps useful to confirm the hyerarchical phosphorylation of Ago protein in a cell based experiment, for example by measuring phosphorylation of ectopically expressed Ago2 harboring various combinations of mutations in the 5 phosphorylation sites. The model predicts that the S828A and, to lesser extent, the S831A mutant should be resistant to phosphorylation, while mutants in the other three sites should still be at least partially phosphorylated.</p><p>b) In the introduction (line 136), the authors mention ChIP-seq as the method used By Golden and colleagues to show reduced coverage of individual targets in the absence of phosphorylation. I think in the Golden paper the method used was eCLIP, not ChIP-seq.</p><p>c) While this manuscript conclusively shows that S828 is the first residue to be phosphorylated by CK1 in a hierarchical fashion using full length Ago, a key role for S828 and S831 had been already suggested by Golden and colleagues using in vitro phosphorylation of various peptides corresponding to the EI region of Ago2 (Figure 4g). In fact, Golden et al., wrote: &quot;Unphosphorylated peptide was a poor substrate for CSNK1A1 under these conditions, suggesting that initial phosphorylation of this region is facilitated by contextual features present in full-length AGO2. pS824 only weakly stimulated further phosphorylation. Prior phosphorylation of S828, however, robustly promoted phosphorylation of S831 (but not T830), while pS831 efficiently primed phosphorylation of S834. Taken together with our earlier data demonstrating a critical role for S828 in phosphorylation of AGO2 in cells (Figure 2e), these findings support a model whereby initial phosphorylation of S828, and potentially S824, stimulates efficient hierarchical phosphorylation of S831 followed by S834, rendering AGO2 incompetent for target binding until returned to an active state by ANKRD52-PPP6C phosphatase activity.&quot; It would be important to mention this in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 165 Please explain why you choose miR-200b</p><p>Figure 1c why mutating all residue at the same time and not testing simple mutation and combination? this experiment is done in figure 5 and could maybe be positioned in figure 1.</p><p>Is hAgo2 plus guide phosphorylation in the expected background or it could reflect a first low round of phosphorylation? Maybe by doing the same experiments with Ago1 to 3 the authors could see if just hAgo with miRNA are phosphorylated even if its low?</p><p>In Figure 2 is it possible to quantify remaining not bound mRNA to reinforce the idea that 14nt are the shortest length to establish base pairing?</p><p>The HDX-MS experiments show an important point: the target do not protect the EI site which was the simplest explanation. The results are also really interesting as it is suspected that free Argonaute are unstable but it’s one beautiful demonstration I saw in this direction.</p><p>Is it possible to test if phosphorylated hAgo2 loaded and with its target have a mRNA release decrease during a time course in presence of PP6, this would be demonstrated that when the phosphatase remove phosphorylation we observed a decreased of Koff.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76908.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The results in figure 2 are quite interesting.

As we show in the figure, different targets promote phosphorylation to different extents. This would confound target release rate measurements, and therefore we were unable to compare the relative contributions of phosphorylation to target release between targets. However, because phosphorylation must occur to have any effect, targets that fail to induce robust phosphorylation would be expected to rely less on phosphorylation to aid in miRNA/target resolution and more on alternative mechanisms. Consistent with this, targets that failed to induce such phosphorylation either have less need for affinity-lowering (this is the case for seed-only targets, which have a lower affinity to begin with) or have alternative mechanisms to promote target release. In the latter category, targets with full complementarity can be sliced by hAgo2, which has been shown to enhance target release<sup>1</sup>. Targets with extensive 3’ pairing, but bulged central regions, can induce TDMD in vivo, which resolves the interaction through degradation of the RISC complex. We have added further discussion of this in the Discussion section (p 13, line 538-541).</p><p>“However, we found that extending 3’ pairing in the absence of central pairing also decreased EI phosphorylation (Figure 2b). Such targets can induce TDMD in vivo, which resolves the interaction through degradation of the RISC complex<sup>63,64</sup>, and therefore these targets would not need phosphorylation-promoted release to resolve RISC/target interactions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5, what happens if you only mutate S828 to Alanine, leaving the rest open? Can you prevent EI phosphorylation in vitro, and ideally in vivo, by mutating only S828?

We have added a figure showing this (Figure 5d). Although the in vivo experiments suggested are outside the scope of the current study, results from Golden et al., and Huberdeau et al., are consistent with S828 priming in vivo and we have added the following language to the Discussion section (p 12, line 476-487).</p><p>“This was further supported by their finding that S828A mutation, but not a single A mutation at any of the other phosphorylatable residues in the EI, eliminated detectable phosphorylation of hAgo2 in HCT116 cells lacking expression of ANKRD52, a regulatory subunit of PP6<sup>2</sup>. The central importance of S828 is also reflected in functional data from in vivo experiments. Huberdeau et al., found that mutating the corresponding serine in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hAgo2 homolog ALG-1 (S992) to alanine led to severe developmental defects similar to those seen when mutating all EI phosphorylation sites to alanine<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, Golden et. al reported that expression of hAgo2(S828A), but not wt hAgo2, was able to rescue repression of a miR-19 EGFP reporter in ANKRD52-deficient cells. Phosphorylation of S828 thus appears to serve as a key gatekeeper regulating further phosphorylation and its consequent functional effects, implying its regulation would be critical. We now show that this gatekeeper is directly regulated by target binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would it be possible to reanalyze data from ref 41 and see whether there is a bias toward the extent of miRNA/target pairing? Based on your hypothesis and discussion, one could expect more targets with 3' supplemental pairing in non-phosphorylated AGO2 mutants than in WT? If the reasoning of your discussion paragraph starting at Line 389 is correct, the in vivo results in this mutant should mimic better the in vitro data showing an increased affinity for more extensive pairing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We looked into the possibility of doing this analysis. Unfortunately, the processed eCLIP data in Golden et al., only yields target peaks (corresponding to hundreds or thousands of nucleotides) rather than precise miRNA binding sites. In that way, the eCLIP data are useful for comparisons at the mRNA level but not for miRNA/site-specific analyses. The eCLIP peaks typically encompass multiple predicted miRNA-binding sites, any of which could be bound. Additionally, the dataset lacks the identity of the corresponding bound miRNAs. We need this information for the requested analyses because members of the same miRNA family can differ in their extent of supplemental pairing. In order to directly compare wt- and 5XA-bound targets at the site level we would need miRNA/target site-specific data, such as CLEAR-CLIP results linking the Ago-bound miRNA to the target site to which it is bound (Moore et al., 2015)<sup>4</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main open question here is the in vivo dynamics.

Studying this aspect is beyond the scope of this paper and will need extensive analysis, but it would be nice if you discuss this point further.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and have added further discussion of this in the Discussion section to clarify our thinking. Additionally, we have now performed additional experiments showing that GW182 binding does not impact Ago phosphorylation, supporting our model that phosphorylation occurs after repression is established. These are described below in response to reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Out of personal curiosity, do you know how is EI Serine conservation in plant' AGOs (AGO1)? miRNA/target pairing is extensive in plants, so I would expect that this mechanism is not conserved? There is no need to discuss this on the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their interest. Serine-rich EI’s are conserved in plant Ago’s. However, the sequences and lengths of the EI vary. Interestingly, it was recently discovered that the EI’s of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Ago proteins MAGO1 and MAGO2 are subject to phosphorylation in vivo, and are hypophosphorylated upon heat stress (Lee et al., 2021). We do not know at this juncture what the role is for EI phosphorylation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Although the responsible kinase was not identified in that study, another putative <italic>Arabadopsis</italic> CK1 target, the transcription factor DREB2A, gets stabilized upon heat stress due to decreased phosphorylation.</p><p>Phosphorylation normally occurs on DREB2A, leading to DREB2A degradation. But heat stress inhibits the phosphorylation, allowing DREB2A to accumulate and regulate stress response genes (Mizoi et al., 2019). Perhaps CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of hAgo could be reduced upon various stresses. However, this is only speculative. So far, although EI phosphorylation has been found to occur in a variety of organisms, the responsible kinase has only been identified in humans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a few suggestions for the authors:</p><p>a) The use of purified components in an in vitro system is certainly a strength of this work, but it is also a limitation, since in vivo additional factors are known to interact with Argonaute (GW182 proteins as well as other effectors) and these interactions could significantly affect Ago phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that it is important to keep in mind the effects additional factors, such as GW182, might have on Ago phosphorylation. Previous studies have found that EI phosphorylation does not impact hAgo2/GW182 interaction<sup>2,3</sup>. However, it remains a possibility that GW182 (or other recruited factors) could influence phosphorylation. Because GW182 plays a pivotal role in establishing target mRNA repression, binding directly to Ago and recruiting additional downstream effectors, we investigated the potential impact of GW182 binding on hAgo2 phosphorylation. We measured hAgo2 phosphorylation in the presence and absence of the GW182 Ago Binding Domain (GW ABD) (residues 455-860 of human TNRC6A)<sup>5</sup> and found that GW ABD binding had no qualitatively detectable impact on endpoint phosphorylation of hAgo2 by CK1α. These results are compatible with our model that phosphorylation likely occurs after repression is established, thereby allowing effective repression without sequestering Ago longer than necessary. For these experiments, we had to use qualitative SDS-PAGE analysis of phosphorylation products instead of our quantitative scintillation counting method used in the experiments reported in our manuscript because we discovered that CK1α phosphorylates the GW ABD as well, confounding the measurement of total phosphorylation. Interestingly, although Ago phosphorylation was not impacted by GW ABD, GW ABD phosphorylation was greatly enhanced by the presence of hAgo2 (both wt and 5XA). As the GW ABD can bind up to 3 Ago molecules<sup>5</sup>, we suspect that, in these assays, hAgo2 is localizing CK1α to GW182, leading to its phosphorylation. However, we do not know where on GW this phosphorylation is occurring, what effects it might have on GW function, or whether it is physiologically relevant. Because of the issue of quantification, and since proper investigation of these questions requires further experiments that are outside the scope of the current paper, we have chosen not to include these preliminary results in the manuscript. However, we are providing them here to show that the immediate downstream factor associating with Ago does not interfere with Ago’s phosphorylation by CK1α, supporting the theory that Ago phosphorylation can occur after repression is established.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be perhaps useful to confirm the hyerarchical phosphorylation of Ago protein in a cell based experiment, for example by measuring phosphorylation of ectopically expressed Ago2 harboring various combinations of mutations in the 5 phosphorylation sites. The model predicts that the S828A and, to lesser extent, the S831A mutant should be resistant to phosphorylation, while mutants in the other three sites should still be at least partially phosphorylated.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern was also raised by reviewer #1. We now address this issue and added a new figure 5d. Please see our response to reviewer #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the introduction (line 136), the authors mention ChIP-seq as the method used By Golden and colleagues to show reduced coverage of individual targets in the absence of phosphorylation. I think in the Golden paper the method used was eCLIP, not ChIP-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this typo! We were indeed referring to eCLIP experiments and we have corrected the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) While this manuscript conclusively shows that S828 is the first residue to be phosphorylated by CK1 in a hierarchical fashion using full length Ago, a key role for S828 and S831 had been already suggested by Golden and colleagues using in vitro phosphorylation of various peptides corresponding to the EI region of Ago2 (Figure 4g). In fact, Golden et al., wrote: &quot;Unphosphorylated peptide was a poor substrate for CSNK1A1 under these conditions, suggesting that initial phosphorylation of this region is facilitated by contextual features present in full-length AGO2. pS824 only weakly stimulated further phosphorylation. Prior phosphorylation of S828, however, robustly promoted phosphorylation of S831 (but not T830), while pS831 efficiently primed phosphorylation of S834. Taken together with our earlier data demonstrating a critical role for S828 in phosphorylation of AGO2 in cells (Figure 2e), these findings support a model whereby initial phosphorylation of S828, and potentially S824, stimulates efficient hierarchical phosphorylation of S831 followed by S834, rendering AGO2 incompetent for target binding until returned to an active state by ANKRD52-PPP6C phosphatase activity.&quot; It would be important to mention this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a good point and in order to underscore the previous findings and clarify the added findings in this work, we have now added the following paragraphs in the Discussion section contextualizing our findings (p. 12, lines 461-487):</p><p>“The need for target-binding could explain findings from previously reported in-vitro phosphorylation assays testing CK1α’s ability to phosphorylated peptide substrates spanning hAgo2’s EI region<sup>2</sup>. Golden et al., reported that unphosphorylated EI peptide could not be phosphorylated by recombinant CK1α, leading them to propose that contextual features in the full-length hAgo2 were required in order to make S828 a suitable CK1α substrate. Our work shows that it is not only full-length hAgo2 that is required, but rather hAgo2 bound to a guide and a target RNA with seed and supplemental region pairing.</p><p>All the in vitro phosphorylation experiments that have been reported point to a central importance of S828. Our finding that S828 phosphorylation is required for subsequent hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α in full-length hAgo2 (Figure 5) is consistent with previous experiments using phosphorylated peptide substrates<sup>2</sup>. Golden et al., showed that peptides phosphorylated at S828 were able to be phosphorylated at S831 and those phosphorylated at S831 were able to be phosphorylated at S834. They suggested that pS828 primes for hierarchical phosphorylation of the EI at S831 and S834, consistent with our experiments with full-length hAgo2. This was further supported by their finding that S828A mutation, but not a single A mutation at any of the other phosphorylatable residues in the EI, eliminated detectable phosphorylation of hAgo2 in HCT116 cells lacking expression of ANKRD52, a regulatory subunit of PP6<sup>2</sup>. The central importance of S828 is also reflected in functional data from in vivo experiments. Huberdeau et al. found that mutating the corresponding serine in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hAgo2 homolog ALG-1 (S992) to alanine led to severe developmental defects similar to those seen when mutating all EI phosphorylation sites to alanine<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, Golden et al., reported that expression of hAgo2(S828A), but not wt hAgo2, was able to rescue repression of a miR-19 EGFP reporter in ANKRD52-deficient cells. Phosphorylation of S828 thus appears to serve as a key gatekeeper regulating further phosphorylation and its consequent functional effects, implying its regulation would be critical. We now show that this gatekeeper is directly regulated by target-binding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 165 Please explain why you choose miR-200b</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following (p. 5, lines 170-174):</p><p>“This guide/target combination was chosen because the target’s genomic location was identified as bound to 5XA but not wild-type hAgo2 in previous eCLIP experiments<sup>2</sup>, suggesting it was sensitive to EI phosphorylation in vivo. It was also chosen because of its functional relevance in helping regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transitions<sup>6</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1c why mutating all residue at the same time and not testing simple mutation and combination? this experiment is done in figure 5 and could maybe be positioned in figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the logic behind this suggestion, however, the aim of Figure 1c is to show that target binding triggers CK1α-mediated phosphorylation and that this phosphorylation is occurring in the eukaryotic insertion, hence the use of the 5XA mutant in this situation. As we do not discuss the precise locations of the phosphorylations until later in the paper, we have left the experiments showing the effects of single A mutations and combinations in Figure 5. We have also added a figure showing the effects of each single A mutation (Figure 5d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is hAgo2 plus guide phosphorylation in the expected background or it could reflect a first low round of phosphorylation? Maybe by doing the same experiments with Ago1 to 3 the authors could see if just hAgo with miRNA are phosphorylated even if its low?</p></disp-quote><p>The levels of phosphorylation in guide-bound Ago1/2/3 are within the expected background accounting for artifacts of the experimental system (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). These experiments are performed to measure endpoint or near-endpoint phosphorylation, after 90 minutes, so multiple rounds of phosphorylation are possible. However, the phosphorylation with guide-bound alone does not exceed the expected background even with the long incubation time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 is it possible to quantify remaining not bound mRNA to reinforce the idea that 14nt are the shortest length to establish base pairing?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t believe one needs 14-nt of target to establish base-pairing per se. As we show in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1, the affinity for a target of 13-nt in length is very similar to that of 14-nt long. However, the differences in the amounts of phosphorylation triggered by these targets are striking. Therefore, the requirements for phosphorylation shown in Figure 2 go beyond simple base pairing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The HDX-MS experiments show an important point: the target do not protect the EI site which was the simplest explanation. The results are also really interesting as it is suspected that free Argonaute are unstable but it’s one beautiful demonstration I saw in this direction.</p><p>Is it possible to test if phosphorylated hAgo2 loaded and with its target have a mRNA release decrease during a time course in presence of PP6, this would be demonstrated that when the phosphatase remove phosphorylation we observed a decreased of Koff.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The proposed experiments would be difficult to interpret conclusively, unfortunately, because the timescales of dephosphorylation and target release would be confounding one another. Furthermore, in vivo, PP6 functions as a heterotrimer and although 2 of the subunits were identified in Golden et al.,’s CRISPR screen (ANKRD52 and PPP6C), the identity or identities of the third subunit involved remain unknown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
