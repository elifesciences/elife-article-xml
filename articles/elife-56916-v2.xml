animal model. We implemented a mouse model recapitulating more closely the human pathology as it is characterized by both an autoimmune heterogeneity and the presence of cortical lesions, two parameters missing in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In our model, mice clustered in two groups displaying high or low clinical scores. Upon cortical cytokine injection, lesions appeared with a specific topography while cortical miRNA profiles were altered. These two features differed according to disease severity. We evidenced changes in miRNA regulators and targets suggesting that miRNA alteration had functional repercussions that could explain the differences in cortical lesions.

It is proposed to be the consequence of an interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (e.g. low vitamin D levels, smoking, Epstein-Barr virus infection). MS is a complex and heterogeneous disease presenting various degrees of inflammation, gliosis, and neurodegeneration leading to differences in clinical manifestations and severity between patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paz Soldan and Rodriguez, 2002</xref>). For decades, the focus in MS was on white matter lesions, however, progress in imaging put forth the relevance of lesions in the gray matter, particularly in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filippi and Rocca, 2019</xref>). It is now established that these cortical lesions (CLs) represent a hallmark of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucchinetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Filippi et al., 2010</xref>). CLs were suggested to be predictors of long-term severity in MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filippi and Rocca, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Filippi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Treaba et al., 2019</xref>). Actually, the presence of CLs in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome is suggested as a confirmation for MS diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Filippi et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the assessment of CLs has been added to the diagnostic criteria of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite their importance, the factors and the pathological mechanisms that determine the presence and the localization of CLs remain elusive. This is in part due to the challenges of obtaining an appropriate animal model to study these phenomena. However, it has been suggested that meningeal inflammation and immune cell infiltration, characterized by the presence of T-cell infiltrates, B-cells, and macrophages play a role in the development of CLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Treaba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howell et al., 2011</xref>). Besides inflammation, oxidative stress leading to DNA damage, and degeneration of oligodendrocytes and neurons, could also be implicated in CL formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the direct involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in MS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Junker et al., 2011</xref>), as well as in the pathogenesis of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model has been put forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thamilarasan et al., 2012</xref>). miRNAs are small non-coding RNA that mediate the repression of messenger RNA translation and thereby refine protein expression levels. It is estimated that up to 60% of protein-coding genes are regulated by miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). Several studies support miRNAs as having a central role in inflammation and adaptive immunity, emphasizing the need to understand their variation and potential implication in MS, as this could improve our understanding of MS pathogenesis. Dysregulation of the miRNA profile was reported in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keller et al., 2014</xref>), in active and inactive lesions, and in normal-appearing white matter in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junker et al., 2009</xref>). However, miRNA analysis in a mouse model that features CLs is still needed to improve our understanding of their potential role. Indeed, this would provide a tool to study miRNA expression at the early stage of CL formation which is not feasible in human patients or in the other models of MS.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was twofold. First, we wanted to set up and characterize an EAE mouse model recapitulating more closely the key aspects of MS, specifically the heterogeneity of the immune response and the presence of CLs. Secondly, we analyzed the miRNome in this modified model of MS to identify interesting candidate miRNAs that could potentially be involved in the phenotype observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EAE mouse model with both a heterogeneous immune response and cortical lesions</title><p>One of the classical mouse models of MS is the EAE model that is typically induced by subcutaneous administration of myelin-derived peptides (such as MOG<sub>35-55</sub> when working with C57BL/6JRj mice) in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) followed by intraperitoneal administration of pertussis toxin (PTX). PTX administration is commonly used as it leads to a more homogeneous immune response. However, MS is a heterogeneous disease. Thus, in order to obtain in mice a more heterogeneous autoimmune response and to assess the impact of PTX injection in the same setting, we induced EAE in mice using MOG<sub>35-55</sub> in CFA with or without PTX administration. As might be expected, mice that received the PTX declared the disease earlier than mice that did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using a standard five-point EAE grading scale, we could separate the EAE mice that did not receive PTX into two distinct cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): mice with a high clinical score (HIS; 53% of the immunized mice) and mice with a low clinical score (LIS; 47%). Importantly, there was no difference in disease onset between the HIS and LIS groups. EAE in mice typically presents with ascending paralysis consistent with spinal cord lesions. Accordingly, we could observe decreased fluoromyelin staining in the spinal cord of EAE mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found less lesions in the LIS group compared to the HIS group, and that the latter could not be distinguished from the PTX group. Indeed, the decrease in fluoromyelin staining was more marked in the HIS group compared to the LIS group, consistent with the higher clinical score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To assess reproducibility and strengthen our findings, the same immunization protocol without PTX was conducted on a second independent set of mice (different suppliers and laboratories). Here again, we observed two distinct phenotypes, that is HIS and LIS, with a similar distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This was accompanied by decreased Luxol Fast Blue-Cresyl Violet (LFB-CV) staining in the spinal cord of both HIS and LIS mice of this second cohort. This decrease was more marked in the HIS group compared to the LIS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical and immunohistological characterization of the EAE model with high and low clinical scores.</title><p>To induce EAE, mice received MOG<sub>35-55</sub> and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) with or without pertussis toxin (PTX).

CD3 immunostaining in all the mice that received the immunizing peptide was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). We then measured the area of the spinal cord occupied by Iba-1 (a marker of microglia, macrophages, and monocytes) and GFAP (a marker of astrocytes) positive cells. We found, both in the white and grey matters, larger Iba-1-occupied and GFAP-positive areas in the HIS group compared to the LIS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Next, we measured the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines as well as of the Treg transcription factor FoxP3 (<italic>Foxp3</italic>) and the Th17 transcription factor RORγ (<italic>Rorc</italic>) in the spinal cord. Immunization resulted in an increased mRNA expression of cytokines, chemokines, and <italic>Foxp3</italic> and a decreased expression of <italic>Rorc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). There were no differences between the HIS and LIS groups, except for <italic>Foxp3</italic> which was more expressed in the LIS group compared to the HIS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As the difference in disease development could also be explained by differences in blood cytokine levels, we measured at 7, 14 and 21 days post-immunization the levels of key inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g. IL-17A, IFNγ, G-CSF, …) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Circulating cytokine levels were similar in the HIS and LIS groups, except for IL-12p40 at day 14 and MIP-1α at day 21. Finally, we thought to assess whether differences between the HIS and LIS groups could also be evidenced in the cortex as it is the localization of the CLs found in MS patients. Therefore, we measured the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines and found increased mRNA expression of <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> in the immunized groups compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This was also the case for mRNA of the lymphocyte marker <italic>Cd3g</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When looking at the expression of neurotrophic factors, we found decreased expression of <italic>Bdnf</italic> in the immunized groups compared to the control group with no difference between HIS and LIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>Gdnf</italic> expression on the other hand was increased only in the groups that did not receive PTX with higher expression in the HIS group compared to the LIS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of inflammatory marker and growth factor expression in the EAE model with high and low clinical scores.</title><p>To induce EAE, mice received MOG<sub>35-55</sub> and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) with pertussis toxin (PTX) or without PTX (HIS and LIS groups).

Indeed, miRNAs are important players in the control of inflammation and immune responses and their characterization has not been carried out in a model displaying CLs. Thus, we performed a high-throughput miRNA expression profile using TaqMan microfluidic cards on the micro-dissected cortical region surrounding the injection site and the corresponding contralateral structure of HIS-C and LIS-C mice. We found 202 miRNAs expressed in the ipsilateral and 197 miRNAs in the contralateral side of HIS-C mice, 197 miRNAs in the ipsilateral, and 179 miRNAs in the contralateral of LIS-C mice, and 167 miRNAs expressed in control mice (i.e. PBS-injected non EAE mice, CTL).

Analysis of the ipsilateral injected structure of HIS-C versus CTL showed 161 miRNAs were expressed in both groups and among them, 139 were upregulated, and none were downregulated. For the corresponding contralateral cortical structure of HIS-C, 161 miRNAs were expressed in both HIS-C and CTL of which 138 were upregulated and two were downregulated.

For the corresponding contralateral cortical structure of LIS-C, 157 miRNAs were expressed in both LIS-C and CTL of which 115 were upregulated and two were downregulated. These data suggest that, in the cortical region surrounding the injection site, EAE induces miRNA expression compared to the control group as more miRNAs were expressed in the HIS-C and LIS-C groups compared to CTL, and many of the miRNAs expressed in all groups were up-regulated compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>As we were interested in the difference between HIS-C and LIS-C groups, we compared the miRNA profiles between the ipsilateral cortical region surrounding the injection site of HIS-C and LIS-C mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We found 192 miRNAs expressed, 20 of which were more expressed in HIS-C, and eight were less expressed. miRNAs altered in HIS-C compared to LIS-C are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.

Over the years, using new MRI sequences, cortical lesions were frequently found and are now identified as a hallmark of the pathology and are associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kutzelnigg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gh Popescu and Lucchinetti, 2012</xref>).

In our study, we wanted to set up in mouse a model able to recapitulate two key aspects of MS pathogenesis: the immune response heterogeneity and the presence of CLs. Indeed, such a model would allow us to study and mechanistically address these events at early stages of the disease. The first aspect was achieved by omitting the usual PTX administration in the classical EAE mouse model. Indeed, MS is a disease characterized by a wide heterogeneity in its clinical symptoms and its course. Our model can mimic this MS hallmark as we found in several independent studies (mice, laboratories, researchers) that the clinical score of the mice was no longer leveled out but could be stratified in two groups of similar size. This heterogeneity might seem surprising for inbred mice. However, inter-individual phenotypic variability has been reported for inbred mice in several models.

In a model of social defeat, C57Bl/6 mice can be clustered into susceptible and unsusceptible groups based on their behavior following chronic social defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>). In models of diet-induced obesity, C57BL/6 mice can be clustered in low and high weight-gainers as well as based on their insulin resistance phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>). However, in most experimental paradigms, the reasons for these differences remain to be fully explored, even if epigenetic mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the observed variations. Actually, epigenetics could also explain differences in disease susceptibility between monozygotic twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fraga et al., 2005</xref>). Although the prevalence of MS is higher in monozygotic twins compared to the general population, both twins do not necessarily develop MS. This observation highlights both the role of genetic susceptibility in MS pathogenesis and the importance of environmental factors and epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vakhitov et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications as well as miRNAs have been proposed to be involved in MS pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vakhitov et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A second key aspect of MS is the presence of CLs which is not reported in the classical EAE model. We were able to induce this key feature in our EAE mouse model, similar to what was reported in an EAE model in common marmoset and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stassart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Üçal et al., 2017</xref>). We induced CLs by the stereotactic injection of TNFα and IFNɣ in the mouse cortex. This additional inflammatory insult, added to the MOG<sub>35-55</sub> immunization, led to the formation of CLs that was not found in PBS-injected animals. The decrease in fluoromyelin, LFB, and MBP cortical staining was dependent on the clinical score of the mice as it was different in HIS-C and LIS-C mice but did not differ between HIS mice injected at the peak of disease (d21) or during its chronic phase (d35). We found CLs to be intracortical and to a lower extent subpial hence sharing close similarities to CLs observed in patients suffering from MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lassmann, 2018</xref>). In a model using rats immunized with rMOG and cortically injected with cytokines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merkler et al., 2006</xref> also observed CLs but they did not report any heterogeneity of the autoimmune response as evidenced by the levels of circulating anti-MOG IgG titers. In our study, we were able to repeat this finding in mice and we also showed that some CLs were quite distant from the injection site such as those we observed in the motor cortex. In an interesting experiment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rüther et al., 2017</xref> combined both EAE and cuprizone models in mice and observed CLs characterized by microglia activation and monocyte recruitment. However, in this dual model, there is no heterogeneity reported in the autoimmune response.</p><p>As previously stated, the processes underlying cortical demyelination in MS remain to be determined. In our model, we evidenced the presence of CLs and we started to characterize them in the HIS-C and LIS-C groups. It would be interesting to characterize these CLs further in terms of myelin and axonal losses (e.g. using electron microscopy) or regarding the specific type of immune cells recruited (T-cell subtypes, monocytes/macrophages, …). A follow-up study should address these interesting aspects.</p><p>Most of the markers we measured in the brain before cytokine injection were increased in all the immunized groups. An exception was <italic>Bdnf</italic> that was decreased by 20%. When comparing the HIS and LIS groups, we found a significantly higher expression of the chemokine <italic>Cxcl10</italic> and the lymphocyte marker <italic>Cd3g</italic> in the HIS group. The comparison of the expression level in the cortex of mice that did not receive the cytokines and those injected with cytokines points to an upregulation of the expression of several key markers in the context of MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For instance, the injection of cytokines resulted in increased cortical expression of <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> in both LIS and HIS groups. miRNAs and their effects are attracting attention as they represent important repressors of RNA translation and are now also considered as biomarkers and as potential therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Irizar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perdaens et al., 2020</xref>). The dysregulation of miRNA profile is studied in the context of MS pathology, although mostly in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thamilarasan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Irizar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jagot and Davoust, 2016</xref>). A limited number of studies have profiled miRNA expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of deceased MS patients revealing that miRNAs are altered in MS lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noorbakhsh et al., 2011</xref>). In these conditions, it is not possible to link the dysregulation of miRNA expression and early events in the formation of CLs. Thus, to further support the interest of our model, we wondered if the different clinical scores and CLs would result in differential changes in miRNA expression. Our results clearly show this is the case as the miRNome is strongly affected by the injection of cytokines, and several miRNAs are differently altered depending on the HIS or LIS group. We also focused on some miRNAs of particular interest in the disease. Among those, miR-155 is a major regulator of inflammation. The altered <italic>Mir155</italic> profile observed in our modified EAE model, along with prominent astrogliosis, might reflect the presence of an active lesion state in the LIS-C group. Interestingly, Junker et al found increased <italic>Mir155</italic> expression in astrocytes from active lesions of MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junker et al., 2009</xref>). Besides, the administration of miR-155 antagomir reduced the disease severity when administered in the classic EAE mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murugaiyan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another miRNA found dysregulated in many inflammatory conditions is miR-223 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haneklaus et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we found <italic>Mir223</italic> to be consistently more expressed in mice from the HIS-C group compared to mice from the LIS-C group for both the ipsi- and contralateral cortical areas. We also found a lower expression of <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, one of miR-223 direct targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2019</xref>), in the HIS group. This glia-enriched miRNA has been studied in an EAE model, and <italic>Mir223</italic> KO mice were found to develop less severe hallmarks of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jovičić et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantoni et al., 2017</xref>). The authors also observed alterations of the immune system that could explain the partial protection against the EAE phenotype. Indeed, they found an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cell number in the CNS along with a decrease in T-cell proliferation and associated neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantoni et al., 2017</xref>). This detrimental role exerted by miR-223 in the context of EAE could participate in the different cortical lesions observed between HIS-C and LIS-C mice.</p><p>We also found <italic>Mirlet7c</italic> levels to be decreased in HIS-C compared to LIS-C mice in the ipsilateral cortical side. This miRNA is known to be involved in neuroinflammatory processes as it both decreases microglia activation and exerts neuroprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lv et al., 2018</xref>). As the decreased expression was restricted to the ipsilateral side (increased in the contralateral side), differential regulation of <italic>Mirlet7c</italic> could participate in the difference in CL pattern between HIS and LIS groups. Finally, the effects and possible involvement of miR-410 described as being enriched in neurons compared to the other CNS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jovičić et al., 2013</xref>), in the observed phenotype remain less clear as it was studied in the CNS only with respect to its behavioral functions and in tandem with miR-379 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marty et al., 2016</xref>). However, in the context of another autoimmune disorder where T-cells also represent a key effector, namely systemic lupus erythematosus, miR-410 levels were decreased in patients’ T-cells compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the authors showed that the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) is a target of miR-410. This finding is quite interesting in the context of EAE as inhibiting the STAT-3 pathway, which is central in T-cell differentiation, has proven to be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we established a new model of EAE in mice that is closer to human pathology as it recapitulates the usual hallmarks of EAE with the addition of heterogeneity in the immune response (HIS and LIS groups) as well as the presence of CLs. We also showed that intracortical cytokine injections in mice with different immune responses and clinical scores results in different alteration of the miRNome. While the direct link between these differences in miRNA expression and CLs formation remains to be established, we put forth the heterogeneity in the response to immunization and the formation of CL as key features of our model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

that was able to recapitulate more closely pathophysiological manifestations encountered in MS, namely a heterogeneity of the immune response and the presence of CLs. Two features absent from the standard EAE model. Secondly, we wanted to create an experimental tool allowing for the study of miRNAs with regards to their potential implication in the formation, extent, and topography of CLs as previous studies in humans put forth a dysregulated miRNA expression in CLs. The study included a series of controlled laboratory experiments carried out in C57BL/6 mice. Several experiments were conducted using a modified version of the EAE model. EAE was induced by immunization with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> with or without PTX injection. Additionally, in other sets of experiments mice received either vehicle or a mixture of TNFα and INF-γ through stereotactic injection in the somatosensory cortex. A power analysis was used to assess the sample size necessary for the experiments. We took into consideration the known variability of the standard EAE mouse model and the variability expected for the intracortical cytokine injection. Data collection was stopped when an animal reached a predetermined clinical score (see infra) in strict accordance with the European recommendation regarding experimental procedures and the local ethics committee. The data for these mice were excluded from the analysis. Statistical outliers were defined using extreme studentized deviate also known as Grubbs' test. The investigators were not blinded while collecting and analyzing the data except for all the histological analyses that were performed by blinded researchers. The experimental endpoints were determined before the start of said experiment. At the beginning of experiments, mice were weighed and randomly allocated in experimental groups of similar weight. Additional details are provided below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>EAE induction and clinical score</title><p>EAE was induced by immunization with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> emulsified with CFA using the Hooke Kit (Hooke labs, EK-2110, Lawrence, USA) in 8–10 week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River and Janvier Labs). The emulsion was administered subcutaneously on the upper back, middle back, and lower back (0.1 mL/site). To compare this model to the classical EAE model, in one study, a group of mice received injections of pertussis toxin (PTX, 80 ng/mice) 1 and 2 days post-immunization while pertussis toxin was omitted in the remaining mice of the study. Mice were weighed and scored daily for clinical signs of the disease by a blinded and trained researcher. The scoring was based on the protocol from Hooke laboratories. <italic>Score 0</italic>: No sign of the disease, the tail is erect when picked up at the base, locomotor activity is intact compared to non-immunized mice. <italic>Score 0.5</italic>: when held at the base, the tip of the tail is limp; Score 1: when picked up at the base, the tail is limp; <italic>Score 1.5</italic>: the tail is limp, and walking is slightly wobbly with a weakness in one hind leg. <italic>Score 2</italic>: when holding at the base, the tail is limp and legs are not spread apart or the mouse presents signs of head tilting with poor balance (both symptoms are associated with poor balance). <italic>Score 2.5</italic>: the tail is limp, the two hind legs are weak or no movement in one leg or the mouse presents signs of head tilting with occasional fall over. <italic>Score 3</italic>: the tail is limp with complete or almost complete paralysis of hind legs (legs can ‘paddle’ but not to move forward of the hip). <italic>Score 3.5</italic>: the tail is limp with complete paralysis of hind legs (hindquarters are flat and the mouse is unable to right itself when put on the side). <italic>Score 4</italic>: the tail is limp with complete paralysis of hind legs associated with weakness or partial paralysis in front legs. <italic>Score 4.5</italic>: limp tail with complete paralysis of hind legs and partial paralysis of the front legs. No movement in the cage, mouse poorly alert. At this stage or for more severe symptoms euthanasia is performed.</p><p>In one of the studies, blood was recovered from the submandibular vein at 7- and 14 days post-immunization and once again before euthanasia. Upon euthanasia, mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) before tissue harvesting. Experimental procedures were in strict accordance with the European recommendation (2010/63/UE), which was transformed into the Belgian Law of May 29, 2013, regarding the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The local ethics committee approved the protocol of the study (study agreement 2010/UCL/MD/022, laboratory agreement LA1230314 and study agreement 2017/UCL/MD/024, laboratory agreement LA1230635).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Intracerebral stereotactic injection</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and placed on a stereotactic device. The stereotactic surgery was used to target the primary somatosensory cortex shoulder-neck region (S1ShNc). The skull was exposed through a midline incision and a drill was used to gain access to the brain. The following coordinates were used: bregma + 1 mm caudal, 2 mm laterally from the median sagittal suture, and 1.06 deep in the cortex. A syringe was inserted into the brain and its content was gradually released over a period of 5 min. Once the injection completed, the capillary was slowly removed. Mice received a single intracerebral (i.c.) injection of either 2 µL of a cytokine mixture composed of 250 ng tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα; PeproTech, London, UK), and 100 U of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ; PeproTech, London, UK) dissolved in sterile PBS or vehicle alone. Mice were monitored daily after surgery until euthanasia three days after cytokine injection. Finally, non-immunized mice also received a unilateral stereotactic injection of PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>miRNA profiling</title><p>On the day of euthanasia, a subset of mice was perfused with 10 mL RNAlater solution (Life Technologies). The site of injection was micro-dissected out and immediately utilized for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using <italic>miRvana</italic> Kit (Ambion), according to manufacturer protocol. Briefly, tissues were collected in a Cell Disruption Buffer and homogenized with a motorized rotor-stator homogenizer. Subsequently, an organic extraction followed by immobilization of RNA on glass-fiber filters was performed. RNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop UV/VIS microspectrophotometry (ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).</p><p>Analysis of miRNA expression was performed on a pool of total RNA samples from a subset of mice. Starting from 500 ng of pooled total RNA, a TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with Megaplex Pool RT primers (Applied Biosystems) was used. A set of predefined pools of up to 380 stem-looped reverse-transcription (RT) primers enabled the simultaneous synthesis of cDNA from mature miRNAs. The expression profile of miRNAs was performed with TaqMan Microfluidic Array Cards Type A (Applied Biosystems) containing dried TaqMan primers and probes. The experiments were performed on a Viia7 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using Viia7 system software and QuantStudio 3D AnalysisSuite Software (Version 3.1.).</p><p>For each miRNA, the amplification curve was checked. The Ct cutoff value of 32 was applied to all miRNA hence miRNA which Ct was above 32 was ignored for the analysis as recommended by the manufacturer. Relative quantification was determined using the ΔΔCt method with U6 as the internal reference. Differential levels of each miRNA were expressed as fold change compared to the control group (when the miRNA was expressed in the CTL group). We also compared miRNA variations between HIS-C and LIS-C groups. Considering specifically miRNA that were increased or decreased at least twofold between HIS-C and LIS-C groups, we performed a pathway analysis of the top enriched canonical pathways associated with the target genes related to the miRNAs dysregulated. These pathways were found by performing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis by miRNet, mirPath, or Cytoscape String app databases.</p><p>Selected miRNAs were also analyzed in individual mice with RT-qPCR. Briefly, 10 ng of total RNA was retrotranscribed with TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) and later amplified with the relevant TaqMan MicroRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were performed using ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and quantification was performed using the ΔΔCt method with U6 as reference.

Plasma cytokines and chemokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12(p40), IL-17, TNFα, IFNγ, MIP-1α, RANTES, KC, and G-CSF were quantified using a Bio-Plex Multiplex kit (Bio-Rad, Nazareth, Belgium) and measured by using Luminex technology (Bio-Plex 200; Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guillemot-Legris et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>Brains and spinal cord were recovered and fixed in 4% PFA for 72 hr, transferred in sucrose solutions (15% then 30%) for cryoprotection, and finally kept at −80°C. Cryosections were cut with a cryostat. The whole brain was serially sliced (sagittal sections) at a thickness of 20 µm and 30 µm (4 slides of 20 µm and 4 slides of 30 µm). Therefore, two successive slices of the brain on the same slide are systematically separated by 180 µm. Each slide analyzed contains 4–5 brain slices (covering a region of 720 to 900 µm (for 4 and 5 brain slices respectively)) and centered on the injection site (PBS or cytokines). A similar strategy was used for the spinal cord. Coronal sections were serially sliced at a thickness of 20 µm and 30 µm (4 slides of 20 µm and 4 slides of 30 µm). Again, two successive slices of the spinal cord on the same slide are systematically separated by 180 µm. Each slide analyzed contains 5–6 spinal cord slices (covering a region of 900 to 1080 µm (for 5 and 6 spinal cord slices respectively)). One slide (brain or spinal cord) of adequate thickness was randomly selected to perform staining. The number of animals used is specified in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Brightfield staining</title><p>Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) stain with Cresyl Violet (CV) counterstain was used for CLs assessment and identification of basic neuronal structure (3-5). LFB staining alone was also used to assess CLs. Toluidine blue was used to measure neuronal loss in the cortex. The size of the nucleus was the morphological criteria used to distinguish neurons from glial cells: nuclei area &gt;50 µm² (neurons). Images were acquired using a Leica DM6000-B microscope or a Leica SCN400 slide scanner.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cryosections were washed in PBS containing 0.1% triton (PBS-T), and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: anti-MBP (1:1000, Abcam Ab123499), anti-FOXO3 (1:300, Abcam Ab177487), anti-C1q (1:100, Abcam Ab71940), anti-GFAP (1:1000, Dako Z0334), anti-Iba-1 (1:500, Wako 019–19741), anti-CD3 (1:300 Dako A0452), and anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore MAB377). All primary antibodies were diluted in PBS-T containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS) overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were washed 3 times for 10 min in PBS and then incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody: Alexa-Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal (1:1000, Abcam) and/or Alexa-Fluor 568 conjugated goat anti-rat polyclonal (1:750, Abcam) and/or Alexa-Fluor Plus 647 conjugated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal (1:750, Abcam) in PBS-T containing 5%-NGS overnight at 4°C. Slides were then washed three times for 10 min with PBS, incubated with a nuclear stain (DAPI), and mounted using Vectashield or Fluoromount as mounting medium. Fluoromyelin staining was used to assess lesions in the spinal cord and cortex. After rehydration in PBS, sections were incubated in Fluoromyelin Green (1:300, Invitrogen F34651) following manufacturer’s instructions. Image acquisition was performed using a Pannoramic P250 Flash III slide scanner (3DHISTECH) or a Leica SP8 confocal system with a Z-step increment set to 3 µm. The confocal images presented are the result of the maximum projection of the entire stack.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification</title><p>Image analysis was performed by a blinded researcher using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guillemot-Legris et al., 2016</xref>). For the area occupied or for the negative area (depending on the output measured), the color image of interest was changed to an 8-bit image. An automatic thresholding method was applied and the value of the area occupied or negative area was obtained. For the brain and the spinal cord, several images were obtained (e.g. left and right sides of the spinal cord, specific regions of the brain for each slice of tissue present on the slide) using all the slices present on the slide (see above) along with the corresponding quantification values. The mean of these values was then calculated to generate a single value per animal. Concerning the fluorescence quantification, the corrected total fluorescence was calculated as follows: integrated density of the area of interest – (size of the area of interest x mean fluorescence of background). Finally, brain fluoromyelin and MBP intensity were normalized further using the corrected total fluorescence of the same region in CTL mice that was set at 100%. For brain analyses, unless otherwise specified, the whole cortical region was considered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data distribution was assessed using the omnibus K2 D'Agostino-Pearson normality test. Data were analyzed using Student’s unpaired t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test depending on parametric or non-parametric distribution, and ANOVA (one-way and two-way ANOVA). Compared groups were deemed significantly different if p-value≤0.05. For details please refer to figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Markus Kipp as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting paper showing new findings in a highly relevant area of research. In this study Nicola orifice and co-workers report that upon cortical cytokine injection, MOG-immunized mice develop cortical lesions, and the severeness of the cortical lesions depends on the initial clinical score. Beyond, the authors provide a miRNA analysis of the experimentally induced cortical lesions and try to correlate the regulated miRNAs with histopathological changes.</p><p>The observed findings, although highly relevant for the field, are not entirely new and unexpected. As stated in the Discussion section, in a previous study Merkler and colleagues stereotactically targeted the cerebral cortex by injection of pro-inflammatory mediators in animals that were immunized subclinically with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and observed the formation of inflammatory cortical lesions. Beyond, several works demonstrated that a focal lesion in the mouse brain can recruit peripheral immune cells to the site of tissue injury. Thus, the observation of the authors that TNF/IFN injections into the neocortex induced cortical lesions could be expected. However, the authors expand these findings and study the regulation of mi-RNA expression in their model. One major limitation of the manuscript is, however, that it remains on the descriptive level. While the authors can show a complex (and sometimes hard to follow) regulation of miRNA species, the functional relevance of these miRNAs for the development and progression of cortical lesions remains speculative.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>While most of the comments address missing Information, two reviewers raised doubts about the myelination Level, which should be carefully addressed.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Specifically, please address the following Points:</p><p>1) The statement that cortical lesions can be predictors of long-term disability is not justified by the cited studies. Please adopt.</p><p>2) In the subsection “EAE mouse model with both a heterogeneous immune response and cortical lesions”, the authors state that anti-IBA1 stains microglia. This statement should be adopted as IBA1 is as well expressed by monocytes, which are particularly recruited in EAE.</p><p>3) I am not sure whether LFB stains should be used to evaluate myelin loss of grey matter areas. Based on the presentation of Figure 1, I assume that the LFB stain was combined with a Cresyl-Violet stain or some similar one. It appears for me that in the cytokine-injection group (see black box in Figure 3A) there is a dramatic loss in nuclear structures which could indicate neuronal cell loss. Thus, the decrease in what the author call LFB stain does not indicate demyelination but neuronal and/or glial damage. This point is critical to the manuscript and should be addressed by a more in-depth histological and immunohistochemical analysis.</p><p>I appreciate that, in parallel, the authors observed a decrease in fluoromyelin and other myelin stains. However, this does not demonstrate true demyelination (i.e. loss of myelin but neuronal/axonal preservation). It might well be that there is neuronal or axonal loss which would result as well in a reduction of anti-myelin staining intensities. To exclude neuronal damage, the authors provide NeuN cell numbers and toluidine-stains. However, the presented data are premature. First, neuronal densities should be demonstrated for control groups, LIS-C and HIS-C groups. In Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4H, just the results of the LIS-C and HIS-C groups are demonstrated. This critic applies as well to other stains. Second, it is not clear to me, how the data in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 were evaluated. The graph says &quot;neuronal loss&quot;. Compared to what? Beyond, where all cells counted or just cells with a neuronal morphology. If the latter is true, what was the morphological criteria to decide whether a stained cell was a neuron or another cell type?</p><p>In the ideal case, design-based stereology should be applied as the method of choice to evaluate total neuronal cell numbers in the cortices. At least,</p><p>4) The finding of more cortical lesions in the somatosensory cortex compared to the motor or visual cortex is not surprising as the cytokines, if I understood correctly, were injected into the somatosensory cortex. If the data are relevant for the manuscript, they should be better embedded into the Results section, and their rationale explained.</p><p>5) In Figure 7B, FOXO3+ cell numbers are shown in two separate graphs (ipsi versus contra). It is not clear to me why this is necessary as it complicates the interpretation of the results.

Actually, we used for the first study the classically used LFB + Cresyl-Violet staining and arrived at the same conclusion as the reviewer. Therefore, in additional experiments we wanted to examine these aspects and performed NeuN, Iba-1, CD3 and MBP stainings. In a subsequent cohort (see Figure 4), we used LFB only to avoid these confounding factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This point is critical to the manuscript and should be addressed by a more in-depth histological and immunohistochemical analysis.</p><p>I appreciate that, in parallel, the authors observed a decrease in fluoromyelin and other myelin stains.

As evidenced by the manuscript title, we focused on cortical lesions (a key feature of MS) and we defined some of their major characteristics in this model. We did evaluate cortical lesions through LFB or MBP staining. However, we know that even though these techniques are strong indicators and are extensively used, they cannot fully replace electron microscopy to quantify demyelination. We feel that further in-depth studies of these cortical lesions would be interesting with regards to myelin loss or axonal preservation for instance but are beyond the scope of our manuscript. A follow-up paper could examine these aspects.</p><p>Regarding the neuronal loss, we apologize if we were not clear. As we often did in this manuscript, we used several techniques to assess the same output. Here we used NeuN IF and further used Toluidine Blue staining to address the potential neuronal loss. Regarding Toluidine Blue, we measured the cortical area where neuron nuclei were no longer present and expressed this as a percentage: area of “neuronal loss” / total cortical area *100. The cortical area of neuronal loss was assessed using the size exclusion criteria between neurons and glia nuclei. We changed the figure and legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the ideal case, design-based stereology should be applied as the method of choice to evaluate total neuronal cell numbers in the cortices. At least,</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and, as mentioned above, a follow-up paper could examine these aspects. We would like to respectfully mention, however, that we did not analyze a single slice (i.e. an area) for each brain but several slices, therefore sampling a volume of the brain. Indeed the data we report were obtained by analyzing serial slices of the brain (i.e. 4-5 slices per mouse separated by 180µm each). While our approach is much better than the analysis of a single slice per brain, as mentioned, we agree that using design-based stereology would bring useful information in our follow-up studies. Thank you for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The finding of more cortical lesions in the somatosensory cortex compared to the motor or visual cortex is not surprising as the cytokines, if I understood correctly, were injected into the somatosensory cortex. If the data are relevant for the manuscript, they should be better embedded into the Results section, and their rationale explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the rationale for discussing this point was not clear. Indeed, the intracortical injection of cytokines targeted the somatosensory cortex. We performed this analysis because we wondered if CLs could be found away from the injection site and if differences in their distribution could be found between mice from the HIS-C and LIS-C groups. We amended the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 7B, FOXO3+ cell numbers are shown in two separate graphs (ipsi versus contra). It is not clear to me why this is necessary as it complicates the interpretation of the results. Beyond, different scales are used which should be avoided.</p></disp-quote><p>We elected to present FOXO3+ data as two separate graphs (ipsi and contra) as the miRNA data in the same figure (Figure 7A) are split between ipsi and contra. We did so in order to simplify the take home message: we focus first on differences between HIS and LIS in the ipsi-lateral cortex and then in the contra-lateral cortex. Thank you for noticing the scale discrepancy, we have modified the scale as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What test(s) was applied to measure data distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to assess the normality of data distribution, we used the omnibus K2 D'Agostino-Pearson normality test. We added this point in the Materials and methods, Statistical analysis section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors should provide more information on how the miRNA profiling experiments were evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have adapted the Materials and methods section in our revised version. For each miRNA, the amplification curve was checked. The Ct cutoff value of 32 was applied to all miRNA hence miRNA which Ct was above 32 was ignored for the analysis as recommended by the manufacturer. To evaluate miRNA expression and to facilitate data interpretation, all miRNA expressed are displayed in Supplementary file 1 (Ct &gt; 32). The ΔΔCt method was used to compare miRNA expression between experimental groups and these data are reported in Supplementary file 2. Because we focused our work on differences between HIS-C and LIS-C groups, we also show data (using the ΔΔCt method) showing miRNA variations between these two groups either in the ipsi- or in the contra-lateral sides in Supplementary file 3. We also display in Figure 6A the miRNA from Supplementary file 3 that were increased or decreased at least twofold between HIS-C and LIS-C groups. Moreover, we performed a pathway analysis of the top enriched canonical pathways associated with the target genes related to the miRNAs dysregulated in HIS-C-ipsi vs. LIS-C-ipsi (presented in Figure 6A) and found either in HIS-C-ipsi or LIS-C-ipsi (Figure 6B). Finally, in order to link miRNA and their target genes, we schematically represented the interactions between the miRNAs that were found in all three databases and controlling the most genes and a panel of the targeted genes found in at least two databases. Thank you for noticing this, we modified the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) For each experiment the authors should include information regarding the number of included animals, how many animals were excluded for what reason, and how many independent experiments were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of animals or N is presented in each figure legends. We reproduced our experimental setup in three different animal cohorts in different laboratories with different experimenters, which is rarely done in in vivo studies. We did not perform the exact same experiment twice; the ethics committee would not allow this. However, using our model in the three different experimental setups, we always obtained an autoimmune heterogeneity (HIS and LIS group) and the presence of cortical lesions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It should be NeuN instead of Neun throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing, we modified the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 1 I suggest to add information regarding what was stained in panel D and also in Figure 3. In Figure 1E the labels are very small in size and hard to read.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding Figure 1D, the information is stated in the figure legend: “Representative photomicrographs of CD3 positive cells (lymphocytes) infiltrating the spinal cord ventral white matter. The scale bar represents 50 µm.”. The same is true for the legends of Figure 3A and C. However, as suggested, we added the information in the figure as well. We also modified the size of the labels in Figure 1E in order to facilitate the reading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please clarify in Figure 2 why is only IL-17 expression relative to PTX?</p></disp-quote><p>We expressed the data as relative to the control group (CTL). However, contrary to the other markers analyzed, IL-17 is not expressed in the CTL group as indicated by the ND (not detected) in the graph. Therefore, we could not express the results of the other groups relative to CTL. As IL-17 is expressed in the other three groups, we decided to report the data for IL-17 as relative to the expression in the PTX group because this is the “classical” EAE model. This is now specified in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 3A, D and G, Figure 4: Scale bars are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing. We added the scale bars for these figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
