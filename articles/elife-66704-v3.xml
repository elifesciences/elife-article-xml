biology during neural tube closure. Additionally, mutations that cause neural tube defects (NTDs) tend to affect anterior or posterior regions of the neural tube but rarely both, indicating a regional specificity to NTD genetics. To better understand the regional specificity of cell behaviors during neural tube closure, we analyzed the dynamic localization of actin and N-cadherin via high-resolution tissue-level time-lapse microscopy during <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural tube closure. To investigate the regionality of gene function, we generated mosaic mutations in <italic>shroom3</italic>, a key regulator or neural tube closure.

NTDs represent a highly heterogenous group of congenital defects in which failure of the neural folds to elevate or fuse results in a failure of the skull or spine to enclose the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>). While genetic analyses in both humans and animal models have revealed dozens of genes necessary for normal neural tube closure, several key questions remain.</p><p>One central unanswered question relates to the regional heterogeneity of both normal neural tube closure and pathological NTDs. For example, the collective cell movements of convergent extension dramatically elongate the hindbrain and spinal cord of vertebrates, but not the midbrain and forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wallingford et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, disruption of genetic regulators of convergent extension such as the planar cell polarity (PCP) genes results in failure of neural tube closure in posterior regions of the neural ectoderm, but not anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kibar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>shroom3</italic> gene is implicated in apical constriction, a distinct cell behavior that drives epithelial sheet bending, and disruption of <italic>shroom3</italic> elicits highly penetrant defects in anterior neural tube closure, but only weakly penetrant defects in the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999</xref>). This regional deployment of apical constriction in the anterior and convergent extension in the posterior during neural tube closure is poorly understood.</p><p>In addition, the underlying mechanisms of individual cell behaviors necessary for neural tube closure remain incompletely defined. While apical constriction is driven by actomyosin contraction, the precise site of actomyosin action during this process is unclear and constitutes a long-term problem in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). For example, analysis of apical constriction during gastrulation in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has shown integration of discrete junctional and medio-apical (‘medial’) populations of actomyosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coravos and Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies in frog and chick embryos have also described similar pulsed medial actomyosin-based contractions occurring during neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and García-García, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christodoulou and Skourides, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>), but how those contractions are controlled and how they contribute to tissue-wide cell shape changes during neural tube closure are not known.</p><p>For example, Shroom3 is among the more well-defined regulators of apical constriction, being both necessary and sufficient to drive this cell shape change in a variety of cell types, including the closing neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hildebrand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plageman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plageman et al., 2011b</xref>). Shroom3 is known to act via Rho kinase to drive apical actin assembly and myosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hildebrand, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plageman et al., 2011a</xref>). However, the relationships between Shroom3 and the medial and junctional populations of actin have not been explored.</p><p>An additional outstanding question relates to the interplay of actomyosin contractility and cell adhesion during apical constriction. The classical cadherin Cdh2 (N-cadherin) is essential for apical constriction during neural tube closure in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morita et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nandadasa et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>shroom3</italic> displays robust genetic interactions with <italic>n-cadherin</italic> in multiple developmental processes, including neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plageman et al., 2011b</xref>). Moreover, a dominant-negative N-cadherin can disrupt the ability of ectopically expressed Shroom3 to induce apical constriction in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lang et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, it is unclear if or how Shroom3 controls the interplay of N-cadherin and actomyosin during apical constriction. This is an important gap in our knowledge, because despite the tacit assumption that cadherins interact with each other and control actomyosin at cell-cell junctions, N-cadherin displays multiple cell-autonomous activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rebman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabatini et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, several papers now demonstrate that extra-junctional cadherins at free cell membranes can engage and regulate the actomyosin cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ichikawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Padmanabhan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sako et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, though Shroom3 has been extensively studied in the context of cranial apical constriction, the gene is expressed throughout the neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999</xref>) and recent studies have also implicated Shroom family proteins in the control of convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simões et al., 2014</xref>). Several studies indicate a genetic and cell biological interplay of Shroom3 and the PCP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durbin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>), and one study directly links PCP, apical constriction, and convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, some studies also suggest a role for PCP proteins in apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Together, these studies highlight the complexity of neural tube closure, which is compounded by the sheer scale of the tissue involved. The neural ectoderm is comprised of hundreds to thousands of cells (depending on organism) and stretches from the anterior to posterior poles of the developing embryo. However, the vast majority of dynamic studies of cell behavior in the neural tube closure, including our own, have focused on small numbers of cells due to constraints of both imaging and image analysis.</p><p>Here, we used image-tiling time-lapse confocal microscopy to obtain over 750,000 individual measurements of cell behaviors associated with neural tube closure in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>. Using these data, we demonstrate that the cell biological basis of apical constriction differs substantially between the anterior and the posterior neural plate. The data further suggest that the crux of Shroom3 function lies not in actin assembly per se, but rather in the coupling of actin contraction to effective cell surface area reduction. Third, we demonstrate that the control of N-cadherin localization is a key feature of Shroom3 function during neural tube closure. Finally, we demonstrate that the incompletely penetrant posterior phenotypes related to <italic>shroom3</italic> loss stem from dysregulation of both actin and N-cadherin localization. Overall, these findings (a) elucidate differences between cell behaviors during cranial/anterior and spinal/posterior neural tube closure, (b) provide new insights into the function of <italic>shroom3</italic>, an essential neural tube closure gene, and (c) demonstrate the power of large-scale imaging and analysis to generate both cell-level mechanistic insight and new hypotheses for exploring neural tube closure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-content imaging of cell behavior and protein localization during vertebrate neural tube closure</title><p><italic>X. tropicalis</italic> affords several advantages for imaging neural tube closure, as its cells are large and easily accessible; its culture conditions for imaging are no more complex than synthetic pond water held at room temperature; and its broad molecular manipulability allows examination of diverse fluorescent markers. We developed methods for confocal microscopy and image tiling to collect high-magnification datasets spanning broad regions of the folding neural ectoderm from embryos injected at blastula stages with mRNAs encoding fluorescent reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the onset of neurulation (approximately <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1994</xref>, stages 12.5–13), embryos were positioned to image either the anterior or the posterior regions of the neural ectoderm.

Second, a unified mechanism for apical constriction has emerged in recent years involving the coordinated action of two discrete populations of actomyosin positioned either at apical cell-cell junctions or the medial apical cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coravos and Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</xref>), but the extent to which this model, developed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, applies to vertebrates is unknown. Third, N-cadherin is essential for apical constriction in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nandadasa et al., 2009</xref>), but its functional interplay with junctional and/or medial actin is unknown. Accordingly, we made movies focused on either the anterior or posterior neural plate during neurulation, imaging the fluorescent actin biosensor LifeAct-RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, magenta) and N-cadherin-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and independently quantified the mean fluorescent intensity of junctional and medial populations for both reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). To account for noise in these measurements, we have smoothed the data within individual cell tracks by averaging the data over a 7-frame window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>In total, our dataset is comprised of ~250,000 observations of apical cell surfaces from over 3700 cells and ~580,000 observations from over 13,000 individual cell-cell junctions across nine embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Images were collected at a rate of 1 frame/observation per minute over 1–2 hr, spanning roughly stages 13–18. Initial cell sizes and fluorescent varied among cells and embryos due to both natural variation and staging as well as variation introduced via mRNA microinjection. Because our primary interest is in the dynamics of apical constriction, we standardized many of the parameters in our analyses to account for variation in cell size and fluorescent intensity. This standardization involved mean-centering the data for each individual cell track to zero and then dividing the resulting mean-centered values by the standard deviation of each track, such that the standardized parameters are now measured in standard deviations rather than square microns or arbitrary units, allowing for simpler comparisons of overall changes in parameters between cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, D</xref>).</p><p>We first performed an initial test of the validity of our approach, examining our dataset for well-known trends expected for neural epithelial cells during neural tube closure, namely an overall decrease in apical area and an overall increase in apical actin intensity. The heat maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> reveal that cells in both anterior and posterior regions generally reduce their apical surface area and increase medial actin intensity, as expected. These overall trends are backed by examination of individual cells, as shown for specific representative cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Overall, this analysis suggests that our pipeline is generally effective for quantifying cell shape and actin intensity over time during neural tube closure.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tissue-level analysis of individual cell behaviors reveals dynamic heterogeneity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall change (Δ) in apical surface area (standardized) across anterior (left) and posterior (right) control embryos.

First, while bulk measurements showed a decrease in apical area in both anterior and posterior regions over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we observed distinct region-specific distributions for these changes. For example, in the anterior, the vast majority of cells displayed significant apical constriction, and this constriction proceeded gradually across neurulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and A’</xref>, left). In the posterior, however, a much smaller proportion of posterior cells constricted and a substantial number actually dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right).

Again, these distributions were significantly different between the anterior and posterior regions, with cells in the spine having a significantly more heterogeneous distribution of actin accumulation outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>, left).</p><p>By far the most intriguing results related to the dynamics of N-cadherin localization, for which we observed two surprising patterns. First, in the anterior neural plate N-cadherin accumulated dramatically not only in the junctional region <italic>but also in the medial</italic> region (i.e. the free apical surface) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, D’, E and E’</xref>). Thus, N-cadherin localization closely parallels actin dynamics in the normal anterior neural plate. This result was surprising because classical cadherins such as N-cadherin are typically known for their action at cell-cell junctions. Nonetheless, immunostaining for endogenous N-cadherin in fixed embryos confirmed this medial accumulation in the apical surfaces of anterior neural ectoderm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For example, the vast majority of junctions in the anterior neural plate decreased in length, but shortening junctions displayed no bias to their orientation, consistent with the robust, largely isodiametric apical constriction of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Consistent with our data on apical surface area, anterior <italic>shroom3</italic> crispant cells displayed a robustly significant defect (p &lt; 2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>), with the majority of junctions actually elongating rather than shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left). A very different trend was observed in the posterior, where most junctions shortened but many elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, left); shrinking was strongly biased to junction joining AP neighbors, with a reciprocal strong bias for elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). The converse pattern was observed for actin accumulation, with increasing actin accumulation negatively correlated to decreasing junction length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). This pattern is consistent with the known convergent extension cell behaviors in the posterior neural tube and our data here reflect the findings of a previous, smaller scale study of this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler and Wallingford, 2018</xref>) as well as data from fixed mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>), providing confidence in the veracity of the dataset.</p><p>Our analysis of posterior <italic>shroom3</italic> crispant junctions revealed a barely significant (p = 0.015) change in their bulk behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>, right). This result reflects our cell-level data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and reinforces the conclusion that apical constriction defects are likely not sufficient to explain the posterior NTDs caused by lack of Shroom3. Indeed, a similar modest defect was observed in <italic>shroom3</italic> mutant mice, and that study also revealed a link to the polarization of planar cell arrangement during neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One possible explanation for such a polarity phenotype is that Shroom3 is directly required for actomyosin contractions that contribute to junction shortening during CE (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huebner et al., 2021</xref>). However, we used Tissue Analyzer to quantify the number of stable neighbor exchanges (‘T1 transitions’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>), and we observed no effect in <italic>shroom3</italic> crispant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>), suggesting that neighbor exchange does not strictly require Shroom3 function. This led us to more carefully explore the effect of Shroom3 loss on polarization of the behaviors of individual junctions.</p><p>We found that strongly shrinking junctions were very tightly clustered in the most extreme AP orientation in control cells (i.e. clustered near 0°) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, left). By contrast, in <italic>shroom3</italic> crispant cells, shrinking junctions still dominated in the AP quadrant, consistent with previous data from fixed mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>), but importantly, they were spread across a wider range of orientations (i.e. more evenly distributed from ~0° to ~40°) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, cyan ellipses). Histograms of these data provided a more granular view of this subtle, but significant shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>). Elongating junctions were also less polarized in Shroom3 crispants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D, H</xref>). Furthermore, actin dynamics very neatly reflected the shrinking and elongating behaviors in both control and <italic>shroom3</italic> crispant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>).</p><p>Thus, loss of <italic>shroom3</italic> leads to a subtle but significant shift in the polarization of the junction behaviors that drive convergent extension, a result that could explain the incompletely penetrant posterior NTDs resulting from Shroom3 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999</xref>) and that is very consistent with the known genetic interaction of shroom3 and PCP gene mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular basis for this interaction remains unclear, but it could relate to the interplay of Shroom3 and N-cadherin. Indeed, we observed a very strong clustering signal for N-cadherin <italic>clearance</italic> from the most polarized elongating junctions (i.e. ~90°) that was not observed for actin in elongating junctions, and this clustering was significantly diminished in <italic>shroom3</italic> crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Understanding the cellular mechanisms contributing to neural tube closure has long challenged embryologists due to the relatively large number of cells involved and the heterogeneity of their behaviors. Indeed, some of the earliest uses of computer simulation in developmental biology focused on understanding the degree to which neural ectoderm cells constrict their apical surfaces during neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobson and Gordon, 1976</xref>). Since then, our understanding of neural tube closure has broadly improved. Hundreds of mutations affecting neural tube closure have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris and Juriloff, 2010</xref>), and the functional interactions between these genes are coming into focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murdoch et al., 2014</xref>). However, while time-lapse imaging of single cell behaviors in chicks, frogs, and mice have provided key insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler and Wallingford, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christodoulou and Skourides, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson and Keller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Massarwa and Niswander, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molè et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ossipova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pyrgaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallingford and Harland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), our understanding of the cell biology of neural tube closure still lags substantially behind our understanding of the genetics.</p><p>Recent research has begun to bridge this gap. In toto imaging has captured neural tube closure as one facet of overall mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McDole et al., 2018</xref>), and tissue-scale imaging has revealed the cell biological basis of ciliopathy-related NTDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>). In a complement to these recent advancements, we have now used high-resolution, but tissue-scale, time-lapse imaging of both actin and N-cadherin followed by cell-tracking analysis to gain several new insights into the process of apical constriction during neural tube closure.</p><p>First, we show that anterior and posterior neural ectoderm cells undergo apical constriction to differing degrees and by different constrictive mechanisms. Second, we show that changes in apical area in the anterior neural ectoderm are more strongly correlated with changes in medial actomyosin localization than junctional actomyosin, indicating that contractility driving apical constriction is more likely to be generated at the medial cell surface. Our results on medial actin localization are largely consistent with smaller scale studies in both <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and García-García, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christodoulou and Skourides, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>) and moreover reflect mechanisms described in more detail in the context of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roh-Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, our data show that both medial and junctional actin localization have similar correlations with apical area in the posterior neural ectoderm, suggesting actomyosin contractility may be more balanced across the medial and junctional domains in this region.</p><p>Third, we show that N-cadherin accumulates at the medial surfaces of constricting cells in the anterior neural ectoderm, but that N-cadherin localization poorly correlates with apical constriction in the posterior. Interestingly, our analysis suggests that anterior <italic>shroom3</italic> crispant cells fail to constrict less from a lack of actomyosin accumulation and more from an inability to accumulate N-cadherin at the medial surface of cells. This is consistent with a previously reported genetic interaction between <italic>shroom3</italic> and <italic>N-cadherin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plageman et al., 2011b</xref>), and suggests that a Shroom3-N-cadherin pathway may drive anterior apical constriction during neural tube closure. The function of this N-cadherin remains to be determined, but two possibilities are suggested by prior studies. First, non-junctional N-cadherin can drive micropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sabatini et al., 2011</xref>) in cultured cells, so medial N-cadherin may contribute to the known, Shroom3-dependent endocytosis of the constricting apical surface of neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kowalczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Harland, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, medial N-cadherin might act in a manner similar to non-junctional E-cadherin, forming cis-clusters and directing the assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Future experiments should be illuminating.</p><p>Finally, the study of developmental biology in the 21st century has been marked by explosive increases in the size of experiments – advances in proteomics and transcriptomics are providing an unprecedented depth to our understanding of the molecular workings of cells in embryos. Thus, it is of special importance that we use advances in imaging and data analysis to ask what those cells <italic>actually do and how they do it</italic>. It’s notable then that the approach described here can be applied to essentially any protein for which reliable fluorescent reporters are available. Many key questions immediately arise from our work, for example, the localization and dynamics of other crucial players such as Myosin II or Rho kinase. In the posterior neural plate expanding previous smaller scale analyses of PCP protein localization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler and Wallingford, 2018</xref>) will be of great interest. Finally, the large-scale approach here provides a lower-resolution, but tissue-scale complement to super-resolution imaging advances that are now revealing the subcellular organization of the machinery of morphogenesis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huebner et al., 2021</xref>). Ultimately, then, the work presented here is significant for providing quantitative insights at tissue scale into the interplay of gene function, protein localization, and cell behavior during a biomedically important process in vertebrate embryogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> frogs were obtained from the National <italic>Xenopus</italic> Resource, Woods Hole, MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horb et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Injections</title><p>Wild-type <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> eggs were fertilized in vitro using sperm from wild-type <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> males using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wlizla et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><italic>X. tropicalis</italic> embryos were moved to 1/9× MMR +2% Ficoll, then injected in both dorsal blastomeres at the 4-cell stage with 50 pg LifeAct-RFP mRNA and 45 pg <italic>Xenopus</italic> N-cadherin-GFP mRNA, or 80 pg GFP-Shroom3ΔC-term mRNA.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Elke Ober as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Α Yap (Reviewer #2); Jeff Hildebrand (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to revisit their conclusions, which in places are overextended. For example, it seems too much to conclude that &quot;the primary effect of shroom 3 in the anterior neural plate is …on the coupling of medial actomyosin …with medial N-cadherin accumulation&quot; (p 10, bottom). It is the most obvious change in their current data set, but that data set seems too limited to call it the &quot;primary effect&quot;.</p><p>Similarly, the manuscript strength is the new analytical approach of molecular and cellular changes at tissue scale rather than in increasing the understanding of neural tube morphogenesis. Therefore, we suggest to better frame the manuscript around this new analytical approach and its capacity to yield data of great richness for understanding morphogenetic processes in vertebrates.</p><p>Addressing the points raised below will support the potential of the approach for gaining mechanistic insights and overall strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2) Estimating molecular concentration: Please clarify and address whether the molecular concentration of analyzed proteins has been corrected for change in size of the analyzed area over time. For example, the medial N-cadherin increases with apical constriction (Figure 6), but is this because the apical surface is getting smaller (i.e. same amount of apical N-cadherin, but now more concentrated) or is there an increase in the total amount of protein in the apical surface?</p><p>3) Clarify the analysis of medial signals: How do the authors correct for noise in their analyses? Lifeact can also bind G-actin and some of the punctate N-cadherin-GFP could potentially be in vesicles rather than at the apical membrane (see also point 5).</p><p>4) The non-junctional distribution of N-cadherin and its dynamic changes during apical constriction represent an exciting result. However, solely using ectopically expressed N-cadherin-GFP to investigate its function is not sufficient, as it may introduce overexpression artifacts. Please provide data corroborating that endogenous N-cadherin behaves similar to the exogenous protein. We appreciate that based on the available reagents (e.g. antibodies) this would likely represent static images. If this proves experimentally not possible, this should at a minimum be addressed in the text.</p><p>5) Could the current data be used to assess the trafficking of the N-Cadherin? For instance, can the authors determine if N-cadherin moving from junctional to medial locations, is being trafficked directly to the medial membrane, or being internalized from the medial region, or perhaps some other dynamic behavior. This could help provide more information regarding the mechanistic role of N-cadherin.</p><p>6) Does medial N-cadherin co-distribute with Myosin II, ppRLC, or Rho-kinase? Based on previous studies of apical constriction in other model systems this is an attractive assumption. This should be tested experimentally to support and mechanistically corroborate the correlation of molecular events and cell shape changed described in this manuscript. For instance, combine N-cadherin with a MyosinII, a GTP-Rho localization sensor (e.g. Bement lab) or the AHPH system (Piekny and Glotzer, 2008) reporter to generate relevant time-series.</p><p>7) Given that non-junctional N-cadherin has been associated with diverse cellular functions apart from adhesion, please discuss its possible role in this current context.</p><p>8) Support the functional inactivation of <italic>Shroom3</italic>: The sequence analysis provided is compelling but actually demonstrating reduced protein would strengthen the method.</p><p>What proportion of indels are 3 bp or multiple of 3, could resulting in-frame deletions or monoallelic indels explain for instance the 2 populations observed for instance in Fig5D, E?</p><p>Moreover, please clarify which particular domain is targeted by the <italic>Shroom3</italic> gRNA employed in this study? How is it expected to impair its function, e.g. complete loss of function, deletion of a specific functional domain? If the latter, could a truncated protein exert partial functions? How would this effect interactions with actin or N-cadherin and relate to the specific phenotypes observed?</p><p>9) <italic>Shroom3</italic> spatial expression: How is <italic>Shroom3</italic> expressed throughout the extent of the anteroposterior neural epithelium, given that it seems to exert different effects in the anterior and posterior parts? Likewise, would be important to see the <italic>Shroom3</italic> subcellular distribution in the neural plate to determine if there is a population of <italic>Shroom3</italic> in medial positions analogous to N-cadherin.</p><p>10) Clarification of sample numbers and data integration of different samples: The samples included in this study and presented in Methods Appendix2 display apparent differences, therefore additional information is required for the number of samples that contribute to each analysis and how data were compared and/or integrated. For instance, the anterior samples show differences in cell size and asymmetries within the tissue. Please explain the reason for this and how is this accounted for when comparing quantifications between samples. This should include how staging between samples was achieved, and the related registration allowing comparison of resulting cell behaviors.</p><p>Related to this, there seem to be only two posterior samples containing <italic>Shroom3</italic> crispant cells, please describe the variability between samples, similar to above. If only two samples were interrogated, a third sample needs to be included. In general, the sample number per experiment should be greater than two.</p><p>11) Describing the data analysis. Please introduce in the Results a few sentences that explain the &quot;standardization&quot; approach that are used to present the data. While this is in the Methods and Appendix, the approach is not one commonly seen, and it would be good to orient readers less familiar with the approach.</p><p>12) Facilitating the interpretation of some the 2D density plots in figure 10. Consider an alternative way or simplification of the graphs without breaking the data out into several additional graphs. If difficult, a more detailed description in the methods should be helpful to the reader and included.</p><p>13) The 2D density plots in figure 6D and E have such sharp edges; they look artificial. Please check and address whether this is just an issue with the PDF, thresholding, or some other technical issue.</p><p>14) Discuss limitations inherent to the approach, including: (i) a relatively limited number of molecular parameters are interrogated (F-actin and N-cadherin). It is possible, for example, that changes in contractility which drive junctional shortening (relevant for the analysis in Figure 10) are due to changes in actin organization (that may not be readily captured by overall measures of quantity) or activity of Myosin II (which is not measured here). Given the scale of the experiments that are involved, it would be technically challenging to interrogate more molecular players at the same time, representing a potential limitation.</p><p>(ii) the dynamics are relatively coarse-grained. For example, changes in cadherin levels that occur over hours may not capture changes in molecular turnover.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Baldwin and colleagues investigate a key morphogenetic step of neural tube closure, namely the apical constriction of the neural epithelium. Using <italic>Xenopus</italic> as a model for live imaging, they monitor the underlying cell behaviours over time, including large-scale quantitative analyses of cell shape changes and subcellular localization of key proteins, actin and N-cadherin. This revealed clear differences in the anterior and posterior neural plate with respect to apical constriction dynamics and cell junction dynamics. The cytoskeletal interactor <italic>Shroom3</italic> mediates aspects of these cell behaviours in a region-specific fashion, as revealed by F0 CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. <italic>Shroom3</italic> seems to control partially similar actin and N-cadherin localization, however, its loss leads to stronger defects only in anterior neural tube closure. The strength of this study is the highly quantitative nature of the approach: quantifying the morphogenetic behaviours of individual cells at the tissue level, which leads to an integration of previous observations with new insights into region-specific differences of cell behaviours and their correlation with characteristic actin and N-cadherin subcellular localisation. The very interesting observations however require further substantiation by functional experiments, as well as clarification of some experimental details.</p><p>The non-junctional distribution of N-cadherin and its dynamic changes during apical constriction represent an exciting result. Given that non-junctional N-cadherin has been associated with diverse functions, please clarify its possible role in this context. If it would be possible to determine its region-specific function(s) without interfering with cell adhesion, would add to the mechanistic understanding.</p><p>Which particular domain is targeted by the <italic>Shroom3</italic> gRNA employed in this study? How is it expected to impair its function, e.g. complete loss of function, deletion of a specific functional domain? If the latter, could a truncated protein exert partial functions? How would this effect interactions with actin or N-cadherin and relate to the specific phenotypes observed?</p><p>What proportion of indels are 3 bp or multiple of 3, could this or monoallelic indels explain for instance the 2 populations observed in Figure 5?</p><p>There seem to be two populations of n-cadherin positive cells in the posterior domain, how are they spatially distributed and would this affect morphogenesis on the tissue level?</p><p>How is <italic>Shroom3</italic> expressed throughout the extent of the anteroposterior neural epithelium? Given that <italic>Shroom3</italic> seems to have different effects in the anterior and posterior neural epithelium, information about its spatial distribution and sub cellular localisation would be informative for the interpretation of the results.</p><p>The samples included in this study and presented in Methods Appendix2 display apparent differences, therefore additional information is required for the number of samples that contribute to each analysis and how data were compared. For instance, the anterior samples show differences in cell size and asymmetries within the tissue.

If there is variability, a third sample needs to be included in the study.</p><p>How was the staging between samples and adjustment between resulting cell behaviours achieved? For instance, there seem to be fewer cells/lower signal at the time of rapid constriction in the posterior neural plate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Morphogenesis entails cell-level behaviours that generate tissue-level (multicellular) consequences. The challenge of characterizing and dissecting those cellular behaviours in the context of a tissue or organism is made even greater because (a) regional variation is often critical for morphogenetic processes (e.g. convergent extension, tube closure); and (b) cellular level activity is likely to have stochastic components that make it difficult to identify regional patterns of variation. Traditional approaches in cell biology or in the molecular genetic dissection of development have been less well-equipped to deal with these complexities.</p><p>To address this issue, Baldwin et al., describe an analysis pipeline that utilizes live optical imaging to capture cellular-level events within a morphogenetically-active tissue. Combining tiling and confocal imaging with large scale image analysis, the authors characterize patterns of cell shape change, subcellular F-actin and N-cadherin accumulation, in the neural tube of <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>. This addresses the challenge of capturing both cell- and tissue-level behaviours in a relatively large organism. They reveal a regional diversity of behaviours between the anterior and posterior neural tubes, which are also disparately affected when Shroom 3, a known regulator of neural tube development, is depleted.</p><p>I think that the major contribution of this paper is to introduce an approach to the large-scale imaging of tissues in a &quot;big&quot; vertebrate. The value is that the approach can extract cellular-level data, combined with regional information at the tissue level. And it can generate large numbers for good statistics. Although this has been done for smaller organisms, less progress has been made for larger samples. Another attraction of the approach is that the authors have used readily-available imaging technology and analysis tools. To be clear, I think that this is a valuable contribution for the field.</p><p>I am less certain of how much this paper represents in terms of new &quot;biological&quot; insight. The principal experimental intervention is <italic>Shroom3</italic> KO and this changes some of the patterns of correlation (between cell shape change, cadherin concentration and F-actin). But the current analysis doesn't help me better understand which of those changes responsible for the abnormal morphogenesis of the Shroom 3 phenotype. This is for the following reasons (which are inherent features of the approach):</p><p>i) A relatively limited number of molecular parameters are interrogated (F-actin and N-cadherin). It is possible, for example, that changes in contractility which drive junctional shortening (relevant for the analysis in Figure 10) are due to changes in actin organization (that may not be readily captured by overall measures of quantity) or activity of Myosin II (which is not measured here). Given the scale of the experiments that are involved, it would be technically challenging to interrogate more molecular players at the same time, but this is a potential limitation that should be acknowledged.</p><p>ii) The dynamics are relatively coarse-grained. For example, changes in cadherin levels that occur over hours may not capture changes in molecular turnover.</p><p>So, while I think that the paper will make a contribution that could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, I would ask the authors to consider the following issues.</p><p>Specific</p><p>1) I think that the authors sometimes draw their bow(s) a little too long. For example, it seems too much to conclude that &quot;the primary effect of shroom 3 in the anterior neural plate is …on the coupling of medial actomyosin …with medial N-cadherin accumulation&quot; (p 10, bottom). It is the most obvious change in their current data set, but that data set seems too limited to call it the &quot;primary effect&quot;.</p><p>2) Medial signals. How do the authors correct for noise in their analyses? Lifeact can also bind G-actin and some of the punctate N-cadherin-GFP could potentially be in vesicles rather than at the apical membrane.</p><p>3) Estimating molecular concentration. I may have missed this, but have the authors also done an analysis where they correct for change in size of the region analysed. For example, the medial N-cadherin increases with apical constriction (Figure 6), but is this because the apical surface is getting smaller (i.e. same amount of apical N-cadherin, but now more concentrated) or is there an increase in the total amount of protein in the apical surface?</p><p>4) Focus of the paper. The authors seemed to frame this manuscript as an effort to better understand the morphogenesis of the neural tube. But, as noted above, from that perspective I was disappointed. I think the paper may be better framed as a new analytical approach, which yields data of great richness for future work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Baldwin, Kim, and Wallingford describes an in-depth, robust analysis of cell morphology, actin dynamics, and N-cadherin distribution in the neural plate of <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>. This analysis further describes the role of <italic>Shroom3</italic> in the regulation or participation in these processes. This work represents an important study of the cellular dynamics associated with neural tube formation and identifies some fundamental differences between the anterior and posterior regions of the neural plate that may contribute to birth defects that occur in different regions of the neural tube. The work presented should have an impact in the areas of cell and tissue morphogenesis, methods for analysis of complex cell dynamics in the context of intact tissues/embryos, epithelial organization, and neural tube formation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the conclusions and interpretation are well supported by the detailed analysis of cellular and cytoskeletal dynamics during neural plate morphogenesis. It provides unique and valuable insights into the differences in cellular behavior in the anterior and posterior regions of the neural plate. This approach and level of analysis can help to set a standard for the combined use of Crispr, live cell imaging, and computational analysis to assess the function of specific proteins in dynamic processes in whole embryos.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My major concern is with the statement that the data presented advance our understanding of the mechanistic role for actin, <italic>Shroom3</italic>, N-cadherin, and contractility in apical constriction. This study shows beautiful and compelling correlative data that there is a, actin-<italic>Shroom3</italic>-N-cadherin network or pathway (or some other type of &quot;interaction&quot;) that is important. However, this does not seem to provide a mechanism beyond what has previously been shown in other studies. This, however, does not invalidate the significance of the work presented.</p><p>I think some of the points below might help to provide more mechanistic insights, if possible.</p><p>1. I have a concern with only using ectopically expressed N-cadherin-GFP to investigate it's function. If possible, it would be useful to have some data indicating that the endogenous N-cadherin behaves in a way that is similar to the exogenous protein. I appreciate these would likely have to be static images and this may not be possible based on the available reagents. At a minimum, it should be addressed in the text if not possible to address experimentally.</p><p>2. Is it possible, using the data that has already been collected, to assess the trafficking of the N-Cadherin? For instance, can the authors determine if the N-cadherin is moving from junctional to the medial locations, being trafficked directly to the medial membrane, is it being internalized from the medial region, or perhaps some other dynamic behavior. This could help provide more information regarding the mechanistic role of N-cadherin.</p><p>3. Along these same lines, do the authors know if the medial N-cadherin co-distributes with Myosin II, ppRLC, or Rho-kinase? It might be presumed to the case based on previous studies of apical constriction in other model systems, but it would be interesting to see if this is the case.</p><p>4. Similarly, it might also be useful to see the <italic>Shroom3</italic> distribution in the neural plate to determine if there is a population of <italic>Shroom3</italic> in medial positions analogous to N-cadherin. I think the sequence analysis provided is compelling but actually demonstrating reduced protein would strengthen the method.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>I had a difficult time interpreting some the 2D density plots in figure 10. I'm not sure if there is really a better way to simplify it without breaking the data out into several additional graphs. Perhaps a more detailed description in the methods would be helpful to the reader.</p><p>I'm curious why the 2D density plots in figure 6D and E have such dramatic edges? These look artificial and I wonder if this is just an issue with the PDF, thresholding, or some other technical issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66704.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to revisit their conclusions, which in places are overextended.

We have included a description of this in the main text (lines 149151) and included a diagram in Figure 1 figure supplement 1. As LifeAct cannot strictly distinguish between F-actin and G-actin, we have not distinguished between F-actin and G-actin in the manuscript. We now explicitly describe what we observed and our interpretation thereof. We now also report on the apicobasal position of N-cad relative to actin (lines 197-200, Figure 4) and we discuss the possible mechanisms of action for medial N-cad (Discussion, lines 448-462).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The non-junctional distribution of N-cadherin and its dynamic changes during apical constriction represent an exciting result. However, solely using ectopically expressed N-cadherin-GFP to investigate its function is not sufficient, as it may introduce overexpression artifacts. Please provide data corroborating that endogenous N-cadherin behaves similar to the exogenous protein. We appreciate that based on the available reagents (e.g. antibodies) this would likely represent static images. If this proves experimentally not possible, this should at a minimum be addressed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is crucial. We therefore examined this issue using immunostaining for endogenous Ncadherin. These experiments, presented in the new Figure 3 figure supplement 1 and lines 194-197 confirm our findings with N-cadherin-GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Could the current data be used to assess the trafficking of the N-Cadherin? For instance, can the authors determine if N-cadherin moving from junctional to medial locations, is being trafficked directly to the medial membrane, or being internalized from the medial region, or perhaps some other dynamic behavior. This could help provide more information regarding the mechanistic role of N-cadherin.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we do not have enough time resolution (1 frame per minute) to resolve the directionality of N-cadherin movement. However, we have shown some new images from our data that provide some insight into the relative apicobasal positioning of actin and N-cadherin (Figure 4), and we discuss the possibility of N-cad endocytosis (lines 197-203 and 448-462).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Does medial N-cadherin co-distribute with Myosin II, ppRLC, or Rho-kinase? Based on previous studies of apical constriction in other model systems this is an attractive assumption. This should be tested experimentally to support and mechanistically corroborate the correlation of molecular events and cell shape changed described in this manuscript. For instance, combine N-cadherin with a MyosinII, a GTP-Rho localization sensor (e.g. Bement lab) or the AHPH system (Piekny and Glotzer, 2008) reporter to generate relevant time-series.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are interesting experiments, but as the reviewers themselves point out in Point 14 (below), examining these additional markers is extremely daunting given the scale of each experiment here. Thus, we followed the advice in Point 14 and now clearly discuss this limitation of our approach and leave analysis of other markers for a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given that non-junctional N-cadherin has been associated with diverse cellular functions apart from adhesion, please discuss its possible role in this current context.</p></disp-quote><p>The possible roles for medial N-cad are now discussed in lines 448-462 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Support the functional inactivation of Shroom3: The sequence analysis provided is compelling but actually demonstrating reduced protein would strengthen the method.</p><p>What proportion of indels are 3 bp or multiple of 3, could resulting in-frame deletions or monoallelic indels explain for instance the 2 populations observed for instance in Fig5D, E?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there are no available antibodies that detect <italic>Shroom3</italic> protein in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (mouse antibodies do not cross-react). We hasten to add, however, that all aspects of the phenotype we observe with <italic>shroom3</italic> CRISPR recapitulate known phenotypes not only of <italic>shroom3</italic> morphants in <italic>Xenopus</italic> but also of dominant-negative <italic>shroom3</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and genetic mutants in mice. This explicitly stated now in the manuscript, and coupled to our sequence analysis, we hope these findings will satisfy the reviewers.</p><p>Regarding the proportions of indels and their relationship to phenotypes, we have no way of exploring this possibility. That said, as we now clarify in the revision on lines 236-239 and in Figure 5 figure supplement 1A, our sgRNA targets amino acid ~28 of the ~3000 amino acid <italic>Shroom3</italic> protein, making it unlikely that distinct change-of-function mutations could be introduced. We therefore feel it more appropriate not to speculate on the issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, please clarify which particular domain is targeted by the Shroom3 gRNA employed in this study? How is it expected to impair its function, e.g. complete loss of function, deletion of a specific functional domain? If the latter, could a truncated protein exert partial functions? How would this effect interactions with actin or N-cadherin and relate to the specific phenotypes observed?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in point 8, above, the sgRNA targets amino acid ~28 of the ~3000 amino acid <italic>Shroom3</italic> protein. This is substantially N-terminal to all defined domains in the protein. This is now stated on lines 236-239 and diagrammed in Figure 5 figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Shroom3 spatial expression: How is Shroom3 expressed throughout the extent of the anteroposterior neural epithelium, given that it seems to exert different effects in the anterior and posterior parts? Likewise, would be important to see the Shroom3 subcellular distribution in the neural plate to determine if there is a population of Shroom3 in medial positions analogous to N-cadherin.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Xenopus shroom3</italic> is expressed along the entire length of the closing <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural plate (Haigo et al., <italic>Current Biology</italic> 2003), as we now indicate on lines 86-88.</p><p>As for the protein localization, unfortunately no antibodies that detect <italic>Xenopus Shroom3</italic> are available. Compounding this problem, ectopic expression of wild-type <italic>Shroom3</italic> causes a severe gain-of-function phenotype in early embryos, eliciting strong apical constriction of blastomeres that precludes analysis of <italic>Shroom3</italic>-GFP localization at neural plate stages.</p><p>That said, ectopically expressed, tagged <italic>Shroom3</italic> clearly decorates the entire apical surface in diverse epithelial cell types (see Haigo, 2003; Lee et al., 2009), and this point is now made on lines 204-208 of the revision.</p><p>Finally, in a more direct attempt to attempt to address this concern, we took a cue from previous work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shroom, and we expressed a C-terminal (Rok-binding domain) truncation of <italic>Xenopus Shroom3</italic>.</p><p>We found his construct co-accumulates with both medial and junctional actin in the closing neural plate. These data are now discussed on lines 208-214 and shown in Figure 4 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Clarification of sample numbers and data integration of different samples: The samples included in this study and presented in Methods Appendix2 display apparent differences, therefore additional information is required for the number of samples that contribute to each analysis and how data were compared and/or integrated. For instance, the anterior samples show differences in cell size and asymmetries within the tissue. Please explain the reason for this and how is this accounted for when comparing quantifications between samples. This should include how staging between samples was achieved, and the related registration allowing comparison of resulting cell behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>Differences in cell size and fluorescent intensity arise from many sources: (a) staging, (b) natural variation, (c) variation arising from microinjection of mRNAs, etc. As such, we have focused not so much raw values of size and intensity, but rather in the changes in these values over time. Thanks to our cell tracking paradigm, we are able to mean-center and scale cell size and fluorescence parameters per individual cell track and convert measures of area and fluorescence (i.e. microns and arbitrary units) to standard deviations. Thus both within and between embryos, each cell is analyzed individually for relative changes in parameters over time and then integrated into the overall dataset. We have clarified this in the text on lines 157-164 and is additionally diagrammed in Figure 1 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, there seem to be only two posterior samples containing Shroom3 crispant cells, please describe the variability between samples, similar to above. If only two samples were interrogated, a third sample needs to be included. In general, the sample number per experiment should be greater than two.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included additional videos and analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Describing the data analysis. Please introduce in the Results a few sentences that explain the &quot;standardization&quot; approach that are used to present the data. While this is in the Methods and Appendix, the approach is not one commonly seen, and it would be good to orient readers less familiar with the approach.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in response to Point 10, we have improved the description of this method on lines 157164 of the main text and diagrammed the standardization in Figure 1 figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Facilitating the interpretation of some the 2D density plots in figure 10. Consider an alternative way or simplification of the graphs without breaking the data out into several additional graphs. If difficult, a more detailed description in the methods should be helpful to the reader and included.</p></disp-quote><p>We have broken out a large part of the data in Figure 10 (now Figure 11) to Figure 11 figure supplement 1 to aid with legibility. These data are now described in more detail and the original plots have now been annotated to guide the reader (Figure 11C, cyan ellipses). In addition, histograms have been extracted from different regions of the plots (Figure 11H) to provide more granular view of specific results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The 2D density plots in figure 6D and E have such sharp edges; they look artificial. Please check and address whether this is just an issue with the PDF, thresholding, or some other technical issue.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a technical issue with a background layer on the plots. This background layer has been removed in all density plots in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Discuss limitations inherent to the approach, including: (i) a relatively limited number of molecular parameters are interrogated (F-actin and N-cadherin). It is possible, for example, that changes in contractility which drive junctional shortening (relevant for the analysis in Figure 10) are due to changes in actin organization (that may not be readily captured by overall measures of quantity) or activity of Myosin II (which is not measured here). Given the scale of the experiments that are involved, it would be technically challenging to interrogate more molecular players at the same time, representing a potential limitation.</p><p>(ii) the dynamics are relatively coarse-grained. For example, changes in cadherin levels that occur over hours may not capture changes in molecular turnover.</p></disp-quote><p>Limitation of the approach are now discussed on lines 463-477.</p></body></sub-article></article>
