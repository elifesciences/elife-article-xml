three multispanning <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> inner membrane proteins in vivo using high-resolution force profile analysis. The force profiles show that the nascent chain is subjected to rapidly varying pulling forces during translation and reveal unexpected complexities in the membrane integration process. We find that an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain can fold in the ribosome exit tunnel before membrane integration starts, that charged residues and membrane-interacting segments such as re-entrant loops and surface helices flanking a transmembrane helix (TMH) can advance or delay membrane integration, and that point mutations in an upstream TMH can affect the pulling forces generated by downstream TMHs in a highly position-dependent manner, suggestive of residue-specific interactions between TMHs during the integration process. Our results support the ‘sliding’ model of translocon-mediated membrane protein integration, in which hydrophobic segments are continually exposed to the lipid bilayer during their passage through the SecYEG translocon.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>cotranslational</kwd><kwd>biogenesis</kwd><kwd>EmrE</kwd><kwd>GlpG</kwd><kwd>BtuC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017.0323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0032828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>621-2014-3713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Heijne</surname><given-names>Gunnar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM125063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmer</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller III</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Protein Factory 642863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicolaus</surname><given-names>Felix</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACI-1548562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miller III</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cotranslational membrane integration of three multispanning <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> inner membrane proteins is followed using force profile analysis, uncovering unexpected complexities in the membrane integration process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most integral membrane proteins are cotranslationally integrated into their target membrane with the help of translocons such as bacterial SecYEG and YidC, and the eukaryotic Sec61 and EMC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rapoport et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chitwood et al., 2018</xref>). While the energetics of translocon-mediated integration of a transmembrane α-helix (TMH) is reasonably well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hessa et al., 2007</xref>), the actual integration process is not, other than in general terms. We have shown that force profile analysis (FPA) – a method in which a translational arrest peptide (AP) engineered into a target protein serves as a sensor to measure the force exerted on a nascent polypeptide chain during translation – can be used to follow the cotranslational folding of soluble proteins and the membrane integration of a model TMH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ismail et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farías-Rico et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we have applied FPA and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to follow the cotranslational membrane integration of three multispanning <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> inner membrane proteins of increasing complexity (EmrE, GlpG, BtuC), providing the first residue-by-residue data on membrane protein integration in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Force profile analysis</title><p>FPA takes advantage of the ability of APs to bind in the upper parts of the ribosome exit tunnel and thereby pause translation when their last codon is in the ribosomal A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito and Chiba, 2013</xref>). The duration of an AP-induced pause is reduced in proportion to pulling forces exerted on the nascent chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kemp et al., 2020</xref>), that is, APs can act as force sensors and can be tuned by mutation to react to different force levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cymer et al., 2015a</xref>). In an FPA experiment, a series of constructs is made in which a force-generating sequence element (e.g., a TMH) is placed an increasing number of residues away from an AP (reflected in <italic>N</italic>, the number of residues from the start of the protein to the end of the AP), which in turn is followed by a C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In constructs where the TMH engages in an interaction that generates a strong enough pulling force <italic>F</italic> on the nascent chain at the point when the ribosome reaches the last codon of the AP, pausing will be prevented and mostly full-length protein will be produced during a short pulse with [<sup>35</sup>S]-Met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, middle). In contrast, in constructs where little force is exerted on the AP, pausing will be efficient and more of the arrested form of the protein will be produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left and right). The fraction full-length protein produced, <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> = <italic>I<sub>FL</sub></italic>/(<italic>I<sub>FL</sub>+I<sub>A</sub></italic>), where <italic>I<sub>FL</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>A</sub></italic> are the intensities of the bands representing the full-length (<italic>FL</italic>) and arrested (<italic>A</italic>) species on an SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), can therefore be used as a proxy for <italic>F</italic> in a given construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kemp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niesen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leininger et al., 2019</xref>). A plot of <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> versus <italic>N</italic> – a force profile (FP) – thus can provide a detailed picture of the cotranslational process in question, as reflected in the variation in the force exerted on the nascent chain during translation.

Unexpectedly, however, the E<sup>14</sup>L, E<sup>14</sup>A, and E<sup>14</sup>Q (but not the E<sup>14</sup>D) mutations in TMH1 increase <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> at <italic>N</italic> = 85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), showing that a negatively charged residue (D or E) in position 14 in TMH1 specifically reduces the pulling force generated by TMH2 at <italic>N</italic> = 85, that is, when about one-half of TMH2 has integrated into the membrane. Likewise, <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> values at <italic>N</italic> = 115 and 130 (but not at <italic>N</italic> = 105, included as a negative control) are specifically affected by mutations in E<sup>14</sup>: at <italic>N</italic> = 115 (one-half of TMH3 integrated), all four mutations in position 14 increase <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> relative to E<sup>14</sup>, while at <italic>N</italic> = 130 (beginning of TMH4 integration) the E<sup>14</sup>A and E<sup>14</sup>L mutations decrease <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). FPA thus reveals long-range effects of mutations in E<sup>14</sup> on three specific steps in the membrane integration of the downstream TMHs.

This could in principle affect the FP; however, because the C-terminal end of the LepB part is ≥70 residues away from the C-terminal end of the SecM AP in these constructs, LepB is far outside the ribosome exit tunnel and therefore unlikely to exert a strong effect. Indeed, <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> values for GlpG (calculated either including or excluding the slowly migrating band in <italic>I<sub>FL</sub></italic>) and LepB-GlpG are very similar in the peak III region (<italic>N</italic> = 166–231) of the FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>end</sub></italic> values for peaks II–VII are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>.</p><p>Peak I, at <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> ≈ 84 residues, is conspicuously close to what would be expected for the folding of the NTD from previous studies of cotranslational folding of small globular domains in the ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farías-Rico et al., 2018</xref>). To verify that the peak indeed represents folding of the NTD, we recorded an FP for the NTD by in vitro transcription-translation in the PURE system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shimizu et al., 2005</xref>) and further made a destabilizing point mutation (F<sup>16</sup>E) in the core of the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The FP obtained in vitro (magenta) overlaps peak I in the in vivo FP, and the mutation strongly reduces <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> values for peak I both in vivo (green) and in vitro (black). Given that the NTD has a relative contact order of 15% and is predicted to fold on the ms time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plaxco et al., 1998</xref>) while the elongation cycle on the ribosome takes ~100 ms/codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Young and Bremer, 1976</xref>), the NTD has ample time to equilibrate between the unfolded and accessible folded states at each elongation step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kemp et al., 2019</xref>).

The unexpectedly low <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> value for peak III seems to be caused by an upstream periplasmic surface helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>) (see below). Likewise, peak VI-a likely reflects the membrane integration of a hydrophobic, membrane-associated cytoplasmic segment located just upstream of TMH5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, the unexpectedly high <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> value for peak IV indicates that integration of TMH3 commences only when its N-terminal end is ~52 residues away from the PTC, possibly because of the tight spacing between TMH2 and TMH3.</p><p>As peak III saturates at <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> ≈ 0.9 over a rather wide range, we sought a more detailed view by using the strong SecM(<italic>Ec-</italic>Sup1) AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yap and Bernstein, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d</xref>, blue) and the medium-strong SecM(<italic>Ec-Ms</italic>) AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farías-Rico et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, green).

The SecM(<italic>Ec-Ms</italic>) FP reveals additional detail: peak III is now seen to be composed of three subpeaks III-a, III-b, and III-c. III-a has <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> = 182, coinciding with the N-terminal end of the periplasmic surface helix reaching 45 resides away from the PTC.

The major subpeak III-c at <italic>N</italic> ≈ 197–204 finally corresponds well to the peak seen in the SecM(<italic>Ec-</italic>Sup1) and the CGMD FPs, and therefore represents the membrane insertion of the most hydrophobic part of TMH2. Taken together, subpeaks III-b and III-c are reminiscent of the biphasic pulling force pattern previously recorded for a model hydrophobic transmembrane segment using the medium-strong SecM(<italic>Ms</italic>) AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>), which is closely related to the SecM(<italic>Ec-Ms</italic>) AP used here.</p><p>We further recorded a SecM(<italic>Ec-Ms</italic>) FP (magenta) for the triple mutation Y<sup>138</sup>F<sup>139</sup>L<sup>143</sup>→NNN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) that renders the periplasmic surface helix less hydrophobic: the mutation strongly reduces the amplitude of peak III-a, has only a small effect on peak III-b, and both reduces the amplitude and shifts <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> and <italic>N<sub>max</sub></italic> for peak III-c by approximately four residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,f</xref>).

Since it was not possible to provide an unequivocal match between the BtuC FP and the CGMD-FP (or HP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), we did two sets of controls. First, we chose constructs at or near peaks in the FP and CGMD-FP and mutated multiple hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Met) located 40–50 residues from the PTC to less hydrophobic Ala residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The mutation data allowed us to identify the membrane integration of TMHs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 with peaks I, II, III, IV, V, VIII, IX, X, and XI, respectively; the overlapping peaks VIII and IX appear to represent the concerted integration of the closely spaced TMH7 and TMH8.

To confirm these assignments, we obtained FPs for the isolated TMH2 (dashed green), TMH8 (dashed light blue), and TMH10 (dashed pink) sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) by introducing them into the periplasmic domain of LepB such that they maintained their natural N<sub>out</sub>-C<sub>in</sub> orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>); the FPs for the individual TMHs overlap the corresponding peaks II, IX, and XI in the full FP.

The low <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> value for the N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub>-oriented TMH5 in full-length BtuC may result from an early interaction between a positively charged patch (RFARRHLSTSR) just upstream of TMH5 and negatively charged lipid headgroups (note that only two of the four Arg residues are present in the ΔTMH1-TMH4 construct; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), while the low <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> values for peaks X and XI are likely caused by the short upstream hydrophobic segments LCGL and LAAALEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,f</xref>), similar to peak III in GlpG.</p><p>Remarkably, the N-terminal end of the isolated TMH2 is ~45 residues away from the PTC at <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic>, suggesting that upstream sequence elements present in full-length BtuC delay the integration of TMH2 by ~10 residues (compare II* and II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The most conspicuous feature in the upstream region of TMH2 is the presence of three positively charged Arg residues, an uncommon occurrence in a periplasmic loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heijne, 1986</xref>). Indeed, when these residues are replaced by uncharged Gln residues in LepB-BtuC, peak II (dashed black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,e</xref>) becomes almost identical to the FP for the isolated TMH2; a similar behavior is seen when the CGMD-FP simulation is run without an electrical membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Upstream positively charged residues thus delay the membrane integration of the N<sub>out</sub>-oriented TMH2, possibly because of the energetic cost of translocating them against the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ismail et al., 2015</xref>), or because they are temporarily retained in the negatively charged exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Neither peak VI nor VII seems to represent the integration of TMH6, but instead flanks the location expected from the CGMD-FP and HP and apparently corresponds, respectively, to the membrane insertion of a short periplasmic re-entrant helix and of a short cytoplasmic surface helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,h</xref>). Mutation of three hydrophobic residues to Ala in the latter significantly reduces the amplitude of peak VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, construct <italic>N</italic> = 259). Further, the FP for the isolated TMH6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,g</xref>, dashed dark blue) peaks in the location expected from the CGMD-FP, between peaks VI and VII, and the FP for the isolated TMH5-6 part that includes the re-entrant helix but lacks the downstream surface helix is intermediate between the LepB-BtuC and the TMH6 FPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, dashed green).

This is in agreement with the 'sliding’ model of TMH integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cymer et al., 2015b</xref>), which posits that N<sub>out</sub>-C<sub>in</sub> TMHs have continuous lipid contact as they slide across the membrane along the open lateral gate in the SecYEG translocon, while N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub> TMHs first partition into the cytoplasmic interface region of the membrane as they exit the ribosome (and therefore generate less pulling force than N<sub>out</sub>-C<sub>in</sub> TMHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cymer et al., 2014</xref>) and only insert across the membrane as their polar C-terminal flanking region translocates through the central translocon channel. In both cases, the TMHs are embedded in the membrane (albeit in perpendicular orientations) when their C-terminal end is ~45 residues from the PTC. In the sliding model, the translocon channel serves as a conduit for polar nascent chain segments while hydrophobic segments are always in contact with surrounding lipid, similar to what has been proposed for the YidC/Oxa1 translocon family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2020</xref>). The lateral gate region in the SecYEG translocon thus in a certain sense mimics the water–bilayer interface environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marx and Fleming, 2021</xref>).</p><p>We also find that the cytoplasmic NTD in GlpG folds already in the ribosome exit tunnel, before the first TMH has been synthesized. Further, the FPs for EmrE, GlpG, and BtuC to a first approximation match those predicted by CGMD calculations, but uncover a much richer picture of the membrane integration process where charged residues and membrane-interacting segments such as re-entrant loops and surface helices flanking a TMH show prominent interactions with the translocon and surrounding lipid. Finally, point mutations in EmrE TMH1 affect the pulling force generated by downstream TMHs in a highly position-dependent manner, suggestive of residue-specific interactions between TMHs during the membrane integration process.

The nascent protein interacts with the Sec translocon and the ribosome via pairwise interactions that depend on the hydrophobicity and charge of the beads of the nascent protein. The interaction parameters are unchanged from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Niesen et al., 2017</xref>). The lateral gate of the translocon switches between the open and closed conformations with probability dependent on the difference in free energy between the two conformations. The structures of the ribosome and translocon are based on cryo-EM structures and, aside from the lateral gate of the translocon, are fixed in place during the simulations. The lipid bilayer and cytosol are modeled implicitly. The positions of the nascent protein beads are evolved using overdamped Langevin dynamics with a timestep of 300 ns and a diffusion coefficient of 253 nm<sup>2</sup>/s. Membrane potentials are included by adding an electrostatic energy term to the simulations, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niesen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To simulate protein translation, new amino acids are added to the nascent chain at a rate of five amino acids per second. Simulations of EmrE, GlpG, and BtuC begin with 12 amino acids translated. Translation continues until the nascent protein reaches the desired length, at which point translation is halted and forces on the C-terminus of the nascent chain are measured every 3 ms for 6 s. This methodology has been found to accurately reproduce experimental FPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niesen et al., 2018</xref>). Forces are measured starting at a nascent protein length of 18 amino acids for EmrE and BtuC, and 70 for GlpG. The computational force profile (CGMD-FP) is then obtained by measuring the forces at lengths incremented by four amino acids. Simulations at different lengths are performed independently and repeated 100 times. Because the ribosomal exit tunnel is truncated in the CGMD model, a shift in the protein index is required to compare simulated and experimental results. Shifts of −12, –5, and −5 residues are used for EmrE, GlpG, and BtuC CGMD-FPs, respectively. The shifts are estimated by aligning the computational and experimental FPs and are in line with what is expected given the length of the truncated exit tunnel. Variation in the shift may reflect different degrees of compaction of the nascent chain. Although previous work provides a framework to estimate the experimentally observed fraction full length from simulated forces given a specific AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niesen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tian et al., 2018</xref>), forces are reported directly to facilitate comparison between experiments performed with different APs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Protein contact order calculation</title><p>The relative contact order for the GlpG NTD was calculated using the Contact Order server at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depts.washington.edu/">https://depts.washington.edu/</ext-link>bakerpg/contact_order/contact_order.cgi.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Rickard Hedman (Stockholm University) for programming and maintenance of the EasyQuant software.

I have included the full comments of the reviewers for your consideration. However, these need not be addressed in detail in your the response accompanying the submission of your revised manuscript.</p><p>There are a number of technical issues that need to be addressed in a revised text including conclusions that need to be adjusted. If co-translational folding of polypeptide segments in the ribosome tunnel can affect the integration process (which the authors claim occurs), in some cases it is problematic to use Lep fusions to solve technical issues with detection. In those cases, the native polypeptide is no longer the context for this detection issue.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could show the force profiles are unaffected by the presence of the fusion proteins? Of course, if the results are affected then the conclusions should be changed accordingly.</p><p>However, it may be difficult to show this convincingly given the use of Lep with Btu to allow an interpretation of the protein band pattern. The implication is that Lep affects the process of either integration or folding. Further, the authors claim sequences upstream of the N-terminus may affect integration by co-translational folding as in the case of the NTD region in GlpG. Thus the replacement of Lep for such sequences may interfere with the folding/integration process.</p><p>Given the von Heijne group's previous good agreement with MD simulations, perhaps this could approach could be used to access the divergence from native behavior.</p><p>Perhaps the current analysis would be acceptable for the constructs that are sufficiently long (For GlpP, N&gt;120; a 58-residue-long LepB portion is completely exposed outside the ribosome and does not engage with SecY). GlpP is probably fine in this regard because LepB-fused constructs are N=131-224. Of course, LepB has a membrane anchor, and we don't know how that might have affected FP of GlpP. They might have some native GlpG data besides those with multiple bands, which might be useful. For BtuC, they show at least some data without LepB fusion (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). This is nice particularly because these are shorter constructs, which could have been more affected by LepB. Nevertheless, the potential caveats in their interpretations bear correction.</p><p>It may be helpful to include raw images and some clarification regarding statistics for the experiments where there were only 2 biological replicates..</p><p>The major issues summarized above may be addressed by the authors without additional experiments. Reviewer #1 offers additional experimental tests, but they are not considered essential for a satisfactory revision of this most interesting work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Nicolaus et al. followed the co-translational integration of three multi-spanning membrane proteins using force profile (FP) analysis, the method previously pioneered by the von Heijne group. This approach uses a C-terminal fusion of a translation arrest peptide to either soluble or membrane proteins of varying truncations. Folding or membrane integration of the nascent chain produces a pulling force, which can be read out from how efficiently the arrest peptide causes translational stalling. Previously the group has analyzed membrane insertion of model single transmembrane helices (TMHs) in detail (Ismail et al., 2012). Now they extended the approach to multi-spanning (and more native) membrane proteins, namely EmrE, GlpG, and BtuC. The authors concluded that their data support the so-called &quot;sliding&quot; model for TMH integration, where each TMH slides down along the open lateral gate of the SecYEG channel. They also present several interesting observations, such as effects of charged residues, re-entrant loops, and surface helices on the timings of TMS integration, although these would require more data to be generalized.</p><p>A main weakness of the study is its exclusive reliance on the FP analysis. Coarse-grained MD simulations were also used but rather to confirm observations from the FP analysis. A limitation of the FP analysis is that it only monitors (indirectly) an insertion of the last TMH which is near the SecYEG channel. The analysis does not address what would happen to earlier TMHs (such as folding of TMD, delayed insertion, or possible flipping of TMs) as the polypeptide grows. A second weakness would be that the study adds only rather minor updates (effects of charged residues, re-entrant loops, and surface helices) to the previous model.</p><p>Despite the weaknesses, this work provides useful insights and resources to the field, and therefore I consider it to be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with revision. Membrane integration of multi-spanning membrane proteins is a still poorly understood process, largely because there are only very few experimental tools available for researchers to follow the process. The authors' analysis is generally of high quality, and their interpretations are reasonable.</p><p>1) The current version of the manuscript is probably difficult for scientists outside the field to follow. It would be better to extend Introduction to provide non-experts with more background information about the pathway, such as the general model for the SecYEG-mediated protein translocation and membrane integration, what is known about membrane protein integration, and what are main questions to address.</p><p>2) As in Point #1, a cartoon figure showing the &quot;sliding&quot; model described in Discussion would be helpful to improve readability.</p><p>3) Regarding Point #2. Although the authors did not explicitly mention this, the model opposed to the sliding model would be the &quot;in-out&quot; model, where the TMS first goes down along the translocation pore and then partitions into the lipid phase through the open lateral gate. However, in my opinion, mechanistic differences between the two models are rather small, and a boundary between the lateral gate and pore is not clear-cut (also, lipids can partially insert acyl tails into the open lateral gate and contact the polypeptide chain in the pore). The authors should clearly describe why the data fits into the &quot;sliding&quot; model not the &quot;in-out&quot; model. Also &quot;slide along the open lateral gate&quot; is unclear. It is possible that the TMH stays just outside the lateral gate while it slides across the membrane (similar to structures seen in studies of translocation intermediates containing TMHs or signal sequences).</p><p>4) In the previous study by Ismail et al., a bi-phasic pulling force has been observed. In the current study, the FPs do not seem to clearly show such a biphasic pattern.

I have included the full comments of the reviewers for your consideration. However, these need not be addressed in detail in your the response accompanying the submission of your revised manuscript.</p><p>There are a number of technical issues that need to be addressed in a revised text including conclusions that need to be adjusted. If co-translational folding of polypeptide segments in the ribosome tunnel can affect the integration process (which the authors claim occurs), in some cases it is problematic to use Lep fusions to solve technical issues with detection. In those cases, the native polypeptide is no longer the context for this detection issue.</p><p>Perhaps the authors could show the force profiles are unaffected by the presence of the fusion proteins? Of course, if the results are affected then the conclusions should be changed accordingly.</p><p>However, it may be difficult to show this convincingly given the use of Lep with Btu to allow an interpretation of the protein band pattern. The implication is that Lep affects the process of either integration or folding. Further, the authors claim sequences upstream of the N-terminus may affect integration by co-translational folding as in the case of the NTD region in GlpG. Thus the replacement of Lep for such sequences may interfere with the folding/integration process.</p><p>Given the von Heijne group's previous good agreement with MD simulations, perhaps this could approach could be used to access the divergence from native behavior.</p><p>Perhaps the current analysis would be acceptable for the constructs that are sufficiently long (For GlpP, N&gt;120; a 58-residue-long LepB portion is completely exposed outside the ribosome and does not engage with SecY). GlpP is probably fine in this regard because LepB-fused constructs are N=131-224. Of course, LepB has a membrane anchor, and we don't know how that might have affected FP of GlpP. They might have some native GlpG data besides those with multiple bands, which might be useful. For BtuC, they show at least some data without LepB fusion (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). This is nice particularly because these are shorter constructs, which could have been more affected by LepB. Nevertheless, the potential caveats in their interpretations bear correction.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ concerns regarding the possible effects of the LepB fusions that we were forced (by expression issues) to make to a certain number of GlpG constructs (<italic>N</italic> = 131-224) and all of the BtuC constructs. However, we are confident that the LepB part does not have a strong effect on the FPs, for the following reasons:</p><p>1) For the LepB-GlpG (<italic>N</italic> = 131-224) constructs, the segment between Lep TMH1 and GlpG TMH1 is always 71 residues, and the C-terminal end of the LepB part is ≥70 residues away from the PTC and hence far out of the ribosome tunnel. LepB is therefore unlikely to affect the FP in the region of peak II and in longer constructs. Likewise, had the NTD been present instead of the LepB part in these constructs, its C-terminal end would also have been ≥ 70 residues away from the PTC, while its folding transition (as seen in the FP) is completed already when the C-terminal end is ~40 residues from the PTC (construct <italic>N</italic> = 101, Figure 3B).</p><p>2) For the BtuC constructs, the N-terminal LepB fusion part is 177 residues long, and LepB TMH1 is 155 residues away from the N terminus of the BtuC part. The ~150-residue fragment from the LepB periplasmic domain is unlikely to be able to fold, as it does not represent any compact subdomain in the protein. LepB is therefore unlikely to affect the BtuC FP in any major way.</p><p>3) Finally, we have been able to measure some points on the GlpG and BtuC FPs both for the wildtype protein and for the corresponding LepB fusions. As can be seen in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A (for GlpG) and the already submitted Figure 4—figure supplement 1B (for BtuC), while the <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> values are not completely identical, the shapes of the FPs are only minimally affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may be helpful to include raw images and some clarification regarding statistics for the experiments where there were only 2 biological replicates..</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a gallery of gels from repeat experiment for all three proteins in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We haven’t included all gels, as the total number of lanes would be ~1,400 (including all repeats). The statistics for the GlpG constructs for which we only have duplicate measurements is now discussed in Materials and methods. All individual <italic>f<sub>FL</sub></italic> measurements are included in the Supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major issues summarized above may be addressed by the authors without additional experiments. Reviewer #1 offers additional experimental tests, but they are not considered essential for a satisfactory revision of this most interesting work.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The current version of the manuscript is probably difficult for scientists outside the field to follow. It would be better to extend Introduction to provide non-experts with more background information about the pathway, such as the general model for the SecYEG-mediated protein translocation and membrane integration, what is known about membrane protein integration, and what are main questions to address.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not very fond of wordy Introductions and Discussions, and probably err on the short side from time to time. Maybe we’ve read Strunk and White a few times too many: “Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.” We’ll be happy to discuss this further, if you want.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As in Point #1, a cartoon figure showing the &quot;sliding&quot; model described in Discussion would be helpful to improve readability.</p><p>3) Regarding Point #2. Although the authors did not explicitly mention this, the model opposed to the sliding model would be the &quot;in-out&quot; model, where the TMS first goes down along the translocation pore and then partitions into the lipid phase through the open lateral gate. However, in my opinion, mechanistic differences between the two models are rather small, and a boundary between the lateral gate and pore is not clear-cut (also, lipids can partially insert acyl tails into the open lateral gate and contact the polypeptide chain in the pore). The authors should clearly describe why the data fits into the &quot;sliding&quot; model not the &quot;in-out&quot; model. Also &quot;slide along the open lateral gate&quot; is unclear. It is possible that the TMH stays just outside the lateral gate while it slides across the membrane (similar to structures seen in studies of translocation intermediates containing TMHs or signal sequences).</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered this suggestion, but feel that putting too much emphasis on the “sliding model” would risk turning the paper into a discussion of the pros and cons of different models rather than providing a first overview of what kinds of fine-level details of the co-translational membrane integration process that FP analysis may offer. We’ll be happy to discuss this further, if you want.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the previous study by Ismail et al., a bi-phasic pulling force has been observed. In the current study, the FPs do not seem to clearly show such a biphasic pattern. Can the authors discuss about this?</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous study, the biphasic pulling force was not resolved with the weak SecM(<italic>Ec</italic>) AP, and the first of the two peaks was hardly visible with the strong SecM(<italic>Ec</italic>-Sup1) AP. The 2-peak pattern was most clearly seen with the medium-strong SecM(<italic>Ms</italic>) AP (with peaks at <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> ≈ 27+19=46 residues and <italic>N<sub>start</sub></italic> ≈ 35+19=54 residues). Referring to Figure 3D, it is thus possible that peak III-b in the SecM(<italic>Ec-Ms</italic>) FP (green) is in fact the first peak in a biphasic peak generated by TMH2. We now mention this possibility in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For some observations, the authors simply say further studies will be required to understand (for instance, long-range residue-residue interactions). Instead, the authors should at least provide a possible explanation or propose a testable hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>At this point, our best guess is that these patterns in the EmrE FPs are explained by specific interactions between E14 in TMH1 and (polar?) residues in downstream TMHs, as stated in the manuscript. Obviously, we will try to identify such interactions in future studies. We have, however, ventured a speculative explanation for how the periplasmic surface helix located just upstream of GlpG TMH2 may affect the FP recorded for the latter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) “Likewise, peak VI-a likely reflects the membrane integration of a hydrophobic, membrane-associated cytoplasmic segment located just upstream of TMH5, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B.

Specifically, FPA has been shown to give results fully consistent with results obtained by real-time FRET and NMR (JMB 431:1308). Small domains have been shown to be able to fold completely inside the exit tunnel, and the NTD is small enough that it should be able to fit in the distal part of the tunnel. Moreover, as now mentioned in the text, the folding time that can be predicted for the NTD based on its “relative contact order” is ~1 msec, while the elongation cycle on the ribosome takes ~100 msec/codon. The NTD should thus be able to equilibrate between the unfolded and accessible folded states between each elongation step during ongoing translation, just as it will have time to equilibrate when the ribosome pauses on the last codon of the AP. Finally, the NTD peak in Figure 3B is seen both in vivo and in vitro, i.e, in experiments that are carried out in quite different ways.</p></body></sub-article></article>
