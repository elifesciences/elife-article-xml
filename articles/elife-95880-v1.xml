Several possibilities, including myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones, may explain this. However, the precise mechanisms remain controversial. Utilizing the Hoxb5 reporter system to prospectively isolate long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), we found that young and aged LT-HSCs co-transplanted into the same recipients demonstrated nearly equivalent myeloid lineage output, contrary to the theory of myeloid-biased HSC clones. Transcriptomics indicated no significant myeloid gene enrichment in aged LT-HSCs compared to their young counterparts. Instead, transplanting reconstituted young HSCs with the ratio of LT/ST-HSCs seen in aged mice can significantly skew the lineage output to myeloid cells. In addition, while the niche environment in the bone marrow minimally affects myeloid-biased hematopoiesis, aged thymi and spleens substantially hinder lymphoid hematopoiesis, resulting in further myeloid domination. Thus, we demonstrate that myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in aged mice originates due to alteration of the ratio between LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs rather than in heterogeneous HSC clones with various cell fates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>long-term hematopoietic stem cell</kwd><kwd>short-term hematopoietic stem cell</kwd><kwd>self-renewal</kwd><kwd>myeloid

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jones and Rando, 2011</xref>). In the hematopoietic system, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which possess self-renewal capacity and multipotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spangrude et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weissman and Shizuru, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Majeti et al., 2007</xref>), are responsible for various hematopoietic alterations with age, such as reduced self-renewal capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morrison et al., 1996</xref>) and myeloid-biased hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller-Sieburg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Challen et al., 2010</xref>) due to their functional decline. For example, myeloid-biased hematopoiesis potentially reduces response to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webster, 2000</xref>), reduces vaccination efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crooke et al., 2019</xref>), and increases myeloid malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossi et al., 2008</xref>) in aged individuals. To comprehend these age-associated physiological changes, myeloid-biased hematopoiesis has been studied in considerable detail.</p><p>Based on the experimental observation that transplantation of aged HSCs exhibits more myeloid-biased differentiation in young recipient mice than transplantation of young HSCs, this phenotype has been thought to originate in cell-intrinsic changes in the HSC compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Haan and Lazare, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz and Sinclair, 2016</xref>). A myeloid-biased phenotype after aged HSC transplantation leads to the suggestion that myeloid-biased HSC clones selectively expand with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). Transcriptome and epigenetic analyses showing that a set of genes related to myeloid differentiation is significantly enriched in aged HSCs compared to young HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grover et al., 2016</xref>) further supports this hypothesis.</p><p>On the other hand, some reports support a different point of view in light of experimental evidence showing that aged lymphoid-biased HSCs still demonstrate the same level of lymphopoiesis as their younger counterparts, despite exhibiting a myeloid-biased gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>). This result highlights the limitations of predicting a pattern of HSC differentiation based upon gene expression patterns. Moreover, myeloid progenitors such as granulocyteâmacrophage progenitor (GMP) and common myeloid progenitor (CMP) should also increase with age if the selective expansion of myeloid-biased HSCs leads to an increase of myeloid cells in peripheral blood (PB). However, the increment of such progenitors with age was not consistently demonstrated in earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rundberg Nilsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Min et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, a mathematical model demonstrated that aging had no effect on the daily production of CMP supplied from multipotent progenitors (MPPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Busch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorshkind et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As such, while selective expansion of myeloid-biased HSC clones is the most widely accepted hypothesis to explain myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mejia-Ramirez and Florian, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">SanMiguel et al., 2020</xref>), other mechanisms may exist in light of the inconsistent cellular behavior of progenitor fractions relative to HSCs. To the best of our knowledge, no reports have analyzed kinetics of age-associated changes in HSCs, progenitors, and PB cells simultaneously. Therefore, we started our investigation by examining the correlation between age-related changes in PB and bone marrow (BM) to shed light on the mechanism underlying myeloid-biased hematopoiesis that occurs during aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The discrepancy of age-associated alternation in PB and BM cells into question the existence of a myeloid-biased clone</title><p>Mouse HSC research on aging has used mice aged 18 months or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Challen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rundberg Nilsson et al., 2016</xref>). However, given that continuous accumulation of cellular stress with age causes a gradual decline of cellular functions, a comprehensive analysis from young to old mice is necessary to unravel mechanisms by which age-associated, myeloid-biased hematopoiesis progresses. Hence, we analyzed changes in PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) at multiple time points from young to old mice. These results showed that the percentage of myeloid cells began to change as early as 6 months in mice and continued to increase at a constant rate until the age of â¥23 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive analysis of hematopoietic alternations with age shows a discrepancy of age-associated changes between peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average frequency of myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes) and lymphoid cells (B cells, T cells, and NK cells) in PB at the age of 2 and 3 months (<italic>n</italic> = 6), 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 6), 12 and 13 months (<italic>n</italic> = 6), 18 months (<italic>n</italic> = 6), 20 and 21 months (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and â¥23 months (<italic>n</italic> = 16).

According to this hypothesis, age-associated myeloid hematopoiesis progression in PB would be paralleled by an increase in myeloid-biased HSC clones. Therefore, we examined the frequency of the HSC and progenitor fractions in the BM at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We found that the frequency of immunophenotypically defined HSC in BM rapidly increased up to the age of 12 months. After the age, the rate of increase in their frequency appeared to slow down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, in contrast to what we anticipated, the frequency of GMP was stable, and the percentage of CMP actually decreased significantly with age, defying our prediction that the frequency of components of the myeloid differentiation pathway, such as CMP, GMP, and megakaryocyteâerythrocyte progenitor (MEP), may increase in aged mice, if myeloid-biased HSC clones increase with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we determined the ratio of each fraction in young mice versus aged mice to compare the age-associated transition pattern of components comprising the myeloid differentiation pathway.

First, we revisited our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), which demonstrated that transplanted ST-HSCs maintain lymphocyte production while rapidly losing myeloid lineage production in recipients. This result may potentially indicate the presence of HSC clones with a preference for lymphoid differentiation. Given that donor cells obtained from primary recipients receiving ST-HSCs do not undergo hematopoiesis in secondary transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), it is likely that all ST-HSCs have already lost their ability to self-renew and have disappeared from the HSC fraction in primary recipients. To confirm this, we transplanted 10 LT-HSCs or ST-HSCs and then analyzed PB and BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), donor-derived hematopoiesis eventually becomes lymphocyte dominant in PB of ST-HSC recipients over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Subsequently, it was determined that the vast majority of T cell subsets are memory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). In addition, unlike recipients receiving LT-HSCs, recipients receiving ST-HSCs lacked any bulk-HSCs in their BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). These results strongly suggest that lymphoid-biased hematopoiesis observed after transplantation of ST-HSCs is due to persistence of memory-type lymphocytes in PB, rather than to de novo lymphopoiesis from lymphoid-biased HSC clones. Persistence of memory-type lymphocytes from ST-HSCs may have led us to misinterpret mechanisms underlying myeloid-biased hematopoiesis after aged bulk-HSC transplantation. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the kinetics of the LT-HSC/ST-HSC ratio in the bulk-HSC population, revealing the ratio of ST-HSC to LT-HSC decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The memory-type lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (PB) make it look as if short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) are lymphoid-biased hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design for assessing the lineage output of young long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) or ST-HSCs.

This difference indicated that other intrinsic or extrinsic factors might exist in mice older than 23 months to promote myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. To investigate this further, we transplanted 10 GFP<sup>+</sup> young LT-HSCs into young or 2-year-old recipient mice and examined their PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We limited the observation period to 12 weeks because many aged recipient mice had died prior to that point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

These results indicate that the process of lymphoid lineage differentiation is impaired in the spleens and thymi of aged mice compared to young mice, or that differentiating cells in the BM do not successfully migrate into these secondary lymphoid organs.

This process has been linked to an increase in myeloid-biased HSC clones in the bulk-HSC fraction identified by surface antigens through aging. By isolating LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs, respectively, we discovered that age-related changes in the ratio of ST-HSCs to LT-HSCs in bulk-HSCs are responsible for myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.</p><p>When aged bulk-HSCs were transplanted into young mice, post-transplant hematopoiesis in recipient mice was significantly biased toward myeloid in PB compared to transplantation of young bulk-HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beerman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dykstra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sudo et al., 2000</xref>). Historically, this myeloid-biased hematopoiesis derived from aged bulk-HSCs has been considered as evidence supporting expansion of myeloid-biased HSC clones with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haan and Lazare, 2018</xref>). Other studies suggest that blockage of lymphoid hematopoiesis in aged mice results in myeloid-skewed hematopoiesis through alternative mechanisms. However, this result should be interpreted carefully, since Busulfan was used for myeloablative treatment in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>). To clarify the cause for this disparity, we chose to examine the LT-HSC fraction, which persists in the BM for long periods of time and is enriched for aging-related alterations. We discovered that post-transplant hematopoiesis of aged LT-HSCs did not vary from that of young LT-HSCs in terms of differentiation capacity. Expression of myeloid-related genes was not significantly altered when LT-HSCs from young and aged mice were compared. Therefore, we inferred that age-related myeloid-biased hematopoiesis cannot be attributed to an increase in myeloid-biased HSCs, at least among LT-HSCs. Given that bulk-HSCs consist of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs, and that LT-HSCs exhibit no change in differentiation potential with age, we hypothesized that ST-HSCs may be responsible for the myeloid-skewing phenotype in PB. Transcriptomic analysis revealed no enrichment of myeloid-related genes in the ST-HSC fraction, ruling out the possibility of an increase in myeloid-biased HSCs in the ST-HSC fraction. Alternatively, we observed a proportionate decrease in ST-HSCs in bulk-HSCs accompanying an increase in LT-HSCs. We postulated that this relative decrease in ST-HSC ratio is responsible for myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. When isolated LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs from young mice were reconstituted to replicate an aged BM type in terms of the LT-HSC/ST-HSC ratio, we discovered that PB was strongly skewed toward myeloid cells after transplantation of reconstituted HSCs. In contrast, transplantation of reconstituted HSCs with a young BM type resulted in a significantly lymphoid-skewed PB profile.</p><p>On the other hand, it has been reported that myeloid-biased HSCs have a more persistent capacity for self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller-Sieburg et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, in our prior investigation comparing PB 16 weeks post-transplant, myeloid cell production in PB was greater when LT-HSCs were transplanted, while ST-HSC transplantation resulted in a considerable increase in lymphoid cell production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). It is therefore possible that the LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs we isolated utilizing the Hoxb5 reporter system are myeloid- and lymphoid-biased HSCs, respectively. However, the myeloid-producing capacity of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs 4 weeks post-transplantation is equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, 16 weeks after transplantation, ST-HSC transplant recipients demonstrate negligible myeloid development and a predominance of lymphocytes, unlike LT-HSC transplant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). These characteristics show that early post-transplant ST-HSCs lack the phenotypic of lymphoid-biased HSCs. When ST-HSC-transplanted BM cells are employed as donors for secondary transplantation, no donor-cell-derived hematopoiesis is detected in recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, HSCs are not observed in the BM following transplantation of ST-HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results indicate that ST-HSCs lose their capacity for self-renewal earlier after transplantation than LT-HSCs. In addition, phenotypic examination of lymphocytes in PB after ST-HSC transplantation revealed that nearly all of them were memory cells, and that there was no de novo supply of T cells. In other words, ST-HSCs may have been erroneously classified as lymphoid-biased HSCs due to the preservation of memory lymphocytes with a long half-life in the peripheral circulation, despite the absence of de novo hematopoiesis following transplantation of ST-HSCs. These findings suggest that the bias toward myeloid and lymphoid lineages in post-transplant PB is not regulated by heterogeneity of multipotency, but by heterogeneity of self-renewal capacity.</p><p>Multiple extrinsic factors have been implicated as HSC-independent causes of myeloid-biased hematopoiesis associated with aging. Some findings suggest that cell interaction with niche cells in BM is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pinho et al., 2018</xref>), whereas others claim that chronic inflammation in aged mice lowers production of lymphoid progenitors and induces myeloid-biased hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montecino-Rodriguez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ergen et al., 2012</xref>). To identify HSC-independent causes of myeloid-biased hematopoiesis specifically, we transplanted young LT-HSCs into young or aged mice. Cellular differentiation observed in BM revealed that proportions of GMP, MEP, and CLP are unchanged between young and aged recipients. In contrast, an examination of spleens and thymi, the sites of lymphocyte maturation, revealed the absence of donor cells in aged recipients. These findings suggest that myeloid cells increase in aging mice due to a relative decrease in the ratio of mature lymphocytes in PB, resulting from inhibition of lymphocyte maturation outside the BM, such as in the thymus and spleen, rather than a significant change in cell differentiation caused by the intramedullary environment. Attempts have been made in the past to restore thymus function in aged mice by administering keratinocyte growth factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossi et al., 2007b</xref>). Indeed, in aged mice, lymphocyte hematopoiesis recovers, which is consistent with our results that the extramedullary environment influences the myeloid-bias phenotype in PB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossi et al., 2007b</xref>).</p><p>It has been clinically documented that recovery of the lymphocyte fraction in PB is delayed in elderly donors, compared to young donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">GonzÃ¡lez-Vicent et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baron et al., 2006</xref>). Although it is undeniable that this phenomenon may be due to decreased HSC hematopoietic potential, it may also be due to a change in the ratio of LT-HSC/ST-HSCs in bulk-HSCs, as described in our report, which may give the appearance of a myeloid bias in PB after transplantation. It has also been noted that lymphocyte recovery is delayed in elderly patients compared to younger patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van der Maas et al., 2021</xref>). Age-related loss in thymus and spleen functions has been recorded in humans, implying that the same mechanism is acting as in our mouse observations. If it is possible to assess and regulate the LT-HSC/ST-HSC ratio in donors and thymus/spleen function in recipients in the future, it will help to develop accurate models for predicting lymphocyte recovery after transplantation as well as new transplantation strategies.</p><p>In contrast, our findings should be considered in light of some limitations. In this report, we primarily performed 10â20 cell transplantation assays. Therefore, the current theory should be revalidated using single-cell technology with lineage tracing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodriguez-Fraticelli et al., 2020</xref>). This approach will investigate changes in the self-renewal capacity of individual HSCs and their subsequent differentiation into progenitor cells and PB cells. In the co-transplantation assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the myeloid lineage output derived from young and aged LT-HSCs was comparable (young LT-HSC: 51.4â¯ Â± â¯31.5% vs. aged LT-HSC: 47.4 â¯Â±â¯ 39.0%, p = 0.82). Although no significant difference was detected, the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 8) may limit the sensitivity of the assay to detect subtle myeloid-biased phenotypes. Additionally, in this study, we purified LT-HSCs using the Hoxb5 reporter system and employed a moderate conditioning regimen (8.7 Gy). To have a better picture of total donor contribution, total PB chimerism is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref> and we cannot exclude the possibility that these factors may have influenced the results. Therefore, it would be ideal to validate our findings using alternative LT-HSC markers and different conditioning regimens.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that the ratio of LT-HSC/ST-HSC is important in age-related myeloid-skewed hematopoiesis as an HSC-dependent factor and that aging-related thymus and spleen dysfunction also contributes significantly as an HSC-independent factor. Furthermore, here we propose a âself-renewal heterogeneity modelâ as a new mechanism for hematopoietic heterogeneity, including myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In addition to this report, we have also shown that cellular differentiation in the PB after transplantation can vary by changing transplantation conditions, ultimately altering self-renewal ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sakamaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishi et al., 2022</xref>). This highlights the significance of deciphering molecular processes that regulate the heterogeneity of HSC self-renewal capacity, which will help to provide a better understanding of the hematopoietic system and the hematopoietic hierarchy in the future.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Our new model: self-renewal heterogeneity model.</title><p>It has been thought that there were myeloid (My-) or lymphoid biased (Ly-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and that clonal selection of My-HSCs caused age-associated myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. However, in our model, long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) represent unbiased hematopoiesis throughout life. Short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) lose their hematopoietic ability within a short period, and memory-type lymphocytes remain in the peripheral blood (PB) after ST-HSC transplantation. These remaining memory-type lymphocytes make it look as if ST-HSCs are lymphoid-biased (the upper section). As a result, the age-associated relative decrease of ST-HSCs in bulk-HSC fraction causes myeloid-biased hematopoiesis with age. Additionally, the blockage of lymphoid differentiation at the spleen and thymus accelerates further myeloid-biased hematopoiesis in aged mice (the lower section).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95880-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 8âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of donor chimerism in whole blood cells for each transplantation assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Donor chimerism analysis related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E</xref>.

Cells were passed through 100 and 40 Î¼m strainers (Corning). Isolated thymocytes and splenocytes were incubated on ice for 30 min with appropriately diluted antibodies in staining buffer. Identification of B cells in spleens and T cells in thymi was performed by staining with antibodies described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Prior to flow cytometry or cell sorting, samples were stained with SYTOX Red Dead Cell Stain (Life Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tissue imaging</title><p>Freshly dissected spleens and thymi were fixed in 4% PFA (Nacalai tesque) in PBS for 24 hr at 4Â°C. After PFA washout with PBS, tissues were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 hr at 4Â°C, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek), and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serial 10 Î¼m longitudinal cryostat sections were obtained using CryoStar NX50 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 Î¼g/ml, Roche). To reduce autofluorescence, tissue sections were treated with Vector TrueVIEW autofluorescence quenching kit (Vector Laboratories). Images were obtained from Leica TCS SP8 (Leica).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cleaned up using RNeasy MinElute columns (QIAGEN). cDNA libraries were prepared from bulk-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and LT-HSCs using a KAPA RNA HyperPrep kit with RiboErase (HMR) (Kapa Biosystems) and sequenced using a Hiseq 1500 (Illumina) to obtain 2 Ã 127 basepair (bp) paired-end reads. Three replicates were sequenced for each population. Raw transcriptome sequence data were mapped to the genome (mm10) using HISAT2 (ver 2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Alignments were then passed to StringTie (ver 1.3.4d), which was used to assemble and quantify transcripts in each sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). EdgeR (ver 3.22.5) was then used to compare all transcripts across conditions and to produce tables and plots of differentially expressed genes and transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). Normalization with the TMM method was performed with the edgeR package in Bioconductorâ¬ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/">https://bioconductor.org/</ext-link>). â¬Genes (12,808 genes) were selected for hierarchical clustering based on the mean of TMM normalized read counts across all samplesâ cells (mean â¥ 1). Then, clustering was performed by using the hclust function for R (distance = âSpearmanâs correlationâ; method = âward.D2â).

Authors used Hoxb5 reporter mice to isolated LT-HSC and ST-HSC and performed molecular analyses and transplantation assays to support their arguments. How hematopoietic system becomes myeloid-biased upon aging is an important question with many implications in disease context as well. However, this study needs more definitive data.</p><p>(1) Authors' experimental designs have some caveats to definitely support their claims. Authors claimed that aged LT-HSCs have no myeloid-biased clone expansion using transplantation assays. In these experiments, authors used 10 HSCs and young mice as recipients. Given the huge expansion of old HSC by number and known heterogeneity in immunophenotypically defined HSC populations, it is questionable how 10 out of so many old HSCs (an average of 300,000 up to 500,000 cells per mouse; Mitchell et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2023) can faithfully represent old HSC population. The Hoxb5+ old HSC primary and secondary recipient mice data (Fig. 2C and D) support this concern. In addition, they only used young recipients. Considering the importance of inflammatory aged niche in the myeloid-biased lineage output, transplanting young vs old LT-HSCs into aged mice will complete the whole picture.</p><p>In response to the above comments, the authors calculated the required sample size as approximately 384 cells to represent 500,000 HSCs per old mouse. Based on the total 1260 cells used throughout the whole manuscript (Figures 2, 3, 5, 6, S3, and S6), the authors claimed that the data is reflecting old HSC behavior. However, 384 cells represent HSCs from one old mouse. Following the authors' logic, they did only 3.2 mice (1260/384) experiment for the whole manuscript to make their argument. N of 3 is not enough, especially for old mice experiments considering the heterogeneity of aged mice. Also, they did not address the comment regarding inflammatory aged niche effects.</p><p>(2) Authors' molecular data analyses need more rigor with unbiased approaches. They claimed that neither aged LT-HSCs nor aged ST-HSCs exhibited myeloid or lymphoid gene set enrichment but aged bulk HSCs, which are just a sum of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs by their gating scheme (Fig. 4A), showed the &quot;tendency&quot; of enrichment of myeloid-related genes based on the selected gene set (Fig. 4D). Although the proportion of ST-HSCs is reduced in bulk HSCs upon aging, since ST-HSCs do not exhibit lymphoid gene set enrichment based on their data, it is hard to understand how aged bulk HSCs have more myeloid gene set enrichment compared to young bulk HSCs. This bulk HSC data rather suggest that there could be a trend toward certain lineage bias (although not significant) in aged LT-HSCs or ST-HSCs. Authors need to verify the molecular lineage priming of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs using another comprehensive dataset.</p><p>(3) Although authors could not find any molecular evidence for myeloid-biased hematopoiesis from old HSCs (either LT or ST), they argued that the ratio between LT-HSC and ST-HSC causes myeloid-biased hematopoiesis upon aging based on young HSC experiments (Fig. 6). However, old ST-HSC functional data showed that they barely contribute to blood production unlike young Hoxb5- HSCs (ST-HSC) in the transplantation setting (Fig. 2). Is there any evidence that in unperturbed native old hematopoiesis, old Hoxb5- HSCs (ST-HSC) still contribute to blood production? To answer this question, authors performed additional experiments with increased cell number (Fig. S6). Although Fig. S6.D data has a statistical significance, it is questionable how biologically meaningful it is. More fundamental question is back to the representability. Can this cell number used in this experiment represent old HSC (either LT or ST) behavior?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95880.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Nishi et al, investigate the well-known and previously described phenomenon of age-associated myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. Using a previously established HoxB5mCherry mouse model, they used HoxB5+ and HoxB5- HSCs to discriminate cells with long-term (LT-HSCs) and short-term (ST-HSCs) reconstitution potential and compared these populations to immunophenotypically defined 'bulk HSCs' that consists of a mixture of LT-HSC and ST-HSCs. They then isolated these HSC populations from young and aged mice to test their function and myeloid bias in non-competitive and competitive transplants into young and aged recipients. Based on quantification of hematopoietic cell frequencies in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and in some experiments the spleen and thymus, the authors argue against the currently held belief that myeloid-biased HSCs expand with age.</p><p>While aspects of their work are fascinating and might have merit, several issues weaken the overall strength of the arguments and interpretation. Multiple experiments were done with a very low number of recipient mice, showed very large standard deviations, and had no statistically detectable difference between experimental groups. While the authors conclude that these experimental groups are not different, the displayed results seem too variable to conclude anything with certainty. The sensitivity of the performed experiments (e.g. Fig 3; Fig 6C, D) is too low to detect even reasonably strong differences between experimental groups and is thus inadequate to support the author's claims. This weakness of the study is not acknowledged in the text and is also not discussed. To support their conclusions the authors need to provide higher n-numbers and provide a detailed power analysis of the transplants in the methods section.</p><p>As the authors attempt to challenge the current model of the age-associated expansion of myeloid-biased HSCs (which has been observed and reproduced by many different groups), ideally additional strong evidence in the form of single-cell transplants is provided.</p><p>It is also unclear why the authors believe that the observed reduction of ST-HSCs relative to LT-HSCs explains the myeloid-biased phenotype observed in the peripheral blood. This point seems counterintuitive and requires further explanation.</p><p>Based on my understanding of the presented data, the authors argue that myeloid-biased HSCs do not exist, as:</p><p>(a) they detect no difference between young/aged HSCs after transplant (mind low n-numbers and large std);</p><p>(b) myeloid progenitors downstream of HSCs only show minor or no changes in frequency and (c) aged LT-HSCs do not outperform young LT-HSC in myeloid output LT-HScs in competitive transplants (mind low n-numbers and large std!!!).</p><p>However, given the low n-numbers and high variance of the results, the argument seems weak and the presented data does not support the claims sufficiently. That the number of downstream progenitors does not change could be explained by other mechanisms, for instance, the frequently reported differentiation short-cuts of HSCs and/or changes in the microenvironment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors present an interesting observation and offer an alternative explanation of the origins of aged-associated myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. Their data regarding the role of the microenvironment in the spleen and thymus appears to be convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>&quot;Then, we found that the myeloid lineage proportions from young and aged LT-HSCs were nearly comparable during the observation period after transplantation (Fig. 3, B and C).&quot;</p><p>[Comment to the authors]: Given the large standard deviation and low n-numbers, the power of the analysis to detect differences between experimental groups is very low. Experimental groups with too large standard deviations (as displayed here) are difficult to interpret and might be inconclusive. The absence of clearly detectable differences between young and aged transplanted HSCs could thus simply be a false-negative result. The shown experimental results hence do not provide strong evidence for the author's interpretation of the data. The authors should add additional transplants and include a detailed power analysis to be able to detect differences between experimental groups with reasonable sensitivity.</p><p>Line 293: &quot;Based on these findings, we concluded that myeloid-biased hematopoiesis observed following transplantation of aged HSCs was caused by a relative decrease in ST-HSC in the bulk-HSC compartment in aged mice rather than the selective expansion of myeloid-biased HSC clones.&quot;</p><p>[Comment to the authors]: Couldn't that also be explained by an increase in myeloid-biased HSCs, as repeatedly reported and seen in the expansion of CD150+ HSCs? It is not intuitively clear why a reduction of ST-HSCs clones would lead to a myeloid bias. The author should try to explain more clearly where they believe the increased number of myeloid cells comes from. What is the source of myeloid cells if the authors believe they are not derived from the expanded population of myeloid-biased HSCs?</p><p>New comment for the authors:</p><p>While the authors provide new evidence, clarify the text, and adjust their interpretation, the presented data remain weak and do not convincingly challenge the current paradigm. As myeloid-biased HSC expansion with age has been observed and published by many different groups, the authors need to provide much stronger evidence to challenge the observations of others. Key experiments that might support their claims had been suggested, but as indicated, the authors plan to provide these much more rigorous experiments in future studies. As it stands, the overall conclusions of this manuscript thus remain weak and preliminary.</p><p>In an attempt to quantify the absolute cell number of HSPC subpopulations, the authors use a usual readout and quantify &quot;Number of cells per minute of analysis time&quot;. This appears to be a quick and dirty reanalysis of already existing flow cytometry data. Unfortunately, this quantification cannot count the absolute number of cells reliably, as the number of cells per minute recorded is heavily influenced by the abundance of other cell populations. Instead, the author should have counted the absolute number of HSCs, MPPs, GMPs, etc. per femur, which is typically done to address this question.</p><p>At this point, as authors are seemingly not willing to provide additional hard evidence to support their claims in this study and are instead in the process of preparing additional data for a future manuscript, I believe this study, as it stands (although weak), suggests an interesting alternative model. Despite being highly controversial, this alternative model warrants future investigations and discussions in the field. As always, it will also be important to reproduce these findings independently in other labs. As my concerns and the concerns of the other reviewers are documented and available to read by others, I believe the manuscript should be published in its current form to stimulate critical discussion and future investigations of the current model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95880.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Nishi et al. propose a new model to explain the previously reported myeloid-biased hematopoiesis associated with aging. Traditionally, this phenotype has been explained by the expansion of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones during aging. Here, the authors question this idea and show how their Hoxb5 reporter model can discriminate long-term (LT) and short-term (ST) HSC and characterized their lineage output after transplant. From these analyses, the authors conclude that changes during aging in the LT/ST HSC proportion explain the myeloid bias observed.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I appreciate the authors' reply to some of my comments. However, there are some key aspects that remain unresolved. Please see below.</p><p>- The authors propose a critical change in the way we consider the mechanisms leading to lineage biased hematopoiesis during aging. As Reviewer 2 mentioned, such a strong claim needs to be supported by solid experimental data. Unfortunately, the level of variability in key in vivo experiments (Figure 2 and 3) diminishes the robustness of these results.</p><p>The authors argue that even with the low number of mice used in some of these experiments and the high level of variability, differences still reach (or not) statistical significance according to their analysis. I am not an expert on statistics but the only test that is mentioned is their methodology is a Welch's t test, which is only appropriate for data following a normal distribution. A more rigorous statistical analysis should be performed to sustain the claims included in the current manuscript.</p><p>- The chosen irradiation regiment might contribute to the uncertainty of the data and influence their interpretation. As the authors show in their response to my &quot;comment to our #3-4 response&quot;, there is a considerable (and variable) amount of &quot;radioresistant&quot; CD45.1+CD45.2- cells in their primary recipients, which become concerningly high in the secondary transplant. This is not found in previous publications focused on this topic and, therefore, it makes it difficult to compare those studies with the present manuscript. The inclusion of this aspect in the text is appreciated but definitely reduces the impact of their claims.</p><p>- The correction introduced in the main text as an answer to the original comment #3-6 is still misleading. There is an assumption for GMP, CMP and MEP to increase with age if myeloid-biased HSC clones increase with age (&quot;in contrast to what we anticipated&quot;).

Authors claimed that aged LT-HSCs have no myeloid-biased clone expansion using transplantation assays. In these experiments, authors used 10 HSCs and young mice as recipients. Given the huge expansion of old HSC by number and known heterogeneity in immunophenotypically defined HSC populations, it is questionable how 10 out of so many old HSCs (an average of 300,000 up to 500,000 cells per mouse; Mitchell et al., Nature Cell Biology, 2023) can faithfully represent old HSC population. The Hoxb5+ old HSC primary and secondary recipient mice data (Fig. 2C and D) support this concern. In addition, they only used young recipients. Considering the importance of inflammatory aged niche in the myeloid-biased lineage output, transplanting young vs old LT-HSCs into aged mice will complete the whole picture.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your insightful comment regarding the existence of approximately 500,000 HSCs per mouse in older mice.

They claimed that neither aged LT-HSCs nor aged ST-HSCs exhibited myeloid or lymphoid gene set enrichment but aged bulk HSCs, which are just a sum of LTHSCs and ST-HSCs by their gating scheme (Fig. 4A), showed the &quot;tendency&quot; of enrichment of myeloid-related genes based on the selected gene set (Fig. 4D). Although the proportion of ST-HSCs is reduced in bulk HSCs upon aging, since STHSCs do not exhibit lymphoid gene set enrichment based on their data, it is hard to understand how aged bulk HSCs have more myeloid gene set enrichment compared to young bulk HSCs. This bulk HSC data rather suggest that there could be a trend toward certain lineage bias (although not significant) in aged LT-HSCs or ST-HSCs. Authors need to verify the molecular lineage priming of LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs using another comprehensive dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful feedback regarding the lack of myeloid or lymphoid gene set enrichment in aged LT-HSCs and aged ST-HSCs, despite the observed tendency for myeloid-related gene enrichment in aged bulk HSCs.</p><p>First, we acknowledge that the GSEA results vary among the different myeloid gene sets analyzed (Fig. 4, DâF; Fig. S4, CâD).

The sensitivity of the performed experiments (e.g. Fig 3; Fig 6C, D) is too low to detect even reasonably strong differences between experimental groups and is thus inadequate to support the author's claims.

The power analysis for this experiment shows that power = 0.319, suggesting that more number may be needed. On the other hand, our method for determining the sample size in Figure 3 is as follows:</p><p>(1) First, we checked whether myeloid biased change is detected in the bulk-HSC fraction (Figure S3). The results showed that the difference in myeloid output at 16 weeks after transplantation was statistically significant (young vs. aged = 7.2 Â± 8.9 vs. 42.1 Â± 35.5%, p = 0.01), even though n = 10.</p><p>(2) Next, myeloid biased HSCs have been reported to be a fraction with high selfrenewal ability (2004, Blood).

Since there was no difference in the mean itself, it is highly likely that no difference will be detected even if n is further increased.</p><p>Regarding Figure 6, we obtained a statistically significant difference and consider the sample size to be sufficient. In addition, we have performed various functional experiments (Figures 2, 5, 6 and S6), and have obtained consistent results that expansion of myeloid biased HSCs does not occur with aging in Hoxb5+HSCs fraction. Based on the above, we conclude that the LT-HSC fraction does not differ in myeloid differentiation potential with aging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors attempt to challenge the current model of the age-associated expansion of myeloid-biased HSCs (which has been observed and reproduced by many different groups), ideally additional strong evidence in the form of single-cell transplants is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #2-2:</p><p>Thank you for the comments. As the reviewer pointed out, we hope we could reconfirm our results using single-cell level technology in the future.</p><p>On the other hand, we have reported that the ratio of myeloid to lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood changes when the number of HSCs transplanted, or the number of supporting cells transplanted with HSCs, is varied[1-2]. Therefore, single-cell transplant data need to be interpreted very carefully to determine differentiation potential.</p><p>From this viewpoint, future experiments will combine the Hoxb5 reporter system with a lineage tracing system that can track HSCs at the single-cell level over time. This approach will investigate changes in the self-renewal capacity of individual HSCs and their subsequent differentiation into progenitor cells and peripheral blood cells. We have reflected this comment by adding the following sentences in the manuscript.</p><p>[P19, L451] âIn contrast, our findings should be considered in light of some limitations. In this report, we primarily performed ten to twenty cell transplantation assays. Therefore, the current theory should be revalidated using single-cell technology with lineage tracing system[3-4].

Our data, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, demonstrate that the differentiation potential of LT-HSCs remains unchanged with age. Therefore, rather than suggesting that an increase in LT-HSCs with a consistent differentiation capacity leads to myeloidbiased hematopoiesis, it seems more accurate to highlight that the relative decrease in the proportion of ST-HSCs, which remain in peripheral blood as lymphocytes, leads to a relative increase in myeloid cells in peripheral blood and thus causes myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.</p><p>However, if we focus on the increase in the ratio of LT-HSCs, it is also plausible to explain that âwith aging, the proportion of LT-HSCs capable of long-term myeloid hematopoiesis increases. As a result, from 16 weeks after transplantation, the influence of LT-HSCs maintaining the long-term ability to produce myeloid cells becomes relatively more significant, leading to an increase in the ratio of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood and causing myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on my understanding of the presented data, the authors argue that myeloidbiased HSCs do not exist, as</p><p>a) they detect no difference between young/aged HSCs after transplant (mind low nnumbers and large std!!!); b) myeloid progenitors downstream of HSCs only show minor or no changes in frequency and c) aged LT-HSCs do not outperform young LT-HSC in myeloid output LT-HSCs in competitive transplants (mind low n-numbers and large std!!!).</p><p>However, given the low n-numbers and high variance of the results, the argument seems weak and the presented data does not support the claims sufficiently. That the number of downstream progenitors does not change could be explained by other mechanisms, for instance, the frequently reported differentiation short-cuts of HSCs and/or changes in the microenvironment.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #2-4:</p><p>We appreciate the comments. As mentioned above, we will correct the manuscript regarding the sample size. Regarding the interpreting of the lack of increase in the percentage of myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow with age, it is instead possible that various confounding factors, such as differentiation shortcuts or changes in the microenvironment, are involved.</p><p>However, even when aged LT-HSCs and young LT-HSCs are transplanted into the same recipient mice, the timing of the appearance of different cell fractions in peripheral blood is similar (Figure 3 of this paper). Therefore, we have not obtained data suggesting that clear shortcuts exist in the differentiation process of aged HSCs into neutrophils or monocytes. Additionally, it is currently consensually accepted that myeloid cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, differentiate from GMPs[1]. Since there is no changes in the proportion of GMPs in the bone marrow with age, we concluded that the differentiation potential into myeloid cells remains consistent with aging.</p><p>&quot;Then, we found that the myeloid lineage proportions from young and aged LT-HSCs were nearly comparable during the observation period after transplantation (Fig. 3, B and C).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Comment to the authors]: Given the large standard deviation and low n-numbers, the power of the analysis to detect differences between experimental groups is very low. Experimental groups with too large standard deviations (as displayed here) are difficult to interpret and might be inconclusive. The absence of clearly detectable differences between young and aged transplanted HSCs could thus simply be a false-negative result. The shown experimental results hence do not provide strong evidence for the author's interpretation of the data. The authors should add additional transplants and include a detailed power analysis to be able to detect differences between experimental groups with reasonable sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #2-5:</p><p>Thank you for providing these insights.

We apologize for the insufficient explanation. We will explain using Figure 8 from the paper.</p><p>First, our data show that LT-HSCs maintain their differentiation capacity with age, while ST-HSCs lose their self-renewal capacity earlier, so that only long-lived memory lymphocytes remain in the peripheral blood after the loss of selfrenewal capacity in ST-HSCs (Figure 8, upper panel).

Unfortunately, the authors do not provide additional data to further support their claims. Instead, the authors argue the following: Because they were able to find significant differences between experimental groups in some experiments, the absence of significant differences in the results of other experiments must be correct, too.</p></disp-quote><p>This logic is in my view flawed. Any assay/experiment with highly variable data has a very low sensitivity to detect significant differences between groups. If, as in this case, the variance is as large as the entire dynamic range of the readout, it becomes impossible to be able to detect any difference. In these cases, it is not surprising and actually expected that the mean of the group is located close to the center of the dynamic range as is the case here (center of dynamic range: 50%). In other words, this means that the experiments are simply not reproducible. It is absolutely critical to remember that any experiment and its associated statistical analysis has 3 (!!!) instead of 2 possible outcomes:</p><p>(1) There is a statistically significant difference</p><p>(2) There is no statistically significant difference</p><p>(3) The results of the experiment are inconclusive because the replicates are too variable and the results are not reproducible.</p><p>While most of us are inclined to think about outcomes (1) or (2), outcome (3) cannot be neglected. While it might be painful to accept, the only way to address concerns about data reproducibility is to provide additional data, improve reproducibility, and lower the power of the analysis to an acceptable level (e.g. able to detect difference of 5-10% between groups).</p><p>Without going into the technical details, the example graph from the link below illustrates that with a power 0.319 as stated by the authors, approx. 25 transplants, instead of 8, would be required.</p><p>Typically, however, a power of 0.8 is a reasonable value for any power analysis (although it's not a very strong power either). Even if we are optimistic and assume that there might be a reasonably large difference between experimental groups (in the example above P2 = 0.6, which is actually not that large) we can estimate that we would need over 10 transplants per group to say with confidence that two experimental groups likely do not differ. With smaller differences, these numbers increase quickly to 20+ transplants per group as can be seen in the example graph using an Alpha of 0.1 above.</p><p>Further reading can be found here and in many textbooks or other online resources: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://power-analysis.com/effect_size.htm%20https://tss.awf.poznan.pl/pdf-188978-110207?filename=Using%20power%20analysis%20to.pdf">https://power-analysis.com/effect_size.htm%20https://tss.awf.poznan.pl/pdf-188978-110207?filename=Using%20power%20analysis%20to.pdf</ext-link>.</p><p>Response:</p><p>Thank you for your feedback.

Our data, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, demonstrate that the differentiation potential of LTHSCs remains unchanged with age. Therefore, rather than suggesting that an increase in LT-HSCs with a consistent differentiation capacity leads to myeloid biased hematopoiesis, it seems more accurate to highlight that the relative decrease in the proportion of ST-HSCs, which remain in peripheral blood as lymphocytes, leads to a relative increase in myeloid cells in peripheral blood and thus causes myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. However, if we focus on the increase in the ratio of LT-HSCs, it is also plausible to explain that &quot;with aging, the proportion of LT-HSCs capable of long-term myeloid hematopoiesis increases. As a result, from 16 weeks after transplantation, the influence of LT-HSCs maintaining the long-term ability to produce myeloid cells becomes relatively more significant, leading to an increase in the ratio of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood and causing myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Comment for authors]</p><p>While this interpretation of the data might make sense the shown data do not exclude alternative explanations.

As this reviewer pointed out, we do not exclude the possibility that the combination of aged microenvironment drives myeloid bias.

However, given the low n-numbers and high variance of the results, the argument seems weak and the presented data does not support the claims sufficiently. That the number of downstream progenitors does not change could be explained by other mechanisms, for instance, the frequently reported differentiation short-cuts of HSCs and/or changes in the microenvironment.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #2-4:</p><p>We appreciate the comments. As mentioned above, we will correct the manuscript regarding the sample size. Regarding the interpreting of the lack of increase in the percentage of myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow with age, it is instead possible that various confounding factors, such as differentiation shortcuts or changes in the microenviroment, are involved. However, even when aged LT-HSCs and young LT-HSCs are transplanted into the same recipient mice, the timing of the appearance of different cell fractions in peripheral blood is similar (Figure 3 of this paper). Therefore, we have not obtained data suggesting that clear shortcuts exist in the differentiation process of aged HSCs into neutrophils or monocytes. Additionally, it is currently consensually accepted that myeloid cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, differentiate from GMPs1. Since there are no changes in the proportion of GMPs in the bone marrow with age, we concluded that the differentiation potential into myeloid cells remains consistent with aging.</p><p>Reference</p><p>(1) Akashi K and others, 'A Clonogenic Common Myeloid Progenitor That Gives Rise to All Myeloid Lineages', Nature, 404.6774 (2000), 193-97.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Comment for authors]</p><p>As the relative frequency of cell population can be misleading, the authors should compare the absolute numbers of progenitors in young vs. aged mice to strengthen their argument.

Experimental groups with too large standard deviations (as displayed here) are difficult to interpret and might be inconclusive. The absence of clearly detectable differences between young and aged transplanted HSCs could thus simply be a false-negative result. The shown experimental results hence do not provide strong evidence for the author's interpretation of the data. The authors should add additional transplants and include a detailed power analysis to be able to detect differences between experimental groups with reasonable sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #2-5:</p><p>Thank you for providing these insights.

We agree with the importance of discussing potential limitations in our experimental design. In response to the reviewerâs suggestion, we have revised the manuscript to include the following sentences:</p><p>[P19, L434] &quot;In the co-transplantation assay shown in Figure 3, the myeloid lineage output derived from young and aged LT-HSCs was comparable (Young LT-HSC: 51.4 Â± 31.5% vs. Aged LT-HSC: 47.4 Â± 39.0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.82).

It is not intuitively clear why a reduction of STHSCs clones would lead to a myeloid bias. The author should try to explain more clearly where they believe the increased number of myeloid cells comes from. What is the source of myeloid cells if the authors believe they are not derived from the expanded population of myeloid-biased HSCs?</p></disp-quote><p>Response #2-6:</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We apologize for the insufficient explanation. We will explain using attached Figure 8 from the paper. First, our data show that LT-HSCs maintain their differentiation capacity with age, while ST-HSCs lose their self-renewal capacity earlier, so that only long-lived memory lymphocytes remain in the peripheral blood after the loss of self-renewal capacity in ST-HSCs (Figure 8, upper panel). In mouse bone marrow, the proportion of LT-HSCs increases with age, while the proportion of STHSCs relatively decreases (Figure 8, lower panel and Figure S5).</p><p>Our data show that merely reproducing the ratio of LT-HSCs to ST-HSCs observed in aged mice using young LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs can replicate myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. This suggests that the increase in LT-HSC and the relative decrease in ST-HSC within the HSC compartment with aging are likely to contribute to myeloid-biased hematopoiesis.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, since the differentiation capacity of LT-HSCs remain unchanged with age, it seems more accurate to describe that the relative decrease in the proportion of STHSCs, which retain long-lived memory lymphocytes in peripheral blood, leading to a relative increase in myeloid cells in peripheral blood and thus causes myeloid-biased hematopoiesis. However, focusing on the increase in the proportion of LT-HSCs, it is also possible to explain that &quot;with aging, the proportion of LT-HSCs capable of long-term myeloid hematopoiesis increases. As a result, from 16 weeks after transplantation, the influence of LT-HSCs maintaining the long-term ability to produce myeloid cells become relatively more significant, leading to an increase in the ratio of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood and causing myeloid biased hematopoiesis.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Comment for authors]</p><p>While I can follow the logic of the argument, my concerns about the interpretation remain as I see discrepancies in other findings in the published literature. For instance, what the authors call ST-HSCs, differs from the classical functional definition of ST-HSCs. It is thus difficult to relate the described observations to previous reports. ST-HSCs typically can contribute significantly to multiple lineages for several weeks (see for example PMID: 29625072). It is somewhat surprising that the ST-HSC in this study don't show this potential and loose their potential much quicker.</p><p>The authors should thus provide a more comprehensive depth of immunophenotypic and molecular characterization to compare their LT-HSCs to ST-HSCs. For instance, are LT-HSCs CD41- HSCs? How do ST-HSCs differ in their surface marker expression from previously used definitions of ST-HSCs? A list of differentially expressed genes between young and old LT-HSCs and ST-HSCs should be done and will likely provide important insights into the molecular programs/markers (beyond the provided GO analysis, which seems superficial).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. As the reviewer noted, there are indeed multiple definitions of ST-HSCs. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our definitions of ST-HSCs. We define ST-HSCs functionally, rather than by surface antigens, which we believe is the most classical and widely accepted definition [1]. In our study, we define long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) as those HSCs that continue to contribute to hematopoiesis after a second transplantation and possess long-term self-renewal potential. Conversely, we define short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs) as those HSCs that do not contribute to hematopoiesis after a second transplantation and only exhibit self-renewal potential in the short term.</p><p>Next, in the paper referenced by the reviewer[2], the chimerism of each fraction of ST-HSCs also peaked at 4 weeks and then decreased to approximately 0.1% after 12 weeks post-transplantation. Author response image 5 illustrates our ST-HSC donor chimerism in Figure 2. We believe that data in the paper referenced by the reviewer2 is consistent with our own observations of the hematopoietic pattern following ST-HSC transplantation, indicating a characteristic loss of hematopoietic potential 4 weeks after the transplantation. Furthermore, as shown in Figures 2D and 2F, the fraction of ST-HSCs does not exhibit hematopoietic activity after the second transplantation. Therefore, we consider this fraction to be ST-HSCs.</p><fig id="sa4fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95880-sa4-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, the RNAseq data presented in Figures 4 and S4 revealed that the GSEA results vary among the different myeloid gene sets analyzed (Fig. 4, DâF; Fig. S4, CâD). Moreover, a comprehensive analysis of mouse HSC aging using multiple RNA-seq datasets reported that nearly 80% of differentially expressed genes show poor reproducibility across datasets[3]. From the above, while RNAseq data is indeed helpful, we believe that emphasizing functional experimental results is more critical than incorporating an additional dataset to support our claim.

However, the best way would be to normalize to single cells. As I mentioned in my original comment, normalizing to cKit+ cells could be misleading, as the proportion of cKit+ cells could be different across the experimental conditions. Further, enriching for cKit+ cells when analyzing BM subpopulation frequencies could introduce similar potential errors. The enrichment would depend on the level of expression of cKit for each of these population, what would alter the final quantification. Indeed, CLP are typically defined as cKit-med/low. Thus, cKit enrichment would not be a great method to analyze the frequency of these cells.</p><p>The graph in the authors' response to my comment, show similar trend to what is represented Figure 1B for some populations.

This would imply that their results (no changes or reduction in these myeloid subpopulations) suggest the absence of myeloid-biased HSC clones expansion with age. This reviewer believes that differentiation dynamics within the hematopoietic hierarchy can be more complex than a cascade of sequential and compartmentalized events (e.g., accelerated differentiation at the CMP level could cause exhaustion of this compartment and explain its reduction with age and why GMP and MEP are unchanged) and these conclusions should be considered more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #3-6:</p><p>We wish to thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree with that the differentiation pathway may not be a cascade of sequential events but could be influenced by various factors such as extrinsic factors.</p><p>In Figure 1B, we hypothesized that there may be other mechanisms causing myeloid-biased hematopoiesis besides the age-related increase in myeloid-biased HSCs, given that the percentage of myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow did not change with age. However, we do not discuss the presence or absence of myeloid-biased HSCs based on the data in Figure 1B.</p><p>Our newly proposed theoriesâthat the differentiation capacity of LT-HSCs remains unchanged with age and that age-related myeloid-biased hematopoiesis is due to changes in the ratio of LT-HSCs to ST-HSCsâare based on functional experiment results. As the reviewer pointed out, to discuss the presence or absence of myeloid-biased HSCs based on the data in Figure 1B, it is necessary to apply a system that can track HSC differentiation at single-cell level. The technology would clarify changes in the self-renewal capacity of individual HSCs and their differentiation into progenitor cells and peripheral blood cells. The authors believe that those single-cell technologies will be beneficial in understanding the differentiation of HSCs. Based on the above, the following statement has been added to the text.</p><p>[P19, L440] In contrast, our findings should be considered in light of some limitations. In this report, we primarily performed ten to twenty cell transplantation assays. Therefore, the current theory should be revalidated using single-cell technology with lineage tracing system1-2.

As the reviewers pointed out, in Figure 2D, a few recipients show a very high percentage of T cells. The authors had the same question and considered this phenomenon as follows:</p><p>(1) One reason for the very high percentage of T cells is that we used 1 x 107 whole bone marrow cells in the secondary transplantation. Consequently, the donor cells in the secondary transplantation contained more T-cell progenitor cells, leading to a greater increase in T cells compared to the primary transplantation.</p><p>(2) We also consider that this phenomenon may be influenced by the reduced selfrenewal capacity of aged LT-HSCs, resulting in decreased sustained production of myeloid cells in the secondary recipient mice. As a result, long-lived memorytype lymphocytes may preferentially remain in the peripheral blood, increasing the percentage of T cells in the secondary recipient mice.</p><p>We have discussed our hypothesis regarding this interesting phenomenon.

Based on this evidence, we consider that the transplantation of a small number of cells (10 cells) is the primary cause of the high level of variability observed.</p><p>Comment for our #3-8 response:</p><p>I agree that transplanting low number of HSC increases the mouse-to-mouse variability.

Including all primary recipients yields n = 11 vs. n = 12, providing a more balanced comparison. Therefore, we analyzed all primary recipient mice to ensure the reliability of our results.</p><p>Comment for our #3-10 response:</p><p>I respectfully disagree. Secondary recipients are derived from only 3 of the primary recipients. Therefore, the BM composition is determined by the composition of their donors. Including primary recipients that are not transplanted into secondary recipients for is not the fairest comparison for this analysis.</p><p>Thank you for your comment and for highlighting this important issue. We acknowledge the concern that including primary recipients that are not transplanted into secondary recipients is not the fairest comparison for this analysis. In response, we have reanalyzed the data using only the primary recipients whose bone marrow was actually transplanted into secondary recipients.</p><fig id="sa4fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95880-sa4-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Importantly, the reanalysis confirmed that the kinetics of myeloid cell proportions in peripheral blood were consistent between primary and secondary transplant recipients. We sincerely appreciate your thoughtful feedback, which has helped us improve the clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #3-11: When discussing the transcriptional profile of young and aged HSCs, the authors claim that genes linked to myeloid differentiation remain unchanged in the LT-HSC fraction while there are significant changes in the STHSCs. However, 2 out of the 4 genes shown in Figure S4B show ratios higher than 1 in LT-HSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Response #3-11:</p><p>Thank you for highlighting this important point. As the reviewer pointed out, when we analyze the expression of myeloid-related genes, some genes are elevated in aged LT-HSCs compared to young LT-HSCs. However, the GSEA analysis using myeloid-related gene sets, which include several hundred genes, shows no significant difference between young and aged LT-HSCs (see Figure S4C in this paper). Furthermore, functional experiments using the co-transplantation system show no difference in differentiation capacity between young and aged LT-HSCs (see Figure 3 in this paper). Based on these results, we conclude that LT-HSCs do not exhibit any change in differentiation capacity with aging.</p><p>Comment for our #3-11 response:</p><p>The authors used the data in Figure S4 to claim that &quot;myeloid genes were tended to be enriched in aged bulk-HSCs but not in aged LT-HSCs compared to their respective controls&quot; (this is the title of the figure; line # 1326). This is based on an increase in gene expression of CD150, vWF, Selp, Itgb3 in aged cells compared to young cells (Figure S4B). However, an increase in Selp and Itgb3 is also observed for LT-HSCs (lower magnitude, but still and increase).</p><p>Also, regarding the GSEA, the only term showing statistical significance in bulk HSCs is &quot;Myeloid gene set&quot;, which does not reach significance in LT-HSCs, but present a trend for enrichment (q = 0.077). None of the terms in shown in this panel present statistical significance in ST-HSCs.</p><p>Thank you for your valuable point. As the reviewer noted, the current title may cause confusion. Therefore, we propose changing it to the following:</p><p>[P52, L1331] âFigure S4. Compared to their respective young controls, aged bulk-HSCs exhibit greater enrichment of myeloid gene expression than aged LT-HSCsâ</p></body></sub-article></article>
