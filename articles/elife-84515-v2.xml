Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery mediates the membrane fission step that completes cytokinetic abscission and separates dividing cells. Filaments composed of ESCRT-III subunits constrict membranes of the intercellular bridge midbody to the abscission point. These filaments also bind and recruit cofactors whose activities help execute abscission and/or delay abscission timing in response to mitotic errors via the NoCut/Abscission checkpoint. We previously showed that the ESCRT-III subunit IST1 binds the cysteine protease Calpain-7 (CAPN7) and that CAPN7 is required for both efficient abscission and NoCut checkpoint maintenance (Wenzel et al., 2022). Here, we report biochemical and crystallographic studies showing that the tandem microtubule-interacting and trafficking (MIT) domains of CAPN7 bind simultaneously to two distinct IST1 MIT interaction motifs. Structure-guided point mutations in either CAPN7 MIT domain disrupted IST1 binding in vitro and in cells, and depletion/rescue experiments showed that the CAPN7-IST1 interaction is required for (1) CAPN7 recruitment to midbodies, (2) efficient abscission, and (3) NoCut checkpoint arrest. CAPN7 proteolytic activity is also required for abscission and checkpoint maintenance. Hence, IST1 recruits CAPN7 to midbodies, where its proteolytic activity is required to regulate and complete abscission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>ESCRT-III</kwd><kwd>abscission</kwd><kwd>NoCut Checkpoint</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM112080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ullman</surname><given-names>Katharine S</given-names></name><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Christopher P</given-names></name><name><surname>Sundquist</surname><given-names>Wesley I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31GM139318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paine</surname><given-names>Elliott L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical, structural, imaging, and functional studies reveal how the ESCRT-III protein IST1 recruits the CAPN7 cysteine protease to midbodies, where its proteolytic activity is required for efficient abscission and NoCut checkpoint arrest.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Midbody abscission separates two dividing cells at the end of cytokinesis.

Humans express 12 distinct ESCRT-III proteins that are recruited to membrane fission sites throughout the cell, including to midbodies that connect dividing cells during cytokinesis. Within the midbody, ESCRT-III proteins copolymerize into filaments that constrict the membrane to the fission point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guizetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mierzwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfitzner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azad et al., 2022</xref>).

One such cofactor was Calpain-7 (CAPN7), a ubiquitously expressed but poorly understood cysteine protease that had not previously been linked to abscission or to the NoCut checkpoint.

In the CAPN7-IST1 complex, IST1 Ser330 bulges away from the MIT domain to accommodate an intramolecular salt bridge formed by CAPN7 Asp21 and Arg63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and C</xref>), and the peptide then bends back to allow Val331 and Pro332 to make hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, respectively. In the VPS4A MIT-CHMP6 complex, the CHMP6 Glu176 residue forms a salt bridge with VPS4A Lys23, whereas the equivalent interaction between CAPN7 MIT Gly24 and IST1 Val331 interaction has a very different character, thereby disfavoring CHMP6 binding to CAPN7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and C</xref>). At the other end of the interface, helix 3 of the VPS4A MIT domain is two turns longer than the equivalent helix 3 in CAPN7 MIT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This allows CHMP6 Ile168 to make a favorable interaction, whereas the shorter CAPN7 MIT helix 3 projects loop residue Leu50 directly toward the IST1<sub>324-332</sub> N-terminus, in a position that would disfavor CHMP6 Ile168 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>The C-terminal IST1 MIM element (<sub>349</sub>DIDFDDLSRRFEELKK<sub>364</sub>) forms an amphipathic helix that packs between helices 1 and 3 of the C-terminal CAPN7 MIT domain, making a canonical âtype 3â (MIM3) interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bottom, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Skalicky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wenzel et al., 2022</xref>). Core residues from the hydrophobic face of the IST1 helix are buried in the CAPN7 MIT helix 1/3 groove, and the interface hydrophobic contacts, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges are nearly identical to those seen when this same IST1 motif makes a type 3 interaction with the MIT domain of SPARTIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo and Xu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wenzel et al., 2022</xref>). A previous study has reported that Thr95 of CAPN7 can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mayya et al., 2009</xref>). This residue sits in the IST1<sub>349-364</sub> binding site, adjacent to the detrimental F98D mutation (see below), and Thr95 phosphorylation would position the phosphate near Leu355 of IST1, creating an unfavorable electrostatic interaction and steric clash. We therefore anticipate that Thr95 phosphorylation would reduce IST1 binding and could negatively regulate the CAPN7-IST1 interaction.</p><p>The selectivity of each CAPN7 MIT domain for its cognate IST1 MIM element binding is dictated by the character of the MIT binding grooves. The hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding potential of the residues within the N-terminal MIT domain are selective for type 2 interactions (IST1<sub>324-332</sub>), whereas the C-terminal MIT domain selects for type 3 interactions. This is consistent with our binding data for each individual CAPN7 MIT with each individual IST1 MIM element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the CAPN7(MIT)<sub>2</sub>-IST1<sub>322-366</sub> structure (1) provides the first example of IST1<sub>325-336</sub> bound to an MIT domain and confirms the expectation that this IST1 element engages in MIM2-type interactions, (2) demonstrates that IST1<sub>352-363</sub> engages in a MIM3-type interaction when it binds CAPN7, and (3) shows that the separate IST1 MIM elements each bind distinct MIT domains within CAPN7(MIT)<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutational analyses of the CAPN7âIST1 complex</title><p>In our earlier study, we identified point mutations in the helix 1/3 grooves of each MIT domain that disrupt IST1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wenzel et al., 2022</xref>).

However, IST1 eluted anomalously rapidly, apparently because it adopts an extended conformation. When mixed, full-length IST1 and CAPN7 formed a 1:1 complex that migrated even more rapidly. Importantly, complex formation was inhibited by inactivating mutations in the center of the two IST1 MIM elements interaction interfaces (L328D/L355A, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Obita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stuchell-Brereton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kieffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajorek et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the crystallographically defined MIT-MIM interactions also mediate association of the full-length IST1 and CAPN7 proteins in solution. Finally, we analyzed the CAPN7-IST1 interaction in a cellular context using co-immunoprecipitation assays that employed our panel of different CAPN7 MIT mutations. Epitope-tagged CAPN7 and IST1 constructs were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, CAPN7-OSF constructs were immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts, with co-precipitated Myc-IST<sub>190-366</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or Myc-IST1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) detected by western blotting. Wild-type CAPN7 and the control CAPN7(L61D) mutant both co-precipitated IST1<sub>190-366</sub> and IST1 efficiently, whereas all three inactivating CAPN7 MIT point mutations (V18D, F98D, and V18D/F98D) dramatically reduced the co-precipitation of Myc-IST<sub>190-366</sub> (no detectable binding) or Myc-IST1 (very low-level residual binding, indicating either non-specific background or minor contributions from other region(s) of the protein).

In contrast, cells depleted of SPAST or CAPN7 did not exhibit NoCut checkpoint responses following aphidicolin treatments, indicating that both proteins are required to sustain NoCut signaling when the checkpoint is triggered by replication stress.</p><p>Our discovery that both CAPN7 and SPAST participate in the competing processes of cytokinetic abscission and NoCut delay of abscission may appear counterintuitive, but we envision that the MIT proteins could participate in both processes if they change substrate specificities or activities when participating in NoCut vs. abscission; for example, via different sites of action, post-translational modifications, and/or binding partners. We note that, in addition to its well-documented function in clearing spindle microtubules to allow efficient abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), SPAST is also required for ESCRT-dependent closure of the nuclear envelope (NE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>). The relationship between NE closure and NoCut signaling is not yet well understood, and it is therefore conceivable that nuclear membrane integrity is required to allow mitotic errors to sustain NoCut signaling. It will therefore be of interest to determine whether or not CAPN7, in addition to its midbody abscission functions, also participates in nuclear envelope closure and, if so, whether that activity is connected to its NoCut functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CAPN7 as an evolutionarily conserved ESCRT-signaling protein</title><p>Our data imply that proteolysis is critical for CAPN7 functions in NoCut and abscission, although physiological substrates have not yet been identified. GFP-CAPN7 can perform autolysis, and this activity is enhanced by IST1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Osako et al., 2010</xref>), implying that interactions with IST1 could activate CAPN7 proteolytic activity. In addition to our studies implicating CAPN7 midbody functions during cytokinesis, other biological functions for CAPN7 have also been proposed, including in ESCRT-dependent degradation of EGFR through the endosomal/MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yorikawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maemoto et al., 2014</xref>), and in human endometrial stromal cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) and decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2022</xref>). Aberrant CAPN7 expression may also impair embryo implantation through a currently unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>CAPN7 has evolutionarily conserved orthologs throughout Eukaryota, including in Aspergillus and yeast, where its role in ESCRT-dependent pH signaling is well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orejas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Futai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">PeÃ±alva et al., 2014</xref>). In Aspergillus, pH signaling requires proteolytic activation of the transcription factor PacC (no known human ortholog), which initiates an adaptive transcriptional response. PacC is cleaved and activated by the MIT domain-containing, Calpain-like CAPN7 ortholog protease PalB, which is recruited to membrane-associated ESCRT-III filaments in response to alkaline pH through a MIT:MIM interaction with the ESCRT-III protein Vps24 (CHMP3 ortholog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">RodrÃ­guez-GalÃ¡n et al., 2009</xref>). These ESCRT assemblies also contain PalA (ALIX ortholog), which co-recruits PacC to serve as a PalB substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu and Mitchell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vincent et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The pH signaling system in fungi has striking parallels with our model for human CAPN7 functions in cytokinesis, including: (1) MIT:MIM interactions between CAPN7 and ESCRT-III, which serve to recruit the protease to a key ESCRT signaling site. (2) The local presence of the homologous PalA and ALIX proteins. In the pH sensing system, PalA is thought to act as a scaffold that âpresentsâ the substrate to PalB for proteolysis on ESCRT-III assemblies, thus providing an extra level of spatiotemporal specificity for proteolysis. In the mammalian midbody, ALIX helps to nucleate ESCRT-III filament formation. (3) A requirement for proteolysis in downstream signal transduction. Thus, ESCRT-III assemblies are evolutionarily conserved platforms that recruit and unite active calpain proteases and their substrates with spatiotemporal specificity to regulate key biological

Raw data were first fit to the equation Y = Bmax * X/(Kd + X) + m2, each binding replicate isotherm was then normalized to a fraction bound value by subtracting the fitted m2 baseline value and dividing by the fitted Bmax value. Following normalization, three replicate isotherms were merged to generate an average K<sub>D</sub>, treating each of the replicate values as individual data points. Reported K<sub>D</sub> values indicate the average Â± standard error of the mean from three independent binding experiments. In cases where binding isotherms did not reach half occupancy at the highest ligand concentration tested, we simply report K<sub>D</sub> as being greater than the highest concentration used (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, IST1<sub>316-343</sub>). The K<sub>D</sub> are listed as not determined (ND) if changes in fluorescence polarization anisotropy were too small to allow meaningful curve fitting (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>NMR spectroscopy</title><p>NMR data were collected on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer running OpenVnmrJ_v3.1. 2D <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC data were processed using nmrPipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delaglio et al., 1995</xref>) and spectra were analyzed and NMR figures prepared using NMRFAM-SPARKY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).

They should also include a few examples of raw data.</p><p>â How exactly were the FPA data fit? The authors state that they used the Prism software package for data fitting. They should show the exact equation(s) used and should describe specifically what the uncertainties displayed in parenthesis represent, how they were estimated, and using what methods (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations, jackknife resampling, etc.). Based on the binding isotherms and the goodness of the fits, I would have expected a higher degree of uncertainty in the dissociation constants derived. For example, for titrations that showed weak affinity, the authors should describe what exactly they are reporting, and the error associated with such extracted parameters (an upper bound? 1x standard deviation?).</p><p>â On page 2, last paragraph of the NMR section: The authors state they measured different chemical shifts for 23 amide resonances (this needs to be better defined, see comment below) in the MIT-bound state. This statement is not supported by the data. In Figure 1D, no chemical shift changes in IST were observed upon the addition of unlabeled MIT. The authors can only claim that IST peaks disappeared. It is unlikely that the chemical shifts stayed the same, but since the bound peaks are not observed, they have no measurement to support the magnitude of the chemical shift changes (if any).</p><p>â Figure 1D shows changes in peak heights and not chemical shift perturbations. Calling the y-axis chemical shift perturbations (when none/few are measured) and assigning them values of -1 and +1 is unusual and confusing. I suggest modifying this figure and the text above so that the data are discussed in terms of peak intensities, not chemical shifts (see note above). A simple solution would be to plot intensity ratios between the bound and free spectra on the vertical axis. An inferior yet acceptable solution would be to set the intensity to 1 for peaks that stay visible and set it to 0 for those that disappear. In either case, the y-axis should be relabeled. The overall outline of Figure 1D can stay the same. The protein sequence and schematic illustrating MIM locations are done well and should stay as is.</p><p>â In the text, I would suggest that authors state that for 23 residues the peaks disappear, for X number of peaks (where X&lt;31) peak intensities change to some percentage range (peak heights in free and bound IST1 will be different), and perhaps for Y number of peaks (Y=31-X) intensities could not be quantified due to overlap or other reasons. The larger than expected size of the interacting proteins could explain why the peaks in the NMR spectra disappear in the bound state (see my comment on complex stoichiometry below).</p><p>â In the crystallography section, the authors state that the asymmetric unit contains two copies of the MIT-IST complex and outline two possible ways of modeling their structure. They clearly state that they chose to use the simpler model, but I believe showing the alternative arrangement as a supplementary figure would add value to the manuscript.</p><p>â Compared to FPA, NMR is a far better technique for quantifying weak interactions between individual MIMs and MIPs. Figure 2 â supplement 3 and the last two paragraphs of the NMR section would be considerably strengthened if dissociation constants from an NMR titration were provided.</p><p>â In Figure 3B, the authors use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to claim that a 1:1 complex is formed between MIT and IST. This is by no means supported by the data they provide. The authors mention that they calibrated their Superdex 200 column, but calibration data is not provided. We happen to own the same type of SEC column in our lab. In our hands, a 100 kDa protein elutes at ~13.3 mL retention on our column. Figure 3B indicates that CAPN7 is a monomer, but IST1 elutes earlier, consistent with it being a dimer or even a trimer. The retention volume of the wild-type complex appears more consistent with a 2:2 complex rather than a 1:1.</p><p>â The calibration data should be added to the figure. Regardless, I highly recommend the stoichiometry of this complex and isolated IST and MIT domains needs to be validated using another measurement such as NMR- or DLS-based measurement of diffusion rates, SEC-MALS (recommended), or native mass spectrometry. Establishing the stoichiometry of the complex and the interacting proteins is especially important because it might affect the models used in the fitting of the FPA data and their reported dissociation constants, the interpretation of the X-ray data, and the overall mechanism of ESCRT cytokinesis.</p><p>-Figure 5A: The style of the stacked bar chart makes this figure hard to read. I strongly recommend the authors improve this. One solution would be to change the chart to two bars per treatment (which has its own issue with visual clutter). Alternatively, they could separate midbody vs. multinucleate data into panels C and D (which would be my preference).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have the following recommendations:</p><p>1. The sentence starting on page 4, lines 16 to 18 needs a reference or a supplementary figure showing the sequence divergence.</p><p>2.

Does it play a role in the polymerization of ESCRT-II into filaments?</p></disp-quote><p>The binding synergy between the two CAPN7 MIT domains and their target IST1 MIM elements is a central theme of our paper. Specifically, we show that both interaction interfaces contribute to the CAPN7-IST1 interaction in vitro and in cells (Figure 3), and quantify the energetic contributions of each interface (Figure 3A). Both interaction interfaces are also required for proper localization of CAPN7 to midbodies (Figure 4) and for CAPN7 functions in abscission and NoCut checkpoint regulation (Figure 5). We appreciate that the reviewer highlighted this concept, and we have included text that emphasizes the importance of both interaction interfaces, e.g., discussions of Figure 3 (page 6, lines 8-9 and lines 19-21), Figure 4 (page 7, lines 5-7), and Figure 5 (page 7, lines 21-22 and lines 31-32).</p><p>On the question of the importance of the cooperating MIM interactions contributing to ESCRT-III filament polymerization: we have presented strong evidence that the interaction between CAPN7 and IST1 does NOT play a role in ESCRT-III polymerization because IST1 ESCRT-III polymers assemble in vitro in the absence of CAPN7, and also in the absence of the C-terminal region of IST1 (which contains the MIM elements that bind cooperatively to CAPN7) (PMID: 26634441). Furthermore, our immunofluorescence images show that localization of IST1 polymers in the midbody is not affected by CAPN7 depletion, or by CAPN7 MIT mutants that inhibit IST1 binding to either the first (V18D) or second (F98D) MIT domains (see manuscript Figure 4A, and quantified in Figure 4B). Therefore, ESCRT-III polymers assemble in vitro and in cells without IST1 MIM-CAPN7 MIT interactions (and, indeed, even in the absence of CAPN7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2)The authors should include more details regarding NMR resonance assignments. Also, the authors should provide an additional figure showing the resonances that broaden or shift in the complex and map them onto the crystal structures.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to these helpful suggestions, we have (1) added text to our Materials and methods section (page 22, lines 49-52 through page 23 lines 1-4; âNMR data were collected on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer running OpenVnmrJ_v3.1. 2D <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC data were processed using nmrPipe (Delaglio <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995) and spectra were analyzed and NMR figures prepared using NMRFAM-SPARKY (Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). NMR resonance assignments for <sup>15</sup>N-labeled IST1<sub>303-366</sub> were taken from Caballe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015. Briefly, sequential assignments were obtained from 2D <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC and 3D HNCA, HNCACB, CBCAcoNH, HNCO, and HNcaCO triple resonance experiments. Using this approach, it was possible to assign all 55 non-proline backbone amide resonances.

Titration data for five shifted, fast-exchanging residues were analyzed individually (the binding isotherms for three such resonances, F323, L325, and T337, are shown), and also globally fit to a simple 1:1 binding model (top right panel), providing a dissociation constant of 200 Â± 20 ÂµM, which is in excellent agreement with our FPA estimate that the K<sub>D</sub> is modestly above 100 ÂµM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Indicate calibration on the SEC to assist with proper interpretation of the SEC data.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this helpful suggestion, we have now added the positions of SEC calibration standards directly above the aligned chromatograms (Figure 3B) to allow readers to see the elution positions of the SEC calibration standards. We have also added a new supplemental figure that presents the raw chromatograms of the calibration data and individual protein traces (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A) so that reviewers can assess the data quality. Most importantly, as described in greater detail in our response to Reviewer #1, we have now performed SEC-MALS analyses on the individual CAPN7 and IST1 proteins to show that they both elute as monomeric proteins. We have included these data in new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B.

We have also updated the figure legends and Materials and methods to state more clearly that reported K<sub>D</sub>âs are the averages Â± standard error of mean from three independent measurements. For weak affinity binding (in cases where the fraction bound did not reach 0.5), we did not attempt to estimate K<sub>D</sub>âs, but instead reported the K<sub>D</sub> as being greater than the highest concentration point measured (e.g., in Figure 1B, binding of IST1<sub>314-343</sub> to CAPN7(MIT)<sub>2</sub> is reported as K<sub>D</sub> &gt; 100 ÂµM because the binding isotherm shows only ~30% saturation at that CAPN7(MIT)<sub>2</sub> concentration).

Figure 2 â supplement 3 and the last two paragraphs of the NMR section would be considerably strengthened if dissociation constants from an NMR titration were provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided these, as described in our response to âEssential revisionsâ, Point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â In Figure 3B, the authors use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to claim that a 1:1 complex is formed between MIT and IST. This is by no means supported by the data they provide. The authors mention that they calibrated their Superdex 200 column, but calibration data is not provided. We happen to own the same type of SEC column in our lab. In our hands, a 100 kDa protein elutes at ~13.3 mL retention on our column. Figure 3B indicates that CAPN7 is a monomer, but IST1 elutes earlier, consistent with it being a dimer or even a trimer. The retention volume of the wild-type complex appears more consistent with a 2:2 complex rather than a 1:1.</p><p>â The calibration data should be added to the figure. Regardless, I highly recommend the stoichiometry of this complex and isolated IST and MIT domains needs to be validated using another measurement such as NMR- or DLS-based measurement of diffusion rates, SEC-MALS (recommended), or native mass spectrometry. Establishing the stoichiometry of the complex and the interacting proteins is especially important because it might affect the models used in the fitting of the FPA data and their reported dissociation constants, the interpretation of the X-ray data, and the overall mechanism of ESCRT cytokinesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the chance to clarify this issue. Firstly, we have now added elution positions for the SEC calibration standards to the main figure and also show the raw data in a supplemental figure (see âEssential Revisionsâ, Point 5 above). The reviewer is correct that IST1 elutes earlier than CAPN7 despite its smaller molecular weight, but this is due to its elongated shape (PMID: 18032582 and 19129479). Importantly, we have now performed SEC-MALS analyses on both individual proteins to show that both eluting peaks correspond to monomeric proteins. We have included these data in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B and added text to clarify this point on page 5, lines 32-35 through page 6, lines 1-4:</p><p>âWe also assessed the importance of these interfaces for association of the full-length IST1 and CAPN7 proteins, using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to analyze the individual proteins and their complex (Figure 3B and Figure 3figure supplement 2). SEC with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analyses showed that the individual IST1 and CAPN7 proteins both eluted as monomers (IST1: calculated MW = 40.0 kDa, SEC-MALS estimated MW = 41 Â± 1 kDa; CAPN7 calculated MW = 92.6 kDa, SEC-MALS estimated MW = 90.4 Â± 0.3 kDa, see Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B). However, IST1 eluted anomalously rapidly, apparently because it adopts an extended conformation.â</p><p>Finally, we also attempted to perform analogous SEC-MALS analysis of the complex but our data were not rigorously interpretable because the complex dissociates slightly during chromatography (and we are limited in the concentration of CAPN7 that we can achieve). Nevertheless, those data again indicate that the complex is also monomeric (i.e., 1:1) because the estimated SEC-MALS mass (105 kDa) is slightly <italic>lower</italic> than that expected for a 1:1 complex (130 kDa).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Figure 5A: The style of the stacked bar chart makes this figure hard to read. I strongly recommend the authors improve this. One solution would be to change the chart to two bars per treatment (which has its own issue with visual clutter).

We chose to include the C-terminal IST1 construct for the pulldown in Figure 3C because the C-terminal construct includes these interfaces and lacks the ability to oligomerize (PMID: 19525971), which often contributes to background binding. Nevertheless, we agree that the modest binding seen for full-length IST1 mutants could conceivably reflect minor binding contributions from other region(s) of the full-length protein. We have therefore included the raw binding data in a supplemental figure so that readers can see the data for themselves, and we now explain that the very low levels of binding for the full length could indicate âeither non-specific background binding or minor binding contributions from other region(s) of the protein.â (page 6, lines 18-19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Before publication, the authors need to address the following questions/comments:</p><p>(A) The authors need to discuss the binding synergy they identified between the two MIM domains in depth.
