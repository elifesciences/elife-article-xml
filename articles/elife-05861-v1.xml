We use the word teosinte to refer to all the wild species of <italic>Zea</italic> that are native to Mexico and Central America. Teosinte sows its seeds widely. In addition to dispersing pollen in the wind, the kernels fall from the plant and, if eaten, are carried to other locations in fecal matter, thanks to the indigestible fruitcase (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> for a glossary of specialist terms used in this article). The domestication of maize kept the wind-born pollen of teosinte, but changed other traits, improving its utility for human consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doebley, 2004</xref>). The teosinte fruitcase, full of silica and lignin, became softer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), allowing humans to grind its kernels for food. The branch holding the kernels (cob) grew in girth, increasing the kernel row number from 2 to 20, or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Kernels no longer self-dispersed but were held tight on the cob, requiring the intervention of humans to sow seeds. Finally, the long branches shortened, but kept the leaves along the branch. These ‘husk leaves’ keep birds, insects and other pests from eating the kernels.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05861.003</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Glossary</title><p><bold>Axil:</bold> Where a leaf joins the stem.

He noted a reduced size in self-pollinated corn and the improved size and vigor, or heterosis, of cross-pollinated corn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darwin, 1876</xref>). His observations were extended by George Harrison Shull in 1908, who made inbreds by self-pollinating maize plants for multiple generations before crossing them together to make hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shull, 1908</xref>). Today, of course, hybrid maize is the predominant form grown in industrial agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duvick, 2001</xref>), with traditional open-pollinated landraces (see Glossary) primarily limited to small scale or subsistence farming.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The lifecycle of maize</title><p>Teosinte is sensitive to day length and only makes flowers when days are short (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emerson, 1924</xref>). An important step in breeding maize for higher latitudes involved overriding this environmental control, creating maize plants that flower independently of day length. The maize shoot apical meristem (see Glossary) initiates a genetically determined number of leaves before it transitions to become the male reproductive structure, known as the tassel. Buds are found in the axils (see Glossary) of most leaves—the lower buds become tillers, which are long branches, resembling the main stem. The buds above the tillers will develop into the ears, which hold the kernels. During early development, the ear and tassel primordia appear similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Sex determination genes initiate a program that blocks development of female reproductive parts in the male flowers of the tassel and male reproductive parts in the female flowers of the ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 1983</xref>). Interestingly, the tassel of a tiller is often partially feminized. While teosinte plants have multiple tillers, ensuring a supply of pollen over many days, modern maize often has a single tassel and lacks tillers entirely. Maize hybrids are created by planting two distinct inbreds in alternate rows and detasseling one inbred, ensuring that the ears on detasseled plants are cross-pollinated and thus hybrid.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05861.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Maize reproduction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a tassel primordium.

Following meiosis, the microspore undergoes two mitotic divisions, generating two sperm cells contained within a vegetative cell (see Glossary). The vegetative nucleus does the work of bringing the sperm cells to the female egg. The pollen germinates on silks, the extended pistils (see Glossary) of the female flower, and grows a tube inside the silk. Once the pollen tube reaches the plant's ovule, one sperm will fertilize the haploid egg cell, creating the diploid embryo, and the other sperm will fertilize the central cell of the female gametophyte, which has two polar nuclei (see Glossary). The resulting triploid cell develops into the endosperm, a sacrificial tissue that feeds the growing embryo.</p><p>Once the kernel, containing the double fertilization event, matures, it can be planted or stored for years in a dry state. The root emerges first, growing towards gravity. The shoot grows upward, supported by the nutrients of the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Maize is a monocotyledonous plant, meaning it produces one embryonic leaf (as compared to another model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which is a dicotyledonous plant). The cotyledon equivalent for maize is the coleoptile, which is connected to the nutritive scutellum (see Glossary). Inside the tubular coleoptile are sequentially younger leaves that arise from a shoot apical meristem.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Strengths as a model organism</title><p>Geneticists began collecting, describing and distributing maize mutants in the early 1900's (see references in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emerson et al., 1935</xref>). They took advantage of a number of features that make maize a valuable resource for genetic research (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>). Dozens of genes affect the texture of the endosperm and the color of its outermost layer, the aleurone, providing easily visible and eye-catching information about the genotype of the next generation. The large, distinctive chromosomes of maize further paved the way for a number of major discoveries, including linking genetic recombination to physical exchange of chromosomal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creighton and McClintock, 1931</xref>).

Based on the frequency of maize- or teosinte-like plants in his cross, he argued that as few as five loci might be responsible for much of the phenotypic difference between maize and teosinte. Later work by John Doebley et al. found quantitative trait loci (QTL; see Glossary) consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doebley and Stec, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">1993</xref>), and careful genetic analysis of these regions allowed Doebley's group to dissect some of these QTL down to the responsible genes. The two best-studied cases are the loci <italic>teosinte branched1</italic> (<italic>tb1</italic>) and <italic>teosinte glume architecture</italic> (<italic>tga</italic>)<italic>. tb1</italic> is responsible for the shortening and feminization of the axillary branches in domesticated maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doebley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Studer et al., 2011</xref>), while <italic>tga</italic> is responsible for the hardened fruitcase of teosinte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Changes at <italic>tb1</italic> are due to genetic alterations at distant regulatory sequences while critical changes at <italic>tga</italic> are likely to be due to amino-acid changes. Knowledge of these loci provides some of the best examples to date of how human selection for certain physical traits in maize has led to specific changes at the DNA level.</p><p>Many other genes, in addition to <italic>tb1</italic> and <italic>tga1</italic>, have played a role in domestication, however. The analysis of genetic diversity from whole-genome sequences of multiple maize and teosinte has identified nearly 500 regions of the genome that show evidence of selection during domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hufford et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, some of these regions do not contain genes, and many of the genes identified show differences in expression, pointing to the potentially important role of regulatory variation. Overall, more than 3000 genes show reduced diversity due to the impact of selection. In spite of this strong selection, maize landraces still retain more than 80% of the diversity found in teosinte, and it should be possible to identify potentially useful genetic diversity in landraces or teosinte while maintaining the key genetic contributors to improved maize.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Genetic diversity and analyzing complex traits</title><p>The modern diversity of inbred lines, ranging in their flowering time from 50 to 120 days and in height from 3 to 15 feet tall, derives from maize landraces. Buckler, Holland and McMullen took advantage of this natural diversity to create a widely-used tool, the nested association mapping (NAM) panel, which consists of 5000 recombinant inbred populations (see Glossary) generated by crossing 25 diverse maize lines to the same recurrent parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McMullen et al., 2009</xref>). This population is being used to identify the genes responsible for complex traits, such as flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckler et al., 2009</xref>), plant architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tian et al., 2011</xref>), and resistance to pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kump et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poland et al., 2011</xref>). It appears that variation for most traits results from numerous genes that each have a small effect on a trait. Maize differs in this regard from species that are self-pollinated, such as rice, sorghum and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which frequently have fewer loci that produce large effects on traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salome et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Teosinte, as an out-crossing species, is similar to maize in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Another powerful approach in maize that takes advantage of its diversity and history of outcrossing is that of genome wide association studies (GWAS), which exploits ancient recombination events that have shuffled and reshuffled genes. GWAS looks for correlations between variation at individual markers and a trait, and has become an important complement to the use of experimental crosses. By using detailed genetic and phenotypic information from the NAM line founders and by comparing this information to genotypic information obtained from their recombinant NAM progeny, we can begin to predict the phenotypic effects produced by the variants of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wallace et al., 2014</xref>). Other collections of maize inbred lines are also available for GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flint-Garcia et al., 2005</xref>). Using recently developed, high-throughput sequencing methods, a population of 2815 maize lines was genotyped with more than 600,000 single nucleotide polymorphic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Romay et al., 2013</xref>). This density of marker information worked well for identifying the genetic basis of simple traits using GWAS, but more markers will be needed for analyzing complex traits.</p><p>The eventual goal of these efforts is to link genotypes with phenotypes for use in predictive breeding studies (see Glossary). Predictive breeding will help breeders to create improved crops, by selecting alleles from different inbred maize lines to generate the combination of traits needed in a particular environment.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Today maize is one of the most important crops worldwide. As we try to increase yields, improve sustainability, and adapt maize to changing environmental and climatic conditions, we can take advantage of our understanding of the natural history of maize and its status as an important model organism. Future efforts at incorporating novel alleles into modern germplasm via selective breeding or transgenics, as well as developing predictive breeding models, will benefit from the history of research in maize, as well as its rich heritage of genetic diversity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Ed Buckler and members of the Hake lab for helpful comments,
