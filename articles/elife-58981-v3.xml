Here, we derive fundamental limits to the precision of morphogen concentration sensing for two canonical mechanisms: the diffusion of morphogen through extracellular space and the direct transport of morphogen from source cell to target cell, for example, via cytonemes. We find that direct transport establishes a morphogen profile without adding noise in the process. Despite this advantage, we find that for sufficiently large values of profile length, the diffusion mechanism is many times more precise due to a higher refresh rate of morphogen molecules.

Cells use this information to determine their position with extremely high precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erdmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Lachapelle and Bergmann, 2010</xref>). However, not all morphogen profiles are formed via the same mechanism and for some profiles the mechanism is still not well understood. One well-known mechanism is the synthesis-diffusion-clearance (SDC) model in which morphogen molecules are produced by localized source cells and diffuse through extracellular space before degrading or being internalized by target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lander et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilcockson et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, a direct transport (DT) model has been proposed where morphogen molecules travel through protrusions called cytonemes directly from the source cells to the target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressloff and Kim, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilcockson et al., 2017</xref>). The presence of these two alternative theories raises the question of whether there exists a difference in the performance capabilities between cells utilizing one or the other.</p><p>Experiments have shown that morphogen profiles display many characteristics consistent with the SDC model. The concentration of morphogen as a function of distance from the source cells has been observed to follow an exponential distribution for a variety of different morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002</xref>). The accumulation times for several morphogens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been measured and found to match the predictions made by the SDC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berezhkovskii et al., 2011</xref>). In zebrafish, the molecular dynamics of the morphogen Fgf8 have been measured and found to be consistent with Brownian diffusion through extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Despite these consistencies, recent experiments have lent support to the theory that morphogen molecules are transported through cytonemes rather than extracellular space. The establishment of the Hedgehog morphogen gradient in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is highly correlated in both space and time with the formation of cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>), while Wnt morphogens have been found to be highly localized around cell protrusions such as cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stanganello and Scholpp, 2016</xref>). Theoretical studies of both the SDC and DT models have examined these measurable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berezhkovskii et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressloff and Kim, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shvartsman and Baker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teimouri and Kolomeisky, 2016a</xref>), but direct comparisons between the two models have thus far been poorly explored. In particular, it remains unknown whether one model allows for a cell to sense its local morphogen concentration more precisely than the other given biological parameters such as the number of cells or the characteristic lengthscale of the profile.</p><p>Here, we derive fundamental limits to the precision of morphogen concentration sensing for both the SDC and DT models. We investigate the hypothesis that sensory precision plays a major role in the selection of a gradient formation mechanism during evolution, and we test this hypothesis by quantitatively comparing our theory to morphogen data. Intuitively one might expect the DT model to have less noise due to the fact that molecules are directly deposited at their target. Indeed, we find below that the noise arises only from molecular production and degradation, with no additional noise from molecular transport. However, we also find below that for sufficiently large morphogen profile lengthscales, the SDC model produces less noise than the DT model due to it being able achieve a higher effective unique molecule count. By elucidating the competing effects of profile amplitude, steepness, and noise, we ultimately conclude that there should exist a profile lengthscale below which the DT model is more precise and above which the SDC mechanism is more precise. We find that this prediction is quantitatively supported by data from a wide variety of morphogens, suggesting that readout precision plays an important role in determining the mechanisms of morphogen profile establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Several past studies have focused on the formation dynamics of morphogen profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berezhkovskii et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressloff and Kim, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shvartsman and Baker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teimouri and Kolomeisky, 2016a</xref>). Here, we model profiles in the steady state regime, as most of the experimental measurements to which we will later compare our results were taken during stages when the steady state approximation is valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanodia et al., 2009</xref>). Precision depends not only on stochastic fluctuations in the morphogen concentration, but also on the shape of the mean morphogen profile, as the shape determines concentration differences between adjacent cells that may adopt different fates. Therefore, as in past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tostevin et al., 2007</xref>), we define the precision as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the standard deviation of the number of morphogen molecules arriving at cell <italic>j</italic>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the difference between the molecule number in that cell and the adjacent cell. As is typical in studies of both the DT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teimouri and Kolomeisky, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressloff and Kim, 2018</xref>) and SDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berezhkovskii et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shvartsman and Baker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Teimouri and Kolomeisky, 2016b</xref>) mechanisms, we focus on a one-dimensional line of target cells. However, we derive analogous results for 2D and 3D systems, and we generally find that the dimensionality does not qualitatively change our results, as we discuss later. In 1D, cells extend in both directions from the source cell, with <italic>N</italic> cells on each side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We note that in the case of the Bicoid morphogen in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, target cells extend only on one side of the source. This will introduce a factor of 2 in the means of both the DT and SDC models and a factor slightly greater than 2 in the variance of the SDC model. This will not affect the agreement of the Bicoid data with our theory in Figure 4B.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Source cell (green) produces morphogen which is delivered to <italic>N</italic> target cells (blue) on either side via (<bold>A</bold>) direct transport (DT) or (<bold>B</bold>) synthesis-diffusion-clearance (SDC).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58981-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>A common method for determining the statistical properties of stochastic systems is to express the dynamics of their probability distributions in the form of a master equation. The first moment of the master equation then dictates the dynamics of the mean and becomes the rate equation. Higher order moments can be similarly used to calculate other statistical properties such as the variance. As we will show, in the case of the DT mechanism only the rate equation will be needed as the relevant statistical properties are identical to that of a simple birth-death system which is fully characterized by its mean. Conversely, the SDC mechanism has more complicated noise properties, which we will calculate via the first and second moments. Specifically, we will use a Langevin description which is expressed as a rate equation with noise terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardiner, 2004</xref>.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct transport model</title><p>We first consider the DT case, where morphogen molecules are transported via cytonemes that connect a single source cell to multiple target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cytonemes are tubular protrusions that are hundreds of nanometers thick and between several and hundreds of microns long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kornberg, 2014</xref>). They are supported by actin filaments, and it is thought that morphogen molecules are actively transported along the filaments via molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kornberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>). It was recently shown that a DT model that includes forward and backward transport of molecules within cytonemes reproduces experimentally measured accumulation times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teimouri and Kolomeisky, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bressloff and Kim, 2018</xref>), although the noise properties of this model were not considered. Here, we review the steady state properties of this model and derive its noise properties.</p><p>Consider a single source cell that produces morphogen at rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

An alternative model could involve neglecting this degradation step by counting the arrival of morphogen molecules rather than the concentration. This method can at best reduce the variance by a factor of 2 as the noise from degradation is eliminated but the noise from arrival remains. This would cause negligible change to our results presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4 given the order of magnitude difference in precision seen between our two models.</p><p>The dynamics of the mean

We see that for short profiles the DT model is more precise (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) whereas for long profiles the SDC model is more precise (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf150"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). This effect holds for a single source cell providing morphogen for a 1D line of target cells as well as for a 1D line of source cells with a 2D sheet of target cells and a 2D sheet of source cells with a 3D volume of target cells. For the DT model, the 2D and 3D cases are identical to the 1D case as we assume that cytonemes extend perpendicular to the source cells; for the SDC model see Appendix 1.</p><p>The reason that the SDC model is more precise for long profiles is that long profiles correspond to fast diffusion, which increases the refresh rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf151"><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>SDC</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> as discussed above. Conversely, the reason that the DT model is more precise for short profiles is that it has a larger amplitude. It also has a smaller steepness, but the larger amplitude wins out.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the morphogen Wingless (Wg) is localized near cell protrusions such as cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Kornberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stanganello and Scholpp, 2016</xref>), and the Hedgehog (Hh) gradient correlates highly in both space and time with the formation of cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that these two morphogen profiles are formed via a DT mechanism. Conversely, Bicoid has been understood as a model example of SDC for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, Dorsal is spread by diffusion; however, its absorption is localized to a specific region of target cells via a nonuniform degradation mechanism, making it more complex than the simple SDC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrell et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, for Dpp there is evidence for a variety of different gradient formation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilcockson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In zebrafish, the morphogen Fgf8 has been studied at the single molecule level and found to have molecular dynamics closely matching the Brownian movement expected in an SDC mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, Cyclops, Squint, Lefty1, and Lefty2, all of which are involved in the Nodal/Lefty system, have been shown to spread diffusively and affect cells distant from their source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Müller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogers and Müller, 2019</xref>). This would support the SDC mechanism, although Cyclops and Squint have been argued to be tightly regulated via a Gierer-Meinhardt type system, thus diminishing their gradient sizes to values much lower than what they would be without this regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gierer and Meinhardt, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogers and Müller, 2019</xref>).</p><p>For all these morphogens, we estimate the profile lengthscales <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> from the experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liberman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2012</xref>) (Appendix 3). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows these <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf161"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> values and indicates for each morphogen whether the evidence described above suggests a DT mechanism (red), an SDC mechanism (blue), or multiple mechanisms including DT and SDC (white).

For each morphogen species, we assume a 1D system for simplicity as we have checked that considering higher dimensions yields negligible differences to the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. We see that our theory predicts the correct threshold: the morphogens for which the evidence suggests either a DT or an SDC mechanism (red or blue) fall into the regime in which we predict that mechanism to be more precise for most of the cells, and the morphogens with multiple mechanisms (white) fall in between. This result provides quantitative support for the idea that morphogen profiles form according to the mechanism that maximizes the sensory precision of the target cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that in the steady-state regime, the DT and SDC models of morphogen profile formation yield different scalings of readout precision with the length of the profile and population size. As a result, there exist regimes in this parameter space in which either mechanism is more precise. While the DT model benefits from larger molecule numbers and no added noise from the transport process, the ability of molecules to diffuse into and away from a target cell in the SDC model allows the cell to measure a greater number of effectively unique molecules in the same time frame. By examining how these phenomena affect the cells’ sensory precision, we predicted that morphogen profiles with shorter lengths should utilize cytonemes or some other form of direct transport mechanism, whereas morphogens with longer profiles should rely on extracellular diffusion, a prediction that is in quantitative agreement with measurements on known morphogens. It will be interesting to observe whether this trend is further strengthened as more experimental evidence is obtained for different morphogens, as well as to expand the theory of multicellular concentration sensing to further biological contexts.</p><p>Despite the quantitative agreement between our theory and experiments, it is clear that the models presented here are minimal and thus cannot be directly applied to all systems. This is exemplified by morphogen such as Dorsal, which due to aforementioned diffusive spreading and nonuniform degradation mechanism clearly does not strictly follow either model. Additionally, the SDC model can be violated if the diffusion of morphogen through a biological environment is hindered by the typically crowded nature of such environments, leading to possibly subdiffusive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ellery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fanelli and McKane, 2010</xref>). For the DT model, we explicitly ignored the dynamics of the cytonemes themselves due to the growth rate of the cytonemes being sufficiently fast so as to traverse the entire system size in significantly less time than is required for the cells to integrate their morphogen counts over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). This assumption is problematic if cytonemes continue to behave dynamically after reaching the source cell. In particular, the process of cytonemes switching between phases of growing and retracting can introduce super-Poissonian noise sources to the morphogen count within the target cells. Super-Poissonian noise can also be introduced by relaxing the assumption that the morphogen molecules behave independently of each other as this was a critical component of our proof that the molecule count in the target cells is statistically identical to a birth-death process. Finally, it is conceivable that a hybrid system which utilizes a combination of diffusion and directed transport could be developed. However, we are unaware of any experimental study into such a possibility and as such have not considered it in this particular work. It will be interesting to explore the implications of each of these complications in future works.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Methods are described in Appendices 1, 2, and 3 along with more detailed evaluations of 2D and 3D SDC systems and further discussion of data used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.

For Bicoid, we obtain a value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf409"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of ∼100 µm from the text of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref> with and error of ±10 µm from the finding in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref> that cells have a ∼10% error in measuring the Bicoid gradient. We then take the <italic>a</italic> value of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo cells that are subjected to the Bicoid gradient to be ∼2.8 µm based on Figure 3A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>. We use the same figure to estimate the size of the whole embryo to be ∼500 µm or ∼90 cells. This value of <italic>a</italic> is also used for Dorsal as measurements of both Bicoid and Dorsal occur in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo at nuclear cycle 14. For the value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf410"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for Dorsal, we use Figure 3D from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liberman et al., 2009</xref> to obtain a full width at 60% max of 45 ± 10 µm. Since this represents the width of Gaussian fit on both sides of the source whereas our model uses an exponential profile, we assume the appropriate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf411"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> value for such an exponential fit would be half this value, 22.5 ± 5 µm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> from the same source also shows that the distance from the ventral midline to the dorsal midline is ∼200 µm or ∼35 cells.</p><p>For Dpp and Wg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref> provides explicit measurements of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf412"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for each. These values are 20.2 ± 5.7 µm and 5.8 ± 2.04 µm respectively. For Hh, we use Figure S2C in the supplementary material of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref> to determine <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf413"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> to be 8 ± 3 µm. Dpp, Wg, and Hh all occur in the wing disc during the third instar of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. As such, we use a common value of <italic>a</italic> for all three. This value is taken to be 1.3 µm based on the area of the cells being reported as 5.5 ± 0.8 µm<sup>2</sup> in the supplementary material of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kicheva et al., 2007</xref> and the assumption that the cells are circular. Additionally, the scale bar for Figure 1A in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref> shows the maximal distance from the morphogen producing midline of the wing disc to its edge to be ∼250 µm or ∼100 cells.</p><p>The <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf414"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> value of Fgf8 is reported as being 197 ± 7 µm in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>. Additionally, based off the scale bars seen in Figure 2C–E of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>, we estimate the value of <italic>a</italic> for the cells to be ∼10 µm. For the morphogens involved in the Nodal/Lefty system (cyclops, squint, lefty1, and lefty2), measurements of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf415"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for each are taken from Figure 2C–F of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2012</xref> by observing where the average of the three curves crosses the 37% of max threshold with error bars given by the width of the region in which the vertical error bars of each plot intersect this threshold line. We assume the <italic>a</italic> value of each morphogen in the Nodal/Lefty system to be equivalent to the <italic>a</italic> value of cells in the Fgf8 measurements performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref>. This is because the measurements made in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2012</xref> were taken during the blastula stage of the zebrafish development while measurements taken in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2009</xref> we taken in the sphere germ ring stage. These stages occur at ∼2.25 and ∼5.67 hpf respectively, but the blastula stage can last until ∼6 hpf based on the timeline of zebrafish development presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>. As such, since there is potential overlap in the time frame of these two stages, we assume the cells maintain a relatively fixed size and thus that the value of <italic>a</italic> for the Nodal/Lefty system can be taken as the same value of <italic>a</italic> used for Fgf8. Additionally, as seen in Figures 8F and 11B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>, these two stages also share a rougly equal overall diameter of the embryo of ∼500 µm at the largest point. This creates a circumference of ∼1600 µm or ∼80 cells, which in turn means the morphogen must travel a maximum distance of ∼40 cells away from the source.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Morphogen</th><th>Organism</th><th><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf416"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (µm)</th><th><italic>a</italic> (µm)</th><th><italic>N</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Bicoid</td><td><italic>Drosophila</italic></td><td>100 ± 10</td><td>2.8</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Fgf8</td><td>Zebrafish</td><td>197 ± 7</td><td>10</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Lefty2</td><td>Zebrafish</td><td>150 ± 25</td><td>10</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Lefty1</td><td>Zebrafish</td><td>115 ± 20</td><td>10</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Dpp</td><td><italic>Drosophila</italic></td><td>20.2 ± 5.7</td><td>1.3</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Dorsal</td><td><italic>Drosophila</italic></td><td>22.5 ± 5</td><td>2.8</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Squint</td><td>Zebrafish</td><td>65 ± 10</td><td>10</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Cyclops</td><td>Zebrafish</td><td>30 ± 5</td><td>10</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>Hh</td><td><italic>Drosophila</italic></td><td>8 ± 3</td><td>1.3</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Wg</td><td><italic>Drosophila</italic></td><td>5.8 ± 2.04</td><td>1.3</td><td>100</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58981.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>Raymond E</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>During embryonic development, morphogen gradients provide positional information to differentiating cells.

The issue is that cells know about their positions in the organism, and thus their intended cell fates, from measurements of morphogen concentrations. There will necessarily be uncertainty due noise in this concentration, and evolution has presumably favored mechanisms that reduce this noise (in particular relative to signal – namely the average difference in morphogen levels between adjacent cells). The first mechanism is direct transport (DT) of morphogen from a source cell to target cells via specific channels (e.g. cytonemes). The second mechanism is simple diffusion with degradation, which they call synthesis-diffusion-clearance (SDC). By rigorously formulating noise models for these different schemes, the authors draw several interesting conclusions. First, the transport process associated with DT does not in itself contribute to the noise. This follows from the assumption that morphogen molecules are independent so that the details of transport only yield a the net rate of arrival of molecules at the target cell. More importantly, the authors discover that there is a cross-over as a function of profile length from DT as the preferred mechanism to SDC as the preferred mechanism. The authors do an excellent job of presenting intuitive arguments for this and other results. (In this case, the essential disadvantage of the DT mechanism is that cells can only glean information from the morphogens that they absorb, whereas in the SDC mechanism cells can sense all molecules that pass by them.) The authors follow up this theoretical study with an analysis of multiple developmental morphogen systems. The results are impressively consistent with their theoretical predictions concerning which mechanism has higher signal-to-noise given the profile lengths. Overall, this is an exemplary paper: it identifies an important unrecognized question, rigorously formulates and solves theoretical models to address the question, and carefully applies the results to gain original insights into well-studied developmental systems.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We find the notation in the paper is unnecessarily complicated. For example, all the overbars in Equation 1 are not needed if the quantities are defined to be the mean. Otherwise, we have symbols with three labels, the bar, the j and +/-. Notation in a biology journal must be very carefully chosen for maximum simplicity and clarity. Likewise, the δ functions in these equations could more clearly be shifted to statements about boundary conditions, which would be more intuitive. Remember, very few biologists understand δ functions!</p><p>2) The argument presented in the third paragraph of the subsection “Direct Transport Model” is a key one, but we find that it could be explained more clearly. Perhaps by reference to a more detailed diagram?</p><p>3) The lack of parallel construction between the presentations of the two models is odd. The DT model is presented as a set of deterministic ODEs for mean concentrations, while the diffusive model (itself an averaged equation) has noise terms added. We would have expected the statement about the noise effect in the DT model to be deduced from some underlying master equation of which the presented model is simply the first moment(s), but that higher order moments are necessary to calculate to draw conclusions about the model.</p><p>4) Stepping back from the calculations we are struck by the following question. If, as stated: &quot;We see that regardless of the form of <italic>p(τ)</italic>, the probability of a morphogen molecule entering the target cell in any given small time window δ<italic>t</italic> is simply <italic>β</italic>δ<italic>t</italic>. This result holds regardless of the mechanism by which morphogen molecules go</p><p>from the source cell to the target cell, as the only effect such a mechanism can have is on <italic>p(τ)</italic>&quot;, then why can't we substitute a diffusive mechanism and deduce the same thing?</p><p>5) The authors assume that once a morphogen molecule has reached the end of the cytoneme, it is immediately absorbed by the target cell.

For example, the authors chose to study the precision ratio as a function of the gradient length, while optimizing over the DT shape φ. Βut we could also imagine a comparison in which the production and degradation rates are kept the same for both models (because production and degradation are energetically costly), but that over all other parameters the precision is optimized. Would that give a qualitatively different result? Why would the gradient range λ be of special importance (the comparison is made on the footing of equal gradient range)? Should not only the precision matter (such that it would be fine that the gradients in the DT and SDC model are different)? In other words, how do the maximal precisions that can be reached given reasonable constraints (such as production and degradation rates) compare, as a function of the distance to the source?</p><p>7) And in making this comparison, does the SDC model exhibit an optimal diffusion constant that maximizes the precision? Understanding this is probably important, because when, in the current comparison, the SDC model is more precise, it is because of the higher protein clearance rate due to diffusion. Yet, a higher diffusion constant also lowers the steepness of the gradient, decreasing the precision,</p><p>8) The key mechanism by which the SDC model can become superior is indeed diffusion.

Specifically, we now discuss in much greater detail which parameters are equated between the two models and why. The reviewers are correct to point out that the production and degradation rates (<italic>β</italic> and <italic>ν</italic>) should be equated due to their energetic restrictions. While we now present this as our rationale for equating <italic>β</italic>, we also discuss why the explicit value of <italic>ν</italic> is not relevant so long as&lt;inline-graphic mime-subtype=&quot;png&quot; mimetype=&quot;image&quot; xlink:href=&quot;media/image1.png&quot; /&gt; holds true. Thus, while equating <italic>β</italic> and <italic>ν</italic> between models is consistent with our procedure, it still leaves the profile lengthscale <italic>λ</italic><sup>ˆ</sup> as a free parameter. Because the profile lengthscale is a frequently measured parameter across a variety of developmental systems, and our goal here is not only to understand the physical mechanisms behind developmental precision but also to quantitatively compare to data, we do not optimize over <italic>λ</italic><sup>ˆ</sup>. Instead we imagine that the profile lengthscale is set by a functional objective of the developing system, such as where a boundary is to form, and we ask, given this constraint, which model has the higher precision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) And in making this comparison, does the SDC model exhibit an optimal diffusion constant that maximizes the precision?

However, this optimal value depends on the choice of cell position: a smaller diffusion coefficient maximizes precision at nearby cells, whereas a larger diffusion coefficient maximizes precision at faraway cells. For the same reasons as outlined in the previous response, we do not presuppose the position at which the maximal precision is desired. Instead, we vary <italic>λ</italic><sup>ˆ</sup>, which allows us to compare the two models systematically and then compare the results to the experimental data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The key mechanism by which the SDC model can become superior is indeed diffusion.

How could correlated transport be included in the DT model?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, there have not been detailed experimental studies into the correlation between dynamics of individual morphogen molecules within cytonemes. Introducing correlated transport would violate a key assumption of our argument presented in our new Figure 2 and would create nonlinear and most likely unsolvable noise terms. As such, we consider the investigation into correlated transport to be beyond the scope of this particular work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Also, in the DT model could noise be reduced by cells measuring arrivals of particles rather than averaging over internal concentration of particles? This would presumably only change the resulting expression for precision by a numerical factor, but could this factor shift the balance in favor of DT in some cases?</p></disp-quote><p>Measuring the arrival rate of molecules in the DT model would at best reduce the variance by a factor of 2, as the noise from degradation would be eliminated but the noise from arrival would remain. While this would increase the precision of the DT model, it would not do so significantly enough, and our results remain almost entirely unchanged by its inclusion. We have added a footnote in the manuscript to address this possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
