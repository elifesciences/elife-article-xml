for 93 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) isolates from seven lineages paired with fully-annotated, finished, de novo assembled genomes. Integrative analysis yielded four key results. First, methyltransferase allele-methylome mapping corrected methyltransferase variant effects previously obscured by reference-based variant calling. Second, heterogeneity analysis of partially active methyltransferase alleles revealed that intracellular stochastic methylation generates a mosaic of methylomes within isogenic cultures, which we formalize as ‘intercellular mosaic methylation’ (IMM). Mutation-driven IMM was nearly ubiquitous in the globally prominent Beijing sublineage. Third, promoter methylation is widespread and associated with differential expression in the <italic>ΔhsdM</italic> transcriptome, suggesting promoter HsdM-methylation directly influences transcription. Finally, comparative and functional analyses identified 351 sites hypervariable across isolates and numerous putative regulatory interactions. This multi-omic integration revealed features of methylomic variability in clinical isolates and provides a rational basis for hypothesizing the functions of DNA adenine methylation in MTBC physiology and adaptive evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>dna methylation</kwd><kwd>phenotypic plasticity</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>intracellular stochastic methylation</kwd><kwd>intercellular mosaic methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI105185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Modlin</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Conkle-Gutierrez</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Calvin</given-names></name><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Scott N</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrissey</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramirez-Busby</surname><given-names>Sarah M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoffner</surname><given-names>Sven E</given-names></name><name><surname>Valafar</surname><given-names>Faramarz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fully assembled DNA methylomes from phylogeographically diverse clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates reveals 'intercellular mosaic methylation' as a source of epigenetic diversity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2017, tuberculosis (TB) killed 1.6 million people globally, the most of any infectious disease, despite significant TB control efforts and the availability of effective TB drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">WHO, 2017</xref>). Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens control efforts and debilitates patients through a grueling and often ineffective treatment regimen (52% success) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">WHO, 2017</xref>). The primary causative agent of TB, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, has a low mutation rate, and is reported to evolve chiefly through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). However, subpopulations of the pathogen consistently persist through chemotherapeutics, eventually developing full antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jain et al., 2016</xref>). It is unclear how such a genetically static organism adapts so rapidly to drug treatment and varied immune pressures.</p><p>DNA methylation is a plausible yet scarcely explored alternative mechanism for phenotypic variation in <italic>M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis</italic> encodes three known DNA methyltransferases (MTases), MamA, MamB, and HsdM, which each target a different sequence motif for N6-adenine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have shown that loss-of-function (inactive) variants in these genes are common, and often associate with lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phelan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). These minor differences in genotype result in radically different methylomes, potentially explaining the phenotypic variation observed between lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phelan et al., 2018</xref>). However, these studies examined only a handful of isolates from each lineage of the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC), included few or no resistant isolates, and did not directly examine kinetics at each motif, relying instead on the motifs identified from single-molecule, real-time sequencing (SMRT-sequencing) software to classify isolates as lacking methylation of a motif entirely.</p><p>Prokaryotic DNA methylation has been shown to mediate diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hernday et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ringquist and Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wright et al., 1997</xref>), far beyond its originally understood role as the self-protective component of Restriction-Modification systems (RM systems). MTases that lack restriction enzymes, termed ‘orphan’ MTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>) are highly conserved within phyla, and nearly ubiquitous, though diverse, across phyla, suggesting orphan MTases are functionally important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, both MamA and HsdM are orphan MTases, while MamB shares sequence homology with Type IIG RM enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), and therefore ostensibly has a functional restriction endonuclease domain. One emerging role for orphan MTases is regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardissone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Low and Casadesús, 2008</xref>). In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, MamA-mediated transcriptional regulation has been demonstrated at four promoters in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shell et al., 2013</xref>), presumably through interaction with the −10 promoter element. A second characterized mechanism of DNA methylation mediated cis-regulation is interaction between methylated bases, MTases, and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hernday et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stephenson and Brown, 2016</xref>), which has been hypothesized to occur at specific sites in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phelan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous interrogation of cis-regulation by DNA methylation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> through SMRT-sequencing identified seven differentially methylated sites upstream of differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>). However, only Euro-American and Indo-Oceanic (IO) isolates were analyzed, and only the 200 base pairs (bp) upstream of differentially expressed genes were examined for methylation, rather than a window more rigorously informed by mapped promoters and potential mechanisms of cis-regulation. More recently, an integrative analysis of SMRT-sequencing kinetics and differential transcription (RNAseq) following MTase knockout (Δ<italic>hsdM</italic>) in a <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> clinical isolate concluded that HsdM-methylation did not directly affect transcript levels under their tested conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiner-Oms et al., 2019</xref>). However, the single tested condition and limited definition of HsdM-methylated promoters (overlap with SigA Pribnow boxes) invoke skepticism toward this conclusion. Thus, the extent of DNA methylation mediated transcriptional regulation in the MTBC and its effect on phenotype remain open questions.</p><p>Heterogeneous DNA methylation has been reported in several bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>). Heterogeneous methylation can be caused by spontaneous mutations inactivating MTase coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>), site-specific occlusion from DNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atack et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wallecha et al., 2002</xref>), or intracellular stochastic methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>). When DNA methylation regulates gene expression, heterogeneous methylation creates multiple phenotypes within isogenic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>). This phenotypic plasticity aids rapid adaptation to changing environmental pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cota et al., 2016</xref>) and nutrient constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atack et al., 2018</xref>) for other bacteria. However, no study has examined heterogeneous methylation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Here, through comparative, functional, and heterogeneity analysis, we sought to characterize how DNA adenine methylomes vary within and across MTBC clinical isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Integrative analysis of whole DNA adenine methylomes of 93 MTBC clinical isolates</title><p>We analyzed MTBC DNA adenine methylomes through four strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, we used finished genomes assembled from long-read sequencing data and transferred annotations of functional and regulatory elements from virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> type strain H37Rv. This retained syntenic relationships and enabled facile comparative analyses without invoking assumptions inherent to <italic>ab initio</italic> methods. Second, we included the sequencing kinetics at all MTase motif sites in every isolate. This contrasts with the approach of prior <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> methylome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiner-Oms et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phelan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), which examined only the MTase motifs identified by PacBio MotifMaker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/MotifMaker">https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/MotifMaker</ext-link>). This systematic approach revealed MTase genotypes with partial function, previously mischaracterized as completely inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>). Third, we used phylogenetic analysis to identify convergent MTase activity and heterogeneity analysis to characterize epigenomic diversity in vitro. Finally, we integrated transcription start sites (TSSs), transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and sigma factor binding sites (SFBSs) into our methylomic analyses. This helped us identify promoter methylation and potential cis (promoters and SFBSs) and trans (TFBSs) interactions between MTase motif sites and regulatory effectors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design and approach to whole-methylome analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Isolate selection. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> clinical isolates were obtained from tuberculosis (TB) patient sputa from four countries of high TB-burden (India, Moldova, South Africa, and The Philippines), and Sweden (primarily isolated from migrants originating in high TB-burden countries). Isolates were cultured, DNA extracted and sent to the Genomic Medicine Genomics Center at UCSD for amplification-free sequencing (PacBio RSII, P6C4 chemistry). Clinical isolates were supplemented by technical replicate control runs of avirulent reference strains, and publicly available clinical isolates along with technical triplicates of H37Rv (BioProject Nos.

Raw kinetic data were log-transformed, scaled, and standardized according to run-specific statistics in unmodified bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Variation between technical replicates were used to adjust priors based on coverage to build pdfs for a Bayesian classifier. Methylation status of characterized motifs was classified with a Bayes’ classifier based on kinetics of unmodified and modified bases for each motif (Materials and methods). We processed all motifs of identified MTBC complex methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) and assembled the methylome of each isolate with each motif site classified as methylated, hypomethylated, or indeterminate.

IPD ratios are reported as the average IPD ratio observed across sequencing reads mapped to each position, which originate from different cells. Therefore, if isolate colonies contained subpopulations of cells with different methylomes, it would result in the intermediate IPD ratios we observed. Heterogeneous methylation can be caused by different phenomena, including phase-variant MTase activity, intracellular stochastic methylation, or transient hemimethylation from a subset of cells undergoing cell division. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined IPD signals at the read level using SMALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A subset of DNA MTase alleles drive constitutive intercellular mosaic methylation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></title><p>Within each sequencing read, the software SMALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>) calculates the average IPD (natural log-transformed) across multiple motif sites targeted by the same MTase.

SMALR native IPD values can also potentially distinguish transient hemimethylation from intracellular stochastic methylation and phase-variant MTase activity.

This unimodal, normal distribution of intermediate native IPD values implies intracellular stochastic methylation, rather than phase-variant MTase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>). While phase-variant MTase activity has been observed in many bacteria, intracellular stochastic methylation has previously only been observed in a single species, <italic>Chromohalobacter salexigens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>After observing this intracellular stochastic methylation in <italic>mamA</italic><sub>G152S</sub> isolates, we analyzed heterogeneity in isolates with partially active MamA (E270A) and MamB (K1033T).

However, the effect of methylation of sequencing kinetics can vary between motif sequences, and so we cannot conclude from our data that limited activity is present.

Multiple HsdM motif sites clustered together on the same subread too infrequently for analysis with SMALR, precluding analysis of potential heterogeneity with SMALR (isolates had on average 3898.6 MamA, 822.9 MamB, and 719.4 HsdM sites).</p><p>While these intermediate native IPD value distributions for <italic>mamA</italic><sub>E270A</sub>, <italic>mamA</italic><sub>G152S</sub>, and <italic>mamB</italic><sub>K1033T</sub> are consistent with intracellular stochastic methylation, they would also be produced by consistent methylation of some motif sites and consistent lack of methylation in the remaining sites. By examining isolates with these partially active alleles, we see that mean IPD ratios for motif sites distribute unimodally at intermediate values rather than bimodally (purple-filled traces for MamA and MamB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, we reject this alternative explanation and conclude that intracellular stochastic methylation generates diverse combinations of methylated motif sites within the bacilli from which the sequenced DNA was isolated. We call this epigenetic mosaicism ‘intercellular mosaic methylation’. The methylomic diversity in intercellular mosaic methylation is distinct from the two discrete phases generated from phase-variable methylation, instead generating a mosaic of methylation patterns among the cells comprising an isogenic colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether methionine restriction could induce intercellular mosaic methylation in isolates with wild-type MTase function. Methionine is directly linked to DNA methylation by its requirement of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl group donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Parveen and Cornell, 2011</xref>). We reasoned that if methionine starvation induces intercellular mosaic methylation, the effect could be extrapolated to other nutrient restrictions that limit flux through the adenine methylation reaction, such as precursor metabolites for SAM synthesis or trace metal ion cofactors required for SAM biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Czyrko et al., 2018</xref>) and adenine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bist and Rao, 2003</xref>).

The ∆<italic>metA</italic> native IPD value distribution was distinct from the simulated mixture, with fewer fully methylated reads and more partially methylated reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with a mixture of fully methylated reads inherited from bacilli born prior to methionine deprivation and stochastically methylated reads from daughter strands that underwent partial re-methylation following starvation. These results suggest that intercellular mosaic methylation can be induced by nutrient limitation (at least for methionine, and presumably other nutrient constraints that limit flux through the adenine methyltransferase reaction), providing a potential mechanism of environmentally induced phenotypic heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Anomalous methylation patterns in orphan MTase motif sites</title><p>Next, we surveyed all common motif sites (present in ≥75 isolates, n = 4,486; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) for patterns in their variation across isolates and motif sites.

First, while most motif sites were primarily methylated (light yellow), a subset had significantly lower median IPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Second, among the mostly methylated motif sites, a handful had lower IPDs in a subset of isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The converse was also true; some motif sites with low median IPDs had higher IPDs in a subset of isolates. Third, partially active MTases had distinct methylation profiles with median IPDs between those of inactive and wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). All three features were more pronounced in HsdM and MamA motif sites than in MamB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C,E</xref>).</p><p>MamA and HsdM are orphan MTases, which frees their motif sites to remain unmethylated without risking degradation from a cognate restriction enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>), potentially explaining their variable methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) compared to MamB. To corroborate MamB as a full RM system rather than an orphan MTase, we searched InterPro database for functional domains and identified a putative restriction endonuclease (REase) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) as its cognate REase. Single chain restriction-modification fusions are a defining characteristic of Type IIG RM systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen et al., 2011</xref>), which MamB belongs to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>. Orphaned MTases can safely leave motif sites unmethylated, affording the opportunity to evolve essential functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>). At such sites, advantageous methylation states can be selected for following prolonged culturing. Considering this, we sought to identify motif sites that were hypervariable across strains with active MTases, reasoning that it would indicate differential selection for methylation status during culture prior to sequencing and highlight interesting differences between strains. To find hypervariable sites, we calculated the standard deviation (SD) in IPD ratio across isolates for each MTase site. Variation across isolates for each qualifying motif site was compared against the distribution of SD (standard deviation of SD across MamB sites) in MamB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), because they distributed normally and with few outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We defined motif sites with SD ≥3 standard deviations above the mean SD of MamB motif sites. Of 4486 common (in ≥75 isolates) MTase motif sites, 351 were hypervariable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These hypervariable sites fell within 204 coding regions, and within promoter-proximal regions upstream (within 100 bp) of 25 TSSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Yet only seven hypervariable sites were MamB motifs. Hypervariability was 9.43-fold more prevalent in motif sites of orphan MTases than in MamB motif sites (95% CI: 4.50–23.7). This marked enrichment (p = 3.39×10<sup>−17</sup>, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) of hypervariable motif sites in MamA (n = 240) and HsdM (n = 104) is consistent with the lack of selection pressure against unmethylated sites characteristic of orphan MTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Hypomethylated MTase motif sites are rare yet remarkably consistent across isolates</title><p>One characteristic of orphan MTases is hypomethylated sites, specific genome sites lacking or absent of methylation despite the presence of an MTase target motif and active MTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>).

To identify hypomethylated sites in each of our isolates, we applied Bayesian classification to their sequencing kinetics. Active isolates averaged 20.7 hypomethylated HsdM sites, 13.4 hypomethylated MamA sites, and 0.289 hypomethylated MamB sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), comparable to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). However, while rare, these hypomethylated motif sites showed remarkable consistency, with the same MTase motif loci hypomethylated in multiple isolates. The most conserved hypomethylated locus was within <italic>mmpL4</italic>, 1,719 bp downstream of its start. Despite having a MamA target motif, this locus was unmethylated in 51 MamA active isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In total, 34 MamA loci and 58 HsdM loci were consistently hypomethylated (p-value&lt;4.72E-07, cumulative binomial, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These loci included 18 of the top 10 frequently hypomethylated MamA and HsdM sites in a previous study of 12 MTBC strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Nonetheless, the number of adoptable states is large enough that states are practically certain to differ between parent and daughter cells. Second, IMM is distinct in the pattern of epigenetic inheritance from parent to daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In mosaic-like methylomes driven by independent switching of phase-variable MTases (canonically a frameshift) and DoMo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furuta et al., 2014</xref>) (via homologous recombining of TRDs) the methylome-patterning determinant is passed genetically to the daughter strand, unless there is a phase change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sánchez-Romero and Casadesús, 2020</xref>). IMM lacks a genetic basis for transgenerational methylome inheritance and no epigenetic mechanism of inheritance for IMM in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is known at present. Consequently, our current knowledge suggests a greater degree of methylomic diversity is spread throughout the population in each replication event, but that any advantageous methylation patterns would lack a stabilizing mechanism. This apparent differential capacity to produce epigenetic lineages assumes that in IMM, the methylation status of parent strand motif sites has no effect on the probability of daughter strand motif sites being methylated. Empirically testing this assumption would refine our understanding of the implications IMM has for adaptive evolution.</p><p>Transcriptional influence by DNA adenine methylation is prevalent among human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>). Previous study of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genes with MamA-methylated promoters demonstrated that DNA adenine methylation directly influences the expression of genes with MamA target motifs in their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shell et al., 2013</xref>). Our promoter annotation expands the set of promoters potentially regulated by MamA-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) and our <italic>ΔhsdM-</italic>DE analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) strongly suggests that HsdM-methylation at promoters directly influences transcription. This provides a potential mechanism in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> for heterogeneous methylation to produce heterogeneous phenotypes.</p><p>The physiological consequences of mycobacterial gene expression control by DNA methylation, however, remain to be identified. Therefore, the adaptive benefits of phenotypic heterogeneity ostensibly conferred by IMM remain hypothetical. Theoretical grounds for phenotypic heterogeneity to confer survival benefits have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wolf et al., 2005</xref>), as have examples of adaptive phenotypic heterogeneity driven by DNA methylation in bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atack et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Low and Casadesús, 2008</xref>). The adaptive benefit of any epigenetically influenced process depends on the degree to and manner in which it is heritable across generations. In the absence of an identified mechanism favoring self-perpetuity, our description of IMM provides bacterial populations with a means for retaining adaptive methylation patterns, but not for amplifying them. Without heritability, IMM-driven phenotypic heterogeneity could still confer adaptive benefit through a ‘bet-hedging’ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casadesús and Low, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wolf et al., 2005</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with observations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> ‘persister cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vilchèze et al., 2017</xref>), minority groups that are pre-adapted to tolerate initial exposure to macrophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>) and drug pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keren et al., 2011</xref>), by entering dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jain et al., 2016</xref>) or activating efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colangeli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mustyala et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Future work examining changes in methylation patterns in strains with IMM-conferring MTases under selective pressure would help determine whether DNA adenine methylation patterns are heritable in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and whether IMM is compatible with the hypothesis of ‘epigenetic-driven adaptive evolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Furuta and Kobayashi, 2012</xref>). The hypervariability of numerous orphan MTase loci (n = 344, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) could be taken to imply differential selection of methylation patterns across isolates (in vitro). Two observations provide circumstantial evidence in support of this interpretation. First, hypomethylation (which coincides with many hypervariable sites, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>) is a signature of epigenetic regulation in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting genes with hypervariable promoter motif sites (n = 11, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) are epigenetically regulated, providing a potential basis for differential selection across strains. Second, several sites are methylated at similar levels between three EAS isolates and a genetically distant (SNP distance ≥ 2,722) <italic>M. africanum</italic> isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) suggesting convergent epigenomic selection in vitro. This convergence was not driven by MTase genotype, as the isolates had discordant HsdM alleles. Notably, convergently methylated sites between these isolates included <italic>ΔhsdM</italic>-DE persistence (<italic>raaS</italic>) and dormancy (<italic>Rv1813c</italic> and <italic>glpX</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting methylation at these sites affect promoter strength and raising the possibility that these methylation patterns have important phenotypic consequences. However, both these observations may be due to a secondary effect, such as MTase antagonism driven by mutations in DNA-binding proteins, as we observed at <italic>cobK</italic> 304 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), or some other primary factor. Taken together, the evidence from this work is insufficient to conclude that any sites are under epigenetic selection.</p><p>Our promoter methylation analysis produced different results than a recently published analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiner-Oms et al., 2019</xref>) and reached opposing conclusions for the role of HsdM in regulating promoter strength. While the authors conclude that ‘methylation seems to play a minimal role in shaping in-vitro gene expression’, integration of our HsdM motif-harboring promoters with their <italic>ΔhsdM</italic> RNAseq data shows a clear association between HsdM promoter methylation and in vitro gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We believe differences in approach drove our disparate conclusions. For their analysis, Chiner-Oms and colleagues relied on reference-mapping and a single source of TSSs, and they focused on SigA motifs to identify promoter MTase motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiner-Oms et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we transferred TSS annotations from two <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transcriptomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shell et al., 2015</xref>) to contiguous regions of finished de novo assemblies, and scanned for SigA-SigM SFBS motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>) and promoters lacking known SFBSs. These differences explain why our analysis captured the association between HsdM-methylation and expression of downstream genes.</p><p>By integrating DNA adenine methylomes with fully-annotated genome assemblies and TSS-mapping data, this work generates a corpus of putative interactions between DNA methylation and regulatory effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary files 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">7</xref>), providing a basis for generating specific, testable functional hypotheses for DNA adenine methylation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

Methylated promoters implicate some hallmarks of the Beijing sublineage: facile dormancy induction, increased host-lipid utilization, TAG accumulation in aerobic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reed et al., 2007</xref>), and increased synthesis of cell envelope components and virulence lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). While some of these hallmarks have been attributed to genetic factors, such as higher basal expression of the DosR-regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reed et al., 2007</xref>), gaps remain in our understanding. One hypothesis is that, in Beijing isolates, MamA<sub>E270A</sub>-driven mosaicism confers phenotypic heterogeneity, thereby enabling access to a greater number of phenotypic solutions during adaptive evolution. This hypothesis could be investigated by exposing MamA<sub>WT</sub> and MamA<sub>E270A</sub> mutants to different selection pressures and comparing evolutionary outcomes and methylomes of the adapted strains.</p><p>We cannot extrapolate directly from the DNA methylation patterns we report here to what occurs during infection. Sequencing kinetics are measured from DNA extracted after extensive culturing, during which any methylomic adaptation to the host environment may have changed. Directly sequencing from patient specimens would be ideal to assay DNA methylation patterns in vivo, but DNA input requirements necessitate culturing prior to DNA extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">PACBIO, 2013</xref>), as DNA amplification erases epigenetic markings. Studying methylomic adaptation to host-like conditions (e.g. hypoxia, host-lipids as carbon source) can reveal context-dependent selection of methylation patterns, and time-course serial sequencing could characterize the dynamics of their selection. Coupling these sequencing studies with transcriptomic, proteomic, and phenotypic assays could clarify the relationship between DNA adenine methylation, gene expression, and phenotype.</p><p>Throughout this manuscript we have referred to the DNA adenine methyltransferase encoded by Rv2756c as HsdM (<italic>hsdM</italic> for the gene) and its specificity subunit encoded by Rv2761, as HsdS (<italic>hsdS</italic> for the gene) to be consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shell et al., 2013</xref>). It appears that Rv2756c was originally referred to as HsdM based on homology to <italic>hsdM</italic> in R-M systems—before the existence of its restriction component had been investigated—and has propagated through subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiner-Oms et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Phelan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has since been determined that Rv2756c lacks a functional HsdR component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). According to the prevailing nomenclature conventions, the symbol ‘hsd’ is for Type 1 R-M systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Loenen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>), which Rv2756c is not part of, since it lacks a functional restriction component.

These IPD ratios were then log-transformed to produce a normal distribution and standardized by subtracting the mean IPD ratio (also log-transformed) of all adenines outside of MTase motifs in the isolate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>MTase motif locus assignment</title><p>To track MTase motif sites across isolates, each MTase motif site in each isolate was assigned a locus tag based on the nearest gene. For each isolate, a custom python script read a CSV file with the genome positions of each MTase motif site in the isolate, and the isolate’s genome annotation EMBL file. Using the genome positions of annotated coding sequences (CDS), the script identified the nearest gene boundary (CDS start or CDS stop) to each MTase motif site and assigned each site a locus tag. The locus tag contained the gene name of the neighboring gene boundary, the distance in nucleotides between the MTase site and the gene’s CDS start position, an indicator whether the MTase site was on the same strand as the gene (sense) or the opposite strand (antisense), and an indicator whether the gene was downstream or upstream of the CDS start.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Characterizing the kinetic error profile across technical replicates</title><p>We characterized the error profile of sequencing kinetics by comparing the IPD ratio of each base between replicate sequencing runs, and measuring how that variance increased with coverage. We used two sequencing runs on DNA isolated from avirulent type strain H37Ra sequenced at UCSD, and two publicly available sequencing runs on virulent type strain H37Rv (Bioproject accession PRJEB8783). We first log-transformed the IPD ratio of each base to account for the skewed distribution of ratio values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We then plotted the difference in log-transformed IPD ratio of each base between runs by genome position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and by per base coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using R’s cor.test function with the ‘pearson’ method, we tested the significance of the correlation between per base coverage and the difference in log-transformed IPD ratio of each base between runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Characterization of MTase activity of MTase genotypes</title><p>For each MTase and each isolate, a custom R script plotted the distribution of log-transformed, scaled IPD ratios of each MTase motif site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A &amp; D</xref>). For all three MTases, MTase genotype reliably corresponded to distribution of sequencing at their respective motif sites. For most isolates, sequencing kinetics centered around 0 (consistent with no methylation) or around a narrow band consistent with full m6A methylation. MTase genotypes for these cases were labeled accordingly as ‘fully active’ or ‘inactive’ (loss-of-function). MTase genotypes for the remaining minority of cases, where sequencing kinetics distributed around a mean between 0 and the value around which fully active isolates distributed, were labeled as ‘partially active’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Identification of hypervariable MTase motif loci</title><p>For each MTase, a custom R script found the set of MTase motif site loci present in at least 75 isolates. For each locus, summary statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) of mean log<sub>2</sub> (IPD Ratio) were calculated exclusively from isolates with active genotypes of the relevant MTase. The same was then performed to obtain median and standard deviation of mean log<sub>2</sub> (IPD Ratio) for inactive isolates of each activity profile for each MTase, and, for MamA, for isolates with the common E270A <italic>mamA</italic> genotype. Hypervariable HsdM, MamA, and MamB motif sites were classified as those more than 3 s.D above the mean variability (standard deviation across isolates with active MamB at that site) for MamB motif sites, since they had the fewest outliers and are not an orphan MTase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Heterogeneous methylation analysis</title><p>SMALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>) requires a de novo assembled genome FASTA file, a target motif, and a cmp.h5 file with aligned reads, to extract the IPD data from each MTase target motif site within each read. We ran SMALR on 96 samples using the MamA target motif C<underline>T</underline>GG<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>G. The isolates had the following <italic>mamA</italic> genotypes: 49 were wild-type, four were W136R, four were G152S, and 34 were E270A. We also ran SMALR on 70 isolates using the MamB target motif CACGC<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>G. The isolates had the following <italic>mamB</italic> genotypes: 60 were wild-type, nine had an loss-of-function variant, and one had the partially active variant K1033T. We then filtered out isolates with fewer than 20 total reads from downstream analysis. We additionally ran SMALR with the MamA target motif C<underline>T</underline>GG<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>G on one isolate assembled from published sequencing reads from a <italic>∆metA</italic> mutant of H37Rv that was SMRT-sequenced following 5 days of methionine starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berney et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For each isolate, a cmp.h5 was generated by aligning its reads to its assembled FASTA file using BLASR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaisson and Tesler, 2012</xref>). SMALR was run on each isolate with the SMp (single-molecule, pooled distribution) argument. For MamA sites, the motif argument was set to C<underline>T</underline>GG<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>G, the modified position within the motif to 5, and the minimum number of motif sites per read to 6. For MamB sites, the motif argument was set to CACGC<bold><underline>A</underline></bold>G, the modified position to 6, and the motifs per read threshold to 6. The native IPD value of each read was used in place of SMp score. This substitution is susceptible to noise from local sequence contexts, but should still resolve differences between isolates and distinguish methylated and unmethylated reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaulaurier et al., 2015</xref>). The distribution of native IPD values within each isolate for MamA and MamB sites was visualized using ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wickham, 2016</xref>), and comparisons between genotypes was performed using two-tailed Student’s t-tests with the t.test and effect sizes estimated with cohen.d functions in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Identification of promoters</title><p>To identify MTase motif sites in probable gene promoters, for each isolate a custom python script read a CSV file with the genome positions of each MTase motif site in the isolate, and the isolate’s genome annotation EMBL file. The script scanned the surrounding sequence on either strand of each MTase motif site for Sigma Factor Binding Sight (SFBS) motifs previously characterized in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/LPCDRP/dna-methylation/-/tree/publication/targets">https://gitlab.com/LPCDRP/dna-methylation/-/tree/publication/targets</ext-link>). If a SFBS motif match overlapped with an MTase motif site, the MTase motif site was labeled with the sigma factor type corresponding to the SFBS motif (Sigma Factor A through Sigma Factor M, −10 element or −35 element). The script then compared the genome position and strand of the SFBS motif match to the genome position and strand of each annotated TSS in the isolate’s genome annotation EMBL file. To meet the most stringent criteria for probable promoter sites (‘full promoters’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) an SFBS motif had to be the appropriate nucleotide distance upstream from an annotated TSS. If the SFBS motif match was the −10 component of a SFBS motif, the script checked if a there was a TSS on the same strand with a genome position 8 to 12 bp downstream of the matching sequence. If the SFBS match was a −35 component of a SFBS, the script instead checked for a TSS between 30 and 40 bp downstream. To capture MTase promoter interactions excluded by this conservative definition of SFBS, for the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, categories were assigned indicating the substantiveness of the evidence supporting overlap with promoter elements. The following logic was executed programmatically in R to assign categories: ‘Element’ matches overlap either the −10 or −35 SFBS the expected distance from the TSS (see above) but have neither an extended −10 promoter element nor the complementary element; ‘Location’ matches are at the appropriate distance upstream of the TSS to overlap with −10 or −35 elements but do not overlap known SFBS motifs; ‘Sequence’ matches coincide with SFBSs but not in the expected position with respect to TSS; ‘none’ are within 50 bp upstream of a TSS but meet criteria for none of the aforementioned categories.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Bayesian classification of base-specific methylation status</title><p>Even within isolates with active MTase genotypes, not every base with an MTase target motif was methylated. To identify MTase motif sites with no base modification (hypomethylated sites) despite an active MTase we took a Bayesian approach. In each isolate a custom R script estimated the distribution of normalized IPD ratios among unmodified bases by calculating the standard deviation and mean normalized IPD ratios of bases not within MTase motifs. The script then estimated the distribution of methylated bases by calculating the standard deviation and mean of bases targeted by MTase motifs. This estimate assumed that most bases targeted by MTase motifs were methylated, which held true in isolates with active MTase genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For each MTase motif site, the script calculated the conditional probability of the base belonging to either the modified or unmodified population, given its normalized IPD ratio and coverage. The script classified all bases more than nine times more likely to belong to the unmodified population as hypomethylated, all bases more than nine times more likely to belong to the modified population as methylated, and the remaining bases as indeterminate.</p><p>The coverage of each MTase site in each isolate was used to adjust the standard deviation of the distributions used to calculate its conditional probability, as bases with lower coverage have less consistent IPD ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To perform this coverage adjustment, for each isolate we trained a model to estimate the expected standard deviation of any base given its coverage. After log-transforming and normalizing the IPD ratios of all bases in an isolate, the script calculated each base’s number of standard deviations from the median normalized IPD ratio. Next, linear regression estimated the relationship between these standard deviations and the inverse coverage of each base. The resulting model estimated the standard deviation for each possible coverage value. When estimating the conditional probabilities of each MTase motif site, the code first calculated the mean and standard deviation of normalized IPD ratios in adenines within and without MTase motifs. It then multiplied these two standard deviations by the standard deviation predicted from the sequencing coverage at that MTase motif site. These adjusted standard deviations were then used to estimate the distribution of normalized IPD ratios and calculate the conditional probability of the MTase motif site belonging to those distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Conserved hypomethylation patterns</title><p>Using the Bayesian classification of each MTase motif target and the loci labeled by our methylome annotation pipeline, we searched for hypomethylated loci that occurred in multiple isolates. For each locus, a custom R script counted the number of isolates with that locus, including only isolates with active genotypes of the MTase targeting the locus. Our script also counted the number of these isolates in which the locus was hypomethylated. To estimate the significance of these findings, we used a cumulative binomial test, with the first count as the sample size and the second count as the number of successes. To find the probability of hypomethylation for each Bernoulli trial if hypomethylation occurred randomly, we calculated the total frequency of hypomethylation among MTase motif sites in active isolates. A separate per trial probability was calculated for MamA, MamB, and HsdM. The Bonferroni correction adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, by dividing the significance threshold by the total number of unique loci in this study. No reference strains were included in the analysis of hypomethylated loci.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Transcription factor binding motif scanning</title><p>We searched for Transcription Factor (TF) binding motifs near hypomethylated bases using the command line motif scanner FIMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grant et al., 2011</xref>) version 4.12.0. For each hypomethylated locus in an MTase target motif, we extracted the sequence surrounding the locus, 20 bases on each side in a randomly selected representative isolate (only isolates hypomethylated at that locus were chosen). The context sequences were combined into a multisequence FASTA file. Position-dependent letter-probability matrices of each TF binding motif were kindly provided by Minch and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minch et al., 2015</xref>), who derived them from a ChIP-Seq experiment on virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> type strain H37Rv. We then ran FIMO using each TF motif on the context FASTA file with a threshold p-value of 0.01. For comparison we also scanned for TF motifs in the context sequences of consistently methylated loci (consistently methylated loci here defined as loci present in at least 30 isolates and methylated in at least 95% of those isolates). Custom scripts then parsed the FIMO output files for each TF binding motif and counted the number of methylated loci and the number of hypomethylated loci matching each TF with a q-value of at least 0.1.</p><p>To genotype the transcription factor MntR in each isolate, we used the same method used for the MTase genotyping.

For each MTase motif site, the script found the nearest MTase motif site of the same type (MamA, MamB, and HsdM) and the same strand, then recorded the nucleotide distance between them.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors used PacBio sequencing to conduct SMRT-seq based methylome analyses of 93 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates. This study is interesting and important because it provides a detailed description of DNA methylations of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genomes associated with the presence or absence of certain MTases.</p><p>However, the reviewers agreed that there were a number of concerns that need to be addressed. In particular, (1) the authors' argument relating the roles of the methylation patterns in physiology and adaptation are too strong and not supported by the data in this manuscript, (2) the details of the methylation analysis were not clearly described in enough detail, and (3) the &quot;mosaic&quot; finding itself is not new or novel, which needs to be acknowledged and addressed. The storyline of the paper needs to be substantially changed to be more descriptive and data-based (instead of speculation-based). The manuscript should also be edited to be clearer and more concise for the reader as well.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Add detailed method descriptions for the analysis portions of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The physiological consequences of mycobacterial gene expression control by DNA methylation remain to be identified. Therefore, the benefits of phenotypic heterogeneity remain hypothetical. This caveat should be emphasized throughout the manuscript. As support, the authors might perhaps cite game theory papers indicating that phenotypic heterogeneity can be an adaptive strategy in bacterial populations. Here are a few examples (among others):</p><p>Wolf, Vazirani and Arkin, 2005.</p><p>Ficici and Pollack, 2007.</p><p>Lambert and Kussell, 2014.</p><p>3) Results subsection “Diverse mutations drive DNA methyltransferase activity profiles”. The interpretation that intermediate IPD ratios are due to heterogeneous methylation looks reasonable. However, heterogeneous methylation is naturally found in batch cultures during DNA replication unless the bacterial culture is synchronized, which obviously is not the case here. Because formation of hemimethylated sites occurs at different regions in individual bacteria, the DNA hemimethylation patterns vary from cell to cell. This can introduce noise into SMRT-sequencing, and in this study it might lead to overvaluation of cell-to-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity. The risk of hemimethylation-associated noise decreases in non-dividing cells. The growth stage of the culture used for SMRT-sequencing is not indicated in the manuscript (the authors cite Elghraoui, Modlin and Valafar, 2017, which does not give details). If non-dividing cells were used, it should be clearly indicated. Otherwise, evidence for stochastic DNA methylation would be less compelling.</p><p>4) Results subsection “Transcription factor occlusion explains most hypomethylated sites” and thereafter. The statement that transcription factor occlusion explains most hypomethylated sites should be toned down. The data presented are based on bioinformatic analysis only. Proof of transcription factor binding requires biochemical evidence (e. g., gel shift analysis or DNA footprinting). Without proof of this kind, predictions on DNA binding by transcription factors are speculative.</p><p>5) Discussion section. Gries et al. (2010) and Saecker et al. (2002) are wrong citations, not appropriate to support the statement that DNA methylation alters biophysical properties that tune promoter strength. These papers do not mention DNA methylation. Papers that address the effects of DNA adenine methylation on DNA structure include Diekmann (1987), Polaczek et al. (1998) and Kimura et al. (1989).</p><p>6) To improve the manuscript to better convey a clear message, reorganize and revise to highlight the focus on MTase mutants and their effects on methylation:</p><p>a) MTases' genotyping from WGS and their activities from IPD ratio-based analysis; as well as their demonstration in population, i.e. phylogeny tree;</p><p>b) MTases-based methylation heterogeneity from native IPD value-based analysis, suggesting to move Figure 3E, 3F, and 3G (H37Rv-metA, less important) to supplemental and to move Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (MamB) back to Figure 3 with mention of HsdM in the text;</p><p>c) MTases-based comparative methylomics for hypervariable sites and hypomethylated sites, and their potential association with transcription factors;</p><p>d) MTases-based comparative methylomics for promoters and SFBSs, including RNAseq re-analysis.</p><p>7) The use of knock-down (KD) and knock-out (KO) is usually for change of gene/protein quantity or expression level. It may be more appropriate for the authors to use high- (WT), low- (KD), and in- (KO) active mutants for mutation-caused changes of MTase activity.</p><p>8) Epigenetic mosaicism is somewhat associated with MTase activity, high or low, and MTase activity is certainly linked to genetic mutation or genotype. As such, &quot;without genetic mutation&quot; in the title and throughout the manuscript is not accurate, and should be toned down.</p><p>9) Results subsection “Virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> type strain H37Rv poorly represents methylomes of recent clinical isolates”: while H37Rv was recognized as a poor reference for methylome, a better one from the assembled/analyzed should have been suggested/used. Please specify the reference if used.</p><p>10) Since only SNP analysis was considered for phylogeny tree, the effect of insertion/deletion to methylome and methylomics analysis should be mentioned in Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Drivers and sites of diversity in the DNA adenine methylomes of 93 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex clinical isolates&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor and two peer reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that the revisions have strengthened the original story and the authors' responses to the reviewers look reasonable. Most importantly, problematic data and/or statements have been either clarified or removed in the revised manuscript. There are a few text revisions that the authors should address before formally accepting the manuscript, as detailed here:</p><p>1) The name HsdM should not be used for an orphan DNA methyltransferase. The acronym hsdM has been used for decades to designate the DNA methyltransferase subunit of type I restriction-modification systems (see, for instance, Loenen et al., 2014). I perfectly understand that the authors use HsdM in accordance with previous literature, and I am aware that a name change can cause complications and confusion. Despite this inconvenience, the enzyme should be renamed to make it clear that it is not a subunit of a R-M system. How about renaming the enzyme at or near the end of the manuscript and citing Loenen et al., or any another review on restriction enzymes?</p><p>2) Introduction. The authors write that recent SMRT-sequencing studies have revealed that DNA methylation has roles beyond restriction-modification. This statement is unfair to the literature. In γ-proteobacteria, Dam methylation has been known to control DNA replication, mismatch repair, transposon activity and regulation of transcription since the 1980's and roles in bacterial pathogenesis were described in the late 1990s. In α-proteobacteria, control of the cell cycle by CcrM methylation was described in the 1990s and roles in pathogenesis in the first years of the century. Please modify the sentence. SMRT has been a fantastic breakthrough but not the beginning of the story!</p><p>3) Results section. Please change &quot;inactive mutation&quot; to &quot;loss-of-function mutation&quot;. &quot;Inactive&quot; may suggest that the mutation does not do anything while the actual fact is the opposite.</p><p>4) Results section. When you mention that hypomethylated sites have been detected in bacteria different from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, you cite Blow, 2016 (which is fine) and Minch et al., 2015, which does not have anything to do with the subject (DNA methylation is not even mentioned in the paper!). Again, it might be advisable to be fair to the literature citing at least one of the pioneer studies that detected DNA hypomethylation in a bacterial genome. For instance, Ringquist and Smith, 1992 and/or Wang and Church, 1992. Alternatively, you might cite a review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58542.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors used PacBio sequencing to conduct SMRT-seq based methylome analyses of 93 M. tuberculosis isolates.

Edits to address revisions are addressed point-by-point below, but to address these overarching concerns, we have made the following changes in revising our manuscript:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, (1) the authors' argument relating the roles of the methylation patterns in physiology and adaptation are too strong and not supported by the data in this manuscript,</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this sentiment, and have made revisions accordingly, both in the wording of key sentences and in the manuscript’s scope. We acknowledge that our discussion about the roles methylation patterns play in physiology and adaptation are primarily speculation and hypothesis-generating. We have replaced much of this speculative discussion and hypothesis-generating analysis with more descriptive text and cut speculative discussion to reduce its share of the scope of the manuscript. Relevant revisions are enumerated in our reply to Essential revision #2.</p><p>However, we do present data regarding the arrangement of methylation with respect to established regulatory elements. While this arrangement does not confirm any physiological effect of these methylation patterns, it does suggest hypothesis for further experimentation. Thus, while we have cut the speculative portions significantly, we have retained an abridged presentation (Discussion section) of the physiological processes and adaptive mechanisms that our integration of DNA adenine methylomes with annotated complete assemblies support as potentialities previously undescribed in the literature. Throughout the revised manuscript, we have been sure to refer to the data supporting the underlying premise of hypotheses/speculation, and to make clear distinction between hypotheses, speculation, and contentions backed by data presented in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) the details of the methylation analysis were not clearly described in enough detail,</p></disp-quote><p>We have added substantially to the methods describing how we carried out the methylation analysis. Specific changes are enumerated in our response to Essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and (3) the &quot;mosaic&quot; finding itself is not new or novel, which needs to be acknowledged and addressed. The storyline of the paper needs to be substantially changed to be more descriptive and data-based (instead of speculation-based). The manuscript should also be edited to be clearer and more concise for the reader as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this perspective and input, as we had wrestled with how to define the scope of this manuscript during its development as well. Upon reflection, we agree that the revised manuscript should be more descriptive, and less speculation-based. We have made changes throughout the manuscript in this spirit, which is captured by our revision of the manuscript title: “Drivers and sites of diversity in the DNA adenine methylomes of 93 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex clinical isolates”. With this title, we reduce focus on the finding of Intercellular Mosaic Methylation and effects of phenotype or adaptivity, broadening the subject of the title to the other findings backed by data presented in the manuscript. Namely, these are:</p><p>1) The factors demonstrated (MTase genotype) and implicated (transcription factors) by our data and analysis in driving heterogeneity in DNA adenine methylomes within and across isolates.</p><p>2) The sites in the genome where DNA adenine methylation varies across isolates and/or within isolates (the hypomethylated and hypervariable motif sites).</p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ request for a focus more restricted to findings from the data presented in the manuscript, the title change also now only refers to the phenomenon as observed across the isolates analyzed in this study, rather than generalizing to the species level. Our storyline and manuscript organization have also changed accordingly (see replies to Essential revision #6 for specific changes).</p><p>However, we believe that while intracellular stochastic methylation has been reported previously, its manifestation across cells has not been formally described. And while some species have been characterized with multiple phase-variable MTases that, through independent variation, create numerous potential combinations of MTases and resulting methylation patterns, we believe that the diversity of methylation patterns conferred by IMM as we describe in the manuscript remains distinct. The most important distinction is that IMM creates a diversity of methylation patterns that scales logarithmically with the number of methylation <italic>sites</italic> targeting by the mosaicking MTase, whereas the previously described systems of multiple phase-variable MTases scale logarithmically with the <italic>number of phase-variable MTases.</italic> The number of sites is at least an order of magnitude greater than the number of phase-variable MTases, and thus creates far more potential methylome states.</p><p>That said, we wholeheartedly agree that a mosaic nature has been described in the DNA adenine methylomes of other prokaryotes, thus requiring acknowledgment and discussion in our manuscript. We have added such a discussion (Discussion section) of mosaic-like patterning of other prokaryotic methylomes. We have also included a figure (Figure 9, Discussion section) that clearly lays out where our characterization of Intercellular Mosaic methylation implicated by our data departs from these previous descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Add detailed method descriptions for the analysis portions of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that the methods underlying some portions of the analysis could stand to be more explicitly described. We have updated the methods for the following sections and line numbers:</p><p>Subsection “Lineage Determination” now includes a brief description of MiruHero’s input and function.</p><p>Subsection “Genome annotation” now includes a brief description of the Rapid Annotation Transfer Tool’s inputs, output, and function. The section also now has a citation for our annotation of reference genome H37Rv.</p><p>Subsection “Phylogeny construction and mapping of MTase genotypes,” now titled “Phylogenetic analysis,” now clarifies how the MTase genotypes of each isolate were input into iTol for visualization of our phylogenetic trees.</p><p>Subsection “Analysis of sequencing kinetics” and subsection “Finding methylation anomalies” have been expanded into the sections “Determination of interpulse duration of MTase motif sites”, “Characterization of MTase activity of MTase Genotypes”, and “Identification of hypervariable MTase motif loci” with additional details.</p><p>Subsection “Methylome Annotation,” now named “MTase motif locus assignment,” now contains a detailed description of the information contained in the assigned MTase locus tags, and more detail on how the tags were assigned.</p><p>Subsection “Characterizing the kinetic error profile across technical replicates” now specifies the statistical test used.</p><p>Subsection “Identification of promoters” now contains more detail on the files and criteria used to identify probable gene promoters.</p><p>Subsection “Proximal motif site search” now includes the threshold nucleotide distance and other criteria used to classify which MTase motif sites were neighbors.</p><p>Subsection “RNA-Seq analysis” now clarifies how the datasets were merged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The physiological consequences of mycobacterial gene expression control by DNA methylation remain to be identified. Therefore, the benefits of phenotypic heterogeneity remain hypothetical. This caveat should be emphasized throughout the manuscript. As support, the authors might perhaps cite game theory papers indicating that phenotypic heterogeneity can be an adaptive strategy in bacterial populations.

We have now added a paragraph to the Discussion section stating this caveat clearly and discussing the consequences. We have also changed much of the speculative content to descriptive content, and now frame the potential regulatory interactions we have identified as a resource for hypothesis generation, replacing formerly speculative text. We have cited one of the papers you alerted us to in support of the idea that phenotypic heterogeneity may confer survival benefit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results subsection “Diverse mutations drive DNA methyltransferase activity profiles”. The interpretation that intermediate IPD ratios are due to heterogeneous methylation looks reasonable. However, heterogeneous methylation is naturally found in batch cultures during DNA replication unless the bacterial culture is synchronized, which obviously is not the case here. Because formation of hemimethylated sites occurs at different regions in individual bacteria, the DNA hemimethylation patterns vary from cell to cell. This can introduce noise into SMRT-sequencing, and in this study it might lead to overvaluation of cell-to-cell DNA methylation heterogeneity. The risk of hemimethylation-associated noise decreases in non-dividing cells. The growth stage of the culture used for SMRT-sequencing is not indicated in the manuscript (the authors cite Elghraoui, Modlin and Valafar, 2017, which does not give details). If non-dividing cells were used, it should be clearly indicated. Otherwise, evidence for stochastic DNA methylation would be less compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this alternative cause of heterogeneous methylation. Our Results section now considers transient hemimethylation as a potential cause of heterogeneous methylation, in addition to phase variant MTase activity and intracellular stochastic methylation. Our isolates were sequenced after reaching Stationary Phase, which our subsection “Sample preparation and extraction” now indicates. While it is still likely that a subpopulation of cells were undergoing or had recently undergone cell division during DNA extraction, we believe the results of our read-level analysis with SMALR rules out transient hemimethylation as the primary cause of the observed heterogeneity. SMALR’s SMp method calculates a native IPD value for each sequencing read in an isolate, by averaging the IPD values across multiple target sites in the read matching a specified motif. This allows a distinction between fully methylated reads, fully unmethylated reads, and reads with a mix of methylated and unmethylated sites. Hemimethylation would likely result in a mix of fully methylated and fully unmethylated reads (or a mix of fully methylated and partially methylated reads, if the MTase performed distributive rather than processive methylation). The authors of SMALR have indeed observed that a small fraction (0.07%) of sequencing reads were fully unmethylated in cultures of bacterial strains with fully active MTase alleles, and attributed this to transient hemimethylation. The heterogeneity we observed in <italic>mamA</italic><sub>E270A</sub> and <italic>mamA</italic><sub>G152S</sub> variant isolates was not consistent with this transient hemimethylation. Their distribution of native IPD values were consistent with the majority of reads being partially methylated (with only a fraction of sites methylated in each read), rather than a mix of fully methylated and unmethylated reads. Additionally, if the heterogeneous methylation was only the result of hemimethylation during culturing, it would not be exclusive to specific MTase genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Results subsection “Transcription factor occlusion explains most hypomethylated sites” and thereafter.

We have partially adopted the suggested organization, and pruned some sections that did not fall into any of A-D. We agree that a focus on MTase mutants’ brings clarity to A and B and have adjusted the text to more clearly reflect that. C and D, however, identify sites of methylomic variation that are either independent of genotype (organization of MTase motifs with respect to promoters) or are stratified by the level of MTase activity (which can include multiple MTase genotypes), rather than MTase genotype (identification of hypomethylated and hypervariable sites). Therefore, we have not organized C and D according to MTase genotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The use of knock-down (KD) and knock-out (KO) is usually for change of gene/protein quantity or expression level. It may be more appropriate for the authors to use high- (WT), low- (KD), and in- (KO) active mutants for mutation-caused changes of MTase activity.</p></disp-quote><p>All instances of “knocked down” have been replaced with “partially active.” All instances of “knockout” have been replaced with “inactive,” except when referring to the previous mutagenesis experiments on <italic>hsdM</italic> and m<italic>etA</italic>.
