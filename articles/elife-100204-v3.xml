Here, we profiled single-cell transcriptomes and charted a developmental trajectory going from germline stem cells, through early, committed, and late progenitors, to premeiotic and meiotic cells. We showed that the transcription factor Foxl2l was expressed in the progenitor, directing progenitor differentiation toward oocytes.

The mammalian sex is determined by the XX/XY system, in which the <italic>SRY</italic> gene on the Y-chromosome plays a pivotal role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berta et al., 1990</xref>). Females lack <italic>SRY</italic>. They rely on genes such as <italic>RSPO1</italic>, <italic>FOXL2,</italic> and <italic>WNT4</italic> to promote female differentiation and to antagonize male differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">She and Yang, 2017</xref>). In contrast to mammals, fishes have more complicated schemes of sex differentiation. Wild zebrafish strain Nadia uses the female-dominant ZZ/ZW system, but domesticated laboratory strains have no sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, male and female zebrafish are morphologically indistinguishable at the larval stage, creating an obstacle for the study of fish sex differentiation. Zebrafish oocytes start to develop at around 21 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tong et al., 2010</xref>), while male differentiation appears later at around 30 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luzio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uchida et al., 2002</xref>). The sex differentiation mechanism in zebrafish remains unclear.</p><p>Germ cell abundance and the existence of oocytes play essential roles in the differentiation of zebrafish gonads. Zebrafish containing reduced numbers of germ cells (<italic>nr0b1</italic> mutants) or no germ cells (<italic>dnd</italic> morphants) develop into males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Slanchev et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations of genes (<italic>figla</italic>, <italic>sycp3,</italic> or <italic>bmp15</italic>) involved in oocyte development also result in female-to-male sex reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dranow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). These results indicate that intrinsic signals from germ cells are required for the female fate. Germ cell types during and after sex differentiation stages have been well characterized by scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2024</xref>). However, the regulation and subtypes of germ cells before meiosis in zebrafish have not been fully characterized.</p><p>One transcription factor that promotes female differentiation is Foxl2l (forkhead box L2-like). Medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) <italic>foxl2l</italic>, named <italic>foxl3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), encodes a germline intrinsic factor that suppresses spermatogenesis and initiates oogenesis in XX gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kikuchi et al., 2020</xref>). XX medaka fish with a <italic>foxl3</italic> mutation become hermaphrodites with both oocyte and functional sperm in adult XX gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>). Zebrafish <italic>foxl2l</italic> is a marker of progenitors. Its disruption leads to 100% male fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), signifying the role of Foxl2l in female development. However, the mechanism of Foxl2l action remains poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis to dissect the developmental trajectory of germ cells in zebrafish during the critical sex determination stage. In addition to the known germline stem cells and meiotic germ cells, we have further identified three subpopulations of progenitor cells: early progenitor, committed progenitor, and late progenitor. We conducted another scRNAseq of <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant and proved that Foxl2l controls the development of committed progenitors to late progenitor, which is indispensable for female differentiation. We further show that Foxl2l suppresses stemness-related genes in progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developmental trajectory of zebrafish germ cells</title><p>Germ cells play important roles in zebrafish sex differentiation, but we still have much to learn about their development.

This approach does not assume that mutant cells correspond directly to specific WT stages; instead, it enables the identification of potentially novel germ cell types.

GSCs can be split into two subtypes: GSC-I (<italic>nanos2<sup>hi</sup>cbx7a<sup>lo</sup></italic>) and GSC-II (<italic>nanos2<sup>lo</sup>cbx7a<sup>hi</sup></italic>). GSCs can self-renew intermittently through two types of cell division to ensure continuous gamete maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). One type of cell division is symmetric, producing two identical stem cells. The other type is asymmetric division producing two different daughter cells, one stem cell and the other cell preparing for further differentiation. The two subtypes of GSCs may represent two different daughter cells derived from asymmetric division. This speculation needs to be validated by further analysis. When GSCs lose stem cell property, they differentiate into progenitors.</p><p>Progenitors include three types: Prog-E (<italic>foxl2l<sup>-</sup>nanos2<sup>-</sup></italic>), Prog-C (<italic>foxl2l<sup>+</sup>rec8a<sup>-</sup></italic>), and Prog-L (<italic>foxl2l<sup>+</sup>rec8a<sup>+</sup></italic>). We show here that Prog-L is essential for female differentiation. Prog-C is the gate before female differentiation and will stay at S-phase temporarily before developing into Prog-L. In Prog-L, genes such as <italic>rec8a</italic> and <italic>meiosin</italic> are highly expressed for the preparation of meiotic entry. Our study delineates the developmental process of zebrafish germ cells during sex differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A type of zebrafish germ cell progenitor possesses female identity at juvenile age</title><p>In many vertebrate species, sex determination is induced by sex-determining genes expressed in supporting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berta et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>). The fate of germ cells is determined following the instruction of supporting cells.

In female supporting cell precursors, the absence of <italic>Sry</italic> expression enables the expression of female genes and female fate determination. In contrast, germ cell abundance is required for female development in zebrafish, and the early depletion of germ cells at the embryonic stage results in male development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Draper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Slanchev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Our study further determines early establishment of zebrafish germline feminization in Prog-L. Foxl2l drives the differentiation of Prog-C to Prog-L and, therefore, dictates female development in juvenile gonads.</p><p>Medaka Foxl2l controls genes in meiosis and folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kikuchi et al., 2020</xref>). Zebrafish Foxl2l may have the same functions as shown by our previous RNAseq result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2025</xref>) and the expression of <italic>foxl2l</italic> in Prog-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, there are differences regarding the mutant phenotypes in zebrafish and medaka. Medaka <italic>foxl2l</italic> (termed <italic>foxl3</italic>) mutant gonads still contain some meiotic oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>). Zebrafish <italic>foxl2l</italic> deficiency, however, leads to germ cell arrest at the Prog-C stage as shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). No meiotic oocytes can be detected in zebrafish <italic>foxl2l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> gonads. The difference in <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant phenotypes between zebrafish and medaka raises two possibilities. First, zebrafish Foxl2l has an additional role in driving progenitor differentiation. Second, medaka Foxl2l plays a similar role in progenitor differentiation as in zebrafish; however, medaka may have a stronger female genetic tendency that prevents full blockage of female differentiation and meiosis in <italic>foxl3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> gonads.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Direct male differentiation from indifferent gonads</title><p>Zebrafish testis development has been an unsolved issue. Zebrafish testis can be derived from ovary-like tissue that undergoes oocyte apoptosis during sex differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uchida et al., 2002</xref>). Here, we show that germ cells are arrested in the middle of progenitor development followed by direct male differentiation in <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant. This indicates that zebrafish testis can be differentiated directly from indifferent gonads without going through the female phase. Our current result is also consistent with the reports showing direct male differentiation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tong et al., 2010</xref>). The wild zebrafish strain, Nadia, with ZZ sex chromosomes undergoes direct male development without going through female-to-male transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, in addition to female-to-male transition, zebrafish males can develop directly similar to most gonocharists whose males and females are derived directly from undifferentiated gonads.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Foxl2l suppresses genes in male development and stemness</title><p>Our scRNAseq analysis has identified <italic>nanos2</italic>, <italic>dmrt1,</italic> and <italic>id1</italic>, which may be involved in cell-type transition in <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutants.

Therefore, the aberrantly induced <italic>nanos2</italic> in Prog-C of <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant may participate in the suppression of meiotic genes in addition to the induction of stemness.</p><p>Id1, inhibitor of DNA binding 1, is a transcription regulator that lacks a DNA binding domain. It can bind basic helix-loop-helix proteins to prevent their binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benezra et al., 1990</xref>). Id1 is essential for homeostasis and the maintenance of stem cells in several cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kantzer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ying et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Although the function of Id1 in the testis remains unclear, its paralog Id4 regulates the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sablitzky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

In Nile tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>), Dmrt1 and Foxl2l antagonize each other to determine germline sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). Zebrafish appear to behave similarly. As a male-promoting gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Webster et al., 2017</xref>), zebrafish <italic>dmrt1</italic> is aberrantly upregulated in <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutants at the Prog-C, Prog-C(S), and GSCI stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This aberrant <italic>dmrt1</italic> expression may direct <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutants toward male development.</p><p>We show here that Foxl2l regulates genes important for progenitor differentiation from Prog-C to Prog-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>); it also suppresses GSC gene <italic>nanos2</italic> and antagonizes male development by suppressing <italic>dmrt1</italic>. In <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutants, most of the DEGs were detected in Prog-C/Prog-C(S), consistent with the failure of the Prog-C differentiation to Prog-L. Foxl2l facilitates the expression of oocyte genes to ensure female differentiation.</p><p>Our DEG analysis identified both upregulated and downregulated genes in <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that Foxl2l can activate or suppress transcription. The dual role of Foxl2l is comparable with that of other Fox family proteins. The forkhead transcription factor L2 (forkhead box L2, FOXL2) is highly expressed in granulosa cells required for female differentiation, including meiosis and folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Georges et al., 2014</xref>). In mammalian granulosa cells, Foxl2l activates <italic>Fst</italic> to facilitate folliculogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kashimada et al., 2011</xref>). However, in undifferentiated pre-granulosa cells, FOXL2 suppresses granulosa differentiation and proliferation by repressing <italic>StAR</italic>, <italic>CYP11A</italic>, <italic>CYP19,</italic> and <italic>CCD2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pisarska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pisarska et al., 2010</xref>).

In addition to inducing apoptosis, p53 also regulates the differentiation of airway epithelial progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McConnell et al., 2016</xref>), embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2005</xref>), and brown adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molchadsky et al., 2013</xref>).

Finally, the single-cell cDNA libraries were constructed by Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Library Construction Kit v3.1 kit (10x Genomics) following the manufacturer’s protocols with 12 cycles for cDNA amplification and 14 cycles for library amplification. Sequencing was performed by NextSeq 500 (Illumina) with 150 cycles of 28×91 paired-end reads. The raw base call (BCL) files were transferred to FASTQ files by the cellranger mkfastq pipeline from Cell Ranger (10x Genomics). The reads were mapped to the zebrafish genome GRCz11, and gene expression was obtained by cellranger count from Cell Ranger (10x Genomics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the quantitative data is presented as mean ± SD.

The count matrices were then stored as Seurat objects v3.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Quality control</title><p>A two-step quality control approach was conducted individually for each sample. First, we conducted quality control at the cell level. Cells with UMI counts &lt;10,000 or mitochondrial gene expression percentages ≥10% were marked as low-quality cells. Multiplet detection was performed on the remaining cells using the R package <italic>scds</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bais and Kostka, 2020</xref>). Cells with a hybrid score ≥ the outer fence were marked as multiplets. Second, we performed quality control at the cluster level to screen out the potential low-quality cells that passed the hard thresholds at the cell level. A low-resolution clustering was performed using Seurat v3.2.3. Clusters containing more than 80% low-quality cells or multiplets were marked as low-quality clusters. Together, cells that were marked as low quality, multiplets, and cells in low-quality clusters were excluded from the subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Data preprocessing and cell-cycle scoring</title><p>The count matrices of the remaining 769 cells from the WT and 2399 cells from the mutant were merged and normalized using the R package <italic>scran</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lun et al., 2016</xref>). After normalization, gene expression data of cells from WT and mutant samples were organized into individual Seurat objects. The function <italic>CellCycleScoring</italic> in Seurat v3.2.3 was used for cell-cycle scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Briefly, all genes were first sorted by their mean expression and split into bins. For each S- and G2M-specific gene, relative expression was calculated by comparison with other genes in the same bin. The S-score and G2/M-score were calculated as the average of the relative expression of all genes in the lists of S- and G2M-specific genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-4"><title>Cell clustering analysis of WT cells</title><p>We used the <italic>FindVariableFeatures</italic> in Seurat v3.2.3 to identify the top 2500 highly variable genes in each sample. The principal components (PCs) of these highly variable genes on scaled expression matrices were derived after their cell-cycle scores were regressed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We used the leading 30 PCs for UMAP embedding. The Leiden algorithm was applied to identify cell clusters. The optimal resolution, determined by the highest average silhouette score, was chosen from a range of feasible values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-5"><title>Trajectory and pseudo-time analysis of WT cells</title><p>The data matrix, along with the cell clusters and UMAP embedding, was converted to the CDS format and subsequently analyzed using Monocle 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2019b</xref>) to obtain the trajectory that encompasses all clusters. We then used the GSC marker <italic>nanos2</italic> to identify the root and the order of the trajectory and to estimate the pseudo-time for each WT cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-6"><title>Cluster marker identification</title><p>We used the <italic>top_markers</italic> in Monocle 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2019b</xref>) to identify the cluster markers whose high expression discriminates cells in the target cluster from the other cells with a high degree of specificity. For each cluster, genes that satisfy the following criteria: (i) specificity ≥0.2, (ii) q-value &lt;0.01, and (iii) having nonzero counts in ≥80% cells in the cluster were selected as markers. Marker genes were ranked based on the specificity within WT clusters, and the top 2–4 markers in each WT cluster were selected as top markers. Total 37 top markers were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-7"><title>Inferring the developmental stages to mutant cells</title><p>The function <italic>TransferData</italic> in Seurat v3.2.3 was utilized to infer the developmental stage from the WT cells to the mutant cells. Initially, PCs were derived from the WT cells based on the expression of their cluster markers. Mutant cells were then projected to the same PCs. The PCs and the projected PCs were used to identify the mutual nearest neighbors across mutant cells and WT cells. These mutual nearest neighbors were considered anchors and scored based on the consistency across the neighborhood structure of each dataset. Lastly, the developmental stage of each mutant cell was determined using a weighted voting mechanism. This process considers the stages of WT cells in every anchor, with votes weighted according to the anchor score and the proximity between the mutant cell and its corresponding anchor mutant cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-8"><title>Co-clustering analysis of mutant cells and WT cells from GSC to Prog-C</title><p>To integrate mutant cells and WT cells from GSC to Prog-C, the function <italic>DataIntegration</italic> in Seurat v3.2.3 was applied. Briefly, both datasets were projected to a shared space by performing canonical correlation analysis. Mutual nearest neighbors were then identified as anchors, representing pairs of mutant and WT cells sharing a similar expression pattern. Anchors were scored based on the consistency across the neighborhood structure of each dataset. For each WT cell, a correction vector was created based on the proximity to every anchor and the anchor score. The WT expression matrix was corrected accordingly and integrated with that of mutant cells for the same clustering procedure as previously described. Mutant-specific marker genes were identified using the top_markers function with the following criteria: (i) specificity ≥0.25, (ii) Q-value &lt;0.01, (iii) presence in ≥80% mutant cells for each integrated group, and (iv) not included in the WT cluster marker gene list.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-9"><title>Composition analysis</title><p>Because each stage has its own overall rate of prevalence in the entire cell population, we adjusted for the unevenness of stage prevalence in determining how prominent a stage is in an integrative group. Fisher’s exact test was used to find out which integrative groups were enriched with what stages of cells. Prominent stages for an integrative group are defined as those with significantly higher proportions of cells than their prevalence rates. Specifically, we calculated the proportions of developmental stages for both WT and mutant cells in each group and then conducted Fisher’s exact tests for each stage within each group. The resulting p-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method for controlling for false discovery rates, which were set at 0.05. The stages with significant enrichment are referred to as the prominent stages after prevalence rate calibration, or prominent stages for short.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-10"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>To identify DEGs during development, we compared gene expression levels between mutant and WT cells at the same prominent stage within each integrated group. Other cells not included in the comparison are shown in gray on UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed using the function <italic>FindMarkers</italic> in Seurat v3.2.3. Genes that satisfy the following criteria: (i) |log2(fold-change)|≥log2(2.5) and (ii) q-value&lt;0.05 were selected as DEGs. The DEGs in each stage were ordered by the fold change.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-11"><title>Reprocessing of the public scRNAseq dataset from Liu et al</title><p>The processed data were retrieved from the designated repository (GEO accession number: GSE191137).

After regressing out the cell-cycle scores, we used the leading 30 PCs for UMAP embedding.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Zebrafish were handled under the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee of Academia Sinica and National Center for Biomodels, National Applied Research Laboratories (IACUC: 10-10-084, and NLAC-113-M-004-R1).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-100204-mdarchecklist1-v3.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>The list and the expression of marker genes in each cluster.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-100204-supp1-v3.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data for single-cell transcriptomic data analysis are available with NCBI GEO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE173718">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE173718</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Evidence that committed progenitors revert to germline stem cells (GSCs) is weak. Functional data are required to draw this conclusion. The phrase 'reveal stemness suppression' should be removed from the title and alternative explanations should appear in the text. The claim that suppressing stemness is necessary for female differentiation is not well supported, for example, cells might initiate the committed progenitor program but fail to shut off and continue to express part of the GSC program.</p><p>2) Essential literature that places the work in context must be discussed, with several cases noted in each specific review.</p><p>3) Alternative explanations to the statement that committed progenitor stage is &quot;the gate toward female determination&quot; must be discussed, for example, that the late progenitor stage is the key stage for female determination.</p><p>4) Consider alternatives to the conclusion that the progenitors are differentiated because it is based solely on the expression of foxl2l, which is initially expressed in the juvenile ovary state that lab strains develop through.</p><p>5). Consider alternative explanations for the differences in the action of <italic>Foxl2</italic>(Fox3) in zebrafish and medaka.</p><p>6) Methods require more details on how fish were selected for scRNA-seq.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific points.</p><p>1) Page 7 lines 258-261. The authors conclude that the committed progenitors revert to GSCs based on the coexpression of nanos2 and foxl2l nanos2 and later on the same page line 262, based on expression of id1 in mutants but not WT. Without functional data demonstrating that the progenitors revert to an early state, alternative interpretations should be considered. For example, can the authors exclude the alternative possibility that the cells initiate the committed progenitor program but do not shut off and continue to express the GSC program such that the coexpression of both programs blocks differentiation? It would help to discuss these findings in the context of Fox family functions. Some Fox family members, <italic>Foxl2</italic> and FoxPs for example, are known to be both activators and repressors of transcription or act primarily as repressors. Relevant to this work, repressive activity of <italic>Foxl2</italic> has previously been reported in the mammalian ovary (Pisarska et al. Endocrinology 2004, Pisarska Am J. Phys Endo. Metabolism 2010, Kuo Reproduction 2012, Kuo Endocrinology 2011, as well as several more recent publications). In this context interfering with <italic>Foxl2</italic> repression was proposed to accelerate follicle recruitment and cause premature ovarian failure.</p><p>2) Discussion Page 9 lines 289-293. This section is not entirely clear. First GSC-I and GSC-II subtypes are introduced, then it is stated that &quot;all GSCs self -renew&quot; and a Saito 2007 paper is cited. This is followed by a description of &quot;two types of daughter cells derived from GSC self-renewal&quot;. Does the conclusion that &quot;all GSCs renew&quot; still hold in light of the two GSC populations? Would a division that produces a daughter that cannot renew be considered &quot;self-renewal&quot; or instead a non-renewing division?</p><p>3) Discussion Page 9 Line 295-7. The authors conclude that the committed progenitor stage is &quot;the gate toward female determination&quot; and that they &quot;stay at S-Phase temporarily before differentiation&quot;. Is this conclusion based solely on RNA expression? Also, in several species, including zebrafish, meiotic entry has been correlated with ovary development. Can the possibility that the late progenitor stage, the stage when meiotic genes are detected and a stage missing in foxl2l mutants, is the key stage for female determination be excluded?</p><p>4) The same comment as above pertains to Page 9 lines 281-284 of the discussion.</p><p>5) Page 3 Line 64 states that &quot;the developmental stages of germ cells in zebrafish remain unclear&quot;. This is somewhat misleading as recently published single cell datasets have analyzed and defined the stages of germ cell development, including during and after sexual differentiation. This should be clarified, and the relevant published work should be cited. (Liu et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2022, Wilson et al. Front Cell Dev Bio 2024.)</p><p>6) Page 3 Line 70 might be confusing because it states that &quot;XX medaka fish with foxl3 mutation become hermaphroditic processing functional sperms&quot;. Please clarify whether they also produce oocytes or are genetically female &quot;XX&quot; but make sperm.</p><p>7) On Page 9 lines 305-307, the authors discuss prior working showing that loss of germ cells leads to male development and that germ cells are required for female development. Then lines 307-309 state that this work shows some progenitors are already sexually differentiated. First, the stages compared are completely different. The early work looks at the primordial germ cells and their loss in the first few days of development before a gonad forms and this work looks after a gonad has formed and when sex is being determined. The second concern is that the conclusion that the cells are differentiated is based on the expression of foxl2l, which is expressed in the juvenile ovary state that lab strains have been shown to develop through (Wilson et al. Front Cell Dev Bio 2024). While it is fair to state that some cells express ovary markers, are they really differentiated? For example, in the context of the foxl2l mutant, GSCs and early progenitors inappropriately express foxl2l, but the mutants develop as males. Please clarify.</p><p>8) Page 9 lines 315-318 compares medaka and zebrafish foxl2l mutants and seems to suggest that Foxl2l is required for meiosis in medaka but has a different role in zebrafish. Is it possible that foxl2l plays a similar role in repressing the earlier developmental programs of GSCs and early progenitors in both cases? Is it possible that continued expression of these early programs interferes with activation of meiotic genes? Might this account for the absence of the late progenitor stage in foxl2l mutants since it is defined by expression of foxl2l and meiotic genes?</p><p>9) Page 10 lines 328-330. Direct differentiation of testis without going through a female phase is discussed. Recent work showing direct differentiation in wild strains should also be discussed and cited (Wilson et al. Front Cell Dev Bio 2024).</p><p>10) Page 10 lines 359-360. The authors state &quot;Foxl2l may ensure female differentiation by preventing stemness and antagonizing male development.&quot; It is unclear why suppressing stemness would be necessary for female differentiation since female zebrafish have stem cells as do male zebrafish. It seems likely that turning off the GSC and early differentiation programs is important for allowing expression of meiosis and oocyte differentiation genes.</p><p>11) Page 11 370-374. &quot;Thus, p53 may assist alternative differentiation of mutant germ cells&quot;. What is the evidence that p53 is involved in differentiation of germ cells? Sex bias has not been associated with the published p53 mutants. Is it possible that p53 eliminates germ cells that are simultaneously expressing programs of multiple stages? While p53 has been shown to be important for ovary to testis transformation in mutant contexts in adults, it is dispensable in mutants that disrupt ovary development at earlier stages. Please discuss in the context of, and cite, the relevant ovary literature Rodriguez-Mari et al. PLoS Gen 2010, Shive PNAS 2010, Hartung et al. Mol. Reprod. Dev 2014, Miao Development 2017, Kaufman et al. PLoSGen 2018, Bertho et al. Development 2021.</p><p>12) Figure 2D. It would be helpful to show the individual fish points or to present the data as a violin plot.</p><p>13) Figure 2F. The numbers are low here only 3-4 gonads are examined for each genotype and marker and in the mutants only 1/4 expresses the &quot;testis&quot; markers.</p><p>14) Figure 6 model. What is the evidence that prog C becomes GSCs again/revert versus continuing to express earlier programs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The evidence that foxl2l cells are arrested at the committed progenitor stage (a possible novel phenotype) is based on the absence of expression of rec8a and Sycp3. Another explanation is that these gonads have already differentiated as testes. Is rec8a also expressed in male germ cells or is it female germ cell specific? Germ cells in testes are usually delayed in entering meiosis (and thus expressing Sycp3) relative to females so it is not clear if this represents the expected trajectory of testis vs. ovary or a novel developmental state caused by absence of foxl2l. Was expression of any male-specific genes identified in the mutant data set (e.g. tekt1 or odf3b) which could indicate these germ cells were already committed to spermatogenesis? Also, by &quot;arrested&quot; do the authors mean that they are in a cell cycle arrest? If so, this can be assayed with BrdU or EdU labeling.</p><p>L99: incomplete sentence.</p><p>L128: The publication associated with this dataset should be referenced (it's referenced in the figure legend but should also be referenced in main text).</p><p>L138: Using a negative result (absence of staining) to argue for a particular cell stage (prog-E) is problematic. To bolster this argument the authors should consider pointing out that this result is consistent with the scRNA-seq data that predicts little to no overlap between nanos2 and foxl2l expressing cells. Perhaps adding the nanos2 and foxl2l and rec8a UMAPs to Figure 1 would help.</p><p>L148 and Figure 2A. Wilson et al. (2024) showed that the gonads of Nadia ZZ fish appear to directly develop into testis without producing oocytes during the bipotential stage. The data in Figure 2A showing foxl2l expression in the ZZ gonads is therefore unexpected. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>L154: &quot;…barley observed in testis.&quot; Should this be &quot;…not observed…&quot;, or is there low but detectable expression of foxl2l in the testis (not clear from Figure 1D)?</p><p>L170: It is not clear from the Methods how the fish were selected for scRNA-seq. With the piwil1:egfp line it is possible to distinguish wild-type males from females at the 27 dpf timepoint used in this analysis based on the size of the gonad (large=female, small=male). Were only fish with large gonads used for WT and foxl2l mutant scRNA-seq? If fish were chosen randomly, it would be expected that germ cells from testes would also be included. When do foxl2l mutant gonad first start looking like testes? Is there a delay in testis development relative to wild-type?</p><p>Figure 2B: Including age-matched wild-type testes in Figure 2B may help clarify if the foxl2l gonads are different or similar to a normal male gonad at this stage of development.</p><p>Figure 2D: I would suggest replacing si:ch211-191j22.7 with meiosin, since this is the clear ortholog.</p><p>Figure 3B: It is hard to see the morphology of the nuclei in these images. Grey scale is perfect for the DAPI channel, but it would be helpful to increase the apparent signal intensity using an image processing program like Photoshop so that it is possible to better assess the morphology of nuclei.</p><p>Figure 3C: I am having a hard time understanding the meaning of Figure 3C. For the WT cells, the nanos2+ cells are restricted to the W1 subcluster (Figure 1D), indicating that the GSCs are homogeneous with respect to gene expression. However, when WT cells are clustered with mutant cells the WT GSCs now partition to two different subclusters (I1 and I2). When the &quot;control&quot; cells are not clustering tightly, it calls into question how much this clustering represents reality. How do the authors rationalize this?</p><p>L194: Figure S7B is unfortunately not helping me understand how the data was processed. What is meant by &quot;transfer developmental stage?&quot; Does this require/assume that the mutant cells be a specific stage that can be mapped directly onto wildtype stages? I wonder if forcing the mutant cells to cluster with wildtype cells is somehow skewing the results. How different is the clustering if only mutant cells are used?</p><p>Figure 3E: nanos2 and cbx7a are listed twice. It is likely they should be psmb13a and dnmt3bb.1, respectively. Was expression of any male-specific gene identified in the mutant data set (e.g. tekt1 or odf3b) which could indicate these germ cells were already committed to spermatogenesis?</p><p>Sup Figure S8A: It would be helpful if this figure also included the UMAP shown in Figure 3C for reference (with I1-I7 labels). S8A is hard to interpret given the altered gene expression pattern of mutant cells. Some genes fit the proposed cell stages (e.g. dnmt3bb.1), but others are not as clear (e.g. nanos2, dhrs1).</p><p>L210: &quot;This suggests that GSCs can be further divided into two finer stages, GSCI and GSCII.&quot; If you only see this subdivision in mutants, then it is hard to argue that these are representative stages present in WT.</p><p>Line 307: It is not clear what this statement means. It appears to imply that foxl2l-expressing cells are sexually differentiated. However, in Figure 2A it is shown that foxl2l is expressed in germ cells of ZZ fish during the bipotential stage, yet these germ cell presumable would have differentiated as sperm, not oocytes.</p><p>L302-322: The authors need to spell out the evidence that supports these statements. It could be argued that the difference is not in the role of foxl2l between Medaka and zebrafish, but the fact that medaka has a strong genetic sex determination mechanism while zebrafish does not. Thus, the apparent difference in phenotype is because medaka cannot sex reverse as easily as zebrafish.</p><p>L331: For completeness, please add a reference to Wilson et al., (2024; PMID: 38529407)</p><p>L356: The authors argue that one role of Foxl2l is to suppress <italic>Dmrt1</italic> expression in progenitor cells, yet in the foxl2l mutant germ cells, <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is upregulated in all mutant cell stages, from GSC to prog-C cells (i.e. even in cells that do not normally express foxl2l expression). It is possible that the upregulation in all cells is because the gonads from which these cells were isolated have already begun to differentiate as a testis and the germ cells are now more male-like than female-like. This would also suggest the possibility that male and female GSC's do not express equivalent amounts of <italic>Dmrt1</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The major conclusion, i.e., title and short title may be misleading and may cause confusion. Stemness is the ability of a cell to perpetuate/continue/preserve its lineage, to give rise to differentiated cells. With foxl2l, progenitor cells committed cell (Prog-C) will continue to develop into late progenitor (Prog-L). In addition, there is no strong evidence that Prog-C was able to dedifferentiate back into GSC in foxl2l mutants. Prog-C could be simply lost in foxl2l mutant, and increased nanos2 cells could be due to increased proliferation of GSC. Therefore, &quot;Foxl2l suppresses stemness&quot; could be misleading. Is there size and morphological difference between prog-C and prog-L?</p><p>Lines 23-24, 64-65 and in other parts of the text &quot;germ cell types … remain elusive&quot; &quot;developmental stages of germ cells in zebrafish remain unclear.&quot; Probably should be specified as early germ cell types. Five developmental stages of germ cells (oocytes) in zebrafish are well defined by Kelly Selman since 1993. In fact, this manuscript was focusing on fine classification and separation of different germ cell types prior to stage I, which should be highlighted or emphasized, because this is not possible until scRNAseq became available.</p><p>The label D for figure 1D is too far, should be close to the sub-panel.</p><p>It is hard to view two different symbols illustrated in Figures 3C and 4A, suggest to separate symbols into side-by-side figures.</p><p>The cell numbers for mutant in figure 3D are much higher than those in WT, why?</p><p>Why are there two nanos2 lines (lines 1 &amp; 3) in the same GSC group with different expression profiles in Figure 3E? nanos2 expression was not listed for the mutants in figure 3E.

So, is it still validate using wildtype marker genes to define developmental stages found in foxl2l. Can different types of early germ cells be separated using scRNAseq data from the foxl2l mutant?

Data are well presented. Some of the conclusions do not seem to be well supported by the data, or alternatives are sometimes not considered.</p><p>The authors investigated development of zebrafish germ cells by isolating Piwil1-expressing cells and performing scRNA-seq in wild types at 26 days post fertilization, which augments published single cell transcriptomic studies of whole zebrafish gonads at 40 dpf, and they performed scRNA-seq experiments on mutants lacking foxl2l activity. These data, validated by in situ hybridization studies, allowed the identification of new stages of germ cell development. Studies showed that foxl2l mutants failed to develop meiotic oocytes, and that mutant germ cells reached a modified committed progenitor stage (Prog-C) but did not become late progenitors (Prog-L). The cells the authors called Prog-C cells in mutants, unlike wild types, expressed some GSC markers, suggesting that they maybe shouldn't be called Prog-C cells in mutants. From this result, the text concluded that committed progenitors then reverted to germ cell stem cells (GSC), which then directly developed into spermatogenic cells, and hence the animals became males, concluding that this was a direct development into males.</p><p>Alternative hypotheses exist for these data. The expression of genes normally expressed by GSCs (e.g., nanos2) in what otherwise seem to be committed progenitors was interpreted as a reversion of Prog-Cs to GSCs. An equally possible hypothesis is that the normally GSC-expressed genes never turned off and that the mutant 'Prog-C' never fully developed. Both explanations need to be presented and arguments assessed for and against each of these explanations.</p><p>Additionally, the conclusion that there was direct male differentiation in foxl2l mutants without going through the female phase has alternative explanations consistent with the data. This direct male development argument assumes that the Prog-C stage has not already embarked on a female pathway. The text did not demonstrate that Prog-C, or even the earlier stages like Prog-E, had not already begun to be female. The very name 'committed progenitor cells' suggests that these cells are already committed to the female pathway in wild types.</p><p>These authors and others have shown that one of the earliest steps in female gonad development in zebrafish is an increase in the number of primordial germ cells compared to zebrafish that will become males, by 14 days post fertilization. The cell division marker analysis reported here suggests that those PGC proliferation steps are already occurring in the cells studied here. So do the 'Proliferation' arrows shown in Figure 6 for both the Prog-E and Prog-C stages. Thus, these stages would already be female-oriented germ cells. And thus, when the reversion of Prog-C towards Prog-C-to-GSC happens, what that really represents is a reversion of female pathway cells towards uncommitted GSCs that then embark on a male pathway, as happens in many zebrafish individuals due to stress or temperature or other features. Thus, the data presented here shows that the male pathway is taken after germ cells have embarked on the female pathway and turned on foxl2l, but subsequently thwarted from becoming a meiotic oocyte due to the lack of Foxl2l in the mutants.</p><p>The title (Single cell transcriptomes of zebrafish germline reveal stemness suppression and progenitor feminization by Foxl2l) should be revised because the conclusion that Foxl2l suppresses 'stemness' is not well supported. The data do show that foxl2l mutants have cell types that co-express GSC markers like nanos2 with genes usually expressed later in female germ cell development, like sycp1 and sycp3 (Figure S6), but that does not clearly mean that these mutant cells are in fact stem cells.</p><p>The 'allmarkers' files are not included in the supplementary data, making it impossible to see how genes were selected for display.

Furthermore, <italic>foxl2l</italic> is not “initially expressed in the juvenile ovary state that lab strains develop through”.

Consider alternative explanations for the differences in the action of Foxl2(Fox3) in zebrafish and medaka.</p></disp-quote><p>Medaka Foxl2l promotes meiotic entry and the expression of meiotic genes.

These differences raise two possibilities. First, Foxl2l in medaka and zebrafish share a similar role in regulating progenitor differentiation. The difference in mutant phenotypes can be due to a stronger female tendency in medaka that prevents complete blockage of female differentiation and meiosis in <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutants. Second, zebrafish Foxl2l has an additional role in driving progenitor differentiation.

The authors conclude that the committed progenitors revert to GSCs based on the coexpression of nanos2 and foxl2l nanos2 and later on the same page line 262, based on expression of id1 in mutants but not WT. Without functional data demonstrating that the progenitors revert to an early state, alternative interpretations should be considered. For example, can the authors exclude the alternative possibility that the cells initiate the committed progenitor program but do not shut off and continue to express the GSC program such that the coexpression of both programs blocks differentiation? It would help to discuss these findings in the context of Fox family functions. Some Fox family members, Foxl2 and FoxPs for example, are known to be both activators and repressors of transcription or act primarily as repressors. Relevant to this work, repressive activity of Foxl2 has previously been reported in the mammalian ovary (Pisarska et al. Endocrinology 2004, Pisarska Am J. Phys Endo. Metabolism 2010, Kuo Reproduction 2012, Kuo Endocrinology 2011, as well as several more recent publications). In this context interfering with Foxl2 repression was proposed to accelerate follicle recruitment and cause premature ovarian failure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful comment. Alternative interpretations are indeed needed. We have examined the expression of GSC markers including <italic>nanos2</italic> and found that in the mutants, <italic>nanos2</italic> or other GSC markers were not significantly upregulated in the GSC-to progenitor transition (G-P) and early progenitors (Prog-E) (Figure 4B). The expression of these GSC markers was also low in the integrated clusters when G-P and Prog-E stages were prominent (Figure 3D and Figure 3E). Only one GSC marker, <italic>nanos2</italic>, was high in mutant Prog-C. These results indicate that perhaps some mutant Prog-C acquires some GSC properties with the upregulation of <italic>nanos2</italic> instead of a continuous GSC program. We have now included both interpretations and clarified our rationale about the mutant cells gaining a new GSC property. We have also included the discussion about the dual regulation of <italic>Foxl2</italic> in the <bold>discussion</bold>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discussion Page 9 lines 289-293.

This analysis is furthermore backed up by functional analysis. In the absence of functional Foxl2l, Prog-L is absent and the mutant gonads eventually undergo male development. Therefore, we infer that Prog-L stage is required for female differentiation and Foxl2l is essential for the differentiation of Prog-C to Prog-L. On a different note about the expression of <italic>foxl2l</italic>, our in situ hybridization data show that <italic>foxl2l</italic> has the same expression pattern in the wild Nadia strain as in laboratory strains at the larval stage (Figure 2).

The PCs and the projected PCs were used to identify the mutual nearest neighbors across mutant cells and WT cells. These mutual nearest neighbors were considered anchors and scored based on the consistency across the neighborhood structure of each dataset. Lastly, the developmental stage of each mutant cell was determined using a weighted voting mechanism. This process considers the stages of WT cells in every anchor, with votes weighted according to the anchor score and the proximity between the mutant cell and its corresponding anchor mutant cell.

The initial number of sorted cells for scRNA-seq was comparable between the two groups, with 3,231 WT cells and 4,019 mutant cells collected. Following sequencing, 1,677 WT and 2,947 mutant barcodes were identified as containing intact cells using the default settings of the 10x Cell Ranger pipeline. Subsequently, we employed a rigorous two-step quality control procedure to eliminate low-quality cells, such as damaged cells and doublets, as detailed in the &quot;Quality Control&quot; section. To ensure the robustness of our analysis, we retained 769 high-quality WT cells and 2,399 high-quality mutant cells for downstream analyses. The greater retention of mutant cells after quality control may reflect variations in cellular properties, such as viability or transcriptomic integrity between the WT and mutant samples. It can be random or because of the higher numbers of germ cells at the Prog-C stage in the mutant gonads due to germ cell arrest and accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why are there two nanos2 lines (lines 1 &amp; 3) in the same GSC group with different expression profiles in Figure 3E? nanos2 expression was not listed for the mutants in figure 3E.

Additionally, we also detected many cells that uniquely expressed mutant-specific marker genes (Figure 3E). These findings support their utility in delineating mutant germ cell types despite the altered gene regulatory environment.</p><p>Furthermore, we acknowledge the presence of unique early germ cell types in the mutant population. To address this, we performed a co-clustering analysis of WT and mutant cells based on their comprehensive transcriptomic profiles. This approach does not assume a direct correspondence between mutant and WT developmental stages. Instead, it facilitates the identification of novel germ cell types in mutants while characterizing the relationship between WT and mutant cells. The eight integrated groups (I1-I8) reveal both shared and distinct transcriptomic features, providing deeper insights into the altered developmental program of foxl2l mutants (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can different types of early germ cells be separated using scRNAseq data from the foxl2l mutant? Can pseudotime plots be used for the foxl2l mutant? If so, what looks like?</p></disp-quote><p>Trajectory and pseudotime analyses depend on critical assumptions regarding the selection of root cells and the underlying structure of cellular trajectories, whether they follow a tree-like, linear, or circular pattern. The inferred trajectories are highly sensitive to parameter choices, which are often informed by biological hypotheses and thus carry an element of subjectivity. Most trajectory inference tools, including Monocle3, are optimized for tree-like structures and may require parameter adjustments to accurately model looped or cyclic trajectories as hypothesized for the mutant cells. A pseudotime plot for the mutant cells may thus appears meaningless. To ensure a rigorous and transparent analysis, we opted not to include potentially subjective trajectory and pseudotime results, presenting only similarity-based analysis in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abnormal increased expression of nonfunctional foxl2l (figure 3F) in foxl2l mutant suggests a feedback mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, I agree that there is a feedback mechanism for <italic>foxl2l</italic> expression although we did not emphasize this point in the text.

We also found that <italic>foxl2l</italic> transcripts were aberrantly upregulated in only mutant Prog-E (Figure 4B). It is possible that the Foxl2l might have feedback regulation in Prog-E.

Therefore, overexpress/knockout only one or two DEGs might not be sufficient to replicate these <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Guest Editor (suggestions for the authors)</p><p>The Hsu et al. manuscript presents valuable data that extend earlier single cell transcriptomic data on zebrafish gonads to help us better understand various initial stages of germ cell development in zebrafish and the role of Foxl2l in oogenesis. Data are well presented. Some of the conclusions do not seem to be well supported by the data, or alternatives are sometimes not considered.</p><p>The authors investigated development of zebrafish germ cells by isolating Piwil1-expressing cells and performing scRNA-seq in wild types at 26 days post fertilization, which augments published single cell transcriptomic studies of whole zebrafish gonads at 40 dpf, and they performed scRNA-seq experiments on mutants lacking foxl2l activity. These data, validated by in situ hybridization studies, allowed the identification of new stages of germ cell development. Studies showed that foxl2l mutants failed to develop meiotic oocytes, and that mutant germ cells reached a modified committed progenitor stage (Prog-C) but did not become late progenitors (Prog-L). The cells the authors called Prog-C cells in mutants, unlike wild types, expressed some GSC markers, suggesting that they maybe shouldn't be called Prog-C cells in mutants. From this result, the text concluded that committed progenitors then reverted to germ cell stem cells (GSC), which then directly developed into spermatogenic cells, and hence the animals became males, concluding that this was a direct development into males.</p><p>Alternative hypotheses exist for these data. The expression of genes normally expressed by GSCs (e.g., nanos2) in what otherwise seem to be committed progenitors was interpreted as a reversion of Prog-Cs to GSCs. An equally possible hypothesis is that the normally GSC-expressed genes never turned off and that the mutant 'Prog-C' never fully developed. Both explanations need to be presented and arguments assessed for and against each of these explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. We have contemplated alternative explanations for our results. Regarding the possibility of continued GSC programs in the mutants, we examined the expression profile of GSC markers including <italic>nanos2</italic>, <italic>cbx7a</italic>, <italic>psmb13a</italic> and <italic>dnmt3bb.1</italic> in mutant cells. All of them showed low expression in GSC-to-progenitor transition (G-P) stage and Prog-E stage in the mutant (Figure 3D, 3E). In DEG analysis, no GSC markers were upregulated in GSC-to-progenitor transition (G-P) or Prog-E. In Prog-C, however, <italic>nanos2</italic> was abruptly upregulated. This result indicates that the GSC program was shut off during the differentiation from GSC to progenitor. It was re-expressed in the mutant at the Prog-C stage. Therefore, it is more likely that in the absence of functional Foxl2l, Prog-C acquires some GSC property with upregulation of <italic>nanos2</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the conclusion that there was direct male differentiation in foxl2l mutants without going through the female phase has alternative explanations consistent with the data. This direct male development argument assumes that the Prog-C stage has not already embarked on a female pathway. The text did not demonstrate that Prog-C, or even the earlier stages like Prog-E, had not already begun to be female. The very name 'committed progenitor cells' suggests that these cells are already committed to the female pathway in wild types.</p></disp-quote><p>Our transcriptomic analysis showed that both male genes (eg. <italic>tekt1</italic>, <italic>odf3b</italic>) and genes related to female meiosis (e.g., <italic>rec8a</italic>, <italic>meiosin</italic>) were barely detected in Prog-E and Prog-C, suggesting that male or female pathway has not yet been initiated in Prog-E and Prog-C. Furthermore, in Prog-L, the female meiotic genes start to express highly, suggesting that Prog-C is the commitment stage toward either female differentiation or remaining indifferent, followed by male differentiation in the future. This is why the term “committed progenitor” is used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These authors and others have shown that one of the earliest steps in female gonad development in zebrafish is an increase in the number of primordial germ cells compared to zebrafish that will become males, by 14 days post fertilization. The cell division marker analysis reported here suggests that those PGC proliferation steps are already occurring in the cells studied here. So do the 'Proliferation' arrows shown in Figure 6 for both the Prog-E and Prog-C stages. Thus, these stages would already be female-oriented germ cells. And thus, when the reversion of Prog-C towards Prog-C-to-GSC happens, what that really represents is a reversion of female pathway cells towards uncommitted GSCs that then embark on a male pathway, as happens in many zebrafish individuals due to stress or temperature or other features. Thus, the data presented here shows that the male pathway is taken after germ cells have embarked on the female pathway and turned on foxl2l, but subsequently thwarted from becoming a meiotic oocyte due to the lack of Foxl2l in the mutants.</p><p>The title (Single cell transcriptomes of zebrafish germline reveal stemness suppression and progenitor feminization by Foxl2l) should be revised because the conclusion that Foxl2l suppresses 'stemness' is not well supported. The data do show that foxl2l mutants have cell types that co-express GSC markers like nanos2 with genes usually expressed later in female germ cell development, like sycp1 and sycp3 (Figure S6), but that does not clearly mean that these mutant cells are in fact stem cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful comments. Only Prog-L expressed female meiotic genes, indicating these cells already differentiated towards females. The earlier progenitors, Prog-E and Prog-C, are indifferent progenitors because they lack transcripts of both male and female marker genes. Prog-C is the commitment stage deciding either to initiate female differentiation or remain indifferent, waiting for future male differentiation. Here in our mutant study, we found <italic>foxl2l</italic> is critical for the development of Prog-C toward Prog-L. Therefore, in the <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant, Prog-C fails to develop into Prog-L and fails to undergo female differentiation. Taken together, we suggest that in the <italic>foxl2l</italic> mutant, female differentiation is fully blocked, and some of the Prog-C start to express the GSC marker <italic>nanos2</italic> through an unknown mechanism. We agree to remove the term “suppression of stemness”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The 'allmarkers' files are not included in the supplementary data, making it impossible to see how genes were selected for display.

We found that the expression of these genes was low in mutants at GSC-to-progenitor transition stage and Prog-E stage. Their expression remained low after cells are differentiated into progenitors, and only <italic>nanos2</italic> was abruptly upregulated in mutant Prog-C. Therefore, it is more likely that the mutant Prog-C acquires some GSC property with the upregulation of <italic>nanos2</italic> instead of the maintenance of GSC property during the development from GSC to progenitor.
