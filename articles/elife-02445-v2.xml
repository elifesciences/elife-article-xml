Initiation of HR in the G1 phase blocks non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) impairing DSB repair. Completion of HR in G1 cells can lead to the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), which is potentially carcinogenic. We conducted a gain-of-function screen to identify miRNAs that regulate HR-mediated DSB repair, and of these miRNAs, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* specifically suppress the HR-pathway in the G1 phase. These miRNAs target the transcripts of HR factors, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, and inhibiting miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* increases expression of BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51 specifically in the G1-phase leading to impaired DSB repair. Depletion of CtIP, a BRCA1-associated DNA end resection protein, rescues this phenotype. Furthermore, deletion of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* in independent cohorts of ovarian tumors correlates with significant increase in LOH events/chromosomal aberrations and BRCA1 expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02445.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02445.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02445.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in a cell is damaged thousands of times every day. One of the most serious types of damage involves something breaking both of the strands in the double helix. Such a double-strand break can delete genes or even kill the cell. In fact, conventional cancer therapy kills cancer cells by causing irreparable double-strand breaks. Conversely, a normal cell that is constantly exposed to DNA damaging agents can become a tumor if double-strand breaks are incorrectly repaired. An efficient and accurate double-strand break repair system needs to be in place to prevent this transformation. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of double-strand break repair and the factors involved are important for both gaining insight into the cause of cancer and to improve cancer therapy.</p><p>Cells have evolved several different ways to detect and repair double-strand breaks. A method called homologous recombination, for example, uses an undamaged DNA molecule as a template that can be copied to make new DNA. Since it needs a readily available DNA template, this method only works in phases of the cell growth cycle where there are many copies of DNA—that is, in the post-DNA replication phases. In particular, homologous recombination does not work during the pre-replication, G1 phase. If homologous recombination is attempted during G1, it will block the other methods employed by cells to repair broken strands of DNA.</p><p>An important challenge is to understand how homologous recombination is restricted to particular parts of the cell cycle. Although certain proteins associated with the early stages of double-strand repair are thought to determine the type of DNA repair that occurs, the details of this process are not fully understood.</p><p>One group of molecules that are thought to be involved are microRNAs, which normally limit the number of proteins produced from certain genes. However, since a single microRNA molecule can be associated with several proteins, and since a single protein can be associated with several microRNA molecules, it has proved difficult to establish the exact effects of a specific microRNA molecule.</p><p>Choi et al. now show that seven microRNA molecules can control homologous recombination, and three microRNAs in particular restrict homologous recombination during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. If these microRNAs are inhibited during the G1 phase, which allows homologous recombination to start, and counter-intuitively more double-stranded breaks are seen. However, if a gene involved in starting homologous repair–called CtIP—is silenced while the microRNAs are inhibited, then the DNA breaks are repaired. Exactly, how the microRNA molecules produce different effects during different phases of the cell cycle will be need to be investigated by future studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02445.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02445.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>BRCA1</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA142698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Dipanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-12-079-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Dipanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL52725</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Andrea</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Susan Komen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KG101186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Eunmi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ann-Fuller Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Dipanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Susan Smith Women's Cancer Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Dipanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000983</institution-id><institution>Mary Kay Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Dipanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MicroRNAs tightly control the cellular level of homologous recombination (HR) factors in the G1 phase, and failure of this control system results in an ectopic increase in HR proteins in G1 cells leading to impaired DNA repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Double-stranded DNA break (DSB)s are deleterious for cell health and accurate repair of DSBs is critical for maintaining genome stability. Two major mechanistically distinct pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) have evolved to repair DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2012b</xref>). HR requires an undamaged homologous DNA template to replace an adjacent damaged one with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, the untemplated NHEJ pathway is more error-prone as it rapidly processes and joins broken DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lieber, 2010</xref>). There is tight regulation of the DSB repair pathways during the cell cycle as HR is restricted to the S/G2 phase and NHEJ is pre-dominant in G1 but has moderate activity throughout the cell cycle. The balance of HR and NHEJ proteins (such as BRCA1 and 53BP1) involved in early steps of the two repair pathways are critical for pathway choice and the cell-cycle phase specific regulation of each pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouwman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2012b</xref>). Initiation of HR via resection of broken DNA ends blocks NHEJ and could lead to unrepaired DSBs in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helmink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>). The physiological consequence of HR-mediated repair of a DSB in the G1-phase is the loss of heterozygosity (LOH).</p><p>The molecular mechanism of restricting HR to S/G2 phases of the cell cycle is of paramount importance in cancer biology. Ectopic HR leading to LOH may play a critical role in carcinogenesis as recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed and/or tumor suppressor function is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bishop and Schiestl, 2003</xref>). The regulation of the HR pathway is also extremely relevant for cancer therapy. Chemical inhibitors of the DNA repair protein, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), exhibit synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors that have a defective HR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryant et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farmer et al., 2005</xref>). Although the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype remains unresolved, lack of PARP activity in an HR-deficient scenario leads to the accumulation of DSBs in proliferating cells and this triggers apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helleday, 2011</xref>). Epigenetic suppression of factors in the HR pathway occurs in sporadic breast and ovarian tumors, and collectively this phenotype has been described as ‘BRCAness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). Tumors with the ‘BRCAness’ phenotype are likely to respond to PARP inhibitors, and identifying factors (such as microRNAs) that induce the ‘BRCAness’ phenotype may enhance the clinical utility and scope of PARP inhibitors.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are abundant small (∼20–22 nts) non-coding RNAs that typically dampen gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabian et al., 2010</xref>) and are aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garzon et al., 2009</xref>). The regulation elicited by miRNAs is highly complex, given that a single miRNA can influence the expression of many mRNAs, and conversely a single mRNA is targeted by multiple miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Due to this complexity the role of miRNAs in DSB repair remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>). Using the experimental system of in vitro hematopoietic cell differentiation, we discovered that miR-182 targets BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moskwa et al., 2011</xref>). Over-expression of miR-182 in triple negative breast tumor lines (in vitro and in vivo) suppresses HR via down-regulation of BRCA1 and sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors. This served as a ‘proof-of principle’ that miRNAs may influence HR-mediated repair of DSBs.</p><p>In this study, we used PARP inhibitor sensitivity as a marker for HR deficiency to conduct a functional screen to identify miRNAs that down-regulate HR. Over-expression of seven miRNAs significantly reduced HR-mediated DSB repair. Based on their expression in a panel of breast and ovarian lines, we focused on characterizing the mechanism and physiological relevance of miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b*. Despite lacking canonical binding sites, miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* associate with the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts and regulate their expression. Remarkably, the miRNA-mediated regulation of these genes is cell cycle dependent and inhibition of miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* leads to enhanced expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 specifically in the G1 phase. A functional consequence of inhibiting these miRNAs is a basal increase in DSBs in G1 cells. This phenotype can be reversed by silencing CtIP (the BRCA1-associated DNA end resection factor) which initiates HR-mediated DSB repair. Furthermore, deletion of these miRNAs in two independent cohorts of high-grade serous ovarian tumors correlates with increase in LOH.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening miRNA mimic libraries for PARP inhibitor sensitivity</title><p>To systematically identify miRNAs that impact PARP inhibitor sensitivity, we screened two commercially available miRNA mimic libraries (Qiagen, Valencia, CA and Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY). miRNA mimics are 20–22 nt, chemically modified double-stranded RNA molecules designed to mimic endogenous mature miRNAs. The miRNA mimics from Qiagen and Applied Biosystems have proprietary chemical modifications that cause inactivation of the ‘passenger’ strand, allowing the ‘active’ strand to associate with target transcripts and regulate gene expression. The goal was to identify miRNA mimics that sensitize breast tumor cells, MDA-MB231 to the clinical PARP inhibitor, ABT888 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The miRNA mimics from Applied Biosystems impacted ABT888 sensitivity over a broad range, ∼10- to 12-fold difference between the mimics with the highest impact on viability and the control mimics. Whereas the viability range with the mimics from Qiagen was limited to 3- to 4-fold. BRCA2 siRNA served as a positive control for each plate and the mimic for miR-182 served as an internal control. BRCA2 is an important gene for repair of replication-induced DNA damage and depletion of BRCA2 has an impact on viability even in the absence of PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). miRNA mimics that caused significant loss of viability in the absence of PARP inhibitors (equal or more than BRCA2 siRNA) were not considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Applied Biosystems library yielded a rank ordered list of the top 13 miRNAs (including miR-182) based on viability percentage that sensitized cells to ABT888 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<italic>Z</italic>-score thresholds [Z &lt; −2]). Prior to individual validation experiments, we utilized the results from the screen performed with the Qiagen library to confirm the impact of these miRNAs on ABT888 sensitivity. Our results show that 12 of the 13 miRNAs had at least a 25% impact on ABT888 sensitivity. Next, we confirmed the impact of these miRNAs on PARP inhibitor sensitivity using two clinical PARP inhibitors, ABT888 and olaparib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) in two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB231 and 21NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together, these results validate our primary screen and suggest that these miRNAs may regulate the efficacy of HR-mediated repair of DSBs.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02445.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>miRNA screen for PARP inhibitor sensitivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a gain-of-function screen using miRNA mimic libraries from Applied Biosystems and Qiagen to identify miRNAs that sensitize cells to the PARP inhibitor, ABT888.

To test whether expression of the 12 selected miRNAs impacts HR, we used a functional assay that assesses HR-mediated repair of an I-SceI-induced DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>). U2OS cells that have a single, stably integrated copy of the artificial recombination substrate DR-GFP were used for this assay. A chromosomal DSB was introduced in one of two tandem non-functional GFP genes by transient transfection of an I-SceI-encoding plasmid. A functional GFP gene can be reconstituted if the DSB is repaired by HR using the other partial GFP gene as a template. Using this assay, 11 of the 12 miRNAs significantly diminished HR-mediated DSB repair, which correlated with their impact on PARPi sensitivity. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We prioritized the miRNAs according to their impact on HR and selected 7 miRNAs that reduced HR-efficiency by ≥30% (miR-1231, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, miR-193b*, and miR-185*). RAD51 is involved in HR, and quantification of nuclear RAD51 foci has also been used to evaluate HR in various cell systems including primary breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Willers et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with our DR-GFP reporter assay, over-expression of all 7 miRNAs in MDA-MB231 cells had a significant impact on RAD51 foci ranging from a 50–75% reduction in foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02445.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>miRNAs sensitize cells to PARP inhibitors by targeting HR-mediated DSB repair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Measurement of HR-mediated repair of an I-SceI induced site-specific DSB.

From the perspective of cancer biology, the HR pathway is extremely relevant for breast tumors, specifically triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lips et al., 2011</xref>), and clinical trials with PARP inhibitors are underway in TNBC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Shaughnessy et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2011</xref>).

We used a two-pronged approach to identify these genes. First, we used a collection of target prediction algorithms to identify genes targeted by these 3 miRNAs and compared it to the list of DDR proteins (see the ‘Materials and methods’). Second, we used a candidate-based approach using the prediction algorithm RNA22 to screen all the genes implicated in DDR for miRNA recognition element of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b*. This gave us a list of 18 proteins which have been previously implicated in HR-mediated repair of DSBs. We then assessed the impact of over-expressing miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* on the mRNA level of these 18 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). There was at least a 50% reduction in the transcripts of EXO1, MDC1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51, and PALB2 in cells over-expressing either miR-1255b, miR-148b*, or miR-193b*. We next determined the impact of these miRNAs on the protein levels of the putative targets. Over-expressing miR-1255b reduces the cellular levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2, miR-148b* reduces RAD51 and miR-193b* reduces BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and this impact is not related to an altered cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although over-expression of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* correlates with significant increase in the transcripts of certain DNA repair genes (such as MRE11 and NBS1 for miR-1255b and miR-193b*; EXO1 for miR-193b*), there was no detectable increase in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

To test for association of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* with their respective target transcripts, we adopted a recently described method for capturing miRNA–mRNA complexes using streptavidin-coated beads from cells transfected with biotinylated forms of the miRNA mimics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orom and Lund, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lal et al., 2011</xref>).

Strikingly, consistent with our previous results, miR-1255b selectively pulled-down BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts but not the RAD51 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Conversely, miR-148b* pulled-down RAD51 transcript but not BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts, and miR-193b* pulled down all three transcripts.

However, it is noteworthy that there is considerable evidence of ‘seedless’ or non-canonical association of miRNAs with target transcripts including sites in the coding sequence (CDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Didiano and Hobert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lal et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loeb et al., 2012</xref>).

As anticipated, there was significant decrease in luciferase activity, and this was ‘rescued’ by point mutations that disrupt base pairing between miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* and their corresponding MREs in BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Analyzing all the MREs individually, we compared the relative impact of each MRE on luciferase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To confirm the interaction of endogenous miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* with specific MREs in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts, we adopted a loss-of-function approach. We used miRNA inhibitors (also known as antagomirs, ANTs) that are single-stranded chemically enhanced oligonucleotides designed to irreversibly bind endogeneous miR-1255b, miR-193b* and miR-148b and suppress their activity. We estimated luciferase activity after inhibiting the miRNAs using antagomirs and, consistent with our previous results, found that inhibition of miR-1255b enhanced luciferase activity of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 reporter construct, inhibition of miR-148b* enhanced luciferase activity of the RAD51 reporter construct, and inhibition of miR-193b* enhanced luciferase activity of the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The specificity of the MREs was further validated as the mutant versions of the luciferase reporters were immune to the antagomirs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>The luciferase reporter assays with MREs provide important information regarding the miRNA/mRNA association but have limited physiological relevance. To determine the functional significance of non-canonical MREs in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts we generated expression constructs without the MREs by either deletion (MREs in 3′UTR) or mutation (MREs in CDS) of them. Next, MDA-MB231 cells were co-transfected with (i) miR-1255b and BRCA1 or BRCA2 expression plasmid lacking miR-1255b binding sites; (ii) miR-193b* and BRCA1 or BRCA2 or RAD51 expression plasmid lacking miR-193b* binding sites; (iii) miR-148b* and a RAD51 expression plasmid lacking miR-148b* binding sites. First, the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 expression constructs lacking the specific MREs completely restored the expression of these genes in the presence of the corresponding miRNA mimic further validating the predicted MREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, lower panel). Furthermore, in regard to ABT888 sensitivity, expression of BRCA1 or BRCA2 significantly ‘rescued’ the impact of miR-1255b, expression of BRCA1 or BRCA2 or RAD51 significantly ‘rescued’ the impact of miR-193b*, and expression of RAD51 significantly ‘rescued’ the impact of miR-148b* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, upper panel).

We observed that the number of LOH events is significantly higher in tumors with deletions of miR-148b* and miR-193b* relative to the tumors that are diploid copy neutral at these loci. The number of LOH events was also moderately higher (One tailed Mann Whitney's U test; p&lt;0.08) in tumors with deletion of miR-1225b compared to the copy neutral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It is noteworthy that mature miR-1255b is encoded from two distinct genomic loci (miR-1255b-1 on chr4: 36427988-36428050 and miR-1255b-2 on chr1: 167967898-167967964). In our deletion analysis, we correlated LOH events with deletion of either miR-1255b-1 or miR-1255b-2, therefore the moderate correlation of LOH with loss of miR-1255b may be due to the presence of the second copy. The limited sample size with deletions of both miR-1255b-1 and miR-1255b-2 precludes any statistical analysis. Reflecting overall genomic instability, there is a significant increase in somatic amplifications and deletions in tumors with deletions in miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>To validate our analysis in a second cohort, we obtained processed LOH and somatic copy number alteration data for 47 high-grade serous ovarian tumors, which had been processed at Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC).

The statistical significance was limited due to small size of the data set, but the patterns were consistent even with alternative cutoffs. In our analysis, we compared the copy neutral LOH events to specifically focus on LOH events that are likely to occur due to recombination between homologous alleles. Finally, in agreement with our experimental data, there is a significant increase in BRCA1 expression in the tumors with deletions in miR-1255b and miR-193b*(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), which we speculate is the underlying reason for the increase in LOH and overall genomic instability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Contrary to other cellular processes and signaling pathways, there has been limited investigation of miRNAs in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>). In the few recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimitrov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Neijenhuis et al., 2013</xref>), including ones from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lal et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moskwa et al., 2011</xref>), the focus has been the impact of a single miRNA on an individual DSB protein. A key conceptual limitation to this approach is that miRNAs typically target hundreds of transcripts and are more likely to have a profound impact on a pathway like the HR repair pathway by regulating several HR factors. Here, we systematically identified miRNAs influencing HR (miR-1231, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, miR-193b*, and miR-185*) and observed that three of these miRNAs (miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b*) regulate expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51. Intriguingly, they lack canonical binding sites in the 3′UTR of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, but interact with these transcripts via non-canonical MREs. These results underline the importance of binding of miRNAs to their target transcripts that are not restricted to base pairing at ‘seed regions’, and highlight the shortcomings of current prediction algorithms in identifying functional targets of miRNAs.</p><p>The choice of DSB repair pathway is critical for maintaining genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2012b</xref>). Specifically 53BP1 and its associated factors (RIF1 and PTIP) promote NHEJ and counter BRCA1 thereby balancing the process of DSB repair between HR and NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouwman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Virgilio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zimmermann et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of the 53BP1-associated protein RIF1 or the protein H2AX allows the BRCA1/CtIP-mediated resection of DNA ends in G1 cells impeding NHEJ and leading to the persistence of DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helmink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, it is likely that the ectopic increase in expression of BRCA1 and other HR factors in the G1 phase will also disrupt the balance of DSB repair. Our results represent an intriguing example of an organized, miRNA-driven physiological system for controlling the level of endogenous HR factors in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Down-regulating the expression of HR factors, particularly, an HR-initiating factor like BRCA1 in the G1 cells is necessary for maintaining genomic stability. Inhibiting miR-1255b and miR-193b* allows increased BRCA1 expression in G1 cells leading to CtIP-mediated resection and a potential block in NHEJ. This will disrupt the balance of HR and NHEJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) with significant increase in genomic instability. Furthermore, execution of HR-mediated repair in G1 cells would result in LOH which has the potential of revealing recessive oncogenic mutations. The loss of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* largely correlates with increased genomic instability and a higher frequency of LOH, which is consistent with our experimental data. In some cases, the correlations are moderate and not statistically significant, and this may reflect the heterogeneity of primary tumors, limited sample size and the technical shortcomings of large sets of genomic data. These shortcomings notwithstanding, there is a clear pattern that emerges from our experimental data and clinical analysis that strongly suggests that miRNAs regulate the optimal expression of HR proteins in the course of the cell cycle and prevent ectopic activation of the HR pathway. A single copy loss of BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konishi et al., 2011</xref>), BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Popova et al., 2012</xref>), or RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smeenk et al., 2010</xref>) impacts genomic stability giving credence to the idea that a miRNA-mediated alteration in the cellular levels of these proteins may significantly impact the DNA repair process. Furthermore, for miR-1255b and miR-193b*, there is a moderate reduction in multiple HR factors, which further compounds their impact on the HR repair pathway. The underlying mechanism of cell cycle-dependent expression of miRNAs regulating HR factors remains to be investigated in future studies.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02445.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model of miRNA dependent regulation of DSB repair during cell cycle.</title><p>Model of miRNA-dependent regulation of DSB repair during cell cycle. The balance of HR and NHEJ in dividing cells is crucial for efficient DSB repair. NHEJ is the preferred pathway in the G1 phase with 53BP1 and the Ku complex binding the broken DNA end. miRNAs (such as miR-1255b and miR-193b*) suppress HR factors, particularly BRCA1, preventing end resection of the DNA lesions. However, when these miRNAs are inhibited or deleted it may disrupt the correct choice of DSB repair pathway. Ectopic over expression of BRCA1 will allow CtIP-mediated resection in G1 cells, preventing NHEJ. Furthermore, HR-mediated repair in G1 is detrimental to cell health as it would lead to LOH. In S-phase, DSBs are predominantly repaired by HR and down-regulation of miRNAs targeting BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 may be important in ensuring efficient HR-mediated DSB repair. Over-expression of miRNAs (such as miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b*) targeting BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 in the S phase will impede various steps of HR, and the HR deficiency will sensitize these cells to PARP inhibitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02445.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02445.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02445-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>BRCA1 MRE1 and BRCA2 MRE2 located in the gene coding sequence were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis.

In brief, as parts of the TCGA initiative, the LOH analysis was performed using Human HapMap 1M Duo beadchips at the Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, and the copy number analysis was performed using Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A microarray at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. We marked those LOH events as heterozygous deletion mediated, which overlapped with deletion events (aCGH log2 signal intensity ratio &lt;−0.20) for at least 80% of its length. After excluding those LOH events, we focused on the copy neutral LOH events of size &gt;1 Mb. There were 26,176 LOH events in 418 samples. In each sample, at each of the three miRNA loci, we inferred its copy number status as follows: miRNA loci of log2 signal intensity &lt;−0.2 were flagged as deletions, and those regions with signal intensity ≥−0.2 to ≤0.2 were flagged as copy neutral. We also obtained processed expression data for the same samples analyzed using the Affy U133A array at the Broad Institute from the TCGA data portal (PMID: 21720365).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>DF/HCC cohort</title><p>The processed LOH calls and per SNP copy number calls were previously described (GSE39130) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2012b</xref>). We focused only on the LOH events with size &gt;10 kb; we counted the number of marker SNPs in those LOH region (N), and the number of such SNPs with allelic copy number &lt;1.9 (n). If n/N was ≥0.8, we postulated that LOH to be deletion mediated; while the remaining ones (n/N &lt;0.8) as copy neutral LOH. There were 685 copy neutral LOH events in these samples. We repeated the analyses with a n/N cut-off of 0.75. In each sample, at each of the three miRNA loci, we inferred its copy number status based on the nearest marker SNP. If the copy number call was &lt;1.9, we marked that as a deletion, and if the copy number call was between 1.9 and 2.1, we flagged it as copy neutral, respectively.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The RPE1-Fucci cells were a gift from David Pellman's laboratory (DFCI).

First, the writing does not meet the standard of scientific English for publication. This is reflected by frequent grammatical errors and informal phrases throughout the text. Second, the writing does not flow smoothly, as many concepts or findings are not explained well. Some data, for instance, the rescue experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, can only be judged after getting a better understanding of what the authors want to deliver. The weakness in the writing significantly compromised the quality of this work. We suggest rewriting this paper in a precise and concise way, and explain the rationale clearly before moving on to the experimental details. We further suggest that you consult a senior colleague to offer comments on your revised text.</p><p>Additional specific comments:</p><p>1) Criteria for selection of positives in the screen</p><p>In the first paragraph of the Results section, the authors claim “we screened two independently synthesized commercially available miRNA mimic libraries and focused on overlapping 'hits'.” Having said that, it is not entirely clear what criteria was used to select those miRNAs that scored positively in this screen.</p><p>The authors selected miR1255b, miR-148b* and miR-193b* for further studies.

Addressing these comments has significantly improved the manuscript.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p><italic>1) Criteria for selection of positives</italic> <italic>in the screen</italic></p><p><italic>In the,first paragraph of the Results section, the authors claim “we screened two independently synthesized commercially available miRNA mimic libraries and focused on overlapping 'hits'.” Having said that, it is not entirely clear what criteria was used to select those miRNAs that scored positive in this screen</italic>.</p><p>First of all, I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding the screen and our criterion for selecting specific miRNAs. We have completely re-written this section to clarify these issues. To systematically identify miRNAs that impact PARP inhibitor sensitivity we screened two commercially available miRNA mimic libraries (Qiagen and Applied Biosytems). MiRNA mimics are 20-22 nts, chemically modified double-stranded RNA molecules designed to mimic endogenous mature miRNAs. The miRNA mimics from Qiagen and Applied Biosystems have proprietary chemical modifications that cause inactivation of the ‘passenger’ strand, allowing the ‘active’ strand to associate with target transcripts and regulate gene expression. We used the Applied Biosytems library as our primary screen, and this yielded a rank ordered list of the top 13 miRNAs based on viability percentage that sensitized cells to PARP inhibitor. Prior to individual validation experiments we utilized the results from the screen performed with the Qiagen library to confirm the impact of these miRNAs on ABT888 sensitivity. Basically the screen with the Qiagen library was used to validate the ‘hits’ from the Applied Biosystems library, before we did any focused experiments.</p><p><italic>Also,</italic> <italic>why were miRNAs that caused a loss of viability equal to BRCA2 siRNA were not considered?</italic></p><p>BRCA2 siRNA served as a positive control for each plate as the original discovery of PARP inhibitors was made using BRCA2 mutant cells. Depletion of BRCA2 dramatically sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors. However, BRCA2 is an important gene for repair of replication-induced DNA damage and depletion of BRCA2 has an impact on viability even in the absence of PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Our goal was to identify miRNAs that cause loss of viability only when cells are treated with PARP inhibitors. Therefore, miRNA mimics that caused significant loss of viability in the absence of PARP inhibitors were not considered. We used BRCA2 depletion in untreated cells as a threshold to eliminate miRNAs that may cause loss of viability independent of PARP inhibitors.</p><p><italic>The authors selected miR1255b, miR-148b* and miR-193b* for further studies. Maybe, I am missing something here, but why were miR-185*</italic>, <italic>miR-367* and miR-1204</italic> not <italic>selected?</italic></p><p>The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref> were derived by artificially introducing miRNA mimics in cells. To explore the physiological relevance of the seven miRNAs that significantly impacted HR-mediated DSB repair and PARP inhibitors sensitivity we needed to identify cells where these miRNAs are endogenously expressed. From the perspective of cancer biology, the HR pathway is extremely relevant for breast tumors, specifically triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and clinical trials with PARP inhibitors are underway in TNBC. Therefore in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> we initially assessed the endogenous expression of seven selected miRNAs (miR-1231, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, miR-193b*, and miR-185*) in a panel of TNBC lines. Of the seven miRNAs, only miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* had detectable and aberrant over expression in TNBC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore we focused on an in-depth analysis of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b*. Again this section has been re-written and the point clarified.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref><italic>, it would be important to include a few miRNAs that scored negatively in their screen</italic>.</p><p>The rationale for Figure3A was not clearly explained in the original version of the manuscript, and we suspect that this comment may be due to this lack of clarity on our part. ∼880 miRNAs scored ‘negatively’ in our screen. The expression level of a large majority of these miRNAs is not known in TNBC lines. I’m not sure what criterion we would utilize to select the ‘negative’ miRNAs and look at their expression in TNBC lines, and more importantly how that would add to our story. However, we did take the reviewers’ comment in mind to further substantiate this figure. Of the seven miRNAs we initially selected based on impact on HR-mediated DSB repair, miR-1231, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, and miR-185* were not expressed in the TNBC lines. However, it is important to show that our detection method is valid for these miRNAs, and their lack of expression in TNBC lines is not an artifact. Therefore we have included data showing that these miRNAs are expressed in other cell lines.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4b</italic></xref><italic>, it would be important to show the luciferase assays with the wild-type 3'UTR in the presence of an inhibitor of the miRNA under study (e.g. miR-1255b on the upper panel)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, and have conducted the luciferase assays in the presence of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistent with the other results, inhibition of miR-1255b enhanced luciferase activity of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 reporter construct, inhibition of miR-148b* enhanced luciferase activity of the RAD51 reporter construct, and inhibition of miR-193b* enhanced luciferase activity of the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 reporter constructs.</p><p><italic>4) The problem of HR silencing during G1 is not solved here but pushed back one step: i.e., there is no information as to how the levels of miRNAs are regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner</italic>.</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers and we have mentioned this point in the Discussion. Looking at how the miRNAs are regulated in a cell cycle dependent is beyond the scope of this study, and would definitely be an important follow-up of this work.</p><p><italic>5) The manuscript itself meanders around such that the reader can lose interest</italic>.</p><p>One issue here is that we have covered significant ground in this one manuscript, and gone from an unbiased screen in cell lines, to molecular mechanism of multiple ‘hits’ and then to clinical analysis. That being said, we have revised the text to improve how the manuscript reads.</p><p><italic>6) Much of the data is borderline in quality: i.e., affinity pull downs, luciferase assays, etc</italic>.</p><p>For the affinity pull down assays we have added additional data using combination of biotinylated miRNA mimics with overlapping targets to confirm and improve the results presented. For the luciferase assays based on the reviewers comments we have used the loss-of-function approach to further substantiate our previous results.</p><p><italic>7) In mRNAs apparently regulated by more than one miRNA,</italic> <italic>why wasn't the combined effect measured?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have now done a combination of these miRNAs with overlapping targets and the results are very consistent. First for the affinity pulldown with biotinylated miRNA mimics we used a combination of miR-1255b and miR-193b*, and a combination of miR-148b* and miR-193b* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>. As anticipated relative to the individual biotinylated mimics there is increased amount of BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts immunoprecipitated with the miR-1255b/miR-193b*combination and increased RAD51 mRNA immunoprecipitated with the miR-148b*/miR-193b* combination. Second, we used combined inhibition of miRNAs with overlapping targets to observe a synergistic increase in target transcripts in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). There is a significant increase in BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cells co-transfected with miR-1255b ANT and miR-193b*ANT, and a significant increase in RAD51 mRNA in cells co-transfected with miR-148b*ANT and miR-193b*ANT.</p><p><italic>8) Many of the experiments would have been much more convincing if done in synchronized or facs sorted cells</italic>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref> we first discovered that these miRNAs are regulated during the cell cycle. All the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref> were conducted in synchronized cells. We were concerned that synchronizing cells can influence the DNA damage response, and therefore in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> we tried to observe cell cycle phase specific effects without synchronizing cells. Staining cells with Cyclin A allowed us to distinguish the S/G2 versus the G1 cells, and this is a standard procedure in the DNA damage response field. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A to D</xref> we utilized his system, and then we used the Fucci system (which has been better explained in revised manuscript) to yet again visually distinguish G1 and S/G2 cells for the functional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-I</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
