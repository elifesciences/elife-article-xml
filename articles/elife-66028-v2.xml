These unicellular parasites are transmitted by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. In the mammalian host’s circulation, proliferating slender stage cells differentiate into cell cycle-arrested stumpy stage cells when they reach high population densities. This stage transition is thought to fulfil two main functions: first, it auto-regulates the parasite load in the host; second, the stumpy stage is regarded as the only stage capable of successful vector transmission. Here, we show that proliferating slender stage trypanosomes express the mRNA and protein of a known stumpy stage marker, complete the complex life cycle in the fly as successfully as the stumpy stage, and require only a single parasite for productive infection. These findings suggest a reassessment of the traditional view of the trypanosome life cycle. They may also provide a solution to a long-lasting paradox, namely the successful transmission of parasites in chronic infections, despite low parasitemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>trypanosoma</kwd><kwd>sleeping sickness</kwd><kwd>tsetse fly</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd><kwd>life cycle</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ant I-473-416.13/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>396187369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morriswood</surname><given-names>Brooke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NUM Organostrat</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parasite life cycles may be more flexible than traditionally thought, potentially allowing single-cell infections of insect vectors and transmission between hosts even at very low parasite densities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Trypanosomes are among the most successful parasites. These flagellated protists infect all vertebrate classes, from fish to mammals, and can cause devastating diseases. African trypanosomes, which are transmitted by the tsetse fly, are the agents of nagana in livestock and sleeping sickness in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce, 1895</xref>). The most intensively s tudied African trypanosome subspecies is <italic>Trypanosoma brucei brucei,</italic> which in the past decades has emerged as a genetic and cell biological model parasite. The life cycle of <italic>T. brucei</italic> was initially elucidated more than a century ago. As part of their life cycle, the trypanosomes undergo a full developmental program in the tsetse fly in order to become infective to the mammalian host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch, 1909</xref>). This finding, made by Kleine in 1909, showed that transmission was not a purely mechanical event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleine, 1909</xref>). Kleine subsequently found that the life cycle in the fly could take up to several weeks to complete, a discovery that was shortly afterwards confirmed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruce et al., 1909</xref>. More details of the general life cycle of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> were then elucidated by Robertson in 1913, with several key observations concerning the transmission event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robertson and Bradford, 1913</xref>). Subsequent work has resulted in a detailed picture of the passage through the fly, beginning with the ingestion of trypanosomes in an infected bloodmeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013</xref>). After entering through the tsetse proboscis, the infected blood is either held for a short time in the crop, which acts as a storage site and allows the tsetse to drink more blood per meal, or is passed directly to the midgut. Upon entering the tsetse midgut, the trypanosomes differentiate into the proliferative procyclic stage. Once established in the midgut, the parasites must pass the peritrophic matrix, a protective sleeve that separates the bloodmeal from midgut tissue. To do this, the parasites are thought to swim up the endotrophic space to the proventriculus, the site of peritrophic matrix synthesis, where they are able to cross to the ectotrophic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). After having crossed the peritrophic matrix and entered the ectroperitrophic space, procyclic trypanosomes may either further colonise the ectotrophic anterior midgut, becoming the cell-cycle arrested mesocyclic stage, or continue directly to the proventriculus. In the proventriculus, trypanosomes further develop into the long, proliferative epimastigote stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2020</xref>). The epimastigotes then swim from the proventriculus to the salivary glands, while undergoing an asymmetric division to generate a long and a short daughter cell. Once in the salivary gland, the long daughter cell is thought to die while the small one attaches via its flagellum to the salivary gland epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vickerman, 1969</xref>). The attached epimastigotes are proliferative, producing either more attached epimastigote daughter cells or freely swimming, cell cycle-arrested metacyclic trypanosomes. As early as 1911, it was clear that the metacyclic stage (at that time called metatrypanosomes) is the only mammalian-infective stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce et al., 1911</xref>).</p><p>In the mammalian host, trypanosomes have been found in many different organs, including brain, skin, and fat, but are hard to study experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodwin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trindade et al., 2016</xref>). The two main stages found in the bloodstream, and the best-characterised experimentally, are the proliferating slender bloodstream stage and the cell cycle-arrested stumpy bloodstream stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krüger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matthews et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vickerman, 1985</xref>). The stumpy stage is formed in response to quorum sensing of the stumpy induction factor (SIF), a signal produced by slender bloodstream trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vassella et al., 1997</xref>). As the stumpy stage only survives for 2–3 days after formation, the generation of stumpy parasites is thought to control the burden the parasites impose on the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner et al., 1995</xref>). The SIF pathway that controls the slender-to-stumpy transition has been described down to the molecular level, with the <italic>protein associated with differentiation</italic> (PAD1) being the first recognised molecular marker for the stumpy stage trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mony and Matthews, 2015</xref>). More recently, it was also shown that the stumpy pathway can be triggered independently of SIF, although the extent to which this occurs in the general population remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). Besides its proposed role in controlling parasitaemia in the mammalian host, the stumpy stage has a second essential function in the trypanosome life cycle: it is believed to be the only life cycle stage that can infect the tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rico et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, arrest of the cell cycle and differentiation to the stumpy stage are presumed essential for developmental progression to the procyclic insect stage. As early as 1912, Robertson suggested that the short, stumpy bloodstream trypanosomes represent the fly-infective stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robertson, 1912</xref>). While this assumption was questioned several times throughout the 20th century, the discovery of quorum sensing and SIF in the 1990s made it become generally accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vassella et al., 1997</xref>). However, if stumpy trypanosomes are the only stage that can infect the fly, another problem arises. Although trypanosomes might be found at higher densities in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capewell et al., 2016</xref>), chronic trypanosome infections are characterised by low blood parasitemia, meaning that the chance of a tsetse fly ingesting any trypanosomes, let alone short-lived stumpy ones, is also very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frezil, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wombou Toukam et al., 2011</xref>). Mathematical models have been developed that aim to explain how the limited number of short-lived stumpy cells in the host blood and interstitial fluids can guarantee the infection of the tsetse fly, which is essential for the survival of the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capewell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacGregor and Matthews, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seed and Black, 1999</xref>). The present study provides surprising new solutions to this problem. First, systematic quantification of infection efficiencies showed that very few trypanosomes are necessary to infect a tsetse fly, and in fact just one is sufficient. Second, and wholly unexpectedly, slender stages proved at least as competent at infecting flies as stumpy stages. These findings suggest greater plasticity in the life cycle than supposed, prompting a reassessment of the current rigid view of the process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single trypanosome is sufficient for infection of a tsetse fly</title><p>Slender and stumpy bloodstream stage trypanosomes can be distinguished based on cell cycle, morphological, and metabolic criteria. The genome of the single mitochondrion (kinetoplast, K) and the cell nucleus (N) can be readily visualised using DNA stains, and their prescribed sequence of replication (1K1N, 2K1N, 2K2N) allows cell cycle stage to be inferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherwin and Gull, 1989</xref>). Slender cells are found in all three K/N ratios, while stumpy cells, which are cell cycle-arrested, are found only as 1K1N cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Expression of the <italic><underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>a</underline>ssociated with <underline>d</underline>ifferentiation 1</italic> (PAD1) is accepted as a marker for development to the stumpy stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dean et al., 2009</xref>). As the 3’UTR of the PAD1 gene regulates the expression of <italic>pad1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacGregor and Matthews, 2012</xref>), cells expressing an NLS-GFP reporter fused to the 3' UTR of the PAD1 gene (GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup>) will have GFP-positive nuclei when the PAD1 gene is active. Hence, slender cells are GFP-negative; stumpy cells are GFP-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The validity of the GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup> reporter as an indicator for the activation of the PAD1 pathway has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>), and was further corroborated by co-staining with an antibody against the PAD1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have previously shown that stumpy cells can be formed independently of high cell population density by ectopic expression of a second variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) isoform, a process that mimics one of the pathways involved in trypanosome antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cross, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). These so-called expression site (ES)-attenuated stumpy cells can complete the developmental cycle in the tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). It remained an open question whether this occurred with the same efficiency as with SIF-produced stumpy cells. Therefore, we quantitatively compared the transmission competence of stumpy populations generated by either SIF treatment or through ES-attenuation. Tsetse flies (<italic>Glossina morsitans morsitans</italic>) were infected via membrane feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>) with defined numbers of pleomorphic stumpy trypanosomes, capable of completing the entire developmental cycle. This cycle includes entrance through the proboscis, passage through the crop, then establishing infections in the midgut, proventriculus, and finally the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Two transgenic trypanosome cell lines, both of which contained the GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup> reporter construct, were used. One was subjected to tetracycline-induced, ectopic VSG expression to drive ES attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lines i-iii, Stumpy<sup>ES</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). The other was treated with stumpy induction factor (SIF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows iv-vi, Stumpy<sup>SIF</sup>). Both treatments resulted in expression of the GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup> reporter and rapid differentiation to the stumpy stage. The resulting stumpy populations were fed to tsetse flies at concentrations ranging from 120,000 to 10 cells/ml. A feeding tsetse typically ingests about 20 µl of blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibson and Bailey, 2003</xref>), meaning that, on average, between 2400 and 0.2 trypanosomes were ingested per bloodmeal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows i-vi, column 2, Total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The trypanosomes had previously been scored for expression of the GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup> reporter to confirm their identity as the stumpy stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, columns 3–4). To analyse the infections, we carried out microscopic analyses of explanted tsetse digestive tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The dissection of the flies was done 5–6 weeks post-infection. The presence of mammal-infective, metacyclic trypanosomes in explanted tsetse salivary glands indicated the completion of the life cycle inside the tsetse. Remarkably, the uptake, on average, of just two stumpy parasites of either cell line produced robust infections of tsetse midgut (MG), proventriculus (PV), and salivary glands (SG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, columns 5–7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Ingestion, on average, of even a single stumpy cell was sufficient to produce salivary gland infections in almost 5% of all tsetse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, row v). When the stumpy parasite number was further reduced to 0.2 cells on average per bloodmeal, meaning only every 5th fly would receive a stumpy cell, 0.9% of flies still acquired salivary gland infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, row vi). As a measure of the incidence of life cycle completion in the tsetse fly, we calculated the transmission index (TI) for each condition. The TI has been previously defined as the ratio of salivary gland to midgut infections and hence, it is a measure for successful passage through the second part of the trypanosome tsetse cycle, where trypanosomes are again infective to a mammalian host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref>, 3-5)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peacock et al., 2012</xref>). We found that for flies infected with two trypanosomes on average, the TI was comparable between SIF-induced (TI = 0.29) and ES-induced (TI = 0.31) stumpy trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows iii-iv; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A similar TI of 0.23 was observed in flies ingesting on average one trypanosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, row v; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, our data not only clearly show that SIF- and ES-induced stumpy parasites are equally efficient in completing the weeks-long, multi-step fly cycle, but also that a single stumpy cell is sufficient to produce a mature fly infection (individual replicates can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). While this may seem comparable with an observation that has been made before for <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maudlin and Welburn, 1989</xref>), the migration through the fly differs between the two species: <italic>T. brucei</italic> infects the salivary glands, while <italic>T. congolense</italic> infects the proboscis. The tsetse fly, however, is much more susceptible to infections with <italic>T. congolense</italic> than with <italic>T. brucei</italic>, with a nearly 5-fold increase in percent <italic>T. congolense</italic> proboscis infections as compared to <italic>T. brucei</italic> salivary gland infections. As the authors of this work used chemicals (<italic>L</italic>- glutathione and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine) to boost <italic>T. brucei</italic> infection rates, the fivefold difference is actually a lower estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peacock et al., 2012</xref>). Our results demonstrate that very low numbers of <italic>T. brucei</italic> stumpy cells can also successfully establish mature tsetse fly infections.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Slender trypanosomes can complete the entire life cycle in the tsetse fly vector.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell cycle (G1/S/post-mitotic), morphology, and differentiation of bloodstream form (mammalian-infective stage) trypanosomes.

Unexpectedly, we found that slender parasites were not only viable in the midgut, but also infected the proventriculus and the salivary glands. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows vii-xi; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Even one slender parasite was on average sufficient to establish midgut infections, proving that slender and stumpy parasites are, in principle, equally viable in the tsetse midgut. The infection efficiency, measured using TI, was similar when the flies were fed with either 20 stumpy trypanosomes or 20 pleomorphic slender trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare TI in column eight for rows ii and vii). When flies were fed with an average of two slender parasites each, the TI was actually higher for slender cells (0.60) than for stumpy cells (0.31) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This TI of 0.60 was identical for both populations of slender cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Next, when given, on average, just one PAD1-negative slender cell per bloodmeal, parasite infections were still established in the midgut, proventriculus, and salivary glands with incidences of 4.7%, 4.1%, and 2.0% respectively, at a TI of 0.44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, row x; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In order to be absolutely sure that slender trypanosomes can passage through the tsetse, we repeated the experiment with naïve slender parasites that had been freshly differentiated from insect-derived metacyclic trypanosomes, that is cells that had just restarted the mammalian life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, row xii). Infections with, on average, two freshly-differentiated slender trypanosomes per bloodmeal revealed 6.3% midgut and 2.7% salivary gland infections. The transmission index was 0.43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. row xiii). This important control formally ruled out that cultivated slender cells had undergone any kind of gain-of-function adaptation in culture that made them transmission-competent.</p><p>As another control for the slender infection experiments, tsetse infections were carried out using a monomorphic slender trypanosome strain, that is one that had lost the capacity of differentiating to the stumpy stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows xiii - xv). Monomorphic trypanosomes are able to infect the tsetse midgut, but they are incapable of establishing robust infections and completing the developmental cycle in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peacock et al., 2008</xref>). As expected, no salivary gland infections were seen using these cells, even at high infection numbers. Interestingly, we found that even two monomorphic slender parasites could establish a fly midgut infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, row xv). Thus, infection of the tsetse midgut is independent of the capacity for developmental progression and the infective dose, and it does not require the stumpy life cycle stage. This finding also challenges the assumption that slender parasites are selectively eliminated from the parasite population and that only stumpy trypanosomes can survive the harsh conditions thought to prevail within the tsetse crop and midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nolan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The ES-attenuated cells showed similar midgut, proventriculus, and salivary gland infection incidence as either the stumpy or slender stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows ii-iii and vii-viii, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The SIF-induced stumpy cells, however, appeared more effective in establishing midgut infections than their slender counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, rows iv-vi and ix-xi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result could be interpreted as stumpy trypanosomes being more successful in the tsetse fly, but this is a conclusion that is clearly not supported by our data. First, the infections with one to two slender cells produced higher TI values than those with the same numbers of stumpy cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the proliferative slender cells are actually more capable of progressing from a midgut infection to a salivary gland one, and thus have at least comparable overall developmental competence to the stumpy stage. Second, the lack of correlation between infective dose and midgut infections underlines the importance of the TI as a relative measure. What is biologically relevant is not the initiation of infection but the completion of the tsetse passage. In summary, our experiments not only establish that a single <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell (either slender or stumpy) can infect the tsetse fly, but also indicate that infections established by slender cells can still result in efficient completion of the passage through the tsetse fly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>In the tsetse midgut, dividing slender bloodstream stage parasites activate the PAD1 pathway and differentiate to the procyclic insect stage without arresting the cell cycle</title><p>To determine how pleomorphic slender trypanosomes manage to establish infections, we observed the early events following trypanosome ingestion by tsetse flies (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). The canonical version of events is that ingested stumpy (i.e. PAD1-positive) cells reactivate the cell cycle, begin to express the EP procyclin protein on their cell surface, and differentiate to the procyclic life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dean et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matthews and Gull, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mowatt and Clayton, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roditi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziegelbauer and Overath, 1990</xref>). We infected tsetse flies with pleomorphic trypanosomes which not only contained the stumpy-specific GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup> marker, but also encoded an EP1:YFP fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engstler and Boshart, 2004</xref>). In this way, the onset of stumpy development was observable as GFP fluorescence in the nucleus, and further differentiation to the procyclic life cycle stage as YFP fluorescence on the parasite cell surface. In addition, the cell cycle status (K/N counts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), morphology, and the characteristic motile behavior of the trypanosomes were also assessed as criteria of developmental progress. In total, 114 tsetse flies (57 male and 57 female) were dissected after at least six independent infections with either 12,000 slender or stumpy parasites each. These high initial parasite numbers allowed the microscopic analysis of individual living slender (n = 1845) and stumpy trypanosomes (n = 1237) within the complex microenvironment of midgut explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schuster et al., 2017</xref>). As early as 2 hr post-infection with slender trypanosomes, a few (0.8%) 2K1N dividing trypanosomes with a nuclear PAD1 signal could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, blue). After 8 hr however, half (38.3+6.8+5.3=50.4%) of all trypanosomes in the explants were PAD1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows summed cell cycle category values for PAD1-positive cells). After 24 hr, 84.3% (56.3+15.0+13.0) of the parasites expressed PAD1. Of these, 9.8% had already initiated developmental progression to the procyclic insect stage, as evidenced by EP1:YFP fluorescence on their cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, blue). At 48 hr post-infection with slender trypanosomes, virtually the entire trypanosome population (91.8%) expressed PAD1, and almost one fifth (19.1%) of cells were EP1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). To examine cell cycle progression, we counted the number of 1K1N, 2K1N, and 2K2N cells in the PAD1-positive and PAD1-negative slender cell populations. Remarkably, 15 hr post-infection, the majority of all replicating (i.e. 2K1N + 2K2N) cells were PAD1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). No indication of a transient cell cycle arrest or intermittent impairment of cell cycle progression was observed. Over the duration of the experiment, PAD1-negative cells gradually decreased in numbers, while PAD1-positive slender cells were increasingly observed at all cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> blue vs. grey; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1C</xref>). After 2 days, more than 90% of dividing trypanosomes were PAD1-positive.

These cells remained as 1K1N cells in cell cycle arrest for the first day, then differentiated to procyclic cells and re-entered the cell cycle after 2 days. Four hours after uptake by the tsetse fly, stumpy trypanosomes started expressing EP1:YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, red). The fluorescent reporter was visible on 16.2% of stumpy cells after 10 hr, showing that EP expression was initiated before release of cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, red).

Thus, the onset of EP1 expression was shifted, but the kinetics of differentiation were comparable in slender and stumpy parasites, and activation of the PAD1 pathway also preceded developmental progression in slender cells. This strongly suggests that expression of PAD1 is essential for differentiation to the procyclic stage, while cell cycle arrest is not.</p><p>Of note, EP1 expression did not directly correlate with acquisition of procyclic morphology. At 24 hr, 9.8% of slender cells were EP1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but the EP1-negative cells frequently exhibited procyclic morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, upper panels). GPEET is another procyclic surface protein that is expressed early in the transition from bloodstream stage to procyclic stage cells in the tsetse midgut, before being replaced by EP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vassella et al., 2000</xref>). Whether these early and morphologically procyclic cells expressed GPEET was not checked, and remains a target of future work.

After 1 day, EP1 was present on almost all (96.7%) stumpy trypanosomes. The cell cycle analysis revealed that these parasites were not dividing, however (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The first cells re-entered the cell cycle only after 15 hr, and a normal procyclic cell cycle profile was not reached until day 3. Morphological analysis using the distance between the nucleus and the posterior of the cell confirmed acquisition of procyclic identity within 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the in vitro differentiation supported the in vivo observations, demonstrating that pleomorphic slender trypanosomes are able to directly differentiate to the procyclic stage without becoming cell cycle-arrested stumpy cells. The surface expression of EP1 is also of note: it has been shown that in slender bloodstream parasites, ectopically expressed EP1 does not enter the cell surface, but is retained in endosomes and the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engstler and Boshart, 2004</xref>). Hence, as in stumpy trypanosomes, lifting of the cell surface access block for EP1 in the slender trypanosome correlates with activation of the PAD1 pathway. To summarise, the overall developmental capacity of the two life cycle stages - slender and stumpy cells - is comparable both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our observations suggest a revised view of the life cycle of African trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We have shown that one trypanosome suffices to produce robust infections of the tsetse vector, and that the stumpy stage is not essential for tsetse transmission. Slender parasites can complete the complex life cycle in the fly with comparable overall success rates and kinetics as the stumpy stage. Interestingly, the stumpy stage appears more able to establish initial infections in the fly midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 5, MG), while slender-derived parasites appear to produce salivary gland infections slightly more efficiently (higher amount of salivary gland infections compared to midgut infections, TI) than stumpy-derived counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, column 8, TI). At first sight, this discrepancy may be related to a greater resistance of the stumpy stage to the digestive environment in the fly’s gut, as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matetovici et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nolan et al., 2000</xref>). This, however, is not supported by our data. We have not observed cell death of monomorphic or pleomorphic slender cells in infected tsetse midguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). And even if so, why then should slender-derived cells perform better in the second part of the life cycle? As there will not be a difference between slender- and stumpy-derived procyclic cells, the difference observed must be based on the behaviour of bloodstream parasites in the midgut. It is tempting to speculate that one decisive factor could be trypanosome motility. Slender trypanosomes exhibit significantly higher motility compared to stumpy trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargul et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the mean square displacement in the midgut will be much larger for slender parasites. While stumpy trypanosomes probably never reach the ‘midgut exit’ before differentiation to the insect stage, slender trypanosomes could already be located close to the proventriculus before starting to differentiate to the procyclic stage. Thus, passage through the proventriculus could occur immediately, and the slender-derived trypanosomes could rapidly progress to the mesocyclic stage. This faster mesocyclic progression would result in a less-pronounced infection of the midgut, and a higher TI-value for the slender-derived trypanosomes. While the above hypothesis is consistent with our data, experimental proof would be extremely challenging to obtain. The recent demonstration that glucose levels are a developmental trigger in addition to the well-characterised ones of cold shock and <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate adds another layer of complexity to the early events during tsetse infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>). It is also of note that a recent review has suggested that stumpy trypanosomes may have evolved as a stress response, with procyclic pathways already activated in order to increase chances of survival in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quintana et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A revised life cycle for the parasite <italic>Trypanosoma bruce</italic>i.</title><p>Cell-cycle-arrested (G<sub>0</sub>) metacyclic trypanosomes are injected by the tsetse fly into the mammalian host’s skin. There, the parasites re-enter the cell cycle, and proliferate as (<inline-graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66028-inf1-v2.tif"/>) slender forms in the blood, while disseminating into the interstitium and various tissues, including fat and brain. At least two triggers (SIF or ES) launch the PAD1-dependent differentiation pathway (light green boxes) to the cell cycle-arrested (<inline-graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66028-inf2-v2.tif"/>) stumpy bloodstream stage. Stumpy trypanosomes can establish a fly infection when taken up with the bloodmeal of a tsetse. The work described here reveals that proliferating slender stage trypanosomes are equally effective for tsetse transmission, that a single parasite suffices, and that the population can continuously divide while differentiating to the procyclic insect stage. The triggers that initiate further developmental transitions are temperature (°C), <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate (CA) and glucose deprivation (<bold>↓</bold>Glc).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66028-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The dogma that cell cycle-arrested stumpy cells are the only trypanosomes that infect the tsetse fly has never been experimentally challenged, although there are quite a number of reports that point against an exclusive role for stumpy parasites in the life cycle. Koch’s detailed report on the activities of the German sleeping sickness commission sent to East Africa in 1906/7 states that the trypanosome numbers in the blood of human sleeping sickness infections was always very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch, 1909</xref>). From his data, we have calculated an average blood parasitaemia between 10 and 100 trypanosomes cells/ml (see Appendix 1). This means that two or fewer trypanosomes would be present in an average tsetse bloodmeal, again highlighting the rarity of a tsetse taking up a stumpy cell. In 1930, Duke discussed the evidence for the essential status of the stumpy stage for tsetse transmission, and his data did not support it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duke, 1930</xref>). Further, Baker and Robertson in 1957 compared the infection capability of <italic>T. rhodesiense</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> using guinea pig feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Robertson, 1957</xref>). They concluded: 'Neither the morphology nor the intensity of the parasitaemia in the infecting mammal was obviously related to the subsequent infection rates in the tsetse-flies'. In 1990, Bass and Wang suggested that in fact the stumpy stage may be dispensable for development to the insect stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass and Wang, 1991</xref>). The experiments, however, were in part inconclusive, mainly because a molecular marker for the stumpy stage was missing. The discovery of SIF in the 1990s and the realisation that quorum sensing underpinned the differentiation to the stumpy stage led to an assumption that the slender stage had no role to play in the transmission event. Subsequent research has been focused on the details of stumpy formation, while the developmental role of the stumpy cell has not undergone further examination. The above publications all relate to what is nowadays referred to as the transmission paradox, the persistence and circulation of trypanosomiasis in a population even when parasitaemia levels in individuals are low or close to elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capewell et al., 2019</xref>). When parasitaemia is low, stumpy trypanosomes are characteristically absent, making the probability of being ingested by a tsetse fly (which on average ingests 20 µl of blood) extremely low. Yet trypanosomiasis persists, even when statistically it should be eliminated. Solutions to the paradox have long been hypothesised and variously include flawed diagnostic testing, asymptomatic cases, and animal reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvar et al., 2020</xref>). Recent work using theoretical modelling suggests that for <italic>T. gambiense</italic>, trypanosomes residing in the skin of humans could solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capewell et al., 2019</xref>). However, there are currently no data available on the number of trypanosomes located in asymptomatic human skin, nor have the kinetics of fly uptake of skin-localised trypanosomes been explored. Also, different tsetse-transmitted trypanosome species reveal rather distinct distributions in the host, such as <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic> preferentially residing in small blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banks, 1978</xref>). Thus, while trypanosomes in the skin may be important for the persistence of the parasites, their existence alone does not automatically solve the transmission paradox. As tsetse are blood pool feeders, it actually does not matter if the trypanosomes reside in the skin, fat tissue, or blood.</p><p>Furthermore, stumpy cells will inevitably run into an age-related problem. They are not replicative, and their lifetime is limited to roughly 3 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Turner et al., 1995</xref>). In the fly, re-entry into the cell cycle is by no means immediate, but takes at least one day. Following induction of cell cycle arrest, the stumpy cells would need to be taken up by the fly within 1 day. Thus, only a subset of rather young stumpy cells would prove successful in the midgut. It is important to note that this is not the case in our experiments, as only freshly differentiated stumpy cells were used for tsetse infection. Thus, our experiments in fact overestimate the success rate of stumpy stage trypanosomes.</p><p>It should be stressed that our data provide a possible solution to the transmission paradox without challenging any of the extensive published work on stumpy trypanosomes. We have shown that slender and stumpy trypanosomes are equally competent for fly passage. The PAD1 pathway has an essential role in preparing both bloodstream stages for differentiation to the procyclic cell stage. For successful passage through the tsetse fly, however, the stumpy stage is not uniquely required. Along similar lines, it is worth noting that <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>, the principal causative agent of the cattle plague nagana, infects tsetse flies without manifesting a cell cycle-arrested stumpy stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013</xref>). Thus, the essential biological function of the stumpy life cycle stage in <italic>T. brucei</italic> may not be transmission, but rather quorum sensing (SIF)-dependent control of population size in the host. This pathway can be triggered in other ways, and even at low levels of parasitaemia, for example by VSG expression site attenuation (ES)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). The capacity for inducing cell cycle arrest at the single cell level might actually have been important for the evolution of antigenic variation. As not all trypanosome species develop a stumpy life cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013</xref>), density-dependent differentiation at the population level may well be a later innovation in evolution, and specific to the <italic>T. brucei</italic> group. In conclusion, our work evidences a high degree of plasticity in the life cycle of an important parasite.

It is known that teneral flies (flies that are newly hatched and unfed) are more susceptible to midgut infections compared to older flies, and it is an accepted practice in the field to use teneral flies for infections. While all of our infections were done during the flies’ first bloodmeal, it is of note that 1–3 days is rather old for teneral flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walshe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wijers, 1958</xref>).

For infections with low parasite numbers (0.2 and 1 cell/bloodmeal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the cell density of either stumpy or slender trypanosomes was calculated, and the dilutions made directly in blood.

Meanwhile, in the Tsetse fly vector midgut, they divide as &quot;procyclic forms&quot;, which rely heavily on mitochondrial metabolism. While in the blood, the parasites differentiate – probably via quorum sensing – to a non-dividing &quot;stumpy form&quot; which has gene expression changes that pre-adapt the parasites to life in the fly. Textbook knowledge is that only the stumpy form can differentiate to the procyclic form. This paper overturns this dogma. The authors show that long slender forms can also differentiate – somewhat more slowly – directly into procyclic forms in the fly, by-passing several known aspects of stumpy formation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Unexpected plasticity in the life cycle of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Christine Clayton as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James Morris (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Your paper has been reviewed by the reviewing editor and 3 other reviewers, of whom one was less enthusiastic than the other two. Overall it was agreed that:</p><p>1. More statistical analysis is essential, everywhere. At present there is very little indeed. This could partly be achieved by presenting the data as box plots (or &quot;beeswarm&quot; plots) using data from individual flies. From Table 1, it is important to display not just the transmission index (as in Figure 2), but also the individual values for Tsetse fly infection (MG, PV, SG) with the 2-parasite inoculum (lines iii, vi, viii, xi and xii). These are quite complicated to compare from the Table and there are clear differences. Similarly for the bar graphs, it is essential overlay with the values obtained in the individual replicates as dots (not SD!). Readers must be able to assess the variability in ALL of the measurements. One referee also suggested replacing the Table in Figure 4 with more plots – the proportions of different N-K conformations could be shown within the PAD columns, or separately as much narrower columns. The actual numbers could then go into the Supplement.</p><p>2. The GFP-positive cells should be described as GFP-positive – not PAD1-positive. The caveats for this assay should be mentioned.</p><p>3. Some quantitative analysis of cell morphology (e.g. K-N distances) beyond the GFP should be done – this can almost certainly be done using existing images.</p><p>4. One new experiment is needed – assessing GFP-PAD expression in the inoculum after the filtration steps to get rid of the methyl cellulose. (Or is this already what was done?)</p><p>5. Can the metacyclics be tested for VSG expression? As an alternative I guess you could use morphology and state that strictly speaking, metacyclic identity has not been confirmed. The rabbit VSG117 antibody that my lab has seems to be fairly non-specific but maybe you have anti Antat1.1? Another option would be to stain for PGK. (Though I actually don't know where PGK is in epimastigotes.) This would be nice but is probably not essential.</p><p>Further suggestions for improvement are in the individual reviews.</p><p>I would also add that there is a really nice new review about stumpies which is highly relevant and warrants citation: Trends Parasitol. 2020 Dec 11:S1471-4922(20)30316-0. doi: 10.1016/j.pt.2020.11.003.</p><p>I also seem to remember that Muriel Roberts originally thought that it was the slender forms that were transmissible, but I may be wrong.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I agree with the authors that the data in this paper indicate that slender forms can productively infect Tsetse. Although their initial differentiation is delayed, they ultimately are as successful as stumpy forms. One could add that although stumpy morphology is not an essential intermediate, stumpy-like gene expression may well be: essentially, conditions in the fly are sufficient to induce the developmental programme. I don't think the data support the conclusion that no cell-cycle arrest is required – although such an arrest does have to be quite brief.</p><p>I have one major criticism, and that is the authors' equation of GFP-positive with &quot;PAD1 positive&quot;. Yes, this means that the GFP-PAD1 mRNA has been present. But the GFP could easily persist after the mRNA has gone, and of course the presence of GFP can't be equated with the presence of PAD1 protein. This limitation has to be stated right at the start and the description re-worded throughout. Has to be something like &quot;GFP-PAD reporter positive&quot;, or maybe even just &quot;GFP-positive&quot;.</p><p>Line 80 – The possibility that densities are higher in the skin should be mentioned briefly (I know it's in the Discussion as well.)</p><p>Line 99 – for non-experts, the authors should mention that developmental regulation of PAD1 is controlled by the 3'-UTR.</p><p>Line 132 and Table 1: the authors should, in the supplement, provide a simple plot showing the probability distribution for numbers of parasites in 20µl at the different parasite densities. The Legend (as well as the text) should briefly define transmission index and the number of flies per group should be stated. Also, say what the different groups are: what are slender ES and slender SIF? How long was ES induced and what exactly are the &quot;SIF&quot; stumpies? (I know it's in the Methods section but the density of the cultures should be given.) Statistical analysis is needed. Are any of the differences really significant?</p><p>Video 2A – expand the legends, these were initially difficult to follow. (Just say that they switch from DIC to fluorescence, and which comes first.)</p><p>Line 162 – this is a bit misleading. The authors should define what they mean by &quot;infection efficiency&quot;? Indeed the transmission indices for slender and stumpy are similar, but the number of infections per input slender trypanosome is half of that obtained with stumpy. The should state up front (rather than much later) that the slender parasites have more trouble establishing infection in the midgut.</p><p>Line 199-120 – a bit over-stated. If there is no midgut infection then there will definitely be no tryps in the salivary glands.</p><p>Figure 5 and Figure 7 – titles are not appropriate since cell cycle arrest was not measured. How about &quot;Slender trypanosomes show delayed EP procyclin expression after Tsetse infection / in vitro differentiation&quot;? Please explain why 2h time-ranges are given rather than single times.</p><p>I do not think it is possible to conclude that absolutely no cell-cycle arrest is required. From Figure 6, can a 1-2 h arrest while PAD1 is turned on and the rest of the programme is initiated be excluded? I don't think so – the temporal definition and numbers simply don't allow it. Is the sudden drop in positive 2K1N cells from the slender cells at 15-17h significant?</p><p>Line 254 – Did the authors stain for GPEET or phosphorylated GPEET, which are often expressed first after differentiation? IF not they should surely mention that the procyclic-morphology cells are most likely expressing GPEET.</p><p>Line 292 – clearly not true since the procyclin expression of slender forms was delayed. Also no other markers of procyclics were measured. (From their existing images can authors also include the N-K and N-posterior tip distances of 1K1N cells, which gives procyclic morphology independently of procyclin expression?) For Figures 6 and 7, please also plot the absolute cell densities in addition to showing the percentages.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>&quot;We have not observed cell death of monomorphic or pleomorphic slender cells in infected tsetse midguts.&quot; But how would you detect it?</p><p>The authors emphasise that the slender-derived parasites are &quot;more successful in the second part of the life cycle.&quot; Are the differences in Table 1, which are reiterated in lines 300-302, really statistically significant?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The data as presented in the tables is challenging to follow. In table 1, I recommend moving data on short stumpy and slender form related to expression site attenuation to supplemental data. In Tables 2 and 6, the information in the bars of the bar graphs (the different dotted lines, for example) should be developed into stand-alone parts of the figure, as they are difficult to interpret. In the text of the results, it would be helpful to be consistent with directing the reader to the correct column (for example, Line 192, &quot;column 5).</p><p>2. It is unclear what tissues were analyzed in Figure 4 – some clarification about what an &quot;explant&quot; is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very important finding that challenges the current dogma. As any paper that challenges the dogma, this paper raises many questions that will be tackled in future studies, namely reproducing these results with parasites recently isolated from the wild, instead of tissue culture adapted lines. Another important avenue will be to test the different mutant parasites that are incapable of differentiating from slender to stumpy forms and dissect the molecular machinery that composes the slender-differentiation.</p><p>I describe below two points that, in my opinion, could help strengthen the paper:</p><p>1. I am concerned about the parasite purification protocol prior to Tsetse infection (which involves change of buffers, filtration to remove the methylcellulose matrix and centrifugation). Could the protocol stress the slender forms such that these non-cell-cycle-arrested-stressed slenders gain the capacity to infect Tsetses? Previous reports have shown that reduced cellular energy promotes parasite differentiation (Barquilla 2012; Saldivia, 2016). Could the authors avoid or minimize the purification steps? Some <italic>T. brucei</italic> pleomorphic strains grow in vitro without methylcellulose, which would simplify parasite harvesting. Could the parasites be simply diluted in blood prior to infection of flies (without any purification)? When was the IFA done to confirm expression of GFP::PAD1? Ideally, it should have been at the end of purification protocol, just prior to Tsetse feeding. If it is technically impossible to improve/avoid parasite purification protocol, could the authors provide some evidence that after purification parasites are not stressed? Would purified parasites grow exponentially in culture without a lag phase? What are the levels of phosphorylated AMPKa1? This type of experiments would help ruling out that parasites were stressed by a reduced cellular energy during purification protocol.</p><p>2. The authors showed that the kinetics of differentiation of slender and stumpy forms to procyclic forms is different both in vitro and in vivo, although both lead to the formation of bonafide procyclic forms. The authors could consider doing a competition experiment between slenders and stumpy forms to test their individual fitness in group.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Unexpected plasticity in the life cycle of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer 4 asks for you to clarify one sentence and I agree. I too think that the phrase &quot;without harvesting the cells&quot; is really difficult to understand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My only real comment is that the videos seem a little out of place. M1 of the fly feeding has little obvious value in the present context, and I found he quality of M2 disappointing. M2 could be improved and if this were done it would then be a genuine addition to the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my concerns through revision. I applaud their efforts to improve the visualization of the data while maintaining transparency, as there is a tremendous amount to interpret.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have convincingly responded to my question about a putative &quot;stress&quot; effect on harvested parasites. Controls at multiple levels have been used. Thank you.</p><p>While their answer is very clear in the rebuttal, these arguments are not clearly described in the manuscript (or did I miss them?). For example, the description of one of the controls: &quot;cells were directly taken from culture and added to blood, thereby completely omitting any filtration step.&quot;, in the rebuttal, is described in the paper (line 483) as &quot;the dilutions made directly in blood without harvesting the cells&quot;. I suggest the authors include in the paper the exact words used in the rebuttal to answer my question.</p><p>The authors state that my second point (competition) is beyond the scope of this paper.

Overall it was agreed that:</p><p>1. More statistical analysis is essential, everywhere. At present there is very little indeed. This could partly be achieved by presenting the data as box plots (or &quot;beeswarm&quot; plots) using data from individual flies. From Table 1, it is important to display not just the transmission index (as in Figure 2), but also the individual values for Tsetse fly infection (MG, PV, SG) with the 2-parasite inoculum (lines iii, vi, viii, xi and xii). These are quite complicated to compare from the Table and there are clear differences.</p></disp-quote><p>For the revised version, we teamed up with an expert mathematician (Tobias Müller) who performed state-of-the-art modelling and statistical analysis of our data. For the figures with bar graphs (Figure 4-7), statistical analysis was run using a <italic>point estimate mod</italic>el based on time vs. cell type (stumpy and slender).</p><p>For Figure 2A, we now additionally provide a beeswarm plot with results from all individual fly infections (2B), as well as the total number of infections which go with this figure (Figure 2 – table supplement 1).</p><p>A plot showing the transmission index for each N, as well as a table with total infection numbers (rather than percent) and number of infections per N, was added to the supplements (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and – table supplement 1).</p><p>All statistical validation supported the interpretation of the data. We hope that these steps have sufficiently addressed the reviewer's concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly for the bar graphs, it is essential overlay with the values obtained in the individual replicates as dots (not SD!). Readers must be able to assess the variability in ALL of the measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>The tables of cell cycle profiles for PAD1-positive and -negative cells were moved into the supplements (Figure 5 – Supplemental Table 1 and Figure 7 – Supplemental Table 1) and replaced with graphs depicting the PAD1-positive and -negative dividing populations (Figure 5 B, C; Figure 7 B, C). They are shown as mean with standard deviation. A table showing the conversion from trypanosomes/bloodmeal to trypanosomes/ml was added as requested as Figure 2 – table supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One referee also suggested replacing the Table in Figure 4 with more plots – the proportions of different N-K conformations could be shown within the PAD columns, or separately as much narrower columns. The actual numbers could then go into the Supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>Nucleus (N) – posterior pole measurements have now been conducted for all timepoints and added to the supplements. While N-kinetoplast (K) was an option, we decided for N-posterior pole so that a difference can also be seen between slender and stumpy at the zero hour timepoint (which cannot really be differentiated with N-K). Data were visualised using violin plots, with the line at the median and dotted lines at the quartiles while tables added below show some descriptive measures from the data (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The GFP-positive cells should be described as GFP-positive – not PAD1-positive. The caveats for this assay should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The caveats are stated in line 97-105:</p><p>“Expression of the protein associated with differentiation 1 (PAD1) is accepted as a marker for development to the stumpy stage (Dean et al., 2009). […] The validity of the GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup> reporter as an indicator for the activation of the PAD1 pathway has been reported previously (Batram et al., 2014; Zimmermann et al., 2017), and further corroborated by co-staining with an antibody against the PAD1 protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>We also mention this several times in the manuscript but for the sake of clarity and readability we have decided not to include the description each time the reporter has been used. We hope this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Some quantitative analysis of cell morphology (e.g. K-N distances) beyond the GFP should be done – this can almost certainly be done using existing images.</p></disp-quote><p>As there is no true discernable difference between stumpy and slender cell K-N distances, we chose instead to measure the distance between the nucleus and posterior pole of both slender and stumpy trypanosomes during differentiation to the procyclic insect stage – this distance is more discernable between slender, stumpy, and procyclic, especially for stumpy and slender. A violin plot showing all measurements, with lines at the median and dotted lines at the quartiles, was added to the supplements (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Included is a table with some descriptive information about the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. One new experiment is needed – assessing GFP-PAD expression in the inoculum after the filtration steps to get rid of the methyl cellulose. (Or is this already what was done?)</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered the possibility that the cells might be “stressed” even by a single, brief filtration step, and made sure that this did not result in increased GFP-PAD1 expression.</p><p>Almost all experiments were done using the same harvesting protocol. In Figure 2A, however, for 0.2, 1, and 2 cells/bloodmeal, cells were <italic>directly</italic> taken from culture and added to blood, thereby completely omitting any filtration step. This was not necessary since such a small number of cells were needed. These very low trypanosome numbers per bloodmeal still resulted in infections. Furthermore, all images taken at the start of the experiment (zero hour timepoint) were taken <italic>after</italic> the harvest. The cells did not express GFP-PAD1. As a further control, we regularly put harvested cells back in culture where they instantaneously resumed normal growth and did not show GFP-PAD1 expression. In conclusion, the experiments have been carefully controlled on multiple levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the metacyclics be tested for VSG expression? As an alternative I guess you could use morphology and state that strictly speaking, metacyclic identity has not been confirmed. The rabbit VSG117 antibody that my lab has seems to be fairly non-specific but maybe you have anti Antat1.1? Another option would be to stain for PGK. (Though I actually don't know where PGK is in epimastigotes.) This would be nice but is probably not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>In the course of another project, we have used the same tsetse colony and identical experimental procedures to allow infection of artificial skin equivalents with tsetse-borne metacyclic parasites. The respective manuscript is currently under review and is available on bioRxiv (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443986">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443986</ext-link>). In this work, we provide extensive time-resolved single cell RNA-seq analyses, including that of metacyclic and naïve slender parasites. While the metacyclic cells express metacyclic VSGs, the re-activated slender parasites express Antat1.1 VSG in a subset of cells, as expected. Furthermore, the vast majority of cells found freely swimming in the salivary glands after fly infection are metacyclic forms. There are a few epimastigote trypanosomes detectable, which is not so surprising given that they arrive at the salivary glands as freely swimming trypanosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further suggestions for improvement are in the individual reviews.</p><p>I would also add that there is a really nice new review about stumpies which is highly relevant and warrants citation: Trends Parasitol. 2020 Dec 11:S1471-4922(20)30316-0. doi: 10.1016/j.pt.2020.11.003.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this reference (which was published after our initial submission – the only reason for its initial omission). Lines 338-340 now read:</p><p>“It is also of note that a recent review has suggested that stumpy trypanosomes may have evolved as a stress response, with procyclic pathways already activated in order to increase chances of survival in the fly (Quintana et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I agree with the authors that the data in this paper indicate that slender forms can productively infect Tsetse. Although their initial differentiation is delayed, they ultimately are as successful as stumpy forms. One could add that although stumpy morphology is not an essential intermediate, stumpy-like gene expression may well be: essentially, conditions in the fly are sufficient to induce the developmental programme. I don't think the data support the conclusion that no cell-cycle arrest is required – although such an arrest does have to be quite brief.</p></disp-quote><p>Stumpy trypanosomes are arrested in G<sub>0</sub>, and no replicative cell cycle is detectable until either cell death, which occurs after 3 days (our own measurements), or development to procyclic cells. We in fact state that slender parasites also launch the PAD1 pathway in the tsetse fly. We have no indication for a G<sub>0</sub> arrest and likewise not for a G1 prolongation (as shown for example in Batram et al., 2014 and Zimmermann et al., 2017). We are actually not aware of a <italic>bona fide</italic> cell cycle <italic>arrest</italic> that lasts for a shorter period than the cell cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have one major criticism, and that is the authors' equation of GFP-positive with &quot;PAD1 positive&quot;. Yes, this means that the GFP-PAD1 mRNA has been present. But the GFP could easily persist after the mRNA has gone, and of course the presence of GFP can't be equated with the presence of PAD1 protein. This limitation has to be stated right at the start and the description re-worded throughout. Has to be something like &quot;GFP-PAD reporter positive&quot;, or maybe even just &quot;GFP-positive&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We now clearly state in line 97-105:</p><p>“Expression of the protein associated with differentiation 1 (PAD1) is accepted as a marker for development to the stumpy stage (Dean et al., 2009).

We hope this is an acceptable compromise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 80 – The possibility that densities are higher in the skin should be mentioned briefly (I know it's in the Discussion as well.)</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention this in the introduction. Lines 75-79:</p><p>“Although trypanosomes might be found in higher densities in the skin (Capewell et al., 2016), chronic trypanosome infections are characterised by low blood parasitemia, meaning that the chance of a tsetse fly ingesting any trypanosomes, let alone short-lived stumpy ones, is also very low (Frezil, 1971; Wombou Toukam et al., 2011).”</p><p>The referee might also consider our recent new work on fly infections of artificial skin, which clearly shows that immediately after fly infection, trypanosomes do enter a dormant stage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443986">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443986</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 99 – for non-experts, the authors should mention that developmental regulation of PAD1 is controlled by the 3'-UTR.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and was added in line 99-105:</p><p>“As the 3’UTR of the PAD1 gene regulates the expression of pad1 (MacGregor and Matthews, 2012), cells expressing an NLS-GFP reporter fused to the 3' UTR of the PAD1 gene (GFP:PAD1<sup>UTR</sup>) will have GFP-positive nuclei when the PAD1 gene is active.

See lines 741-742.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 162 – this is a bit misleading. The authors should define what they mean by &quot;infection efficiency&quot;? Indeed the transmission indices for slender and stumpy are similar, but the number of infections per input slender trypanosome is half of that obtained with stumpy. The should state up front (rather than much later) that the slender parasites have more trouble establishing infection in the midgut.</p></disp-quote><p>We now state:</p><p>“The infection efficiency, using TI as a measure, when the flies were fed with either 20 stumpy trypanosomes or 20 pleomorphic slender trypanosomes was similar (Figure 2A, compare TI in column 8 for rows ii and vii).

This would compensate for any initial delay in transformation to the procyclic stage. As we know that this is rather speculative, we do not discuss this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 199-120 – a bit over-stated. If there is no midgut infection then there will definitely be no tryps in the salivary glands.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 and Figure 7 – titles are not appropriate since cell cycle arrest was not measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the title accordingly. The title for figure 5 (now figure 6) reads “Slender trypanosomes show delayed expression of EP compared to stumpy trypanosomes, while they seamlessly differentiate to the procyclic life cycle stage in the tsetse fly.” The title for figure 7 (now figure 8) reads “Slender trypanosomes show delayed expression of EP while they differentiate to the procyclic life cycle stage in vitro.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How about &quot;Slender trypanosomes show delayed EP procyclin expression after Tsetse infection / in vitro differentiation&quot;?

Please also see our comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From Figure 6, can a 1-2 h arrest while PAD1 is turned on and the rest of the programme is initiated be excluded?

A 1-2 hours stalling of the cell cycle cannot be regarded as a cell cycle arrest (G<sub>0</sub>), but rather prolongation of the cell cycle phase (maybe in G<sub>1</sub>).

Why one or the other life cycle stage should be successful in early or late stages of infection is a matter of speculation, and in the discussion lines 318 ff. we suggest one possibility, namely the documented differences in motile behavior of trypanosomes. We have clearly marked this as a theory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The data as presented in the tables is challenging to follow. In table 1, I recommend moving data on short stumpy and slender form related to expression site attenuation to supplemental data. In Tables 2 and 6, the information in the bars of the bar graphs (the different dotted lines, for example) should be developed into stand-alone parts of the figure, as they are difficult to interpret. In the text of the results, it would be helpful to be consistent with directing the reader to the correct column (for example, Line 192, &quot;column 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with referee number 3, although we had tried our best to present the data as interpretable as possible. As this was obviously not entirely successful, we now have added a beeswarm plot (Figure 2B) so that Figure 2A is easier to navigate.</p><p>We have re-worked most figures entirely in the revised version, thereby also implementing the suggestion to extract the dotted lines and put them in separate graphs (now Figure 5 B, C and Figure 7 B, C). We also included mathematical modelling and statistical analysis to figures 5-8. We hope that this has further improved the readability of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is unclear what tissues were analyzed in Figure 4 – some clarification about what an &quot;explant&quot; is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. We added that it is an “explanted tsetse midgut” to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very important finding that challenges the current dogma. As any paper that challenges the dogma, this paper raises many questions that will be tackled in future studies, namely reproducing these results with parasites recently isolated from the wild, instead of tissue culture adapted lines. Another important avenue will be to test the different mutant parasites that are incapable of differentiating from slender to stumpy forms and dissect the molecular machinery that composes the slender-differentiation.</p><p>I describe below two points that, in my opinion, could help strengthen the paper:</p><p>1. I am concerned about the parasite purification protocol prior to Tsetse infection (which involves change of buffers, filtration to remove the methylcellulose matrix and centrifugation). Could the protocol stress the slender forms such that these non-cell-cycle-arrested-stressed slenders gain the capacity to infect Tsetses? Previous reports have shown that reduced cellular energy promotes parasite differentiation (Barquilla 2012; Saldivia, 2016). Could the authors avoid or minimize the purification steps? Some <italic>T. brucei</italic> pleomorphic strains grow in vitro without methylcellulose, which would simplify parasite harvesting. Could the parasites be simply diluted in blood prior to infection of flies (without any purification)? When was the IFA done to confirm expression of GFP::PAD1? Ideally, it should have been at the end of purification protocol, just prior to Tsetse feeding. If it is technically impossible to improve/avoid parasite purification protocol, could the authors provide some evidence that after purification parasites are not stressed? Would purified parasites grow exponentially in culture without a lag phase? What are the levels of phosphorylated AMPKa1? This type of experiments would help ruling out that parasites were stressed by a reduced cellular energy during purification protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered that the cells might be “stressed”, even by a single, brief filtration step, and made sure that this did not result in increased GFP-PAD1 expression.</p><p>Almost all experiments were done with the same harvesting protocol. In Figure 2A, however, for 0.2, 1, and 2 cells/bloodmeal, cells were directly taken from culture and added to blood, thereby completely omitting any filtration step. This was not necessary since it was such a small number of cells that was needed. These very low trypanosome numbers per bloodmeal still resulted in infections. Further, all images taken at the start of the experiment (zero hour timepoint) were taken <italic>after</italic> the harvest. The cells did not express GFP:PAD1. As a further control, we regularly put harvested cells back in culture where they instantaneously resumed normal growth and did not show GFP:PAD1 expression. In conclusion, the experiments have been carefully controlled on multiple levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors showed that the kinetics of differentiation of slender and stumpy forms to procyclic forms is different both in vitro and in vivo, although both lead to the formation of bonafide procyclic forms. The authors could consider doing a competition experiment between slenders and stumpy forms to test their individual fitness in group.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments will be done in a follow-up paper. The experimental design is actually more complex than it might appear. For example, we have to tag the parasites with different fluorescent markers, which might differentially influence the parasites at any stage during the 30-day transition to the salivary glands.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer 4 asks for you to clarify one sentence and I agree. I too think that the phrase &quot;without harvesting the cells&quot; is really difficult to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer.

Figure 1—video 1 of the fly feeding has little obvious value in the present context, and I found he quality of Figure 4—video 1 disappointing. Figure 4—video 1 could be improved and if this were done it would then be a genuine addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2 asks us to improve the quality of Figure 4—video 1. Since this video shows live fluorescent trypanosomes in explants of tsetse flies, the quality is as good as it gets, and the video clearly supports our conclusions. In addition, the reviewer feels that Figure 1—video 1 is out of place. We would like to keep it, as tsetse membrane feeding may be known in a few specialized trypanosome laboratories, but certainly not by the wide readership that <italic>eLife</italic> attracts. Therefore, it seems well placed from an educational point of view.</p></body></sub-article></article>
