Mounting evidence supports that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) implicates in this process. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a plant-derived small molecular TrkB agonist, mimics the functions of BDNF. We show that both BDNF and 7,8-DHF promoted the proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. These effects might be attributed to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as the expression of cyclin D1, phosphorylated-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK3β), β-catenin, Runx2, Osterix, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) was all significantly up-regulated. Knockdown of β-catenin restrained the up-regulation of Runx2 and Osterix stimulated by 7,8-DHF. In particular, blocking TrkB by its specific inhibitor K252a suppressed 7,8-DHF-induced osteoblastic proliferation, differentiation, and expression of osteoblastogenic genes. Moreover, BDNF and 7,8-DHF repressed osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. The transcription factor c-fos and osteoclastic genes such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9), Adamts5 were inhibited by 7,8-DHF. More importantly, 7,8-DHF attenuated bone loss, improved trabecular microarchitecture, tibial biomechanical properties, and bone biochemical indexes in an ovariectomy (OVX) rat model. The current work highlights the dual regulatory effects that 7,8-DHF exerts on bone remodeling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>7,8-dihydroxyflavone</kwd><kwd>bone remodeling</kwd><kwd>osteoblasts</kwd><kwd>osteoclasts</kwd><kwd>ovariectomy rat model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019B020212001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro and in vivo studies highlight the dual regulatory effects that 7,8-dihydroxyflavone exerts on bone formation and resorption.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone is a dynamic and continuously renewed tissue that undergoes significant modification throughout the life cycle. Bone remodeling integrates osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption as well as osteocytes within the bone matrix and osteoblast-derived lining cells that cover the surface of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crockett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sims and Gooi, 2008</xref>). Disrupting the balance between bone resorption and formation leads to bone disorders such as osteoporosis, multiple myeloma, and osteopetrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng and McDonald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langdahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walsh and Gravallese, 2010</xref>). Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a ‘progressive systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). It is estimated that osteoporosis has affected hundreds of millions of people worldwide, predominantly postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compston et al., 2019</xref>). Pharmacological agents for the treatment of osteoporosis can be classified as either anabolic or antiresorptive, in the other words, either increasing bone building or blocking bone degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Compston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>). However, treatment with anabolic agents such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) might lead to a simultaneous increase in bone resorption. For the antiresorptive agent bisphosphonates, a concomitant decrease in bone formation can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khosla and Hofbauer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). These drawbacks of the current therapies might be attributed to one target for these drugs that fail to couple bone formation and resorption. Researchers are constantly striving to explore dual-action agents that modulate bone remodeling for the treatment of osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deal, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A large number of factors have been implicated in regulating bone formation, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krishnan, 2006</xref>). Activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway involves recruitment of a degrading complex, stabilization of β-catenin, regulation of transcription factors such as Runx2 and Osterix, and activation of Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron and Kneissel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karner and Long, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takada et al., 2009</xref>). This pathway is active in osteoprogenitor cells or preosteoblasts such as MC3T3-E1 cells, and many signaling molecules in this pathway are developed as drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhukhai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Osteoclasts, formed by the differentiation and fusion of hematopoietic mononuclear precursor cells under the stimulation of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), are the only cells responsible for bone resorption. After binding to receptor RANK, RANKL promotes osteoclastogenesis by activating several signaling pathways, including nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1)/c-fos pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Kim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, several genes such as cathepsin K, matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) that governing osteoclast differentiation and function are triggered after RANKL/RANK signal transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family that regulates a variety of biological processes predominantly via binding to the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB). Nonetheless, BDNF-elicited TrkB signals are transient with a peak signal at 10 min and decreases at 60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). A systemic application study of BDNF found that BDNF had a short half-life and did not readily cross the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felts et al., 2002</xref>). The outcomes of several clinical trials using recombinant BDNF are also disappointing, possibly because of the short in vivo half-life and poor delivery of BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ochs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thoenen and Sendtner, 2002</xref>). These drawbacks impose an insurmountable hurdle to clinical application of BDNF. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a plant-derived flavonoid, has been reported to overcome the above limitations of BDNF and identified as a functional BDNF mimic, which is able to induce TrkB dimerization and activate its downstream signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jang et al., 2010</xref>). 7,8-DHF is now extensively validated in various biochemical and cellular systems. It has been shown that BDNF could promote osteoblast differentiation, migration, and fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kilian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, we found that 7,8-DHF at the dose of 10 mg/kg·BW resulted in a marked increase in bone mineral density (BMD) irrespective of dietary conditions in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Inspired by the studies above, we wonder if 7,8-DHF could serve as a regulator on bone remodeling and exert antiosteoporosis effects. What’s more, it is of interest to explore whether TrkB mediates the interaction between 7,8-DHF-induced osteoblastogenesis and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of BDNF and 7,8-DHF on osteoblastogenesis in osteoprogenitor MC3T3-E1 cells and on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells in vitro, particularly to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying functions of 7,8-DHF. In addition, the in vivo effects of 7,8-DHF on bone remodeling were examined in an ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis rat model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>7,8-DHF promoted proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 osteoprogenitor cells</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, both BDNF and 7,8-DHF displayed a positive effect on MC3T3-E1 cells by promoting cell growth (p&lt;0.05), except the lowest concentration of BDNF (25 ng/mL).

As early as in 2000, BDNF and TrkB were firstly found in bone-forming cells of mice, suggesting that they were involved in the regulation of bone formation as an autocrine and paracrine factor in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asaumi et al., 2000</xref>). In 2014, the detection of BDNF and TrkB in human fracture gap tissue during various stages of the bone formation process was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kilian et al., 2014</xref>). Afterward, some researches confirmed that BDNF plays a positive role in accelerating bone union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kauschke et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kauschke et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, a study provided further understanding for the underlying mechanism of BDNF in fracture healing that BDNF contributed to MC3T3-E1 migration and increased the expression level of integrin β1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the fact that 7,8-DHF mimics so many aspects of BDNF, we hypothesized that there may be a regulatory network involving 7,8-DHF and bone remodeling. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the therapeutic potential of 7,8-DHF toward osteoporosis.</p><p>Bone homeostasis requires the coordinated recruitment of osteoblasts and osteoclasts to sites of remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Phan et al., 2020</xref>). The crosstalk among bone cells is maintained and orchestrated by a complex system, which includes hormones, growth factors, and physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Due to the tight coupling and synchronization of bone formation and resorption, the limitation of clinically used drugs is stimulation or inhibition of both phases at the same time. For example, bisphosphonates decrease bone degradation, but also reduce bone formation. What’s worse, it may cause serious jaw and subtrochanteric fractures, which are mostly attributed to its effects that induce osteoclast cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khosla and Hofbauer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reid, 2011</xref>). Likewise, drugs such as PTH or PTH-related protein mainly enhance the bone formation and meanwhile stimulate bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leder, 2017</xref>). In our present study, 7,8-DHF, as well as BDNF, exhibited the ability to regulate bone remodeling by synchronously promoting osteoblastic differentiation and restraining the formation of osteoclasts. Previous studies reported that BDNF is a potential osteoclastogenic factor in multiple myeloma, and myeloma-derived BDNF could promote RANKL secretion and osteoclasts formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, in our study we found that BNDF at the concentration of 25 ng/mL markedly inhibited the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts derived from RAW264.7 cells, though contributed to the growth of RAW264.7 cells. Of note, we observed that the TRAP-positive cells, c-fos mRNA level, the expression of MMP-9, and Adamts5 were decreased when 0.5 or 1 μM 7,8-DHF was used, while the inhibitory effect was lost at dose of 5 μM. This observation indicated that the effective therapeutic dose range of 7,8-DHF for suppression of bone resorption might be narrow. The underlying molecular mechanism accounting for this curve remains unclear. Nevertheless, the prodrug of 7,8-DHF, R13, also displayed the similar bell-shaped pharmacological curve in therapeutic treating AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>). Therefore, optimization of the chemical structure of 7,8-DHF or development of its analogues might exhibit a positive dose-dependent effect, extending the inhibitory activity for osteoclastogenesis.</p><p>Besides 7,8-DHF, other natural products or their derivatives such as emodin, wedelolactone, rhein, and psoralen have also showed dual effects on bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newman and Cragg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). One of the possible causes of their dual effects might result from that they can target multiple signaling pathways and display various beneficial pharmacological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be responsible for a variety of biological processes, including the regulation of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. β-Catenin is the principal mediator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baron and Kneissel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon and Nusse, 2006</xref>). In the absence of extracellular Wnt ligands, β-catenin is recruited into a degrading complex comprising GSK-3β, the scaffold protein axin, and adenomatous polyposis coli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moon et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the content of the β-catenin protein in normal cells is generally kept very low. In the presence of Wnt ligands, on the other hand, GSK3β is phosphorylated to yield inactive p-GSK3β, and the degrading complex is depolymerized, which allows β-catenin to avoid the degradation by the proteasome and accumulate in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). The accumulated β-catenin translocates into the nucleus, binds with T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor, and activates a series of target gene, such as cyclin D1, Runx2, and Osterix. It has been reported that BDNF is involved in the regulation of GSK3β activity both in the retina tissue in vivo and in the neuronal cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>). In this research, we observed that 7,8-DHF induced phosphorylation of GSK3β at the serine nine residue, thus promoting the aggregation and localization of β-catenin in the nucleus.</p><p>Cyclin D1, whose activity is required for G1/S transition, is one of the key cell cycle regulators. It is synthesized during G1 phase and assembles with either cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) or CDK6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ozaki et al., 2007</xref>). Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with 7,8-DHF could up-regulate the mRNA level of cyclin D1, thus stimulating more cells at S phase but less at G0/G1 phase. These results indicated active DNA synthesis, which was consistent with cell proliferation results. Two transcription factors, Runx2 and Osterix/SP7, have previously been shown to be essential for the differentiation of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ryoo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Karsenty, 2002</xref>). Runx2 not only acts as a scaffold for nucleic acids and regulatory factors involved in skeletal gene expression, but also promotes skeletal development on different levels, including differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into osteoblasts, chondrocyte maturation, and skeletal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kokabu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGee-Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>). Osterix plays an important role at a later step in the process of osteoblast differentiation, that is, the differentiation of pre-osteoblasts into mature osteoblasts and osteocytes. Moreover, it is a key target of mechanical signals that affect bone biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2007</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that 7,8-DHF could enhance osteoblastic differentiation by stimulating Runx2 and Osterix via β-catenin. The possibility that 7,8-DHF enhanced the activity of other Runx2 inducers such as Smad2 and TAK1 was excluded.</p><p>What molecule(s) served as a ‘bridge’ between 7,8-DHF-induced osteogenesis and the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway? It has been reported that 7,8-DHF inhibits obesity through activating muscular TrkB. The anti-obesity activity of 7,8-DHF is muscular TrkB-dependent and 7,8-DHF cannot mitigate diet-induced obesity in female muscle-specific TrkB-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). Besides, the promotion effect of BDNF on osteoblast migration and fracture healing is also via TrkB. The specific inhibitor for Trks, K252a, can suppress BDNF-induced cell migration, integrin β1 expression, and activation of ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We thus hypothesized that TrkB is the link between 7,8-DHF and Wnt/β-catenin reinforcement during osteogenic differentiation. As expected, 7,8-DHF-induced activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in MC3T3-E1 cells was diminished by inhibiting TrkB with K252a. In the presence of K252a, the elevation of the expression of p-GSK3β, β-catenin, Runx2, and Osterix was reduced, suggesting that 7,8-DHF acts on TrkB to alter the expression of critical genes involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p><p>Differentiated osteoblasts subsequently produce positive and negative regulators of osteoclastogenesis, such as RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor-ligand family, and its natural decoy receptor OPG, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacey et al., 1998</xref>). RANKL binds to its receptor RANK on osteoclast progenitors and activates c-fos to induce transcription of genes related to osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leibbrandt and Penninger, 2008</xref>). Whereas OPG competitively binds to RANKL and prevents activation of RANK, leading to the inhibition of osteoclast recruitment. Otherwise, the production of OPG is tightly dependent on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2020</xref>). From the experimental results, we infer that 7,8-DHF-induced increase of OPG might be involved in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and the decreased RANKL probably down-regulated the transcription of c-fos to a certain degree, leading to the suppression of NF-κB pathway and ultimately inhibiting the osteoclastic differentiation of RAW264.7 cells. The RANK/RANKL/OPG axes couple osteoblast and osteoclast activities, thereby controlling the balance between bone formation and resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>). The ratio between OPG and RANKL is considered a quantitative osteogenic activity standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The current study suggests that 7,8-DHF positively modulates OPG/RANKL balance, as OPG/RANKL ratio was increased in response to 7,8-DHF, representing the capability of 7,8-DHF to inhibit osteoclast activity.</p><p>Considering the fascinating dual functional effect of 7,8-DHF on osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vitro, we further proved that 7,8-DHF exerted a protective effect against osteoporosis in vivo using an OVX-induced osteoporotic rat model. In agreement with the previous observations, ovarian hormone deficiency, caused by surgical removal of ovaries, significantly increased body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), but this excess body weight gain was partially prevented by 7,8-DHF. Besides, OVX can accelerate bone remodeling, an uncoupling between bone resorption and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Libouban et al., 2003</xref>). As the resorption phase is short but the period required for osteoblastic replacement is long, any increase in the rate of bone remodeling will result in a loss of bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raisz, 2005</xref>). It is necessary to evaluate the true impact of a treatment on the quality of trabecular bone because trabecular bone is more readily lost due to OVX in this animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maïmoun et al., 2012</xref>). Radiographic and histomorphology analysis showed that 7,8-DHF attenuated bone loss and alleviated the compromised trabecular microstructure in ovariectomized rat. However, neither of the doses was able to restore trabecular bone completely. The loss of bone mass is usually accompanied by enhanced levels of the bone turnover markers, such as ALP and BGP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2011</xref>). The relief of the high bone turnover status in the 7,8-DHF-treated groups was evidenced by lower serum levels of ALP and BGP. Moreover, an increase in urinary calcium excretions might contribute to the reduction of BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park et al., 2011</xref>). Results showed that 7,8-DHF prevented the OVX-induced increase in urinary Ca excretion. Although such inhibition generally would be considered beneficial, biomechanical properties of bone may be decreased if bone remodeling is inhibited excessively. Fortunately, we found that 7,8-DHF at a lower dose (5 mg/kg/day) significantly improved the biomechanical parameters in OVX rats.</p><p>In summary, the present study evaluates the potential of 7,8-DHF as a novel dual regulator for bone formation and bone resorption. We found that 7,8-DHF promoted osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation through the TrkB-Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and inhibited osteoclastogenesis at the same time. Furthermore, 7,8-DHF could alleviate osteoporosis phenotypes, enhance mechanical properties, and ameliorate bone remodeling in OVX rat. Notably, 7,8-DHF is orally bioactive and is safe for chronic treatment. Hence, it acts as a good compound for further medicinal application to maximize its therapeutic properties toward various bone disorders, especially postmenopausal osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">MC3T3-E1 Subclone 14</td><td valign="top">The Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat #:GNM15 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_5437">CVCL_5437</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">RAW 264.7</td><td valign="top">The Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat #:SCSP-5036 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0493">CVCL_0493</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">BDNF</td><td valign="top">PeproTech</td><td valign="top">Cat #:450–02</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">RANKL</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat #:462-TEC-010</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">7,8- Dihydroxyflavone;

To quantify the degree of mineralization, the bound stain was eluted with 10% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride and the absorbance of the solubilized dye was recorded at 561 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>TRAP staining</title><p>TRAP histochemical staining of RAW264.7 cells was performed using an acid phosphatase, leukocyte (TRAP) kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in medium containing different concentrations of 7,8-DHF in 48-well plates in the presence of RANKL (50 ng/mL). Following incubation for 5 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. TRAP staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TRAP-positive multinucleated (more than three nuclei) cells were photographed under manual inverted microscope (Leica DMI3000 B).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Cells were seeded in six-well plates and treated with different concentrations of 7,8-DHF. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, Waltham, MA) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKara, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The detailed sequences of the specific primers are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. cDNA was amplified using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each PCR reaction was carried out in a single 96-well PCR Microplates (Axygen, Union City, CA) using the QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The expression levels of target genes were calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method and normalized to the reference gene GAPDH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer containing fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitor PMSF (1 mM). Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit. Equal amounts of proteins were run in an 8% or 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After 1 hr blocking with 5% (w/v) skim milk at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was incubated with the membrane for 1 hr at room temperature. The blot was detected by chemiluminescence (Clinx, Shanghai, China). The intensity of each band was quantified using ImageJ software (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Rockville, MD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Small interfering RNA transfection</title><p>The small interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Tsingke Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The siRNA oligoconstruction used was as follows: sense 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCACCAUGCAGAAUACAAATT</named-content>-3′ and antisense 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">UUUGUAUUCUGCAUGGUGCTT</named-content>-3′. MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected using 50 nM siRNA mixed with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, Waltham, MA) in a 12-well plate. All transfection procedures were performed in strict accordance with the Lipofectamine 3000 reagent protocol. The gene knockdown efficiency was confirmed by qRT-PCR and the rates of protein production were determined using western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Animals and treatment</title><p>All of the animals were handled according to approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols (Aproval No.: IACUC-20190318–03) of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering. Ten-to-eleven-week-old Sprague-Dawley female rats (Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., China) were acclimated for 5 days before the experiments started. All rats were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Laboratory Animal Research Center. Rats were either sham-operated (SHAM, n=7) or bilateral OVX (n=21) under general anesthesia. One week after recovering from surgery, the OVX rats were randomly divided into three groups: OVX with vehicle (OVX, n=7), OVX with low-dose 7,8-DHF (OVX-L, n=7, 5 mg/kg/day), and OVX with high-dose 7,8-DHF (OVX-H, n=7, 10 mg/kg/day). Masking was used during group allocation. 7,8-DHF was dissolved in 5% DMSO/95% methylcellulose (0.5%, wt/vol). Vehicle or 7,8-DHF solutions were all administrated intragastrically for 12 weeks. During the experimental period, all rats were allowed free access to distilled water and fed with standard rat chow.</p><p>The body weight of the rats was recorded weekly during the experimental period. Urine samples were collected from the rats that were housed individually for 24 hr in metabolic cages without providing food 1 day before the rats were sacrificed. Before laparotomy, blood samples were collected and serums were then prepared by centrifugation of the collected bloods. Urine and serum samples were both stored at −80°C for biochemical determinations. Uterine was removed from each rat and immediately weighed. Femurs were dissected and filled in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4°C for measurement of BMD by DXA (Lunar Prodigy, GE Healthcare, Madison, WI), trabecular microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT, NEMO, PINGSENG Healthcare (Kunshan) Inc, Kunshan, China), and bone histomorphometry analysis. The right tibias were cleaned of adherent tissue, packed with physiological saline-soaked gauze and stored at −80°C for measurement of compression test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>DXA analysis</title><p>Two-dimensional BMD of the left femur was measured using Lunar Prodigy by DXA (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) equipped with appropriate software for bone density assessment in small laboratory animals. BMD was calculated by bone mineral content of the measured area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Micro-CT analysis</title><p>After DXA measurement, one representative left femur from each group was selected for evaluating trabecular microarchitecture of the femoral metaphysis using micro-CT (NEMO, PINGSENG Healthcare (Kunshan) Inc, Kunshan, China). The selection of representative sample was based on the median value of BMD of respective group. The distal femur is rich in trabecular bone compared with the proximal and middle regions. Therefore, the femur was scanned from the proximal growth plate in the distal direction (50 μm/slice). This region included 3600 images obtained from each femur using 1024 × 1024 matrix resulting in an isotropic voxel resolution of 29 μm<sup>3</sup>. The volume of interest was selected as a region 30slices away from the growth plate at the proximal end of the femur to 70 slices. The 3D images were obtained for visualization and display.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Compression test</title><p>The biomechanical properties of the fresh right tibia were assessed using a compression test on an electronic universal testing machine (Shenzhen SUNS Technology Stock Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). The test was performed using upper and lower jigs, vertical in the sagittal plane. The lower part of the tibia specimen was completely fixed in the lower jig using 502 glue. A compression load was applied at a rate of 2 mm/min until the tibia specimen fractured. During the test, the load-displacement data were obtained to calculate the biomechanical parameters, such as the maximum load, the fracture deflection, and the fracture strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bone histomorphometry</title><p>The slices of right femurs were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and TRAP staining. After being freed from soft tissues, the right femurs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr at 4°C and/or decalcified and then dehydrated. Subsequently, the specimen was embedded in wax, made into 4 μm paraffin slices, and baked at 60°C. The slices were deparaffinated before being subjected to H&amp;E staining and TRAP staining. After staining, the slices were sealed in neutral gum and analysis was performed with NIKON Eclipse Ci microscope equipped with a digital camera. TRAP-positive cells with three or more nuclei were identified as osteoclasts, and the osteoclast number/bone surface was calculated by Image-pro plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc, Rockville, MD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Assay for serum and urine chemistry</title><p>S-Ca and ALP concentrations were determined using an automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). U-Ca and creatinine (Cr) concentrations were analyzed by the same method used for the serum samples. Urinary excretion of Ca was expressed as the ratio to Cr concentration (Ca/Cr). In addition, serum levels of FSH, E2, and osteocalcin (BGP) were measured by ELISA kit (Cusabio Technology Llc., Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Biological replicates are parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples and technical replicates are repeated measurements of the same sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blainey et al., 2014</xref>). The number of independent biological replicates was 3, unless otherwise stated. Other statistical details of the experiments could be found in the figure legends for each experiment, including the number of wells in the cell culture experiments and the number of rats in the animal experiments (represented as n, unless otherwise stated). Data were expressed as mean ± SD and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA). Statistical differences were assessed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to assess the statistical significance. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>The authors are indebted to Dr Lizong Zhang and other staff at the Laboratory Animal Research Center, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, for their help with animal experiments.

The authors have also demonstrated the osteoporosis-preventive function of 7,8-DHF in ovariectomized rats, which might have significant translational values. While the study is logically designed and the findings further enhance our understanding of the connection between neurotrophin and bone remodeling, more detailed analyses are needed to fully delineate the molecular actions of 7,8-DHF in the skeletal system. The are several major concerns</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the introduction section, the author claimed that BDNF is a potential therapeutic target in numerous neurological, mental, and metabolic disorders. However, the poor delivery and short half-life of BDNF in vivo impose an insurmountable hurdle to its clinical application. The author should better explain the physiological role of BDNF in nervous system with a relative short half-life and the reason of the short half-life. Long half-life does not necessarily mean better. And why long-half-life BDNF like cytokine is needed in bone metabolism? What the molecular basis that 7,8-DHF can mimic BDNF? BDNF as a protein/peptide based functioning molecule, the function was deployed mainly through active peptide motif. 7,8-DHF however, as one of the flavonoids, is a chemical with two benzene rings with carbon connections. The two molecules are very different and how can one of them mimicking another? The author should provide molecular and structural evidence. The abstract is not appropriately written. It does even describe any results related to BDNF. The studies should include BDNF in the in vitro analyses because previous studies reported contradictorily that BDNF increased osteoclast formation (Sun et al. Int J Cancer 2012 130: 827; Ai et al., PLoS One 2012 7: e46287). Comparing the activity difference between endogenous ligand and non-peptidyl mimetics is essential to understand their functional specificity.</p><p>2) The authors used RAW264.7 and MC3T3-E1 immortal cell lines for studying in vitro effects and molecular clues. The changes are modest at best, use of primary cells is encouraged, and in vivo evidence needs to be strengthened.</p><p>3) The details of 7,8-DHF-provoked β-catenin/Run2 signaling has not been sufficiently addressed. How does 7,8-DHF increase the expression of β-catenin? Moreover, the subtle increase of β-catenin expression questions if it is the major downstream effector for inducing the expression of key osteoclastogenic factors Run2 and osterix. A β-catenin knockdown experiment in MC3T3-E1 cells should be performed to verify this conclusion. The possibility that 7,8-DHF enhances the activity of other Run2 inducers such as Smad2 and <italic>TAK1</italic> should not be excluded, especially that BDNF is able to induce BMP7 production (Ortega and Alcantara Cereb Cortex 2010 20: 2132) and enhance integrin expression in MC3T3-E1 (Zhang et al., J Cell Mol Med 2020 24: 10792).</p><p>4) In addition to osteoclastogenesis, the effect of 7,8-DHF on the reabsorption activity (e.g. Pit assay or OsteoAssay) of differentiated osteoclasts should be assessed. Expression of reabsorption markers such as Adamts5, Loxl2, etc should also be considered. This information will be important to evaluate if BDNF signaling is also important in modulating the activity of mature osteoclasts.</p><p>5) Explanations on the discrepant results between protein content and gene expression of Runx2, osterix, and β-catenin after 7,8-DHF stimulation should be provided (Figures 3E to 3G).</p><p>6) In Figure 5 some of the responses with the Low dose 7,8DHF are higher than Controls. What does 7,8 DHF do by itself, without OVX? A control experiment using 7,8 DHF without OVX would be helpful to interpret the response.</p><p>7) The n number (n=3) used to examine the effect of 7,8-DHF in osteoclast formation in vivo is not sufficient to give a convincing conclusion (Figure 6).</p><p>8) Statistics on the bone morphometric parameters should be provided (Table 1).</p><p>9) In Table 2, it appears that estradiol levels rise after OVX when using the 7,8 DHF, why is that?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64872.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the introduction section, the author claimed that BDNF is a potential therapeutic target in numerous neurological, mental, and metabolic disorders.

It also influences oligodendrocyte proliferation and remyelination. In the central nervous system (CNS), neurons synthesize BDNF and it is suggested that BDNF mainly works in a paracrine or autocrine manner in the CNS (Makar, Nimmagadda, Trisler, and Bever, 2014). The result of a systemic application of BDNF in an experimental model of neuritis was negative, and the study found that BDNF had a short half-life and did not readily cross the brain blood barrier (BBB) (Felts, Smith, Gregson, and Hughes, 2002). The outcomes of several clinical trials using recombinant BDNF are disappointing, also possibly because of the short in vivo half-life and poor delivery of BDNF (Ochs et al., 2000; Thoenen and Sendtner, 2002).</p><p>BDNF exerts its biological functions on neurons predominantly via binding to the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB. BDNF triggers TrkB dimerization through conformational changes and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain, resulting in activation of three major signaling pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) (C. Liu, Chan, and Ye, 2016; Xia Liu et al., 2014). These signaling cascades have critical roles in neuronal plasticity, survival and neurogenesis (Z. Zhang et al., 2014). Nonetheless, BDNF-elicited TrkB signals are transient with a peak signal at 10 min and decreases at 60 min. Furthermore, BDNF provokes activated TrkB receptor to be ubiquitinated and degraded. Conversely, 7,8-DHF swiftly induces TrkB phosphorylation and the activation sustains for more than 3 h without inducing TrkB ubiquitination or degradation (C. Liu et al., 2016; Xia Liu et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Long half-life does not necessarily mean better. And why long-half-life BDNF like cytokine is needed in bone metabolism?</p></disp-quote><p>At present, antiosteoporosis drugs face many challenges, including short half-life. For example, salmon calcitonin (sCT), a polypeptide drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is widely used in more than 90 countries as a typical antiresorptive drug for the treatment of metabolic bone disease. However, the clinical application of sCT is limited by its short half-life because of its rapid clearance in vivo (Yu et al., 2019). NEL-like molecule-1 (NELL-1) protein, an osteogenic growth factor, is widely studied in bone regeneration. Similar to other native protein drugs, NELL-1 has a relatively short half-life time in vivo after intravenous injection, which limits its application as a therapy for osteoporosis. Due to the rapid clearance of native protein drug in vivo, high dose and frequent administration usually have to be adopted to achieve therapeutic benefit. This can lead to high treatment cost and low patient compliance in chronic treatment (Y. Zhang et al., 2014). Long half-life agents in the matrix are well positioned to support long-term gains in BMD, but also carry the risk of adverse skeletal effects (Estell and Rosen, 2021). For BDNF itself <italic>per se</italic>, it has the intrinsic problem as a polypeptide including poor PK profiles and too short half-life for clinical usage. 7,8-DHF obviously exhibits much better and improved PK features as compared to BDNF as a TrkB receptor agonist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What the molecular basis that 7,8-DHF can mimic BDNF? BDNF as a protein/peptide based functioning molecule, the function was deployed mainly through active peptide motif. 7,8-DHF however, as one of the flavonoids, is a chemical with two benzene rings with carbon connections.

The author should provide molecular and structural evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>BDNF triggers TrkB dimerization and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its intracellular domain, resulting in activation of the downstream signaling pathways. Similarly，7,8-DHF specifically activate TrkB. It binds to the receptor extracellular domain of TrkB, promote the receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, and activate the downstream signaling cascades (Jang et al., 2010). It is also a bioavailable chemical that can pass through the BBB to provoke TrkB and its downstream PI3K/Akt and MAPK activation. Besides, internalization of the neurotrophin-Trk complex plays a critical role in signal transduction that initiates cell body responses to target-derived neurotrophins. Both BDNF and 7,8-DHF strongly escalate TrkB internalization. The SAR (structural-activity relationship) study has shown that the 7,8-dihydroxy groups are essential for the agonistic effect, and 8-hydroxy group in A ring is essential for the TrkB stimulatory effect, as 5,7-DHF, 5,6-DHF and 5,6,7-THF could not activate TrkB. None of the single hydroxy flavone derivatives exhibited notable TrkB stimulatory effect and no trihydroxy flavones or dimethoxy flavones demonstrated any substantial effect (C. Liu et al., 2016; X. Liu et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The abstract is not appropriately written. It does even describe any results related to BDNF.

Unlike the above-mentioned research, which BDNF increased osteoclast formation, our study found that BDNF significantly inhibited the formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts. The differences are as follows: The cell model employed in our study was RAW 264.7 murine macrophages, a well-characterized cell linage with regard to osteoclastogenic study. However, Sun et al., and Ai et al., used human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and multiple myeloma cell lines. The concentrations of BDNF applied in our study were 25, 50, 100 ng/mL, while they used 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 25 ng/mL BDNF to determine the effect of BDNF on osteoclast formation and activity in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors used RAW264.7 and MC3T3-E1 immortal cell lines for studying in vitro effects and molecular clues. The changes are modest at best, use of primary cells is encouraged, and in vivo evidence needs to be strengthened.</p></disp-quote><p>MC3T3-E1 subclone 14, derived from mouse calvaria, is a good model for studying in vitro osteoblast differentiation, particularly extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling. They exhibit effects similar to primary calvarial osteoblasts (Wang et al., 1999). RAW264.7 murine cell line is an important tool for in vitro studies of OC formation and function, in parallel or as a prelude to studies with OCs formed from primary cells (Collin-Osdoby and Osdoby, 2012). The use of primary cells raised difficulties. Such limits including the availability and variation in response patterns among different cellular study preparations (Kong, Smith, and Hao, 2019). Despite all these hurdles, we appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments and have conducted some experiments using primary cells. Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were induced to osteoblasts and osteoclasts respectively as previously described (Hu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018).

Besides, 7,8-DHF had no cytotoxicity on survival of BMMs and possessed inhibitory effect on osteoclastic differentiation of BMMs, as the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells was sharply reduced by 7,8-DHF treatment (<italic>p&lt;0.001</italic>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>7,8-DHF promoted osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and inhibited osteoclastic differentiation of BMMs.</title><p>(A) The effect of 7,8-DHF on the proliferation of BMSCs after treatment for 24, 48 and 72 h.

How does 7,8-DHF increase the expression of β-catenin?</p></disp-quote><p>The glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) in the degradation complex is a key negative regulator of β-catenin, which phosphorylates β-catenin and further degrades it via the ubiquitin pathway in quiescent cells (Jain, Ghanghas, Rana, and Sanyal, 2017). As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, 7,8-DHF inactivated GSK3β by increasing its phosphorylation, leading to disrupting the β-catenin destruction complex. The p-GSK3β/GSK3β value significantly increased as the concentrations of 7,8-DHF elevated <italic>(p&lt;0.05)</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the subtle increase of β-catenin expression questions if it is the major downstream effector for inducing the expression of key osteoclastogenic factors Run2 and osterix. A β-catenin knockdown experiment in MC3T3-E1 cells should be performed to verify this conclusion. The possibility that 7,8-DHF enhances the activity of other Run2 inducers such as Smad2 and TAK1 should not be excluded, especially that BDNF is able to induce BMP7 production (Ortega and Alcantara Cereb Cortex 2010 20: 2132) and enhance integrin expression in MC3T3-E1 (Zhang et al., J Cell Mol Med 2020 24: 10792).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, a β-catenin knockdown experiment in MC3T3-E1 cells was performed and results were shown in Figure 2J-M, Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Compared to negative control, expression of β-catenin, Runx2 and Osterix was markedly reduced by β-catenin knockdown in both the absence and presence of 7,8-DHF (<italic>p&lt;0.05</italic>). β-catenin is the major downstream effector for inducing the expression of key osteoclastogenic factors Runx2 and osterix. Besides, the activities of other Runx2 inducers such as Smad2 and <italic>TAK1</italic> had no obvious difference with 7,8-DHF treatment as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Based on these results, we speculated that β-catenin is the major downstream effector for inducing the expression of key osteoclastogenic factors Runx2 and osterix. However, we did not carry out other experiments involving BMP7 or integrin β1, because the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway was not the main objective of this study, we primarily focused on investigating the specific signaling molecules involved in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, in order to avoid complicating the issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In addition to osteoclastogenesis, the effect of 7,8-DHF on the reabsorption activity (e.g. Pit assay or OsteoAssay) of differentiated osteoclasts should be assessed. Expression of reabsorption markers such as Adamts5, Loxl2, etc should also be considered. This information will be important to evaluate if BDNF signaling is also important in modulating the activity of mature osteoclasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. Unfortunately, the Corning osteo assay surface multiple well plate (CLS3988) is not currently available, and it is hard to find suitable substitutes. Hence, we cannot perform the suggested Pit assay or OsteoAssay.</p><p>As requested, expression of Adamts5 was examined and results showed that 0.5 μM and 1 μM 7,8-DHF significantly decreased the protein level of Adamts5 (<italic>p&lt;0.05</italic>) (Figure 4G). We did not measure the expression of Loxl2, because Loxl2 is expressed by pre-hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes in vivo, and that LOXL2 expression is regulated in vitro as a function of chondrocyte differentiation, not osteoclast differentiation (Iftikhar et al., 2011). Besides, Loxl2 promotes aggressive osteosarcoma, a malignant tumor of the bone whose pathological mechanisms is different from osteoporosis (Matsuoka et al., 2020). Instead, we determined another resorption marker matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme of the metalloproteinase family, which plays an important role in the bone matrix degradation and bone remodeling. As shown in Figure 4F, 0.5 μM and 1 μM, 7,8-DHF notably decreased the protein levels of MMP-9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Explanations on the discrepant results between protein content and gene expression of Runx2, osterix, and β-catenin after 7,8-DHF stimulation should be provided (Figures 3E to 3G).</p></disp-quote><p>These results indicated that 7,8-DHF might increase the protein expression of β-catenin, Runx2 and osterix via a post-transcriptional regulation. In fact, it is not abnormal that the mRNA level of a gene is not consistent with the protein level. For instance, Gao et al. found that along with the curcumin treatment, the mRNA level of Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) was not decreased significantly, which was not consistent with the protein level decrease (Gao et al., 2014). Khan et al. found that the mRNA expression pattern of β-galactosidase was not consistent with the protein level (Khan, Takahashi, Abe, and Komatsu, 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 5 some of the responses with the Low dose 7,8DHF are higher than Controls. What does 7,8 DHF do by itself, without OVX? A control experiment using 7,8 DHF without OVX would be helpful to interpret the response.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments. In our previous research, we used a prodrug strategy for elevating 7,8-DHF oral bioavailability and the brain exposure, and found that the optimal prodrug R13 has favorable properties. R13 is readily hydrolyzed into 7,8-DHF in liver microsomes and the plasma concentration of 7,8-DHF is also significantly enhanced (Chen et al., 2018). Recently, we conducted an experiment using 7,8-DHF prodrug R13 to treat wild-type (WT) mice orally. Specifically, 12 weeks old WT mice received vehicle or R13 at dose of 21.8 mg/kg/d, six days per week, for 8 weeks by gavage. μCT scan and analysis was performed in femurs ex vivo using a μCT-40 scanner. The results were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. The structure and volume of trabecular bone, as well as the fretting and microdamage in cortical bone in WT+R13 group was improved compared with the WT+control group. The research, which includes the above results, is continuing and has yet to be published.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Representative samples were reconstructed in 3D to generate visual representations of trabecular and cortical structure.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64872-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The n number (n=3) used to examine the effect of 7,8-DHF in osteoclast formation in vivo is not sufficient to give a convincing conclusion (Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and have made some modifications accordingly. As shown in Figure 6C, we increased the sample sizes to 5, ensuring that the parameter is more accurate and the results obtained are more persuasive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Statistics on the bone morphometric parameters should be provided (Table 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We entrusted Pingsheng Healthcare (Kunshan) Inc (Jiangsu, China) to conduct the micro-CT analysis. The data Table 1 showed were raw data from the company, which did not have statistics. In order to make the results more reliable, we deleted the previous Table 1 and re-organized the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Table 2, it appears that estradiol levels rise after OVX when using the 7,8 DHF, why is that?</p></disp-quote><p>It was reported that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) promotes the differentiation of ovarian follicles and modulates estrogen secretion (Danilovich et al., 2000). We speculate that the rise of estradiol levels when using the 7,8-DHF is possibly due to reduction of FSH. Recently, our study showed that 7,8-DHF at the medium dose (10 mg/kg·BW) resulted in a marked increase in bone mineral density (BMD) irrespective of dietary conditions. All 7,8-DHF treated groups, whether fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD), had lower FSH levels and higher serum estradiol levels in female mice (Zhao et al., 2021). Based on what was emerging from this research, we included the results of serum FSH levels in bone biochemical indexes. As shown in Table 1, the increase of estradiol level was consistent with the decrease of FSH levels when using 7,8-DHF after OVX.</p><p>References</p><p>Chen, C., Wang, Z., Zhang, Z., Liu, X., Kang, S.
