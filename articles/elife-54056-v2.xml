common in eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Whereas therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) can suppress leakage, side-effects include vascular rarefaction and geographic atrophy. By challenging mouse models representing different steps in VEGFA/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-induced vascular permeability, we show that targeting signaling downstream of VEGFR2 pY949 limits vascular permeability in retinopathy induced by high oxygen or by laser-wounding. Although suppressed permeability is accompanied by reduced pathological neoangiogenesis in oxygen-induced retinopathy, similarly sized lesions leak less in mutant mice, separating regulation of permeability from angiogenesis. Strikingly, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin phosphorylation at the Y685, but not Y658, residue is reduced when VEGFR2 pY949 signaling is impaired. These findings support a mechanism whereby VE-cadherin Y685 phosphorylation is selectively associated with excessive vascular leakage. Therapeutically, targeting VEGFR2-regulated VE-cadherin phosphorylation could suppress edema while leaving other VEGFR2-dependent functions intact.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The number of people with impaired vision and blindness is increasing in Western society due to the aging population and the increased prevalence of diabetes. This has led to eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy becoming more common. In both these eye diseases, new blood vessels grow in the retina – the light-sensitive part of the eye – to bring oxygen and nutrients to the tissue. However, these new blood vessels are leaky and allow molecules to leave the bloodstream and enter the retinal tissue. This causes the retina to swell and impair a person’s vision. The leaky blood supply also reduces the amount of oxygen that gets to the tissue, resulting in further damage to the retina.</p><p>When tissues experience low levels of oxygen, cells start making a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (or VEGF for short). Whilst this protein is important for helping form new blood vessels, it also makes these vessels leaky. Current treatments for age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy decrease swelling in the eye by blocking the action of VEGF. However, these treatments also cause existing blood vessels and nerve cells to die, leading to irreversible damage. Now, Smith et al. have set out to find whether the effects of VEGF can be blocked without causing further damage to existing cells.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, the eyes and retinas of mice were treated with a laser or exposed to changing oxygen levels to create injuries that resembled human age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Each of the tested mice had specific mutations in proteins known to interact with VEGF. Fluorescent particles were injected into the bloodstream of the mice to assess how these different mutations affected blood vessel leakage: if fluorescent particles could no longer be detected outside the blood vessels, this suggested that the mutation had stopped the vessels from leaking. Further experiments showed these specific mutations affected leakage and did not prevent new blood vessels from forming.</p><p>In the future it will be important to see if drugs, rather than mutations, can also decrease the leakiness of blood vessels in the retina. Such chemical compounds could then be tested in mouse experiments. If successful, these drugs might be used to treat patients with age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vascular permeability</kwd><kwd>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>macular edema</kwd><kwd>neovascularization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE170100167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-02375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claesson-Welsh</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015.0030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claesson-Welsh</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015.0275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claesson-Welsh</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17 CVD 03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Claesson-Welsh</surname><given-names>Lena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AIRC IG 18683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dejana</surname><given-names>Elisabetta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pathological vessel leakage in mouse retinopathy models depends on VE-cadherin Y685 phosphorylation status, which in turn is regulated by a signaling cascade originating with VEGFR2 Y949 phosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood vessel dysfunction in the retina is a critical component of several blinding eye diseases. In particular, the retina is sensitive to the fluid accumulation that can result from excessively leaking blood vessels in the eye and reduction of the ensuing edema is a therapeutic goal in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daruich et al., 2018</xref>). Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is one of the key factors controlling endothelial cell biology in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daruich et al., 2018</xref>). The importance of VEGFA signaling is underscored by the clinical success of antibodies (bevacizumab, ranibizumab) neutralizing VEGFA, or soluble receptor fusion proteins (aflibercept), neutralizing several VEGF family members. These drugs preserve vision in many patients, but over time disease progression may resume, and for others there is no benefit even from the initial anti-VEGF treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bressler et al., 2017</xref>). The role of VEGFA for survival of VEGFR2-expressing retinal neurons presents an additional challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nishijima et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, anti-VEGF treatment has been linked to capillary loss and rarefaction of normal adult vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamba and McDonald, 2007</xref>). While a focus in the development of new therapies to treat retinopathies has been on increasing the potency of anti-VEGFA therapy, the detrimental effects of long-lasting VEGFA suppression are now being recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Usui-Ouchi and Friedlander, 2019</xref>). Taken together, the development of alternative treatments to block excessive vascular leakage in the eye while sparing other VEGF functions is very important.</p><p>The retina is protected by a blood retinal barrier (BRB) which, under normal conditions, limits the extravasation of blood components into the tissue. The BRB consists of an inner barrier at the level of retinal vessels and an outer barrier at the cell junctions of the retinal pigment epithelium and it serves to stringently protect the tissue from pathogens, edema and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). The BRB is established in conjunction with vessel entry in the central nervous system during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chow and Gu, 2017</xref>). In eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, hypoxia and the ensuing increased production of VEGFA is accompanied by breakdown of the BRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campochiaro, 2015</xref>). The molecular mechanisms downstream of VEGFA leading to this disruption have not been defined.</p><p>VEGFA, originally identified as vascular permeability factor (VPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Senger et al., 1986</xref>), binds to VEGFR2 inducing receptor phosphorylation and the propagation of signaling cascades regulating endothelial survival, proliferation and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simons et al., 2016</xref>). Acute responses to VEGFR2 activity include destabilization of endothelial junctions leading to increased permeability. Notably, phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y949 (951 in human) enhances permeability via the disruption of adherens junctions in the dermal vasculature, but also in pathologies such as neuroendocrine cancer, melanoma and glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>). Phosphorylation of Y949 creates a binding site for the adaptor molecule T cell specific adaptor (TSAd), which in turn binds c-Src at endothelial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). c-Src is implicated in phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vestweber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallez et al., 2007</xref>). VE-cadherin is the main component of endothelial adherens junctions, forming homophilic interactions between endothelial cells, and is critical in regulation of permeability in response to VEGFA as well as inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lampugnani et al., 2018</xref>). Tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin is associated with different biological functions. Thus, phosphorylation of Y658 and Y685 is associated with the control of vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>), and angiogenic sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>), and Y658 with junction stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schulte et al., 2011</xref>), whereas phosphorylation of Y731 in VE-cadherin is linked to leukocyte extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wessel et al., 2014</xref>). Serine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin at S665 is also implicated in regulation of endothelial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gavard and Gutkind, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here, the molecular mechanisms underlying vessel leakage in eye diseases were studied using mouse models deficient in the VEGFR2-TSAd-VE-cadherin pathway. Interruption of the VEGFR2 pY949F pathway resulted in suppressed vascular leakage at the choroid or at the superficial retinal vasculature in mouse models of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, respectively. Furthermore, disrupting this pathway correlated with reduced VE-cadherin pY685 levels and reduced pathological neoangiogenesis of the superficial retinal vasculature. These data identify VEGFR2 pY949 signaling as an important contributor to edema in retinopathies which may serve as a basis for development of new therapies selectively suppressing VEGFA-dependent disruption of the vascular barrier.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced vessel leakage from <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> retinopathy models</title><p>The <italic>Vegfr2<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> mouse (henceforth denoted <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic>), lacks the pY949 phosphosite of VEGFR2 and therefore fails to induce activation of c-Src. We have previously shown that <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> exhibits suppressed vessel permeability in the dermis specifically in response to VEGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>). The stringent BRB of the retinal vasculature is not expected to be regulated by VEGFA, however, in ocular disease such as retinopathy, the BRB may be broken down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Urias et al., 2017</xref>); in accordance, proliferative retinopathies are characterized by increased transvessel flow and edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campochiaro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stahl et al., 2010a</xref>).

The vascular lesions established after laser pulse disruption of the Bruch’s membrane mimic the progression of exudative age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lambert et al., 2013</xref>). The lesions develop from the choroidal vessels over the course of several days as a consequence of hypoxia and elevated production of VEGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">André et al., 2015</xref>). Choroids of CNV-treated <italic>Kdr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> mice were collected 14 days post-laser injury, a timepoint corresponding to a phase of completed neoangiogenesis and relative maturation of vessels lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">André et al., 2015</xref>). Before collection, vessel leakage from the lesions was examined by monitoring extravasation of circulating 100 nm fluorescent microspheres, a particle size selected as being the smallest that would not simply leak through fenestrated pores of the choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). After 2 min of circulation, the microspheres remaining in circulation were flushed away by cardiac perfusion and choroid tissue was collected, immunostained, and analyzed by confocal microscopy for lesion size and microsphere accumulation. Lesions were of equal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; 42038 µm<sup>2</sup> ± 2514, <italic>Kdr<sup>+/+</sup></italic>; 44399 µm<sup>2</sup> ± 3454, <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic>), still, microsphere accumulation was significantly reduced in the vicinity of <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> lesions as compared to the <italic>Kdr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).

In the OIR model, mice are exposed to 75% oxygen during postnatal (P) days 7–12 after which they are returned to normal atmosphere (21% oxygen). During the first stage, VEGFA expression is suppressed which leads to apoptosis of capillaries in the central region of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lange et al., 2009</xref>). In the second stage, retinal VEGFA expression is induced as a consequence of moving mice from high oxygen to normal atmosphere (relative hypoxia), leading to the formation of pathological neovascular tufts, characterized by being disorganized and leaky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Connor et al., 2009</xref>). To determine the role of VEGFR2 pY949 signaling in regulating leakage from neovascular tufts, 25 nm fluorescent microspheres, a particle size chosen as the smallest commercially available, were injected in the tail vein of P17 pups, and allowed to circulate for 15 min before the remaining microspheres were flushed away by cardiac perfusion.</p><p>As expected, retinas from P17 <italic>Kdr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> pups submitted to OIR had a considerable central avascular region remaining following the early phase of vessel destruction and also abundant retinal neovascular tuft formation.

Although pathological vascular tuft formation was diminished in the <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> strain, careful characterization of the vasculature in different organs of this strain has not revealed deficiencies in vessel density or morphology during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>). Of note, the improved barrier properties in the <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> vasculature do not exclude infiltration of CD68/CD45+ inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The effect of bacterial infections and wound healing properties remain to be tested. Nevertheless, based on the currently available information, we favor the notion that suppressed macromolecular leakage in response to VEGFA plays an important role in pathologies while it is dispensable in physiology. We do not exclude that leakage suppression to some extent interferes with neoangiogenesis due to the lack of a fibrinogen mesh for the new vessel to grow on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dvorak et al. (1995)</xref>. However, as leakage was suppressed in the <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> retinas in both the CNV and OIR (normalized to neovascular area) models, our data support the concept that leakage is regulated separately from angiogenesis per se. We conclude that in a range of tissues, either in the CNS or in peripheral organs, the VEGFR2 – TSAd – VE-cadherin pathway regulates vascular leakage in the context of disease, independent of angiogenesis.</p><p>A considerable strength of our study is in the use of intravenously injected microspheres to assess leakage, as we are able to address both pathological vessel growth and leakage simultaneously. This is superior to traditional methodologies using Evans blue injection, to determine the area of dye leakage over the retina surface, or measure the relative amount of dye extracted from retinas using formamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike the methodology described here, neither of these methods allow for the precise visualization of the leakage or how it relates to vessel morphology.</p><p>Studies in rodent models have suggested that a complete loss of VEGFA-induced signaling in the eye can lead to atrophy of the neural layers, which mechanistically can be explained by the presence of VEGFR2 on retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okabe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saint-Geniez et al., 2008</xref>). In rats, anti-VEGFA treatment does not lead to damage of neural cells or loss of photoreceptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that VEGFA might indeed be dispensable for the neural retina in this species. However, retrospective and long term follow-up studies in human patients treated with anti-VEGFA therapies do provide examples of rare negative side effects such as hemorrhages, potentially linked to a systemic reduction of VEGFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falavarjani and Nguyen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keir et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, anti-VEGFA treatment may contribute to the progression of geographic atrophy due to insufficient vascularization or to the fact that VEGFA may serve as a vital survival factor for the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byeon et al., 2010</xref>). Increased treatment frequency in patients receiving ranibizumab or bevacizumab is associated with greater loss of RPE, indicating geographic atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enslow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grunwald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rofagha et al., 2013</xref>). The necessity of repeated intraocular injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2013</xref>) for the administration of current anti-VEGFA therapy reduces patient compliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Polat et al., 2017</xref>) and results in rare but serious instances of eye damage caused by the injection procedure, such as endophthalmitis or retinal detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falavarjani and Nguyen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016b</xref>). Ultimately, the interaction between VEGFR2 pY949/pY951 and TSAd would be an ideal target to specifically block leakage but save other aspects of VEGFR2 biology.</p><p>The literature strongly implicates Src family kinases (SFK) in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on VE-cadherin, thereby playing an essential role in controlling vessel permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wessel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trani and Dejana, 2015</xref>). In the context of OIR, direct inhibition of c-Src activation by kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seo and Suh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Werdich and Penn, 2006</xref>), indirect inhibition of c-Src kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Toutounchian et al., 2017</xref>), or suppressed c-Src expression using siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), all result in decreased tuft formation. Here, we found that neovascular tufts displayed abundant pY418 c-Src at endothelial junctions. Although we may have expected decreased p418 c-Src levels in the <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> tufts, the levels were similar in the mutant and <italic>Kdr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates. These data indicate that while activation of c-Src alone may be required for induction of permeability and tuft formation, it may not be sufficient to induce these events. In agreement, a triggering event, in addition to c-Src activity, is needed for opening of paracellular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2016</xref>). Also, Orsenigo and coworkers detected constitutive, flow-dependent pY418 c-Src in leakage-permissive venules, but described an additional triggering event required for leakage to become established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>). Our data suggests the scenario that VEGFR2 pY949 signaling leads to close proximity and complex formation between VEGFR2 and VE-cadherin potentially involving c-Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016a</xref>), which may be activated in a VEGFR2-independent manner. A caveat in the interpretation of these data is that the pY418 antibody used to detect activated c-Src may cross-react with the related Yes and Fyn antibodies. Currently, reagents specifically recognizing only c-Src are missing.</p><p>The acute stimulation of blood vessels with bradykinin or histamine to induce leakage is linked to a strong and transient drop in VE-cadherin phosphorylation due to internalization and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>). We find that in the chronic disease models studied here, regions of greater VE-cadherin phosphorylation displayed increased leakage. The decrease in leakage observed in the <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> mice challenged with OIR or CNV, correlated with a reduction in VE-cadherin pY685 immunostaining, identifying this phosphosite as a key mediator in leakage regulation. This finding is in line with the observation that sites of leakage in a cremaster model correlated with staining for VE-cadherin pY685 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wessel et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism underlying the important role of VE-cadherin pY685 compared to pY658 in vascular permeability is not understood. The pY685 phosphosite serves as the binding site for C-terminal Src Kinase (CSK), a negative regulator of c-Src activity. CSK phosphorylates c-Src at pY527, leading to its inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Latour and Veillette, 2001</xref>). Reduced pY685 VE-cadherin levels, as seen in the <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> mice, would predict less CSK at the junction and ultimately increased c-Src activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumeister et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ha et al., 2008</xref>), which we did not observe. Moreover, CSK deletion in vitro does not alter barrier properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2010</xref>). Another important aspect of the role of VE-cadherin pY685 is its regulation of pathological angiogenesis. Notably, tuft area was decreased per se, in the VEC-Y685F mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). VE-cadherin has been implicated in regulation of VEGFR2 signaling by limiting receptor internalization. In the presence of VE-cadherin, VEGFR2 is dephosphorylated by density-enhanced phosphatase (DEP)1, thus decreasing the levels of active VEGFR2 and proliferative signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lampugnani et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesize that VE-cadherin pY685 downstream effectors are critical in VEGFR2 signaling at junctions.</p><p>The VE-cadherin Y658 site has also been identified as an integral regulator of junctional stability. Phosphorylation of the site acts to displace bound p120 catenin leading to destabilized adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garrett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schulte et al., 2011</xref>). VE-cadherin Y658 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, with low levels of shear stress leading to maximal pY658 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsenigo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conway et al., 2017</xref>). In the OIR model, tufts are known to have perturbed perfusion, which may drive the high pY658 intensity in tufts, to a similar extent in the WT and mutant models, as observed in this study.</p><p>At this point, VEGFA-targeting is the only pharmacological strategy exploited clinically and it is therefore of particular interest to understand how edema is established in response to VEGFA. Other molecular regulators of pathological leakage have been described that may operate in concert with or independently of the VEGFR2 Y949 signaling. Semaphorin 3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cerani et al., 2013</xref>), Neuropilin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fantin et al., 2017</xref>), activin-like kinase receptor type I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akla et al., 2018</xref>), angiopoietin-like 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babapoor-Farrokhran et al., 2015</xref>), VE-PTP and Tie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) have all been implicated in the control of junctional integrity in different vascular beds. Here, we provide information on the specific VEGFR2 signaling pathway leading to edema that can be tested as a readout in other systems. We also present an effective methodology to quantify leakage in relation to pathological angiogenesis, which we foresee will aid in exploration of new targets to treat retinopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic></td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms11017">10.1038/ncomms11017</ext-link></td><td/><td>C57Bl/6 background</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain;

The researcher was blinded to the genotype of the sample when performing quantifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of fluorescent microspheres in CNV</title><p>The quantity of extravasated fluorescent microspheres, marking sites of leakage, was measured in digital fluorescent images of CNV lesions from images taken with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (63X objective) equipped with single and dual fluorescence filters charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Camera settings were constant for images from all groups in each experiment. Using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD), a guassian blur filter (sigma 1) was applied to each image and a threshold was applied to the microsphere channel (405 for Blue fluorescence) using the Triangle algorithm. Microsphere area was calculated using the Analyze Particles function with an upper limit of 500 pixels to avoid the inclusion of large staining artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of fluorescent microspheres in OIR</title><p>For the OIR model, the quantity of extravasated fluorescent microspheres, marking sites of leakage, was measured in digital fluorescent images of regions of retina over 10 to 15 images in each eye taken with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (63X objective) equipped with single and dual fluorescence filters charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Camera settings were constant for images from all groups in each experiment. Using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD), the microsphere channel and IB4-vessel channel (488 for Green fluorescence and 647 for IB4) were adjusted with threshold (Huang for Ib4 and Triangle for FITC) for each channel. Extravasated microsphere area was calculated by measuring the signal in the green fluorescence channel after removing any signal contained within the ROI (region of interest) corresponding to the IB4-positive area. The Analyze Particles function was employed to quantify the microspheres. A lower limit of 10 pixels was selected to distinguish the microsphere signal from background noise. The mean area density for each group of mice was calculated from the median value of all images of the eyes of each mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuxe et al., 2011</xref>). To quantify leakage based on microscopic images, the amount of tracer extravasation was normalized to blood vessel density. The researcher was blinded to the genotype of the sample when performing quantifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of inflammatory cells in OIR</title><p>Immunostaining for CD68, CD45, and IB4 was performed on retinas from <italic>Kdr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> mice. Confocal images were analyzed using ImageJ software for the presence of inflammatory cells within neovascular tufts. For each image, the tuft area was manually outlined using the freehand selection tool and then each channel was thresholded (CD68 with Zen; CD45 with Triangle) and the positive area within these tuft regions was calculated as the percentage of total tuft area. The average of five regions per retina are presented for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad). An unpaired Student’s T test was used to compare means between experimental groups. A Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the medians between experimental groups with similar outcome. All tests were two-tailed and p&lt;0.05 was considered a statistically significant result. Values shown are the mean, with standard deviation used as the dispersion measure. Biological replicates refer to individual mice for OIR experiments and to individual lesions for CNV experiments. Independent experiments refer to experiments done in different days with independently generated material. A statistical method of sample size calculation was not used during study design. For in vivo experiments, we used an average of 6 animals per experiment, with a minimum of 3 (detailed number of animals used is given in figure legends). The investigators were blind to the genotype of the animal for data analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the expert assistance of Marie Hedlund and Pernilla Martinsson, Uppsala University, and Monica Aronsson, St. Erik Eye Hospital.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Victoria L Bautch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Smith et al. investigates the mechanism whereby vascular leak is regulated during pathological retinal angiogenesis. They find that a specific phosphorylation site of VEGFR2 (Y949) is crucial for regulating leak in vivo, and show data that supports that Tsad, which binds to Y949, and specific phosphorylation of VE-cadherin on Y685, but not c-Src, are involved in the signaling to leak downstream of VEGFR2. The strengths of the study are the use of in vivo models and readouts that provide evidence that specific genetic manipulations lead to changes in leak, and the potential impact of the work in providing focus on a specific aspect of VEGFA signaling which could prevent the side effects associated with VEGFA therapy. The lack of differential c-Src phosphorylation may be due to the limitations of the reagents, as the antibodies are thought to cross-react with other Src family kinases. The limitations of the study are associated with the fact that phenotypes in vivo are more difficult to quantify. For example, the changes in pY685 VE-cadherin (Figure 3J) in the Y949 mutant background are significant but not robust; however, the actual mutant (VE-cadherin Y685F) shows a reduction in leak (Figure 4G). The major critique centers around better explanation and/or quantification of the phenotypes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address assay variability at several levels: Better explanation of quantification assays, and where appropriate increase the n of fields analyzed and/or mice used. Please use body weight to normalize for OIR (see below). Consider reanalysis of microsphere leak for those microspheres clearly outside the vessels.</p><p>a) It would strengthen the work if the analysis protocols were more carefully explained. For example, the Materials and methods describe outlining to get areas of vascular, avascular, and tufts, but do not explain how areas where chosen for microsphere or antibody intensity analysis.</p><p>b) Microsphere analysis – it is a little difficult to interpret the overlay, but many of the spheres seem to be in or very near the tufts. Do the microspheres &quot;get stuck&quot; rather than wash out with the perfusion? It is also not clear how &quot;microsphere area&quot; is defined. It would strengthen the work to better define the quantification process, and perhaps to quantify the microspheres that are clearly not in the vessels. Likewise the quantification of the antibody intensity staining would benefit from more detail.</p><p>c) For OIR model, the body weight of mouse pups should be reported, because pups with better postnatal weight gain have less neovessel formation in OIR (PMID: 21056995). In general, at least n=8-10 mice with 3 different litters are recommended to overcome biologic variability and obtain reliable readout from OIR model. Figure 4C-D (n=4-5 mice per group) of particular concern. Other data (Figures 1D, 2E, 4G would benefit from higher n, and n for animals and fields should be clearly stated in the figure legend).</p><p>2) Tsad excision – consider more rigorous quantification of the excision, perhaps by Western blot in the lungs, and association of excision and tufts: The authors provide 2 possible explanations for their findings that TSAD iECKO and WT have similar avascular areas: these include incomplete excision of Tsad and/or that some vessel regrowth is regulated upstream of TSAd in the Y949F mutant mice. The degree of excision of TSAd is shown in a supplementary figure – some additional quantification by Western blot or some other method would be supportive and more convincing. Do the tuft regions have fewer recombined cells? This was not possible to distinguish in the figures provided.</p><p>3) We request text edits to discuss possible adverse effects of targeting the Y949 of VEGFR2 in other physiological angiogenesis or VEGFR2-dependent processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54056.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address assay variability at several levels: Better explanation of quantification assays, and where appropriate increase the n of fields analyzed and/or mice used.

Camera settings were constant for images from all groups in each experiment. Using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD), the microsphere channel and IB4-vessel channel (488 for Green fluorescence and 647 for IB4) were adjusted with threshold (Huang for IB4 and Triangle for FITC) for each channel. Extravasated microsphere area was calculated by measuring the signal in the green fluorescence channel after removing any signal contained within the ROI (region of interest) corresponding to the IB4-positive area. The Analyze Particles function was employed to quantify the microspheres. A lower limit of 10 pixels was selected to distinguish the microsphere signal from background noise. The mean area density for each group of mice was calculated from the median value of all images of the eyes of each mouse. (see [1]. To quantify leakage based on microscopic images, the amount of tracer extravasation was normalized to blood vessel density. The researcher was blinded to the genotype of the sample when performing quantifications.</p><p>Antibody intensity i.e. neovascular tuft formation and avascular area: Neovascular tuft formation and avascular area were determined by immunostaining retinas followed by image analysis. Quantification of total vascularized area, central avascular area, and tuft area was performed by outlining images manually in ImageJ. Using a tilescan of the IB4 channel for each whole mounted retina, the freehand selection tool was used to demarcate the vascular front, creating an ROI (region of interest) for the total vascularized area. The freehand selection tool was also used to outline IB4-positive vessels from neovascular tufts – regions with disorganized dilated vessels often with markedly intense IB4 staining. The ROIs for tufts were merged into a single ROI corresponding to the all the neovascular tuft area for a given retina. The tuft area normalized to the total vascularized area was reported as a percentage of the total retina that contained tufts. Similarly, the avascular region was determined using the freehand selection tool to outline the central avascular regions. Regions where the superficial layer of capillaries was absent were determined and merged to form a single ROI corresponding to all of the avascular regions for a given retina. The avascular area normalized to the total vascularized area was reported as a percentage of the total retina that was still avascular.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Microsphere analysis – it is a little difficult to interpret the overlay, but many of the spheres seem to be in or very near the tufts.

In Figures 2D, 4G and Figure 4 –figure supplement G, we now show color-coded arrows to indicate extravasated microspheres. Red arrowheads indicate microspheres inside vessels while blue indicate microspheres outside vessels. Microspheres appearing to be on the vessel wall may be inside or outside; this cannot be distinguished. In this analysis, they have been counted as inside (see response to question “Do microspheres get stuck…”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the microspheres &quot;get stuck&quot; rather than wash out with the perfusion?</p></disp-quote><p>It is quite likely that microspheres get stuck inside tufts perhaps due to the abnormal flow in these vessels. The microspheres may get stuck within the vessel or at the basement membrane. After perfusion (with 8 ml PBS), we can see remaining microspheres in tufts but never in normal vessels. For the analysis of OIR leakage, we therefore focus only on the clearly extravasated microspheres, away from the vessel wall, with any microsphere signal within the IB4 positive vessel area being removed. We have normalized the microsphere area to tuft area and therefore, the different tuft areas between wildtype and the various mutants we analyze do not affect the analyses. The difference between wildtype and mutants instead is due to that the mutants have stabilized junctions and therefore leak less. We have added a comment on the potential stickiness of the tuft vessel wall in the last paragraph of the subsection “Reduced vessel leakage from <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> retinopathy models”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) For OIR model, the body weight of mouse pups should be reported, because pups with better postnatal weight gain have less neovessel formation in OIR (PMID: 21056995).

We are aware of that the body weights influence the neovessel formation. We have now given the appropriate reference [2] (subsection “OIR”). Body weight of pups is given in Table 1.</p><p>Concerning the number of animals; we would like to emphasize that we have done many independent repeats. The litters that we generate from crossing of heterozygous recombinant animals are generally small (3-5 pups distributed in 25% wildtype, 50% heterozygous and 25% homozygous animals), and it may well be that we don’t get any homozygous pups at all. Therefore, to have as many as 8-10 x 3 mice would require very many breeding couples over lengthy periods of time to obtain up to 30 litters with sufficient numbers of wildtype and mutant pups. To have 8-10 x 3 is feasible when working with adult mice where pairing of gender and age is more important than pairing litter mates, which is essential in the OIR model. However, we certainly do our best to follow Good Research Practice (defined as research of high quality, conducted and reported in a truthful way and with respect to important societal values, and that researchers take responsibility for their research and its consequences) and had continued to collect samples and also managed to have some more litters during the revision period. The n has now been increased for Figure 2B, C and E, Figure 3C and D, Figure 4D, E and G, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1H. As a result, the statistics is considerably improved. We thank the reviewers for this request.</p><p>The number of animals now is the following:</p><p>Figure 1: n is unchanged</p><p>Figure 2B, C: n is wt=10, Y949F=14 (was 8-11)</p><p>Figure 2E: n=6-7 (was 5-6)</p><p>Figure 3C, D: n=10-15 (was 8-11)</p><p>Figure 4D, E: VEC-WT n = 8 and for VEC-Y685F n = 11 (was 4-5).</p><p>Figure 4G: n=5-7 (was 3-5)</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 1H: n=5-6 (was 3-5)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Tsad excision – consider more rigorous quantification of the excision, perhaps by Western blot in the lungs, and association of excision and tufts: The authors provide 2 possible explanations for their findings that TSAD iECKO and WT have similar avascular areas: these include incomplete excision of Tsad and/or that some vessel regrowth is regulated upstream of TSAd in the Y949F mutant mice.

We have given a comment on this fact in the subsection “pY949 signaling axis results in altered VE-cadherin phosphorylation”.</p><p>In Gordon et al., [3], Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, we provide extensive blotting data on the degree of excision of Tsad in the tamoxifen-treated <italic>Tsad<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Cdh5-CreERT2</italic> mice (about 80%).

Those comments in the text have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We request text edits to discuss possible adverse effects of targeting the Y949 of VEGFR2 in other physiological angiogenesis or VEGFR2-dependent processes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that the <italic>Vegfr2<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup> </italic>mouse exhibits reduced metastatic spread [4], improved heart function after myocardial infarction (Li et al., submitted) and in the current paper, reduced pathological angiogenesis and leakage in retinopathy models. To what extent the VEGFA-regulated vascular barrier contributes to physiology has remained an enigma. Developmental angiogenesis is unaffected by the improved barrier in the Y949F mouse [4]. It remains to be tested whether wound healing or bacterial infections are affected. However, now, we studied the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration in the wildtype and <italic>Vegfr2<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> strains. There was no difference in the degree of CD68+ and CD45+ cell infiltration. These data have been added in a new Figure 2—figure supplement 2. We comment on this result in the subsection “Reduced vessel leakage from <italic>Kdr<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic>retinopathy models” and in the Discussion, stating that inflammatory cell infiltration is not affected by the improved junction stability in the <italic>Vegfr2<sup>Y949F/Y949F</sup></italic> strain. These results suggest that the improved vascular barrier in the strains studied here preferentially acts to suppress molecular leakage. Moreover, we describe the lack of understanding on the role of vascular barrier stability to VEGFA-induced molecular leakage in physiology.
