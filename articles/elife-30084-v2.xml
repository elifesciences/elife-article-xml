motion in the cytoplasm is diffusive, which possibly limits the tempo of processes.

This effect is weaker in <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is probably caused by interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes as shown in <italic>in vivo</italic> diffusion measurements and confirmed <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified ribosomes. Ribosome surface properties may thus limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. This finding lays bare a paradox in the functioning of prokaryotic (endo)symbionts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30084.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain many proteins that constantly move about within the cell to carry out tasks that keep the cell running. A protein of average size makes contact with all the other proteins in a typical bacterial cell in a few seconds. This moving about mixes the cell’s contents, which is crucial for its survival and reproduction.</p><p>Proteins can group together, or with other molecules, to form bigger units. This grouping together depends on the properties of protein surfaces; for example, opposite electrical charges on the surfaces of proteins can cause them to group together. Grouping together proteins causes them to move around cells more slowly. Indeed the ribosome, a protein unit that constructs new proteins and is found in every known species, moves over a hundred times more slowly than the average protein.</p><p>Finding out how the total electric charge inside the cells of different species affects the mobility of proteins would give us a better idea of how fast tasks can be carried out in cells. Schavemaker, Śmigiel et al. now show that protein surface charge matters a great deal in the gut microbe <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

For example, biologists and biotechnologists often produce proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> for convenient study. Yet very positively charged proteins may bind to ribosomes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, causing experiments to fail. Using cells that shield charges better, such as <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> or <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, could solve this issue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>physicochemistry of cytoplasm</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>intracellular diffusion</kwd><kwd>ionic strength</kwd><kwd>ribosomes</kwd><kwd>protein mobility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant (ABC Volume)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poolman</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TOP-PUNT.13.006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poolman</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The diffusion coefficients of proteins in the cytoplasm depend on their net charge and the distribution of charge over the protein surface, with positive proteins moving up to 100-fold slower because they bind to ribosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many processes in biological cells depend on interactions between macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids) and thus on the ability of these macromolecules to find each other by translational diffusion. This is especially important in prokaryotes because of the virtual absence of active mechanisms of cytoplasmic transport. It is clear that macromolecules need to diffuse for cells to function. To what extent the actual rate of this diffusion matters depends on the process under consideration and is in many cases unknown. For Brownian diffusion the rate of movement is characterized entirely by the diffusion coefficient, <italic>D</italic>. The exact value of the diffusion coefficient is important to the rate of a process only if it is diffusion limited, e.g. if the necessary conformational changes in an enzyme are faster than the diffusion of reactants. Arbitrarily lowering a diffusion coefficient, e.g. by osmotic stress, can make a process diffusion limited. Examples of diffusion-limited processes are binding of tRNA complexes to the ribosome, which leads to limitation in cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klumpp et al., 2013</xref>); and the binding of barstar to barnase, which we know to be diffusion limited because the proteins are designed to have an increased association rate by electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vijayakumar et al., 1998</xref>). Because protein diffusion is influenced by the environment, we need to determine diffusion coefficients in the context of the cell.</p><p>The cytoplasm of cells is not only crowded with macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van den Berg et al., 2017</xref>) but also consists of various types of nucleic acids and &gt;1000 types of protein (see proteome analysis below); though only 50 protein types make up 85% of the cytoplasmic proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGuffee et al., 2010</xref>). Various studies report on the presence of weak and nonspecific interactions between these components. NMR studies on proteins, either in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2013</xref>) or cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Latham and Kay, 2013</xref>), reveal that there are weak interactions between <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins and proteins cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, ubiquitin, and calmodulin. In a computational study on protein interactions it was found that in <italic>E. coli</italic> more highly expressed proteins are constrained in evolution to be less sticky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levy et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that nonspecific interactions are common and consequential. The transient macromolecular interactions <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting from molecular evolution, are referred to as the quinary structure of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McConkey, 1982</xref>), and we discriminate these from the more generic nonspecific interactions that occur between molecules without coevolved interfaces.</p><p>In this study we set out to study the diffusion coefficients of proteins as a function of their surface properties and thus probe the boundary conditions for the generic nonspecific interactions. Our interest in this was piqued by four datasets from the literature. The first is the scattering of diffusion coefficients in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm around a common downward trend when they are plotted against protein molecular weight; the dataset suggests that not only size (and shape) matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mika and Poolman, 2011</xref>). Second, the diffusion coefficient of GFP is faster in the cytoplasm of osmotically-adapted <italic>E. coli</italic> cells than in osmotically-upshifted cells, even at similar cytoplasmic macromolecule volume fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konopka et al., 2009</xref>). Third, the diffusion coefficient of GFP drops much faster with cell volume (after an osmotic upshift) in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> than in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mika et al., 2014</xref>). Fourth, the slowing of diffusion in metabolic energy-depleted cells suggests changes in the dynamic structure of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). In all four cases differential interactions of proteins with their surroundings may play a role, which are grounded in the surface properties of the macromolecules. Besides (possibly) giving insight into these four phenomena, studying the dependence of mobility on protein surface properties adds to our general quantitative understanding of diffusion; complementing studies on the relation between diffusion coefficients and protein size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mika and Poolman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mika et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nenninger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mika et al., 2010</xref>), diffusion coefficients and macromolecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Konopka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mika et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mika et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Konopka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van den Bogaart et al., 2007</xref>), and the dynamic structure of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spitzer and Poolman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spitzer and Poolman, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use a set of GFP variants with a net charge that ranges from −30 to +25; we also studied two variants of +11 GFP that differ in the distribution of the charge over the surface. All diffusion coefficients were determined by fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP). We study these proteins in the bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> and the archaeon <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic>. These three organisms differ in their cytoplasmic ionic strength as shown by measurements on the dominant cation, K<sup>+</sup>: <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.2 M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shabala et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>L. lactis</italic> (0.8 M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poolman et al., 1987</xref>) (note: <italic>L. lactis</italic> used to be called <italic>Streptococcus cremoris</italic>), and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> (2.1 M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pérez-Fillol and Rodríguez-Valera, 1986</xref>); these values are dependent on environmental conditions, but the differences in potassium ion concentration likely report the differences in ionic strength in these prokaryotes. The difference in ionic strength between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic> is also reflected in the higher turgor pressure of <italic>L. lactis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mika et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GFP net charge affects its diffusion coefficient in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>We performed fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>) to determine the diffusion coefficients of surface-modified variants of GFP in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm.

For each GFP variant we plotted the histogram of diffusion coefficients over the population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The −30, –7 and 0 variants of GFP all have the same mean diffusion coefficient of 10–11 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (for table of mean diffusion coefficients see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). At +7 GFP the diffusion coefficients start to drop, down to a mean value of 0.14 µm<sup>2</sup>/s for +25 GFP.</p><p>For the +15 and+25 GFP variants we observed heterogeneous fluorescence in some cells. This ranged from a somewhat higher fluorescence at the poles to a clear ring around the outskirts of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). For +15 GFP we were able to get rid of the heterogeneities by inducing for a shorter period of time. For +25 GFP, we excluded cells with extreme heterogeneities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The cells with only slightly inhomogeneous fluorescence had similar diffusion coefficients to cells with homogeneous fluorescence and were included in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The heterogeneities are probably due to exclusion of large complexes (+25 GFP forming clusters of ribosomes) from the nucleoid (see below).</p><p>Why does the diffusion coefficient drop with net positive charge? The first thing to realize is that almost nothing in the cytoplasm of the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell truly stands still. The membrane rearranges itself continuously and the DNA has some diffusive motion and rearranges itself during the cell cycle. If +25 GFP would stick to another average sized protein it would not move more slowly than the combination of the two can diffuse. If +25 GFP were to bind some bigger complex, like β-galactosidase (~500 kDa) with a diffusion coefficient of ~1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, it would diffuse with a similar rate as β-galactosidase.</p><p>Based on a census of elements present in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells this means that for +25 GFP to diffuse with a diffusion coefficient as low as 0.14 µm<sup>2</sup>/s it needs to bind to membrane proteins, DNA and/or ribosome-mRNA complexes. For membrane proteins with 12–14 transmembrane helices in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic>, <italic>D</italic> is 0.02–0.03 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mika et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). Describing the motion of DNA with a diffusion coefficient is somewhat of a stretch, as its parts do not move freely, but apparent values of 0.000035–0.00007 µm<sup>2</sup>/s have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</xref>). In fast growing cells, we expect ribosomes and mRNA to be associated most of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanamrad et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>D</italic> is 0.04 µm<sup>2</sup>/s when a one-component model is used for fitting the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakshi et al., 2012</xref>). In another study free and bound ribosomes were discriminated and <italic>D</italic> values of 0.40 (~15%) and 0.055 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (~85%) were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanamrad et al., 2014</xref>). So membrane proteins, DNA and ribosomes-mRNA all have diffusion coefficients low enough to cause the drop in mobility of +25 GFP. Fluorescence images show that most, if not all, fluorescence is located in the cytoplasm, leaving DNA and/or ribosome-mRNA as the most likely (major) binding partners. We cannot rule out that some of the GFP binds to the membrane but we did not find evidence for it in our images of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cytoplasmic ion concentrations counteract the drop in diffusion coefficient</title><p>We also determined diffusion coefficients of the GFP variants in <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). For <italic>L. lactis</italic> the mean diffusion coefficient of −7 GFP (6.2 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) is lower than for <italic>E. coli</italic> (10 µm<sup>2</sup>/s). However, <italic>D</italic> drops less with positive net charge so that for +25 GFP the mean diffusion coefficient is higher in <italic>L. lactis</italic> (0.61 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) than in <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.14 µm<sup>2</sup>/s). This can be explained by the higher cytoplasmic ionic strength of <italic>L. lactis,</italic> reducing the affinity of positive GFPs to hypothetical negatively-charged binding partners. For <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> the drop in diffusion coefficient is even less steep, with the mean diffusion coefficient dropping from 5.5 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, for −7 GFP, to 1.9 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, for +25 GFP. The shallower drop in diffusion coefficient with net positive charge as compared to both <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> can again be explained by a difference in ionic strength. Another possible contribution to the high +25 GFP diffusion coefficient in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> is the presence of more negative proteins than in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic>, which may titrate GFP away from its slower binding partner (see proteome analysis below). We also note that in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> the diffusion coefficient of −30 GFP is higher than of −7 GFP, 10 µm<sup>2</sup>/s compared to 5.5 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, which may be caused by a less negative binding partner for GFP in <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> than in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30084.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of diffusion coefficients of surface-modified variants of GFP in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example FRAP data for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> cells expressing +25 GFP.

This coincides with the time needed to degrade most of the mRNA. Importantly, the diffusion coefficient after 20 min of rifampicin treatment is close to the value of the 30S and presumably the 50S subunit. We also find that the fluorescence of +25 GFP expressing cells becomes more homogenous after rifampicin treatment. Together, these findings indicate that the positive GFP variants bind to ribosomes, and that this is the major cause for their slow diffusion. We can’t rule out that some +25 GFP binds to mRNA, but it is not a major contributor to the decrease of +25 GFP diffusion coefficient. With reasonable confidence we also put aside two other hypotheses: (i) differential partitioning of negative and positive GFPs in different cytoplasmic phases; and (ii) formation of big clusters of positive GFPs with negative proteins. Finally, we find that the variation in diffusion coefficient between cells is smaller in the presence than in the absence of rifampicin, suggesting that part of the spread in the diffusion relates to ongoing transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Co-localization on sucrose gradients shows that +25 GFP binds predominantly to ribosomes</title><p>To substantiate our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings on the binding of positive GFPs to ribosomes, we determined whether −7 and +25 GFP co-localize with ribosomes and/or DNA on a sucrose gradient.

The protein net charge distributions of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic> go up to a value of +25, irrespective of whether we take the gene-based distributions or protein copy numbers (for <italic>E. coli</italic>), or whether we take the full or cytoplasmic proteome. The net charge distribution of <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> stops at about 0. In <italic>E. coli</italic> 35 cytoplasmic proteins have a net charge higher than +10. These consist of 18 ribosomal, 9 RNA-associated, 5 DNA-associated and 3 uncharacterized proteins. For <italic>L. lactis</italic>, with seven cytoplasmic proteins that have a net charge bigger than +10, the breakdown is similar. The only <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> protein with a net charge bigger than 0 is a ribonuclease, rnp4, with a net charge of +6. Thus, all three organisms essentially have no ‘free’ positive cytoplasmic proteins.</p><p>The drop in diffusion coefficient with increased positive charge may partly explain why the proteome is mostly negative in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic>. Positive proteins not only diffuse slowly but their binding to ribosomes might also inhibit protein synthesis, that is, by affecting the assembly or the activity of ribosomes. As mentioned, there are 18 ribosomal proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> that have a net charge of more than +10. If the findings on GFP are transferable to ribosomal proteins, then these ribosomal proteins experience a drop in diffusion coefficient of more than 5-fold. The most extreme cases, RplT and RplB, with net charges of +24 and +31, would have a drop in diffusion coefficient of 100-fold. The fact that ribosomal proteins themselves are positively charged potentially limits the rate of assembly of new ribosomes. The reason is that ribosomal proteins that have just been synthesized bind nonspecifically to the surfaces of fully assembled ribosomes, and this causes slow diffusion, lower effective protein concentrations and may affect the functioning of ribosomes. An implication of our findings is that the synthesis of cationic ribosomal proteins and the assembly of ribosomes should be highly coordinated and preferably be modular to minimize unwanted side-effects of nonspecific interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A high positive net charge is not a guarantee for binding to the ribosome. One could imagine a positive protein that is disordered before binding but ordered upon binding. The reduction in entropy reduces the binding affinity, which in turn causes the diffusion coefficient to be high. Another option is that the surface shapes don’t match even if the net charges are complementary. This would also lower the affinity and increase the diffusion coefficient.</p><p>A conundrum is encountered when we look at the proteomes of the bacteria <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic>, <italic>Blochmannia floridanus</italic>, <italic>Onion yellows phytoplasma</italic>, and <italic>Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis</italic>.

The diffusion becomes even slower when cells are exposed to an osmotic upshift. In <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> the slowdown in diffusion with increasing positive surface charge is less than in <italic>E. coli</italic> due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in diffusion coefficient is mainly caused by binding of positive proteins to ribosomes, with K<sub>D</sub> values on the order of µM; this shows that non-selected interactions need not be weak. Ribosome surface properties may thus limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. These findings are of general value due to the universal presence of ribosomes in cells. Application of these findings to bacterial (endo)symbionts lays bare a paradox in the functioning of these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains used</title><p>We use <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MG1655 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blattner et al., 1997</xref>).

The next morning the cultures had reached an OD<sub>600</sub> between 0.8–1.3, and were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1–0.16 in 50 mL of fresh medium in a 250 mL flask.

We centrifuged 44 mL of each culture at 5250 g, 20 min, 4°C. From this point onward we did all the work on ice and used cooled buffers. Pellets were suspended in 1 mL of resuspension buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM ammonium acetate plus 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), resulting in around 200–300 fold dilution of cytoplasmic content. To calculate the dilution we assumed a cytoplasmic volume 0.5 fL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015</xref>) and 8 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells in 1 mL of culture of OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.

We cooled the sample on ice in between repetitions. We added PMSF (100 mM in isopropanol stock) to the lysates to a final concentration of 1 mM.

We excited with 488 nm and recorded the emission from 500 to 600 nm (in 5 nm intervals). For the analysis we used the fluorescence emission at 510 nm. To correct for background fluorescence, we acquired spectra of 10, 20, 30% and 40% sucrose in resuspension buffer with 1 mM PMSF.

To determine the fractionation profile of DNA we layered 0.2 mg/ml DNA onto the linear sucrose gradient, except that the 2-mercaptoethanol and PMSF were omitted. The collected fractions were diluted 1:1 in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM ammonium acetate.

The justification for these assumptions are as follows. We assumed that (1) the exchange between free and bound state is much faster than the FRAP measurement. This is justified because we did not observe two-component recovery in the FRAP data. We assumed that (2) the highest diffusion coefficient of all variants in a given organism reflects the free state of GFP; justified by the fact that for <italic>E. coli</italic> the GFP diffusion coefficient levels off towards more negative charge. We assumed that (3) GFPs bind solely to ribosomes; this we have shown experimentally. We assumed that (4) the total number of binding sites on all ribosomes is higher than the number of GFPs. The first justification is that the number of binding sites is about 10<sup>6</sup> and it is unlikely that we express that many GFPs because the cell only has about 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> total proteins. The second justification is that 99% of +25 GFP appears to be bound, meaning that there are enough binding sites to bind all GFPs. We assumed that (5) the decrease of diffusion coefficient with net positive charge has the same origin in all three organisms. This assumption is plausible because all three organisms have ribosomes, and assuming the same cause for slow diffusion is the most parsimonious. Finally, we assumed that (6) the ribosome diffusion coefficient is the same in all three organisms. Here the justification is that for all three organisms −7 GFP diffusion coefficients are similar, suggesting similar crowding, for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>L. lactis</italic> the diffusion coefficient are similar also for a big protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mika et al., 2014</xref>). The consequence for violating assumption one is that there is no D<sub>eff</sub> to speak of and the whole calculation becomes irrelevant. The consequence for violating assumptions 2, 3, 5, and 6 is that the numerical values coming out of the equation will be different, with the severity of the error depending on the difference in diffusion coefficients. The consequence of violating assumption four is that there will be free GFP irrespective of affinity as there are no more binding sites to fill.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was funded by a NWO TOP-PUNT and ERC Advanced grant (ABCVolume) to BP.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Conrad W Mullineaux (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Ribosome surface properties impose limits on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome&quot; the authors have measured diffusion of a set of GFP variants with different net charge in the bacterial cytoplasm. They show that the positively charged proteins diffuse much slower than the negative ones and propose that this behavior arises from protein binding to the negatively charged ribosomes. The authors further hypothesize that such binding to ribosomes imposes evolutionary selection against positively charged cytoplasmic proteins in bacteria, possibly explaining why such proteins are rare. Finally, they discuss the case of several endosymbiotic bacteria, which apparently contain a much larger fraction of positively charged proteins. The findings of the manuscript have potentially fundamental biological importance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised several concerns related to the analysis and interpretation of the data and suggested additional experiments in order to further support authors' conclusions. These concerns must be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted.</p><p>1) Although binding to ribosomes is a plausible explanation for the observed slow diffusion of the positively charged GFP variants, it should be further confirmed by direct measurements of protein binding to purified ribosomes, using for example ITC. You should perform these experiments with both positively and negatively charged GFP constructs under well-defined physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength.</p><p>2) Further evidence is required to rule out that the slower diffusion of positively charged proteins is not due to their binding to mRNA. This could also be done using <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments as described above.</p><p>3) The discussion of protein charge distribution in endosymbionts is too long and speculative, as the authors have no experimental data for these species to support their hypothesis. This discussion should be substantially shortened.</p><p>4) The claim made in the title of the manuscript may be too strong, since the authors could not directly prove that binding to ribosomes was indeed the main reason for evolutionary selection against positively charged proteins. Toning down the title to something like &quot;Ribosome surface properties likely impose limits on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome&quot; as well as rephrasing of the Abstract seem appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Schavemaker et al. describes vary interesting observation that positively charged GFP variants show much slower diffusion in bacterial cytoplasm. This finding is novel, and it potentially has fundamental biological importance. Authors further propose that this effect could be explained by the binding of positively charged proteins to ribosomes. However, there are several serious issues related to the analysis and interpretation of the data that need to be addressed before the manuscript could be considered for publication.</p><p>1) The central claim of the manuscript is that slower diffusion of the positively charged GFP is primarily due to its binding to the surface of ribosomes. In this context, I find the interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> questionable. Authors show that treatment with rifampicin results in faster diffusion of +25 GFP, although even upon such treatment the diffusion coefficient remains well below one of -30 GFP. As far as I understand their logic, the authors assume that this increase is due to dissociation of ribosomes bound to +25 GFP from mRNA (which becomes degraded upon rifampicin treatment). Couldn't the same effect be explained by binding of +25 GFP to mRNA itself? This would not rule out that binding to ribosomes is an important factor in limiting diffusion positively charged proteins in bacteria. But unless the authors can exclude direct binding to mRNA, it may have as much effect as the binding to ribosomes, meaning that the title and the Abstract should be formulated more cautiously.</p><p>2) Subsection “GFP variants and histograms of diffusion coefficients of surface modified variants of GFP in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>”, end of last paragraph. The authors state that they did not find association of +25 GFP with the membrane, without presenting any evidence. What I find worrying is that, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, in some &quot;very heterogeneous&quot; cells +25 GFP appears to localize to the cell periphery, which might indicate binding to the membrane. Although such cells were excluded from further analysis, I think it is possible that even in cells without obvious peripheral localization some membrane binding occurs – unless the authors have some direct evidence that +25 GFP does not bind to the membrane.</p><p>3) In using the equation 1 that describes diffusion with binding, the authors make a number of assumptions. Although the assumptions are clearly specified (and plausible), I think it would be important to justify these assumptions more explicitly (e.g., assumption #1) and mention how would violation of these assumptions affect the conclusions.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>: why is GFP with zero charge not shown?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I enjoyed reading this paper, which introduces a really fresh and exciting approach to thinking about the factors that influence the effective viscosity of the cytoplasm. The idea that the majority of bacterial cytoplasmic proteins could be negatively charged to minimise interaction with ribosomes and maximise their rates of diffusion was a revelation to me. The paper reports an incisive series of experiments that provide convincing evidence that positive surface charge slows diffusion in the cytoplasm and this effect is at least largely due to interaction with ribosomes bound to RNA. The paper is well-written, and the data are well-presented. However, the authors do need to calculate p- values to confirm significant differences between the diffusion coefficients for different GFP variants and under different conditions. Otherwise the only part of the manuscript that I found unsatisfactory was the discussion of the positively-charged proteome of 4 endosymbiotic species (Abstract; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, subsection “Proteome analysis reveals potentially slow proteins”, last two paragraphs). This section raises far more questions than it answers. Here there is no accompanying data in whether cytoplasmic protein diffusion actually is slower in these species, whether the cytoplasmic pH or ionic strength is different, or whether or not the positive proteome is a general feature of endosymbionts (what about mitochondria and chloroplasts too?). And are there non-endosymbiotic bacteria out there with a positively-charged proteome? I would recommend reducing this section to a brief comment that are certain exceptions to the rule of a predominantly negatively-charged cytoplasmic proteome, that deserve further investigation in future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors have estimated the lateral diffusion coefficients (D) of a set of surface modified GFPs and have shown that in <italic>E. coli</italic> D depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein. They show that the positively charged proteins diffuse much slower than the negative ones and this behavior probably arise from their nonspecific association to the negatively charged ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Thus they claim that the presence of limited number of positively charged proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> is most probably for avoiding their crowding on the ribosome – the protein synthesis machinery of the cell. The study is certainly interesting and makes a big claim, but some results need to be clarified and established by additional experiments in order to make such conclusion.</p><p>1) The nucleoid occlusion of +25 GFP is not obvious in majority of the cells shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Why is it so?</p><p>2) Also, only 9 out of 46 cells (only 20%) showed shrinking of the nucleoid upon Chl treatment. This is somewhat strange and can be certainly improved. 1.5 h incubation may be too long; different time period of incubation should be tried to obtain higher fraction of the cells with typical chloramphenicol features.</p><p>3) The ribosomal association of the +25 GFP is shown by co-sedimentation with the ribosomes in sucrose gradient analysis. Further the Kd has been determined by indirect method as 6.7 uM. Since this data is the key to the whole study, I strongly recommend that they validate it with other method such as ITC. In fact, the authors should subject all their GFP constructs to ITC analysis for estimating affinity to the (purified) ribosomes and plot the Kd values against the net charge of the GFPs. This will allow better establishment of a link with the proteome analysis already presented here.</p><p>4) The title of the article must be changed to match the exact finding of the study. It makes an exaggerated claim that the surface property of the ribosome limits the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome, for which the authors have no direct evidence whatsoever! It will require evolution experiments where changing surface charge of the ribosome will allow spontaneous inclusion of the positive charge in various proteins. It is not even discussed adequately and mentioned in the Abstract with uncertainty 'Ribosome surface properties MAY thus limit…..'.</p><p>5) The referencing is not done properly. For ribosomal nucleoid exclusion, and also, for changes in the cell shape, ribosome and nucleoid distribution due to chloramphenicol and cephalexin treatment the authors should refer to Chai et al., JBC, 2014.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30084.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised several concerns related to the analysis and interpretation of the data and suggested additional experiments in order to further support authors' conclusions. These concerns must be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted.</p><p>1) Although binding to ribosomes is a plausible explanation for the observed slow diffusion of the positively charged GFP variants, it should be further confirmed by direct measurements of protein binding to purified ribosomes, using for example ITC. You should perform these experiments with both positively and negatively charged GFP constructs under well-defined physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength.</p></disp-quote><p>We have purified ribosomes and have analysed their ability to bind purified -7 and +25 GFP, using size exclusion chromatography. The pH and ionic strength reflect those in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We find that +25 GFP co-migrates with ribosomes whereas -7 GFP does not, confirming what we had found in the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and on cell extracts. The new data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, four additional panels. ITC is not possible because ribosomes are predicted to have multiple binding sites for +25 GFP and there will not be a unique dissociation constant, hence the ITC data will not be interpretable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Further evidence is required to rule out that the slower diffusion of positively charged proteins is not due to their binding to mRNA. This could also be done using in vitro experiments as described above.</p></disp-quote><p>Ribosome diffusion coefficients have been determined (by others) in the presence and absence of mRNA showing an increase in diffusion coefficient, from 0.04 to 0.6 µm<sup>2</sup>/s upon removal of mRNA (Bakshi et al. 2012). When we remove the mRNA, by the same method, in our diffusion measurements with +25 GFP we see a (similar) increase in diffusion coefficient from 0.14 to 0.5 µm<sup>2</sup>/s. There is not a lot of room for mRNA to do anything here as most of the change in D is already explained by change in the ribosome diffusion coefficient.</p><p>We do not rule out that +25 GFP binds to mRNA to some extent. Similarly, we find no evidence for association of +25 GFP to DNA or the membrane, and thus conclude that these are not major factors. We have made this clearer in our revised manuscript. If +25 GFP does bind to mRNA to some extent this wouldn’t take away from our claim that ribosome surface properties affect the diffusion coefficient of +25 GFP, and thus may put limits on the nature of the proteome. This simply means that other factors may also put limits on the nature of the proteome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The discussion of protein charge distribution in endosymbionts is too long and speculative, as the authors have no experimental data for these species to support their hypothesis. This discussion should be substantially shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shortened the endosymbiont discussion by more than twofold. However, there is no speculation in our discussion on endosymbionts. We merely state some facts that appear paradoxical. Surely this paradox will be resolved in time. We offer this simply as a problem to be solved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The claim made in the title of the manuscript may be too strong, since the authors could not directly prove that binding to ribosomes was indeed the main reason for evolutionary selection against positively charged proteins. Toning down the title to something like &quot;Ribosome surface properties likely impose limits on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome&quot; as well as rephrasing of the Abstract seem appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. In fact we already had the weaker claim present in the abstract. Now we have adjusted the title, and the conclusion, so that they also contain the weaker claim.</p></body></sub-article></article>
