However, for most crops it is unknown which producers and specific phenazines are ecologically relevant, and whether phenazine biodegradation can counter their effects. To better understand their ecology, we developed and environmentally-validated a quantitative metagenomic approach to mine for phenazine biosynthesis and biodegradation genes, applying it to &gt;800 soil and plant-associated shotgun-metagenomes. We discover novel producer-crop associations and demonstrate that phenazine biosynthesis is prevalent across habitats and preferentially enriched in rhizospheres, whereas biodegrading bacteria are rare. We validate an association between maize and <italic>Dyella japonica</italic>, a putative producer abundant in crop microbiomes. <italic>D. japonica</italic> upregulates phenazine biosynthesis during phosphate limitation and robustly colonizes maize seedling roots. This work provides a global picture of phenazines in natural environments and highlights plant-microbe associations of agricultural potential. Our metagenomic approach may be extended to other metabolites and functional traits in diverse ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phenazines</kwd><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>ecology</kwd><kwd>Dyella japonica</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dar</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000183</institution-id><institution>Army Research Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-17-1-0024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Dianne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI127850-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Dianne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rothschild Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dar</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006961</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GPS Division Geobiology Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dar</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-Term Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dar</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational approach quantifies the abundance of phenazine-antibiotic producing and biodegrading bacteria in diverse soil and plant-associated habitats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phenazines are heterotricyclic N-containing metabolites mainly produced by bacteria in soil and plant-root microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biessy and Filion, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mavrodi et al., 2010</xref>), though some are also important in chronic human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sismaet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wilson et al., 1988</xref>). Members of this diverse family of redox-active metabolites act as broad-spectrum antibiotics by generating toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as interfering with cellular respiration chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baron et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perry and Newman, 2019</xref>). In addition to their activity as antibiotics, phenazines can benefit their producers in other ways: promoting survival under anoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), facilitating biofilm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>) and iron acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and increasing the fitness of phenazine-producing (<italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup>) fluorescent pseudomonads in the plant rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LeTourneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mazzola et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In the context of the plant microbiome, phenazines produced by fluorescent pseudomonads have been shown to protect major crops such as wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomashow et al., 1990</xref>) and tomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin-A-Woeng et al., 1998</xref>) from disease-causing fungi and water molds. Moreover, naturally produced phenazine 1-carboxylic acid (PCA) measured in commercial wheat rhizospheres reached levels as high as 1 µg PCA per gram fresh roots, and strongly correlated with the number of cultured <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> pseudomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mavrodi et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, the effective concentration of phenazines is likely to be considerably greater within soil microenvironments. Interestingly, the pathogenic fungus, <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, was previously shown to colonize similar tomato root zones as plant-growth promoting <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> pseudomonads, where they likely compete for plant-root exudates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolwerk et al., 2003</xref>). This evidence for ‘right place at the right time’ niche overlap provides a potential hint as to how phenazines, and possibly other natural antibiotics, can limit pathogen proliferation, even at low producer abundances and in large and complex environments such as plant roots. Phenazine-producing bacteria are positively correlated with warmer and more arid soils and lower species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maestre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mavrodi et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that in a warming climate, phenazine production may impact the composition of the microbial communities associated with certain crops. However, phenazines can also be degraded and consumed by other soil bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). The balance of phenazine production and degradation will ultimately dictate the extent to which phenazines will have agricultural relevance, yet the extent to which these processes are potentially important in agricultural environments is currently unknown.</p><p>Since their discovery and characterization in pseudomonads, genomic signatures of phenazine biosynthesis have been detected in a large set of phylogenetically diverse bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadjithomas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mavrodi et al., 2010</xref>). Despite this diversity, all producer genomes contain a conserved set of core biosynthesis genes <italic>phzA/BCDEFG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biessy and Filion, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mavrodi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Together, these proteins synthesize one of two main phenazines that act as precursors for all other derivatives: PCA in pseudomonads and phenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (PDC) in most other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Phenazine chemical diversity is determined by specific auxiliary genes, which modify and decorate the core phenazine structure. These modifications can strongly affect the toxicity spectrum and function of different phenazine species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laursen and Nielsen, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diversity and phylogeny of phenazine producing bacteria assembled in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic regions containing the core phenazine biosynthesis genes in diverse bacteria.

Importantly, the ecology of these metabolites in natural and agricultural environments is poorly understood. Furthermore, it is generally unknown which bacterial clades and phenazine derivatives are naturally associated with various major crops. While current culturing-based approaches work well for readily-culturable bacteria such as fluorescent pseudomonads, their ability to select for organisms representing the full phylogenetic diversity of phenazine producers is limited. Therefore, the development of quantitative and culture-independent methods is necessary to facilitate the discovery of novel plant-microbe associations between crops and phenazine producers.</p><p>Here, we combine computational metagenomics with field and targeted laboratory experiments to quantitatively capture the global landscape of phenazine antibiotic biosynthesis and biodegradation in soil and plant-associated environments, with the aim of uncovering novel agriculturally promising, plant-microbe associations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constructing a comprehensive phenazine biosynthesis reference database</title><p>The accumulation of shotgun-metagenomic sequencing data in public repositories over the last decade has provided a rich database from which to perform global analysis of phenazine bioproduction in soil and crop environments. Importantly, metagenomic data are particularly suitable for mining new associations between novel phenazine producers and major crops.</p><p>Because all known phenazine producers contain the core phenazine biosynthesis genes, <italic>phzA/BCDEFG</italic>, almost always in single-copy, we reasoned that given a sufficiently broad database of these proteins, we could accurately identify and enumerate the levels of <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria via shotgun-metagenomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We constructed a comprehensive <italic>phzA/BCDEFG</italic> reference gene set by mining the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG), IMG-ABC biosynthetic gene cluster atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadjithomas et al., 2015</xref>), as well as by conducting iterative homology searches. During this analysis, we noticed that highly similar copies of the <italic>phzC</italic> gene were common in non-producer genomes and therefore removed this gene from our analysis. In total, we assembled a list of 181 phenazine producer genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The final reference set contained 100 proteobacterial and 81 actinobacterial genomes representing a total of 15 phylogenetic Orders, exemplifying the diversity of phenazine producers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>To explore the evolutionary relationships between different <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using the above concatenated core-biosynthesis sequences. Notably, species organization in this tree substantially differ from the known phylogenetic relationship of <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria in our database. While <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species are highly clustered, other clades form surprising groupings. For example, phenazine-biosynthesis actinobacterial sequences of the Micrococcales order (e.g., <italic>Brevibacterium linens</italic>) are more similar to those from proteobacteria of the Enterobacterales, Myxococcales and Vibrionales orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, Burkholderiales and Xanthomonadales are both embedded deep within the actinobacterial part of the tree rather than near other proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results support and expand on previous smaller scale analyses made with the <italic>phzF</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mavrodi et al., 2010</xref>), and suggest that multiple horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events have likely shaped the evolution of phenazine biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A quantitative approach for measuring phz<sup>+</sup> bacteria levels via shotgun-metagenomics</title><p>While metagenomic sequencing reads can be translated and mapped against the protein database described above, extracting quantitative and ecologically intuitive information about phenazine producer abundance is not trivial. One major complication is the uncertainty regarding the composition of the background bacterial community as well as other confounding factors that vary among environments. For example, different environments may contain different bacterial titers and some samples, especially those extracted from eukaryotic hosts, can contain high and variable amounts of non-bacterial DNA (host DNA, sequencing artifacts, other microbes such as Fungi, Protists, Archaea etc.). This variability in ‘effective coverage’ confounds normalization by library coverage and thus limits comparison between samples. This issue can be overcome by enumerating the total number of reads that map to bacteria. However, most environments contain substantial amounts of bacterial DNA for which no reference genome exists.</p><p>Employing universal marker genes as a reference point for normalizing gene abundance was previously found to be effective in mitigating these potential issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manor and Borenstein, 2015</xref>). We therefore generated a second reference set representing ‘total-bacteria’ that is based on the bac120 genes previously used in phylogenetic classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parks et al., 2018</xref>). We selected the top 25 most ubiquitous single-copy genes in the bac120 set, all of which are estimated to appear in &gt;92.9% of known genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For each such reference gene we acquired ~25,000 protein sequences from a comprehensive set of dereplicated genomes and assembled metagenomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parks et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these reference genes distill a metagenomic signal representing ‘total-bacteria’ in a manner that is robust to variation in community composition and stochastic parameters such as host DNA contamination.</p><p>We devised a computational procedure for estimating the percentage of <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria out of all bacteria in a microbiome of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this approach, translated metagenomic sequencing reads are first mapped to a merged protein database that contains both phenazine biosynthesis and the ‘total-bacteria’ reference genes. For every gene (phenazine or reference) total read counts are normalized by the average gene size. A ‘total-bacteria’ score is then calculated by taking the median, size-normalized signal across all 25 reference genes. A similar median score is calculated across the six phenazine biosynthesis genes (merging <italic>phzA</italic> and <italic>phzB</italic>, which share highly similar sequences). Using the median in this analysis rather than the average provides robustness to non-specific signal (for example, cases where only one or two of the genes are highly abundant). The fraction of <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria is calculated by dividing the phenazine-specific score by the total-bacteria score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A method for estimating the abundance of phz+ bacteria using shotgun-metagenomics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the computational approach.

For each condition (e.g., 1% <italic>Pseudomonas phz</italic><sup>+</sup> with a total library of 10 million reads) we conducted a dozen technical replicates, resulting a total of 1296 simulated communities. In addition, for each such technical replicate, the abundance of each non-producer species was randomly re-generated each time to better mimic natural variations.</p><p>Because environmental samples may contain <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria with <italic>phzA/BDEFG</italic> protein sequences that are somewhat different from those in our reference set, we first tested the specificity of our approach at increasingly loose mapping stringencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, we find strong and agreement between the ‘ground-truth’ producer levels and the results obtained using our approach, even at a mapping threshold of 80% amino-acid identity. These results indicate that this method has the potential to accommodate new genomes with substantial sequence variation, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; R = 0.99; Pearson). Importantly, our simulations capture the total <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria level even in communities that contain more than one producer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the relative proportions of these different <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria are measured with low error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). In addition, our approach could identify as little as 0.1% <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria, even in relatively low coverage metagenomic samples (5–10M reads) and detected no producers in any of the negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In principle this approach should be readily generalizable to study other genes and functions beyond phenazine biosynthesis.

Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, we find similar induction of phenazine biosynthesis in phosphate limited <italic>D. japonica</italic> cultures, even after only 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>D. japonica</italic> robustly colonizes maize seedling roots in a gnotobiotic laboratory model</title><p>Our metagenomic analyses above identified <italic>Dyella</italic> in the rhizospheres of multiple crop species with the highest abundance in maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To validate and characterize <italic>D. japonica</italic> plant colonization patterns in this staple crop, we used a gnotobiotic seedling model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Niu et al., 2017</xref>).

We developed and field-validated a computational method to analyze &gt;800 metagenomes from across the world and show that phenazine biosynthesis is a highly prevalent trait that is enriched in plant microbiomes relative to bulk soils. In contrast, known phenazine biodegradation genes are rarely detected in these environments. Our data highlight new and potentially important associations between specific <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacterial clades and several major crops. We experimentally validate a novel and frequent association between maize and <italic>D. japonica</italic>, identifying bioactive phenazines produced by this bacterium as well as genetic and environmental factors involved in their regulation. Furthermore, we show that <italic>D. japonica</italic> is a robust maize seedling colonizer that occupies the root interior and root hair tips.</p><p>While the majority of research on phenazine production has been in pseudomonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chincholkar and Thomashow, 2013</xref>), our study demonstrates that most crops and agricultural soils are colonized by different <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria, the most common of which are <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. Notably, our analysis discovered that <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Streptomyces</italic> occur even in relatively well-studied environments such as the Inland Pacific Northwest wheat fields, where pseudomonads have been considered to be the main producers. It has long been known that <italic>Streptomyces</italic> bacteria synthesize highly bioactive metabolites and antibiotics, including phenazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turner and Messenger, 1986</xref>), and some have been characterized as important residents of the plant-root microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rey and Dumas, 2017</xref>). Indeed, our data suggest that particular <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species are more common in plant rhizospheres compared with bulk soils. Notably, many of these species carried the mevalonate pathway operon involved in synthesizing prenylated phenazines (e.g., endophenazines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saleh et al., 2009</xref>). The potential roles of prenylated phenazines in bacterial physiology, root colonization and/or pathogen inhibition are completely unknown and represent an exciting research direction. Our data suggest that prenylated phenazines could be common in the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> rhizosphere, presenting an attractive model system for studying these metabolites, in planta. That phenazine degradation genes are generally more scarce than phenazine production genes, with some notable exceptions (<italic>e.g.</italic> switchgrass rhizospheres), suggests that phenazines might be expected to rise in abundance in certain crop soils as the climate warms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maestre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mavrodi et al., 2012</xref>); direct measurements of phenazine concentrations in soils will be needed to test this prediction.</p><p>The identification of <italic>D. japonica</italic> as the most abundant <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria in our global analysis was our most unexpected and striking result. This recently discovered bacterium was found almost exclusively in plant rhizosphere samples and was highly enriched in citrus, sugarcane and maize crops, where it reached up to 2.7% of the entire microbiome (~7 fold higher than our measured <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in wheat). <italic>D. japonica</italic> is a robust seedling mono-colonizer that appears to accumulate within the root interior as well as the root hair tips, where root exudates levels are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canarini et al., 2019</xref>). Further experiments in soil-grown maize will be needed to further establish the relevance of these colonization patterns. Notably, <italic>D. japonica</italic> can produce the highly toxic phenazine myxin, and upregulates phenazine production when limited for phosphate—an environmental stress likely to become more common as phosphorus fertilizers become scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cordell et al., 2009</xref>). Intriguingly, a mutant deficient in phenazine biosynthesis exhibited somewhat greater plant colonization than the wild type in this model. Because phenazines can have a fitness cost under some conditions in isogenic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meirelles and Newman, 2018</xref>), this result is perhaps unsurprising. Moreover, based on the physiological functions of phenazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chincholkar and Thomashow, 2013</xref>), we would expect any fitness advantage due to phenazine production to manifest at a later stage of growth, be the phenazine producer in mono-culture or in the presence of competing organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LeTourneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mazzola et al., 1992</xref>). The natural abundance of <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>D. japonica</italic> in the microbiomes of economically important crops, as well as its bioactive phenazines suggest that this organism could have important agricultural effects.</p><p>In this work, we developed and field-validated a simple process for measuring the abundance of phenazine producing and biodegrading species. The basic premise of this approach is that a measure for total-bacterial signal can be calculated using a defined set of ubiquitous, single-copy genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manor and Borenstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parks et al., 2018</xref>). This reference signal can then be used to normalize gene abundances between samples in a robust manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manor and Borenstein, 2015</xref>). We use the fact that phenazine biosynthesis genes almost always appear in a single genomic copy to interpret our data as the abundance of phenazine producers out of all bacteria in a given environment (percent producers). We note that this more ecologically intuitive interpretation is only possible when the genomic copy of a given gene can be accurately inferred. Another potential limitation of this general approach is its reliance on a database of gene sequences that might not capture all environmental sequence variants. This issue can be addressed by defining large and diverse reference sets and/or by setting looser read mapping thresholds. Potential false positive signals can arise if highly similar, yet functionally distinct genes occur in the analyzed environment. This issue is mitigated when studying biosynthesis pathways containing multiple genes, as spurious signals are more likely to be filtered. Alternatively, one could first identify protein regions that are more specific, effectively examining a combination of smaller gene marker sections instead of the whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaminski et al., 2015</xref>). While we chose to use 25 reference genes in our analysis, the high similarity in coverage between these genes within individual samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that a smaller set might be used with similar efficacy. While our approach measures the abundance of specific microbes via their DNA signatures, additional transcriptomic and/or proteomic data would be needed to measure the fraction of these bacteria that is metabolically active. Nonetheless, this approach can readily be extended to other metabolite biosynthesis pathways and functional traits of interest.</p><p>In summary, it is now well appreciated that metabolite-mediated interactions play important roles in shaping microbial communities in plant and animals. Yet our ability to leverage this knowledge in ecological settings has been limited by our ignorance of which organisms make particular metabolites in particular niches. As shown here, a culture-independent metagenomic approach can be used to spotlight potential players and traits of interest, allowing for the targeted cultivation of ecologically relevant model organisms. These discoveries open the door for basic research and downstream applications harnessing these microbes for agricultural and medical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Dyella japonica</italic> UNC79MFTsu3.2)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. japonica</italic> WT</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top">Genome IMG ID: 2556921674</td><td valign="top">WT</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Dyella japonica</italic> UNC79MFTsu3.2 <italic>ΔphzA</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. japonica ΔphzA</italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>phzA</italic> deletion mutant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Dyella japonica</italic> UNC79MFTsu3.2 <italic>ΔphzT</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. japonica</italic> ΔphzT</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><italic>phzT</italic> deletion mutant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pMQ30</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shanks et al., 2006</xref></td><td valign="top">GenBank: DQ230317.1</td><td valign="top">Plasmid for generating deletions in <italic>D. japonica</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic> S17-1)</td><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic> S17-1</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simons et al., 1996</xref></td><td valign="top">ATCC 47055</td><td valign="top">Mobilizing strain that carries the pMQ30 plasmid</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">DIAMOND v0.9.22.123</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchfink et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top">DIAMOND</td><td valign="top">Mapping translated reads to references</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Trimmomatic v0.38</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top">Trimmomatic</td><td valign="top">Read quality control</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">fastq-dump v2.9.2</td><td valign="top">NCBI</td><td valign="top">fastq-dump</td><td valign="top">Retrieve public metagenomes from SRA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene reference set construction</title><p>A database of phenazine core biosynthesis genes <italic>phzA/B</italic>, <italic>phzD</italic>, <italic>phzE</italic>, <italic>phzF</italic> and <italic>phzG</italic> was constructed by mining IMG-ABC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadjithomas et al., 2015</xref>).

To normalize between roots of different sizes, each root was patted dry and weighed and the total number of cultured bacteria was adjusted per mg root.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Imaging <italic>D. japonica</italic> colonization in planta</title><p>Seedling root systems (7 day old) colonized with <italic>D. japonica</italic> were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde 1x PBS solution overnight at 4°C and then washed 3 times using 1x PBS. Samples were then incubated overnight in 4% (vol/vol) 29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide and 0.25% (wt/vol) VA-044 hardener in 1x PBS. The following day, the root samples were moved into an anaerobic hood and left open, but covered, for 5 min to remove headspace oxygen. Capped samples were polymerized for 3 hr at 37°C in a water bath, without shaking. Gel encased roots were sectioned using a scalpel to produce 1–2 mm embedded root samples which were then cleared in a solution of 8% SDS, pH 8.0, at 37°C, for 24 hr. HCR was performed using the EUB338 probe as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DePas et al., 2016</xref>). The root sections were incubated at RT overnight in PBS 1x plus 50 µg/ml rhodamine-conjugated lectin (wheat germ agglutinin [WGA]), washed in 1x PBS and then incubated for another 24 hr in refractive index matching solution (RIMS) with 1 µg/ml DAPI. Samples were then mounted on slides in 0.9 mm or 1.7 mm CoverWell perfusion chambers (Electron Microscopy Services) with a coverslip on the top. Imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 10×/0.45-numerical aperture M27 objective. Image analysis was conducted using Imaris imaging software (Bitplane) and the FIJI distribution of ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data and software availability</title><p>The metagenomic DNA-sequencing data generated in this study were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession PRJNA634917.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Phenazines are natural antibiotics produced by bacteria, found mainly in soils and in the plant rhizosphere, that can also have beneficial effects on crops. However, the complexity of the plant-associated microbiome and the difficulty to culture microorganisms frustrate the identification of phenazine producers that might be relevant to crop health. In this elegant and well-designed work, Dar et al. explore the potential of phenazine production in natural environments using an innovative shotgun-metagenomics approach that is then validated experimentally. They first devised a computational procedure to measure phenazine producing bacteria, which was validated in silico and then used to provide a global view of phenazine biosynthesis and degradation by analyzing &gt;800 soil and plant-associated metagenomes. Based on their biogeographical metagenomic analysis they identified an abundant yet less studied phenazine-producing bacterium and proceeded to characterize its interaction with a plant host of agricultural importance. This study not only increases our appreciation of phenazine biosynthesis and biodegradation in the environment but also provides novel tools for exploring specific genes and plant-microbe associations of agricultural potential.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors make claims about horizontal gene transfer of phenazine biosynthetic operons between phyla. While these seem well-supported overall, there are a number of things unclear about the phylogenetic analysis:</p><p>a) which tree reconstruction algorithm was used? The paper refers to MUSCLE, but as far as I know this is a multiple-sequence alignment algorithm, not an algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.</p><p>b) How strong is the bootstrap support for the main branches in the tree?</p><p>c) The authors use a concatenated alignment. Have the authors checked whether the individual gene trees are congruent, to exclude e.g. recombination of phenazine operons during evolution?</p><p>2) Reference databases are used to map metagenomic reads to and thus assess the frequency of <italic>phz</italic> producers across the bacterial fraction of microbial communities. The overall approach appears sound, although I wonder how it deals with ambiguous mapping (reads that can map equally well to two or more reference sequences), as this is not explicitly explained in the paper. When mentioning that 'reads that mapped with less than 80% identity', it is also not clear whether this indicates amino acid sequence identity or nucleotide sequence identity. Also, how was this threshold determined to be optimal in terms of specificity vs. sensitivity? Finally, are there any clades of uncultivated microbes with phenazine biosynthetic capabilities that the approach could be missing?</p><p>3) For the computational analysis, why were 25 genes used from the ubiquitous single copy gene set? Does the estimate of 'total bacteria' change if you do 10 or 40? Do differences in average genome lengths alter this calculation, and is this something you need to worry about?

While these seem well-supported overall, there are a number of things unclear about the phylogenetic analysis:</p><p>a) Which tree reconstruction algorithm was used? The paper refers to MUSCLE, but as far as I know this is a multiple-sequence alignment algorithm, not an algorithm for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the MUSCLE algorithm to perform the MSA using the EMBL-EBI website. This server also provided a phylogenetic tree along with the MSA, which we included in Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) How strong is the bootstrap support for the main branches in the tree?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the original tree did not contain bootstrap values, we redid the tree reconstruction with FastTree, which infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees (Price, Dehal and Arkin, 2010). The new tree is highly similar to the original tree and indeed, the bootstrap values strongly support the original conclusions. Figure 1C was revised and now contains the new tree along with the bootstrap values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors use a concatenated alignment. Have the authors checked whether the individual gene trees are congruent, to exclude e.g. recombination of phenazine operons during evolution?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not previously check this possibility. We repeated the MSA and tree construction procedure described above for the <italic>phzF</italic> biosynthesis gene and found that this tree is congruent with the concatenated tree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reference databases are used to map metagenomic reads to and thus assess the frequency of phz producers across the bacterial fraction of microbial communities. The overall approach appears sound, although I wonder how it deals with ambiguous mapping (reads that can map equally well to two or more reference sequences), as this is not explicitly explained in the paper. When mentioning that 'reads that mapped with less than 80% identity', it is also not clear whether this indicates amino acid sequence identity or nucleotide sequence identity. Also, how was this threshold determined to be optimal in terms of specificity vs. sensitivity? Finally, are there any clades of uncultivated microbes with phenazine biosynthetic capabilities that the approach could be missing?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. Ambiguously mapped reads can be dealt with in several ways. In our analysis, using only uniquely mapped reads does not work as we must account for all reads when estimating the total abundance of <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria. We therefore aimed to randomly distribute the reads between ambiguous targets, which would not affect the relatively low-resolution phylogenetic analysis conducted in this work.</p><p>However, the reviewer’s comment encouraged us to revisit the “randomness” of our ambiguous target selection in more detail. We found that the DIAMOND top hit provided by the -k 1 option that we used is biased toward sequences that are recorded earlier in the reference database. This has no effect on the total abundance measurements and Order level phylogenetic analysis (as there is essentially no ambiguous mapping between organisms of different Orders). We revisited the higher resolution analyses, namely those in the wheat rhizosphere and <italic>Dyella</italic> vs. <italic>Lysobacter</italic> comparisons. We remapped a subset of the data with DIAMOND, but this time kept all of the hits. We reanalyzed the mapping results after randomly distributing ambiguously mapped reads across all targets. We found that this does not have any significant quantitative effect on any of the conclusions presented in the original manuscript and so kept the original reported results. The only main difference we could find was the specific <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains that were commonly represented in the rhizosphere slightly differed as reads were now also mapped to other similar strains.</p><p>We have revised the Materials and methods section to explain this in detail as well as the relevant Results section text:</p><p>Revised Materials and methods text:</p><p>“Single-end Illumina … were mapped to the protein database described above using DIAMOND with the -k 1 option, which outputs a single best hit (Buchfink et al., 2015). […] The data in the figures shows the results of using the DIANMOND -k 1 option”.</p><p>And in the relevant Results text:</p><p>“Notably, three species in our reference set comprise &gt;87% of the <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>Pseudomonas</italic> rhizosphere sequencing reads (Figure 3C). These reads mapped to multiple strains, some of which were more highly represented, including, <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> LBUM223, <italic>P. chlororaphis aureofaciens</italic> 30-84 and <italic>P. orientalis</italic> DSM 17489.”</p><p>Regarding, the 80% mapping threshold, we used amino-acids and have now made this clear in every relevant part of the manuscript text. The 80% threshold was based on testing different options during our simulations. To address this comment as well as comment number 5, we have now also conducted a cross-validation analysis that supports the threshold choice. The new data can be seen in the revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Indeed, there is a reasonable possibility that some uncultivated <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> clades are missing from our reference set. We point to this limitation in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Another potential limitation of this general approach is its reliance on a database of gene sequences that might not capture all environmental sequence variants. This issue can be addressed by defining large and diverse reference sets and/or by setting looser read mapping thresholds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the computational analysis, why were 25 genes used from the ubiquitous single copy gene set? Does the estimate of 'total bacteria' change if you do 10 or 40? Do differences in average genome lengths alter this calculation, and is this something you need to worry about? How does your work compare to other approaches assessing gene abundances per bacteria in metagenomic samples, such as MicrobeCensus?</p></disp-quote><p>We originally tested simulated data with the top 8 bac120 genes and got relatively similar results to our work with the top 25. However, we chose to increase the number of reference genes to gain more confidence when analyzing environmental metagenomes. As the analysis of ~800 shotgun-metagenomes was a computationally intensive task, we opted to use 25 rather than the entire 120 (there are ~25,000 sequences for each gene).</p><p>In retrospect, we believe that similar results would be obtained with ~10 genes. This is supported by the highly similar read coverage across the 25 genes within individual samples. The average coefficient of variation (CV) calculated for these genes is only ~21% (calculated using all ~800 samples). Since similar coverage is measured for these different genes it is quite possible that a more compact set could be used.</p><p>We have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) showing the CV distribution across all analyzed samples and now address this point in the Discussion section to enable others interested in adapting this approach to consider the possibility of using a more efficient reference set.</p><p>The revised Discussion now reads:</p><p>“While we chose to use 25 reference genes in our analysis, the high similarity in coverage between these genes within individual samples (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) suggests that a smaller set might be used with similar efficacy.”</p><p>MicrobeCensus uses a set of universal genes to estimate the average genome size in a metagenome and this metric can correct sampling biases between metagenomic samples. This is important when conducting differential gene abundances using read count values (RPK/RPKM).</p><p>In our analysis, we do not compare read sampling values between metagenomes but rather compare genes within the same community (same average genome size). From the MicrobeCensus paper: “The probability of sampling a gene from a community is inversely proportional to the average genome size of that community”. Thus, our metric should be unaffected by the average genome size bias, as far as we understand, as the genes in the same sample are sampled from the same community.</p><p>In support of this, our simulations, which suggest the approach is reasonably accurate, contain organisms with variable genome sizes. As the frequencies of individual community members are randomly generated during each simulation, the average genome size also fluctuates. Thus, we believe if our results are somehow affected by a size-dependent bias, the magnitude of this effect in our case is likely to be small.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The abundance statistic described in Figure 2A normalizes phz<sup>+</sup> genes to total-bacterial score or Reads Per Kilobase levels, a method analogous to the widely used RPKM metric used to measure gene expression which has certain pitfalls (https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/early/2020/04/13/rna.074922.120.abstract).

I would like the authors to clarify how the RPK statistic proposed here addresses this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point that using RPK and RPKM values when comparing between samples is not trivial and should be done with care. Indeed, these issues, among others are what originally encouraged us to devise a different way of comparing between samples.</p><p>In our analysis, we calculate the RPK values for phenazine and reference genes. However, we only compare these within the same sample, which is used to extract the percent <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria. This approach is robust to changes in effective coverage, which can be caused by different titers of microbiota relative to host DNA or other microbes.</p><p>To make this clearer we revised the relevant Results text, which now reads:</p><p>“While metagenomic sequencing reads can … One major complication is the uncertainty regarding the composition of the background bacterial community as well as other confounding factors that vary among environments. […] This variability in “effective coverage” confounds normalization by library coverage and thus limits comparison between samples.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The validation using simulated metagenomes is set up well but could be explained in more detail.

In 2B why is the relationship not linear between estimated and known phz<sup>+</sup>?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail and explicit examples in the Results and Materials and methods section describing the simulations. In addition, we conducted the cross-validation analysis suggested by the reviewers by constructing a new database that is without the spiked-in producer genomes. We remapped the same simulated data to this database. We then analyzed the accuracy of different thresholds (100, 95, 90, 85, 80) in estimating the levels of the missing organism. The results strongly support our choice of an 80% amino-acid identity threshold and show that it is reasonably balanced in terms of its specificity and sensitivity.</p><p>These new data are now shown in the revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>In Figure 2B, the relationship is visually a little confusing as the boxplot x-axis is not exactly proportional to the y-axis as it is categorical. The linear relationship can be seen in the high Pearson correlation value reported, and in the Figure 2E scatter plot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For the field validation, can you show a 'predicted' vs. 'experimental' phz plot? You show estimates in 3A, how do these relate to your culture-based approach? This is a key point of your study and needs a figure to demonstrate the validation.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the comparison between our new culture-independent approach and the standard culture-dependent method represents an important part of this manuscript.</p><p>In Figure 3A, we show the percentage of all <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria in the rhizosphere, as measured using our metagenomic approach and in 3B, we find that on average, only about half of these <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> bacteria are pseudomonads. The percentage calculation is only possible in the culture-independent analysis, which considers the total bacterial DNA in the environment via the universal reference genes. In contrast, the culture-dependent data specifically enumerates the <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> pseudomonads. While counting the total cultured bacteria can be attempted, the uncultured bacterial fraction, which is often quite substantial and culturing condition-dependent, is unaccounted for. Thus, each approach provides a useful piece of information that is not directly comparable. We therefore opted to use a different approach. Instead of a direct comparison, we performed a calculation that uses both metrics to see if these can be used to generate a reasonable prediction of the total bacterial counts in this environment.</p><p>To make this clearer, we revised the relevant Results text, which now reads:</p><p>“While the enrichment-culture and metagenomic approaches are not directly comparable, they can be used together to extrapolate the number of bacteria in the rhizosphere. Indeed, combining the average <italic>phz</italic><sup>+</sup> pseudomonad cfu/g with their average estimated percent out of all bacteria suggests a wheat seedling rhizosphere bacterial load of ~10<sup>9</sup> bacteria per gram roots, in agreement with other rhizosphere load estimates (Bakker et al., 2013; Mavrodi et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since the vast majority of the metagenome sample are from public data, did the authors consider the impact of DNA quality and variability in sample biomass (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25329041/)? Were any of the public samples from a longitudinal study where the impact of environmental conditions on the distribution of phz<sup>+</sup> genes could be explored?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not explicitly consider this possible source of bias in our analysis. While this parameter has the potential to affect community composition, it is also one that is difficult to control and correct for, especially using a large public datasets, in which deposited samples do not generally report the DNA quality or concentration used. While specific samples might have variable DNA quality or levels, we were generally able to analyze multiple (often dozens) of samples per environment. Thus, we believe that this potential source of bias would have an overall minor effect on the conclusions of this work.</p><p>A relevant longitudinal study would be interesting to analyze, however, we did not identify an appropriate one in this dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Although most of the reads mapped to representative genomes for pseudomonads and Streptomyces, did the authors find any off-target mapping for translated DNA reads to proteins from other gene families? Short reads can represent domains shared by phi<sup>+</sup> genes and other gene families and give rise to cross-mapping and over or underestimation. This could possibly bias the mapping counts for phi<sup>+</sup> genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is an important point which have considered throughout this work. Early on we found that PhzC had close homologues in many other bacteria and therefore removed it from our analysis to reduce false positives, as described in the Results text:</p><p>“During this analysis, we noticed that highly similar copies of the <italic>phzC</italic> gene were common in non-producer genomes and therefore removed this gene from our analysis”.</p><p>False negatives, however, are unlikely to occur in our specific case as we are using a limited protein database composed of phenazine genes and reference genes only (off targets are not presented as options).</p><p>More generally, our approach using the median coverage of 5 different phenazine biosynthesis genes, mitigates such effects. We present these issues in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Potential false positive signals can arise if highly similar, yet functionally distinct genes occur in the analyzed environment. […] Alternatively, one could first identify protein regions that are more specific, effectively examining a combination of smaller gene marker sections instead of the whole (Kaminski et al., 2015)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) What is the intuition for why phosphate limitation turns on phenazine production?</p></disp-quote><p>Fair question! We have revised the text to explain why we focused on phosphate as a variable:</p><p>“Recently, it has been suggested that redox active metabolites such as phenazines might increase phosphate solubility in soils, due to their potential to liberate absorbed phosphate from iron minerals through the process of reductive mineral dissolution (Dahlstrom et al., 2020). […] Perhaps not surprisingly, therefore, we find similar induction of phenazine biosynthesis in phosphate limited <italic>D.japonica</italic> cultures, even after only 24h (Figure 5E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Given that the authors did not include any transcriptomics experiments, there is no direct indication of what proportion of the microbes represented by the sequenced DNA fragments are transcriptionally and metabolically active in each sample. This limitation should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Discussion section to address this point, which now reads:</p><p>“While our approach measures the abundance of specific microbes via their DNA signatures, additional transcriptomic and/or proteomic data would be needed to measure the fraction of these bacteria that is metabolically active.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
