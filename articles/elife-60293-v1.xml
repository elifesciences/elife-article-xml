activates immune responses in plants, a process termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Similarly, insect eggs trigger defenses that impede egg development or attract predators, but information on the nature of egg-associated elicitors is scarce. We performed an unbiased bioactivity-guided fractionation of eggs of the butterfly <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic>. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry of active fractions led to the identification of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). PCs are released from insect eggs, and they induce salicylic acid and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, defense gene expression and cell death in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, all of which constitute a hallmark of PTI. Active PCs contain primarily C16 to C18-fatty acyl chains with various levels of desaturation, suggesting a relatively broad ligand specificity of cell-surface receptor(s). The finding of PCs as egg-associated molecular patterns (EAMPs) illustrates the acute ability of plants to detect conserved immunogenic patterns from their enemies, even from seemingly passive structures such as eggs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pieris brassicae</italic></kwd><kwd>phosphatidylcholines</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>insect eggs</kwd><kwd>plant defense</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_169278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reymond</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>166686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riezman</surname><given-names>Howard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>316030_164095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolfender</surname><given-names>Jean-Luc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plants detect the presence of phospholipids in eggs from a herbivorous insect and trigger innate immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In nature, plants are frequently confronted with microbial pathogens or herbivores, and thus have evolved an efficient immune response that mainly relies on initial detection of the attacker, followed by production of defense proteins and toxic metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuman and Baldwin, 2016</xref>). What plants perceive is the presence of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ranf, 2017</xref>). In bacteria, flagellin, peptidoglycan or medium-chain 3-hydroxy-fatty acids constitute well-studied sources of MAMPs that are sensed by specific plant cell-surface receptor-like kinases; the same is true for chitin, a structural component of fungal cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ranf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kutschera et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, oral secretions (OS) from feeding insect larvae contain herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) that trigger defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erb and Reymond, 2019</xref>). Despite the finding that OS from different insect species activate plant defenses, only a few HAMPs have been characterized chemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stahl et al., 2018</xref>). Volicitin, for example, is a fatty acid-amino acid conjugate from several chewing herbivores OS and triggers the release of plant volatile organic compounds that attract parasitic wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alborn et al., 1997</xref>). Inceptin is a proteolytic fragment of a plant chloroplast ATPase found in <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> OS and induces the production of volatiles and defense compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmelz et al., 2006</xref>). However, contrary to MAMPs, receptors for HAMPs have not yet been described.</p><p>Although a seemingly harmless developmental stage of herbivores, insect eggs trigger efficient plant defenses that include necrosis, callus formation, accumulation of ovicidal compounds and release of volatiles to attract egg predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reymond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilker and Fatouros, 2015</xref>). The large white butterfly <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> deposits batches of 20–30 eggs onto <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves, causing a large transcriptional reprogramming that is drastically distinct from the expression profile triggered by larval feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Little et al., 2007</xref>). Also, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs induce localized cell death, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA), and expression of PTI-related genes, suggesting that egg-associated molecular patterns (EAMPs) activate a response that is similar to the response induced by microbial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Little et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gouhier-Darimont et al., 2013</xref>). Studies with other Brassicaceae reported localized necrosis, SA accumulation and defense gene expression upon <italic>P. brassicae</italic> oviposition or egg extract (EE) treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruessow and Reymond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fatouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fatouros et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griese et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Brassica nigra</italic>, variation in the intensity of localized cell death was negatively correlated with egg survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fatouros et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griese et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> displays variation in the strength of egg-induced necrosis between accessions, but whether this is sufficient to reduce egg survival needs to be evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reymond, 2013</xref>).</p><p>So far, only a few EAMPs have been identified and they were found in secretions associated with eggs or in adults. Bruchins are C22-C24 long-chain α,γ-diols esterified at one or both ends with 3-hydroxypropanoic acid. They are present in bodies of cowpea weevil and induce cell division in pea pods, creating a neoplastic tissue that presumably impedes larval entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doss et al., 2000</xref>). Accessory reproductive gland (ARG) secretions covering eggs of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> trigger arrest of the parasitoid wasp <italic>Trichogramma brassicae</italic> on <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by modifying leaf surface chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fatouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blenn et al., 2012</xref>). This indirect defense response is activated by benzyl cyanide and indole, both male-derived anti-aphrodisiacs found in ARG secretions of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> and <italic>P. rapae</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fatouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fatouros et al., 2009</xref>). Proteins or peptides in oviduct secretions from the pine sawfly <italic>Diprion pini</italic> and the elm leaf beetle <italic>Xanthogaleruca luteola</italic> are responsible for oviposition-induced volatile emission in pine needle and elm leaves, respectively, but their sequence needs to be characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meiners and Hilker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hilker et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Currently, the nature of EAMPs that induce immune responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is unknown. We previously reported that a crude <italic>P. brassicae</italic> EE (soluble fraction from crushed eggs) induced similar responses as oviposition, including ROS and SA accumulation, cell death and defense gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Little et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gouhier-Darimont et al., 2013</xref>). The eggshell was not active implying that gene-induction activity is not associated with covering secretions but is contained in the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that phosphatidylcholines (PCs) from <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs trigger SA accumulation and immune responses. We postulate that PCs represent <italic>bona fide</italic> EAMPs and that plants have evolved receptors to perceive an early stage of insect attack.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs</title><p>In order to find marker genes that we could robustly use to identify defense-inducing compounds in eggs, we performed an RNA sequencing experiment using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants on which eggs were naturally oviposited by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> butterflies and compared it with plants treated with EE. After 5 days, hundreds of genes were significantly upregulated by each treatment and their induction was highly similar between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This conserved transcriptomic signature strongly supports our previous observations that oviposition and EE treatment trigger comparable responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Amongst the most highly upregulated genes, we selected <italic>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEIN1</italic> (<italic>PR1</italic>, At2g14610), <italic>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE 13</italic> (<italic>SAG13</italic>, At2g29350), and <italic>KUNITZ INHIBITOR PROTEIN 1</italic> (<italic>TI</italic>, At1g73260), which were equally induced by oviposition and EE treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and which were initially found to be strongly responsive to <italic>P. brassicae</italic> oviposition and to treatment by EE from different insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>PR1</italic> is a known marker gene of the SA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Loon et al., 2006</xref>), whereas <italic>SAG13</italic> and <italic>TI</italic> have been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell death and defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brodersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhar et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Preliminary tests indicated that egg-derived defense eliciting compounds are of lipidic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gouhier-Darimont et al., 2013</xref>). To confirm this observation, we used Cleanascite solid-phase aqueous reagent to selectively adsorb lipids from EE. Application of the lipid-containing phase to PR1::GUS, SAG13::GUS, and TI::GUS <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> reporter lines triggered strong and localized GUS staining, similar to EE treatment. In contrast, the supernatant containing proteins and other non-lipidic molecules was not active, indicating that defense gene-inducing molecules were restricted to the lipid phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Then, we collected approximately 100'000 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs and extracted 1.1 g of total lipids with CHCl<sub>3</sub>/EtOH (1:1, v/v). The lipid fraction (LF) was separated onto a solid-phase extraction (SPE) C18-cartridge by elution with increasing concentration of MeOH followed by a final wash with ethyl acetate. Each fraction was tested for its ability to induce <italic>PR1</italic> expression by qPCR and compared to the defense-inducing capability of LF. Most of the inducing activity was found in the fraction that eluted with 100% MeOH (Fr. 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Fr. four was further separated by reverse-phase semi-preparative HPLC with evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) and 17 subfractions (Fr. 4.1 to Fr. 4.17) that corresponded to peaks eluting during the isocratic phase of the gradient (see Materials and methods) were collected and tested for activity. Subfractions Fr. 4.10 to 4.17 induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression, Fr. 4.14, Fr. 4.15, and Fr. 4.16 being the most active ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purification of plant-defense eliciting <italic>P. brassicae</italic> egg lipids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of defense genes <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>SAG13</italic>, and <italic>TI</italic> in response to purified <italic>P. brassicae</italic> egg lipids.

To test this hypothesis, we treated EE with phospholipase D, which preferentially cleaves the choline headgroup of PCs, and phospholipase A2, which cleaves the fatty acid in position sn-2 of phospholipids. A combined treatment with both phospholipases abolished <italic>PR1</italic>-inducing activity of EE, confirming that a phospholipid is crucial for triggering defense gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, treatment of EE with single phospholipases showed that PLA2 reduced <italic>PR1</italic>-inducing activity of EE to ca. 20% whereas PLD was less effective, probably because of the release of phosphatidic acid (PA) from PCs (see below) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Loss of the <sup>31</sup>P NMR signal for PCs and PEs in PLD/PLA<sub>2</sub>-treated sample indicated that phospholipases efficiently degraded the main lipid classes of EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To further evaluate the specific contribution of PCs to the <italic>PR1</italic>-inducing activity of EE, we reconstituted a synthetic egg lipid mix (SELM). We included the major phospholipids identified in EE and active fractions (PC, PE, TAG, DAG, LPC, LPE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) and added them at their respective concentration. Given the potential role of PA, we also added PA at the concentration found in EE. SELM application triggered <italic>PR1</italic> expression to a similar extent as EE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, when PCs were omitted from the mix (SELM-PC), no <italic>PR1</italic> expression could be detected, strongly suggesting that PCs are responsible for the observed induction. Indeed, treatment with a PC-Mix triggered <italic>PR1</italic> induction, albeit to a lower extent, which could indicate that some additional EE components are needed for a full PC response or that PCs are more potent when diluted in the EE solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PCs are active molecules in eggs</title><p>To obtain further information on the chemical nature of PCs contained in active subfractions, a MS/MS analysis was performed in positive and negative modes and precursor ion scans were analyzed. To identify fatty acyl chains, LiAc was added and loss of specific fatty acids was detected by neutral ion loss analysis. Results indicated the presence of PC(16:0/16:1) (<italic>m/z</italic> 732.39) in Fr. 4.14, PC(18:1/18:3) (<italic>m/z</italic> 782.37) in Fr. 4.13 and Fr. 4.14, PC(16:1/18:1) (<italic>m/z</italic> 758.43) in Fr. 4.14, and PC36:3 (<italic>m/z</italic> 756.40) in Fr. 4.13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The fatty acyl chains of PCs in other active subfractions could not be determined precisely due to a lack of clear fragmentation pattern. Then, to test whether pure PCs can activate defense gene expression, we applied commercially available phospholipids onto PR1::GUS, SAG13::GUS, and TI::GUS <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines. All PCs with C16 or C18 fatty acyl chains, including PC(16:1/16:1) found in very small amount in Fr. 4.13, and the abundant PC(18:3/18:3) identified by MS shotgun lipidomics, robustly activated gene expression in the three reporter lines, irrespective of the level of fatty acid desaturation. A mixture of purified PCs from chicken egg yolk was also active. In contrast, a PC with C3 fatty acyl chains, lysoPCs, PEs, lysoPEs, and sphingomyelin (SM) were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Then, to test which part of the PC molecule is important for activity, we applied different PC constituents to GUS reporter lines. The entire PC(18:1/18:1) molecule was active, as well as PA (which lacks the choline head group), whereas choline, phosphocholine, lysophosphocholine LPC(18:1/18:1) or 18:1 free fatty acid did not cause GUS staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We further evaluated the <italic>PR1</italic>-inducing activity of phospholipids found in EE. At the same concentration (1 μg/μL), PC(18:1/18:1) robustly activated <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression whereas LPC(18:1), PE(18:1/18:1), LPE(18:1), DAG(16:0/18:1), and TAG(18:1/18:1/18:1) were inactive.

Finally, treatment with 10 μg of PC(16:1/16:1), which corresponds to the amount of total PC found in 2 μL of EE used for experiments, triggered <italic>PR1</italic> expression to similar levels as EE treatment.

Since these responses are also observed after oviposition, our findings thus support the conclusion that PCs contribute significantly to the biological responses to eggs. Identification of active PCs in eggs of chewing herbivores contributes to a relatively small list of characterized EAMPs and, to the best of our knowledge, represents the only example of EAMPs that are clearly shown to originate from the egg itself. PCs are commonly found in storage lipids of insect eggs and are major components of biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bridges, 1972</xref>). Thus, like MAMPs and HAMPs, they constitute a classical example of conserved molecules present in whole classes of attackers with an essential function for these attackers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>). The observation that intact eggs or application of crude EE without wounding induce immune responses implies that PCs originate from the eggs, are released at the leaf surface and reach the extracellular space. In support of this hypothesis, we show that eggs deposited on filter paper release significant amounts of PCs. The amphiphilic nature of PCs is likely to allow diffusion through the lipidic cuticle layer and then through the hydrophilic cell wall. In addition, wounding of a leaf is not sufficient to trigger the immune responses observed after oviposition or PC application, excluding potential leaf-derived PCs as the source of inducing activity. The intact PCs and, to a lesser extent PA, induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression but not lysoPCs, choline, phosphocholine, and 18:1 free fatty acid. PA is a known endogenous signal in plant defense and can be generated from PC by PLD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). We found that PA induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression at 1 μg/μL, which is about 50x more than the PA concentration measured in EE. However, when PA was included at the concentration found in eggs in a synthetic lipid mix lacking PC, the mix did not induce <italic>PR1</italic>. We therefore conclude that PCs are the active molecules in eggs and that they may be further processed to PA in the plant. Whether this would be due to extracellular or cytoplasmic PLD activity seems unlikely since we showed that PE, which can also yield PA upon PLD hydrolysis, is not active in inducing defense gene expression. Alternatively, since the immune response induced by eggs is quite similar to the response induced by microbial pathogens, the observation that PA induces <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>SAG13</italic> and <italic>TI</italic> genes may be linked to its known signaling role during pathogenesis and not related to PC activity in response to oviposition. Further research will need to address this hypothesis.</p><p>PC levels found in a typical <italic>P. brassicae</italic> egg batch of 20 eggs correspond to ca. 10 μg (0.5 μg/egg) and application as low as 0.02 μg of PC(16:1/16:1) induced <italic>PR1</italic> expression. Although the exact amount of egg-derived PCs that reach the plant extracellular space is unknown, we showed that one <italic>P. brassicae</italic> egg batch released 0.23 μg in one day, indicating that, if this is due to a passive diffusion process, up to 1 μg can reach the plant surface after 5 days when eggs hatch. These values thus indicate that the PC amounts present at the plant surface are within the range of quantities that were shown to activate defenses. In addition, the intensity of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> responses to PC application was not always as strong as with EE treatment. As EE contains several active PCs, synergistic effects of different PCs cannot be excluded. Alternatively, EE may contain additional factors (lipid carriers, antioxidants, adjuvant) that maintain PC stability and facilitate penetration through the plant cuticle and cell wall.</p><p>When released in the extracellular space, PCs most likely interact with a plasma-membrane anchored receptor, like all presently known MAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we show here that oviposition, EE and PC treatment induce PTI-like responses and that these responses are drastically reduced in <italic>lecrk-I.8</italic>. It is thus tempting to speculate that LecRK-I.8, a member of clade I L-type LecRKs, is involved in the direct perception of PCs originating from <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs. However, the observation that PTI response is not fully abolished in <italic>lecrk-I.8</italic> suggests some level of redundancy. This is supported by the fact that the 11 highly homologous clade I LecRKs are found in two clusters in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome, rendering generation of higher order mutants technically challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellande et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, LecRK-I.8 may participate in a downstream amplification step of the egg-derived signaling pathway. Clearly, future work will be needed to understand how PCs are released from insect eggs and reach the cell surface. Moreover, binding assays with recombinant proteins will be necessary to test the role of LecRK-I.8 and related homologues.</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> responded to different PCs, but not to PEs or lysoPCs/PEs, indicating some level of specificity. Plant leaf lipids are the major source of fatty acids for Lepidoptera and these fatty acids are then incorporated into neutral lipids and phospholipids in adults and eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turunen, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turunen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blomquist et al., 1991</xref>). The dominant fatty acids found in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs from females fed on <italic>Brasssica oleracea</italic> are C16 and C18 with 0 to 3 double bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turunen, 1974</xref>), and this is consistent with our shotgun MS analysis of PCs in EE. With regard to the position of double bonds, the unsaturated fatty acyl moieties of PCs identified in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs are thus likely 18:1(n-9), 18:2(n-6), 18:3(n-3), and 16:1(n-7), which are fatty acids found in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McConn and Browse, 1996</xref>). It has to be noted at this stage that PCs are challenging to fully resolve by HPLC due to their similar physicochemical properties and full structural characterization is still challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hancock et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the exact chemical structure of all egg-derived PCs will await further development of separation and ion activation techniques. However, we found that the relative length (C16 or C18) and level of desaturation do not matter for PC activity and that the specificity of the response is due to the presence of two fatty acyl chains. The ability to recognize diverse egg PCs may be advantageous for plants as it renders the evolution of avoidance of host detection more difficult for insect pests.</p><p>In response to oviposition by the planthopper <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic>, some rice varieties produce the ovicidal compound benzyl benzoate as a direct defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seino et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, purification of female <italic>S. furcifera</italic> extracts led to the identification of two active fractions that triggered benzyl benzoate accumulation. The first one contained PC(18:2/18:2) and the second was a mix of PE(16:0/16–0), PE(16:0/18:1), and PE(18:1/18:1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Since females insert their ovipositor into stem or leaf sheath of the plant to deposit eggs, it is currently unknown whether PCs or PEs derived from the ovipositor, egg-coating secretions, or eggs. Further work should clarify the origin and specificity of active phospholipids in <italic>S. furcifera</italic> and identify downstream rice signaling components. Although we found that PEs did not activate gene expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, these results nevertheless suggest that PCs activate defense responses in both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice. Collectively, identification of active PCs in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> and <italic>S. littoralis</italic> eggs and the finding of related compounds in <italic>S. furcifera</italic> females suggests that widely divergent insect species contain similar signals that alert plants about the presence of eggs on their leaves. Furthermore, EEs from <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, <italic>S. littoralis</italic>, <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> activate <italic>PR1</italic> expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that EAMPs from different eggs activate a common signaling pathway, potentially through the perception of PCs.</p><p>It is intriguing that plants perceive egg PCs as a potential sign of future insect attack, since PCs are also constituents of plant and bacterial membranes. Although one could argue that the detection of egg-derived PCs is likely to occur in the extracellular space by a cell-surface receptor, hence providing a non-self signal to the plant, leaf-derived PCs could also be passively released upon cell damage and perceived as a sign of danger. Such ‘self’ patterns are referred to as DAMPs and are known to trigger PTI-like responses. Known DAMPs in plants include ATP, NAD(P), and cell wall fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gust et al., 2017</xref>). A perception system for extracellular PC may have been an ancestral way to detect cell damage, in conjunction with the detection of other DAMPs, which may have been co-opted to respond to oviposition. However, we did not observe SA accumulation and defense gene expression when we wounded leaves on an area equivalent to the site of EE or PC treatment. Thus, whether PCs are found in the extracellular space upon wounding and activate immune responses remains unknown and would need to be further investigated. In addition, unlike EE and PCs, wounding is not known to trigger the SA pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pieterse et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Because of their ubiquitous presence in biological membranes and storage lipids of eukaryotes, PCs from different sources might be detected by plants as conserved features from potential enemies. Strikingly, PCs can also be found in about 10% of bacterial species, including bacteria engaged in microbe-host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aktas et al., 2010</xref>). Besides insect eggs, PCs may thus also constitute MAMPs from bacterial or fungal pathogens. How and if plants discriminate PCs originating from insect eggs and bacterial pathogens is an intriguing question that deserves future investigation.</p><p>In summary, we report here the identification of PCs as EAMPs from insect eggs. PCs represent a class of conserved molecules that have the ability to trigger immune defenses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This study illustrates the sophistication of plant-herbivore interactions and expands the repertoire of patterns that plants use to recognize insect attack.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PR1</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.org/">arabidopsis.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">At2G14610</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SAG13</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.org/">arabidopsis.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">At2G29350</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TI</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.org/">arabidopsis.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">At1g73260</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">LecRK-I.8</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arabidopsis.org/">arabidopsis.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top">At5g60280</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>lecrk-I.8</italic> T-DNA</td><td valign="top">Nottingham Arabidopsis stock center (NASC)</td><td valign="top">SALK_066416</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">PR1::GUS</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SAG13::GUS</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">TI::GUS</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruessow et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>sid2-1</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nawrath and Métraux, 1999</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Acinetobacter sp.

review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Phosphatidylcholines from insect eggs activate defense responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Meredith Schuman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>This study is interesting and may represent a significant advance in our understanding of plant responses to insect oviposition. In particular, the use of appropriate bioassays, a broad set of response markers, egg extracts rather than insect extracts, sufficient structural elucidation, and transgenic lines to investigate possible plant response mediators, are all strengths.</p><p>However, the reviewers expressed three sets of concerns which must be resolved before it is clear how the data are to be interpreted, and specifically whether the claim in the title, that phosphatidylcholines from insect eggs activate defense responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, can be supported (see also comment 5). These are detailed below.</p><p>Thus we have decided to decline the manuscript in its current form, because we do not know whether these concerns can be addressed sufficiently within the usual time we allow for revisions at <italic>eLife</italic>, and because to do so may require some additional experimental work. However, should you be able to address these concerns, we would encourage you to submit a revised manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> again as a new submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have good evidence that egg-derived phospholipids largely explain the transcriptional response to oviposition and at least two associated stress responses (SA accumulation, cell death) in the <italic>P. brassicae</italic>-<italic>A. thaliana</italic> interaction, but the evidence for the specific importance of egg-derived PCs is weaker. Specifically:</p><p>1.1) PCs clearly do not account for the entire egg lipid-associated response, which the authors acknowledge and discuss.</p><p>1.2) Tests with purified PCs and PEs use chicken eggs as a source and the composition is not compared to the composition of PCs and PEs found in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs.</p><p>1.3) PLA2 also cleaves other phospholipids, as does PLD (albeit with weaker activity), and thus the phospholipase assay demonstrates the importance of phospholipids but not PCs specifically; Figure 2F is misleading and the authors should show the full lipid spectrum.</p><p>2) The authors need to test whether leaf-derived PCs (and perhaps other phospholipids, see 1) could also explain the response they observe, in which case the claim that these are &quot;EAMPs&quot; cannot be supported and this rather starts to look like a less specific damage-associated response.</p><p>3) The authors show that there are sufficient concentrations of PCs in eggs to elicit a response, but do not show that oviposited eggs actually release such concentrations to the leaf. This could in part be addressed by comparing the response of WT plants and LecRK-I.8 mutants to oviposition as well as to egg extract and an appropriate PC or phospholipid mix (again, see point 1).</p><p>4) Reviewer 1 requests that the authors document their statistical approach in the Materials and methods section (software used, testing that assumptions of statistical tests were met) and that the authors be ready to submit source data for all figures upon publication.</p><p>5) Reviewer 2 points out that the elicited response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has not been shown to defend against <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, and thus the authors should not refer to this as a defense response but might rather characterize it as an immune response.</p><p>6) Reviewer 3 notes that phosphatidic acid (PA) was not tested, while the authors' own reasoning (shown in Figure 3B) indicates that this is relevant.</p><p>We have included the individual peer reviews here for your information. However, please note that the comments above reflect the consensus of the reviewers and their common recommendation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Phosphatidylcholines are not novel oviposition-associated elicitors, but had not previously been shown to be elicitors originating from oviposited eggs. A phosphatidylcholine and three other phospholipids were previously identified by Yang and colleagues from extracts of <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> insects, https://doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2014.917266. Stahl and colleagues refer to this work in their Discussion section. In this earlier work, Yang and colleagues used bioassay-guided fractionation of female adult extracts eliciting benzyl benzoate accumulation in Oryza sativa L., and identified four similar compounds present in hundreds of ng to ug amounts per extracted female. The structure of one of these compounds was determined by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, methanolysis and GC-MS analysis and comparison with the GC-MS analysis of a standard substance, to be 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The authors then demonstrated that pure 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine in a similar concentration also elicited benzyl benzoate accumulation in rice.</p><p>The current work by Stahl and colleagues goes beyond the study by Yang and colleagues in several respects, and as a result the work of Stahl and colleagues represents a significant advance in the elucidation of egg-associated elicitors:</p><p>- Stahl and colleagues demonstrate that phospholipids from egg extracts, rather than insect extracts, elicit a plant response.</p><p>- They use multiple oviposition-associated plant responses to assess the similarity of plant responses to phosphatidylcholines, versus egg extract, rather than only a single response.</p><p>- They demonstrate that LecRK-I.8 is involved in eliciting the phosphatidylcholine-mediated plant response to egg extract, in that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> knock-outs of LecRK I.8 show a substantially attenuated response to both phosphatidylcholines (mix and pure) as well as egg extract.</p><p>Stahl and colleagues furthermore present additional evidence that it is the lipidic fraction of egg extract which is most active, and cleverly show that elimination of phospholipids using phospholipase removes fraction activity.</p><p>Prior to the invitation of this manuscript for full review, I had requested that the authors better justify their choice of marker genes and also demonstrate to the best of their ability that egg extract, which is their positive control for most of this study, elicits a response substantially similar to oviposition. They have done so, in new supplements to Figure 1 showing results from an RNA-seq experiment comparing the transcriptomic response of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants to egg extract, versus oviposition.</p><p>In summary, the work by Stahl and colleagues could represent a substantial advance in the elucidation of egg-associated elicitors and the responses they trigger in plants.</p><p>The title is well chosen if the claims can be fully supported, although the authors might consider adding the insect species name. The manuscript is well and clearly written and the figures are clearly presented. It is easy to follow the authors' experimental logic. To my knowledge, they appropriately refer to and discuss relevant literature.</p><p>The authors, however, do not describe their statistical analyses in their methods section, and this needs to be rectified. See comments below. I would also encourage them to submit all source data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The intriguing study by Stahl et al., aims to identify the molecular patterns of insect eggs that activate an immune response in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. By performing NMR, LCMS spectrometry and lipidomic analysis as well as bioactivity-guided fractionation using expression of three reporter/defence genes, the authors concluded that phosphatidylcholines (PCs), a class of phospholipids common components of cell membranes, are present in the active fractions and act as egg-associated molecular patterns (EAMPs). Although we find the study highly exciting and mostly elegantly performed, we have a few major concerns, namely:</p><p>a) whether the PCs were the only active compounds in egg extract lipid fraction;</p><p>b) that the PCs shown to be bioactive were actually not purified from the butterfly eggs (as claimed in the title and in the Discussion section);</p><p>c) that plant-derived PCs have not been tested in order to rule out whether they are likely to induce a similar response (we would need to call them then DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) instead of EAMPs);</p><p>d) whether the bioactivity of PC (16:1/16:1) is dependent on the whole molecule since lisophosphatidylcholine (released with a fatty acid by PLA2-mediated PC cleavage) and phosphatic acid (released with a choline by PLD-mediated cleavage) have been previously shown to be bioactive in plants and;</p><p>e) that the study might not be novel enough (as claimed in the abstract) as similar EAMPs were found in planthopper eggs.</p><p>Not all lipids present in the <italic>PR1</italic>-inducing subfractions 4.10-4.17 were tested, like SMs (sphingomyelins) and PEs (phosphatidylcholines). These two appear to be present in most of the <italic>PR1</italic>-active fractions but were not further evaluated for their activity as pure compounds (except the PE mix from chicken eggs). The authors motivate the focus on PCs based on the PLD + PLA2-treated egg extract that lose <italic>PR1</italic> induction (Figure 2E). PLD and PLA2 could be active also on PEs, thus PEs should still be tested as candidates. Furthermore, Figure 2F should also show the effect of PLD + PLA2 across the whole lipid NMR spectra not only on PCs. The ultimate proof that insect-derived PCs are active, should be done by testing PCs purified form the HPLC bioactive subfractions 4.10-4.17. Assuming the activity of insect egg derived PCs, the questions on their origin is still unresolved, given their ubiquity in plant cells.</p><p>Lastly, the authors claim that their results point to the conservation of phospholipid EAMPs between distantly related insect species, including moths, planthoppers or true flies. However, most eukaryotes incl. plant membranes and some bacteria contain PCs, and, in our view, it cannot be stated yet that this immunity response is specific to insect eggs. And that brings us to our last major concern that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is unlikely to have evolved such a response to defend insect eggs: neither is it a host plant for one of the tested lepidopteran species nor has it been shown to actually defend eggs, by e.g. impeding egg survival.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Stahl et al., is a continuation of published work which showed that deposition of insect eggs on <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves induces a set of defense responses known from treatments with MAMPs from microbial pathogens and DAMPs released by wounding. The authors previously also showed that induction of these responses can be mimicked by applying egg extracts (EE) and that responsiveness to EE is reduced but not abolished in mutants lacking the receptor like kinase LecRK-I.8. In the present manuscript the authors provide a comprehensive and convincing set of data that identify the active factor in EE as phosphatidylcholine (PC). Thereby, as observed for the response to crude EE, the response to PC was significantly reduced in mutants lacking LecRK-I.8. Based on these results the authors conclude that oviposition is detected via direct or indirect detection of PC by LecRK-I.8.</p><p>However, as a major concern from the side of this reviewer, this conclusion seems not justified since the authors provide no direct evidence that the response to oviposition indeed proceeds via (substantial) release of PC from the intact insect eggs on the leaf surface. A first line of evidence supporting such a process could consist in experiments demonstrating that the response to oviposition is equally dependent on LecRK-I.8 as the response to PC and EE.

The authors succeeded in addressing timely and elegantly all the concerns that we expressed in our first review with few additional experiments.</p><p>Bioassays using a synthetic egg liquid mix (SELM) confirm the link between the bioactivity of the egg extract and of PCs, ruling out a possible effect of the other components of the egg lipid fraction (LPCs, LPEs, PEs and SMs). The authors acknowledge the impossibility to fully purify PCs from insect eggs given the current state of the art. Nonetheless, they provide data that show a very similar fatty acid composition between the PCs from the <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs and the PCs derived from chicken eggs that were deployed in the bioassays.</p><p>Further, the authors provide also a more complete picture on the specificity of the PCs components that are produced by phospholipases cleavage. Besides the whole PC molecule, only phosphatidic acid (PA) shows an induction of the plant immune response, which is in accordance to previous studies. Interestingly, PA activity appears somehow lower than the whole PC, perhaps suggesting that the specificity of the elicitor bioactivity resides in other components/epitopes.</p><p>Wounding treatment was added to the different bioassays without showing any induction of the plant immune response, thus ruling out also a possible plant origin for the bioactive PCs.</p><p>The total PCs released by an egg clutch (~20 eggs) after one day were quantified in 0.23 µg. This amount is about 50x lower than the 5 µg of total PCs that were found on an EE of 20 eggs. Unlike what is stated by the authors (Discussion section), given the current data it is not yet possible to assume a daily constant rate of diffusion of 0.23 µg PCs from the egg into the plant. Thus, the use of 1 µg/µl of PCs (or derivatives) may be still higher than the amount that are present on the leaf surface under an egg clutch. Nevertheless, the authors show that PCs at as low concentration as 0.02 µg/µl are enough to induce a response, albeit weaker than the egg extract.</p><p>The authors correctly indicate that PCs are classes of molecules shared also by bacterial and fungal kingdoms, thus opening the intriguing question how and if a plant can discriminate PCs from different attacker organisms.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have good evidence that egg-derived phospholipids largely explain the transcriptional response to oviposition and at least two associated stress responses (SA accumulation, cell death) in the <italic>P. brassicae</italic>-<italic>A. thaliana</italic> interaction, but the evidence for the specific importance of egg-derived PCs is weaker. Specifically:</p><p>1.1) PCs clearly do not account for the entire egg lipid-associated response, which the authors acknowledge and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the plant responses observed after PC treatment are less strong than the ones observed after EE treatment, which could be either due to additive effects from different PCs and other phospholipids in the EE or due to additional factors in the EE (lipid carriers, antioxidants, adjuvants). To clarify the role of PCs in the egg lipid-associated response we conducted two additional sets of experiments.</p><p>a) We compared the accumulation of <italic>PR1</italic> transcript levels in response to treatment with EE, a synthetic egg lipid mix (SELM), and a pure PC-Mix. The SELM was composed of the main phospholipids found in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> EE and at similar concentration. Moreover, we included a second SELM without the PC-Mix. Interestingly, treatment with EE, SELM, and PC-Mix induced the accumulation of <italic>PR1</italic> transcript levels but the SELM without PCs failed to induce a similar response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. In our opinion this new experiment supports our conclusion that PCs are absolutely needed for the lipid-associated response that we observed in our experiments, with little or no contribution from other phospholipids, at least when the phospholipids are applied in concentrations comparable to the ones found in the EE. The new data are included in the manuscript in Figure 2G.</p><p>b) To test if other phospholipids (besides PCs) can induce a comparable response we treated plants with one synthetic phospholipid from each phospholipid class. We therefore chose phospholipids that were identified by MS analysis in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> EE. We applied the phospholipids at 1 µg/µl and measured <italic>PR1</italic> expression by qPCR. The data are included in the manuscript as a new supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). PC(18:1/18:1) robustly activated <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression but in contrast LPC(18:1), PE(18:1/18:1), LPE(18:1), DAG(16:0/18:1), and TAG(18:1/18:1/18:1) were inactive. Interestingly, PA(18:1/18:1) activated <italic>PR1</italic> gene expression as well but to a lower extent than PC(18:1/18:1), which is discussed in the corresponding sections of the manuscript (subsection “PCs are active molecules in eggs” and Figure 5 legend). Notably, a PA concentration of 1 µg/µl is more than 50x higher than the PA concentration found in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> EE. When the PA-Mix was applied in a physiologically relevant concentration together with other EE phospholipids, but excluding PCs, the mixture was inactive (Figure 2G; SELM-PC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.2) Tests with purified PCs and PEs use chicken eggs as a source and the composition is not compared to the composition of PCs and PEs found in P. brassicae eggs.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the total number of carbon atoms and the sum of the double bonds in the fatty acid acyl chains of the insect egg PCs and PEs with the fatty acid distribution of the chicken egg PC and PE mixes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The majority of PCs and PEs in the insect EE contained C16 and C18 fatty acyl chains which were also the most abundant fatty acids in the PC and PE mixes purified from chicken eggs. We therefore concluded that the use of the PC and PE mixes was reasonable to test if treatment with these phospholipid classes can activate defense gene expression.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of chemical composition of PC and PE mixes purified from chicken egg yolk and PC and PE in EE.</title><p>(A, B) Fatty acid distribution in the commercially available PC and PE mixes purified from chicken eggs used in this study (Redrawn from ‘Fatty Acid Distribution’ at: PC, https://avantilipids.com/product/840051; PE, https://avantilipids.com/product/840021).

We changed Figure 2F according to the reviewer suggestion and adjusted the description and discussion in the text (subsection “Identification of active PCs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to test whether leaf-derived PCs (and perhaps other phospholipids, see 1) could also explain the response they observe, in which case the claim that these are &quot;EAMPs&quot; cannot be supported and this rather starts to look like a less specific damage-associated response.</p></disp-quote><p>Most of the phospholipids tested in Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and Figure 5 are synthetic compounds. We therefore argue that the chemical structure of those compounds will not be different based on their origin. A potential involvement of leaf-derived PCs as damage associated molecular patterns is discussed in the answer to the main comment 3 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that there are sufficient concentrations of PCs in eggs to elicit a response, but do not show that oviposited eggs actually release such concentrations to the leaf. This could in part be addressed by comparing the response of WT plants and LecRK-I.8 mutants to oviposition as well as to egg extract and an appropriate PC or phospholipid mix (again, see point 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a potential release of PCs from the insect eggs is not shown in the manuscript. To tackle this technically challenging question, we tested the release of PCs from eggs oviposited on filter paper. Butterflies can do that when exposed to leaves covered with paper. Strikingly, we could detect the presence of PCs on pieces of paper that contained <italic>P. brassicae</italic> and <italic>S. littoralis</italic> eggs for 1 to 3 days, and the profile was highly similar to the profile identified in EE (new Figure 4). The total amount of PCs released by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> eggs during one day was 0.23 ± 0.05 mg / batch, which falls in the range of active concentrations that induce <italic>PR1</italic> expression. These data thus strongly suggest that PCs can diffuse out of the eggs and are released in sufficient amounts to trigger responses in the plant.</p><p>In addition, we also tried to address this question with the suggested experiment. We thus compared the accumulation of SA and transcript levels of <italic>PR1</italic>, <italic>SAG13</italic>, and <italic>TI</italic> in Col-0 and <italic>lecrk-I.8</italic> in response to oviposition, EE, a PC-Mix and two synthetic PCs (PC(16:1/16:1); PC(18:3/18:3)). In addition, to clarify if the observed response could be triggered by leaf-derived PCs due to damage we included a localized wounding treatment. Leaves were wounded with a one-side corrugated forceps that wounded the leaves mostly from the abaxial site, which is the site of egg, EE, and PC application. The damaged area was similar to the area of EE or PC application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Results indicate that oviposition, EE, and PC-treatment similarly induce a strong SA accumulation and upregulation of marker gene expression in Col-0 and that this response is significantly reduced in <italic>lecrk-I.8</italic>. In contrast, localized wounding does not trigger SA accumulation and marker gene expression. The new data are included in the manuscript in Figure 5A and B. These new experiments therefore support our conclusion that egg-derived PCs induce an immune response in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> after oviposition and that this response involves the receptor kinase LecRK-I.8. Although we cannot formally exclude that wounding releases PCs from plant cells, our data suggest that this is not sufficient to trigger the responses observed after oviposition or after treatment with exogenous PCs. The results and discussion on potential leaf-derived PCs are now found in subsection “PC’s can diffuse out of the eggs” and the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Forceps used (left) and site of leaf wound treatment.</title><p>The size of the corrugated wounding-surface was adjusted to the size of a 2 µl drop of EE.

These two appear to be present in most of the PR1-active fractions but were not further evaluated for their activity as pure compounds (except the PE mix from chicken eggs). The authors motivate the focus on PCs based on the PLD + PLA2-treated egg extract that lose PR1 induction (Figure 2E). PLD and PLA2 could be active also on PEs, thus PEs should still be tested as candidates. Furthermore, Figure 2F should also show the effect of PLD+ PLA2 across the whole lipid NMR spectra not only on PCs. The ultimate proof that insect-derived PCs are active, should be done by testing PCs purified form the HPLC bioactive subfractions 4.10-4.17. Assuming the activity of insect egg derived PCs, the questions on their origin is still unresolved, given their ubiquity in plant cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the concern of reviewer 2 that SMs were not tested and that the activity of PEs was just tested with a PE mix purified from chicken eggs.

However, most eukaryotes incl. plant membranes and some bacteria contain PCs and, in our view, it cannot be stated yet that this immunity response is specific to insect eggs. And that brings us to our last major concern that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is unlikely to have evolved such a response to defend insect eggs: neither is it a host plant for one of the tested lepidopteran species nor has it been shown to actually defend eggs, by e.g. impeding egg survival.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points that PCs cannot be specific to insect eggs. We reformulated the sentence (Discussion section).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that plants from the Brassicaceae (including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) respond to <italic>P. brassicae</italic> oviposition with localized necrosis, SA accumulation and defense gene expression (Bruessow and Reymond, 2007; Bruessow et al., 2010; Fatouros et al., 2014; Bonnet et al., 2017; Griese et al., 2017; Lortzing et al., 2020). In <italic>Brassica nigra</italic>, variation in the intensity of localized cell death was negatively correlated with egg survival (Fatouros et al., 2014; Griese et al., 2017). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we have observed variation in the strength of egg-induced necrosis between accessions, suggesting some ecological relevance for this response (Reymond, 2013). Preliminary observations with accessions showing strong necrosis indicate that <italic>P. brassicae</italic> hatching rate is reduced. We thus believe that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> may have evolved a defense mechanism against eggs from Pierids or other lepidopteran herbivores, but this has to be further studied in the right ecological context. We added more information in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>However, as a major concern from the side of this reviewer, this conclusion seems not justified since the authors provide no direct evidence that the response to oviposition indeed proceeds via (substantial) release of PC from the intact insect eggs on the leaf surface.
