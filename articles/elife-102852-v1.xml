The integrated stress response (ISR) serves as a critical adaptation mechanism to a variety of stresses, including those originating from mitochondria. By utilizing mass spectrometry-based cellular thermal shift assay (MS-CETSA), we uncovered that phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), also known as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP), is thermally stabilized by stresses which induce mitochondrial ISR. Depletion of PEBP1 impaired mitochondrial ISR activation by reducing eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation and subsequent ISR gene expression, which was independent of PEBP1’s role in inhibiting the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Consistently, overexpression of PEBP1 potentiated ISR activation by heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, the principal eIF2α kinase in the mitochondrial ISR pathway. Real-time interaction analysis using luminescence complementation in live cells revealed an interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2α, which was disrupted by eIF2α S51 phosphorylation. These findings suggest a role for PEBP1 in amplifying mitochondrial stress signals, thereby facilitating an effective cellular response to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, PEBP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial dysfunction</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>PEBP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Björklund</surname><given-names>Mikael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A thermal stability-based proteomic analysis identifies cytoplasmic PEBP1 as a mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction-induced stress response, highlighting its potential role in cellular adaptation mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Effective communication between mitochondria and the cytosol is vital for cellular and systemic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quirós et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>). A wide range of chronic diseases from neurodegeneration to type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>) and even many spaceflight health risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">da Silveira et al., 2020</xref>) are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. It therefore seems imperative for cells to have mechanisms to sense, integrate, and respond appropriately to mitochondrial stresses. In mammalian cells, mitochondrial dysfunction elicits an integrated stress response (ISR) in the cytosol. The main function of the ISR is to manage cellular stress and to restore homeostasis, although depending on the intensity and the duration of the stress, the ISR can also induce cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Condon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quirós et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ryan et al., 2021</xref>). ISR can be triggered by various insults including deprivation of amino acids or heme, ER stress, and viral infections, each of which activates one of the four eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinases, GCN2, heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, PERK, and PKR respectively, leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2α, encoded by the <italic>EIF2S1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). Phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to inhibition of overall translation but promotes preferential translation of specific mRNAs, such as that encoding ATF4, a transcription factor regulating redox and amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang and Proud, 2022</xref>).</p><p>While the core cytoplasmic components of ISR have been known for many years, the mechanisms relaying mitochondrial stress signals to cytoplasm to induce the ISR are only beginning to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Condon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mick et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, a proteolytic signaling cascade involving the mitochondrial proteins OMA1 and DELE1 and which converges on heme-regulated kinase EIF2AK1 (HRI) mediated eIF2α phosphorylation was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Additional stress relay mechanisms and regulators are thought to exist as, even in the absence of DELE1, some mitochondrial stresses can still promote eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Further work has demonstrated that distinct mitochondrial signals activate the ISR differentially depending on the metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mick et al., 2020</xref>) and with variable kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Condon et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, how mitochondrial dysfunction induces ISR remains an incompletely resolved question with substantial biomedical potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Genetic screens have been instrumental in identifying genes and pathways related to mitochondrial stress signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">To et al., 2019</xref>), but they may not fully capture the dynamic and complex nature of biological regulation. Mass spectrometry-based cellular thermal shift assay (MS-CETSA), also known as thermal proteome profiling (TPP), is a biophysical method that measures the thermal stability of proteins in cells or cell lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mateus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Perrin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinez Molina et al., 2013</xref>). In this assay, cells grown under different conditions are exposed to non-physiological temperatures that induce protein unfolding and precipitation. The amount of soluble protein remaining at each temperature is quantified and used an indicator of the physiological or pathological cell state. This is because thermal stability of proteins is influenced by interactions with other proteins and ligands, such nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites. Therefore, this method can provide complementary information to that from genetic screens, proteomics, and metabolomics. Furthermore, thermal stability can be informative about transitions between cell states in time scales where mRNA, total protein, or metabolite levels remain largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>By combining the MS-CETSA method with multiple metabolic perturbations induced by commonly used small-molecule inhibitors, we systematically studied alterations in potential interaction states of proteins upon metabolic stress as indicated by differences in protein stability. We now report that phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1), also known as Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yeung et al., 1999</xref>), is thermally stabilized upon induction mitochondrial ISR. Knockdown and knockout (KO) of PEBP1 attenuated mitochondrial ISR by reducing the phosphorylation of eIF2α while the response to endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by tunicamycin was not affected. PEBP1 interacted with eIF2α while Ser51 phosphorylation of eIF2α terminated this interaction. Our results demonstrate that PEBP1 amplifies the mitochondrial ISR thereby helping the cells to respond more robustly to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TPP identifies proteins responding to metabolic stresses</title><p>To systematically identify alterations in thermal stability of proteins after metabolic perturbations, we treated 143B osteosarcoma cells, a common model system to study mitochondrial functionality, with several small-molecule inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These treatments were selected to target oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos complex (C)I=rotenone, CIII = antimycin A, CV = oligomycin, uncoupler CCCP), glucose uptake (2-deoxyglucose), mitochondrial division (Mdivi-1), or cholesterol synthesis (rosuvastatin). We also included the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib as our positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miettinen et al., 2018</xref>).

We reasoned that treating intact cells with the drugs for only 30 min would allow us to observe rapid and direct effects related to metabolic flux and/or signaling related to mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of major changes in protein expression levels. We lysed the drug-treated cells and heated the lysates at 12 different temperatures below and above the median proteome melting temperature (Tm), which is ~50°C in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miettinen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarzab et al., 2020</xref>).

CDK4, which has a Tm of ~45°C, ranked as the fifth most stabilized protein in the 45–50°C pool when comparing palbociclib-treated and control cells, while in the 51–56°C pool the stabilization was not quite as strong as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

However, most of these changes are relatively small. To focus our analysis on the most significant and biologically relevant changes regardless of whether the Tm of each protein fell within the 45–50°C or 51–56°C temperature range, we aggregated the data from each protein into a single multivariate normal observation score using analysis of independent differences (AID; see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table S1</xref>).

Other proteins affected by oligomycin included BANF1, which binds DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>), and has also identified as an oligomycin stabilized protein in a previous MS-CETA experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2019</xref>), as well as mtHSP10/HSPE1, a mitochondrial heat-shock protein, suggested to be an activator of OMA1, a stress-responsive mitochondrial protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yeung et al., 2023</xref>). The top hit in the oligomycin stabilized proteome was PEBP1, an abundant cytoplasmic protein in most human tissues (based on the ProteinAtlas database; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that oligomycin affects PEBP1 independently of the inhibition of ATP synthase, we used bedaquiline, a structurally unrelated complex V inhibitor. Both oligomycin and bedaquiline increased mitochondrial membrane potential and this effect was inhibited by BAM15 (used as an uncoupler) indicating inhibition of ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both oligomycin and bedaquiline stabilized PEBP1 in a thermal shift assay indicating that PEBP1 is not an ATP synthase-independent off-target of oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, purified recombinant PEBP1 treated with oligomycin did not display thermal stabilization in an in vitro thermal shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) or in lysate CETSA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that oligomycin does not directly bind PEBP1.</p><p>Previous work has reported that oligomycin and antimycin are the most efficient electron transport chain targeting compounds in activating ISR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao et al., 2016</xref>). A 30 min treatment with antimycin A or oligomycin that stabilized PEBP1 was also sufficient to induce eIF2α phosphorylation, the core event in the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

This assay demonstrated that although PEBP1 is not necessary for HRI-mediated ATF4 reporter activation, it can amplify this HRI-induced signal. In addition, PEBP1 itself is not sufficient to induce reporter activity in the absence of HRI co-expression indicating that it acts as an auxiliary protein in the ISR signal transduction.

Since the dynamic range of P-eIF2α immunoblotting is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krzyzosiak et al., 2022</xref>), we also checked expression of ATF4 and its transcriptional target CHOP, both of which were increased by oligomycin in control, but not in PEBP1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Phosphorylation of eIF2α induced by deferoxamine mesylate (DFOM), which chelates iron and induces the ISR via the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sekine et al., 2023</xref>), was also attenuated in PEBP1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

However, this increase in phosphatase levels could not explain the reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation in PEBP1 KO cells as Sephin-1 and Raphin-1, inhibitors of PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B, respectively, did not rescue eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>).

Using data from mass spectrometry-based quantification in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>), roughly equimolar concentrations of PEBP1 and eIF2α were observed. Instead, PEBP1 is ~10–1000 times more abundant than any of the ISR kinases and ~6000 times more abundant than DELE1 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Publicly available spatial transcriptomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>) show that PEBP1 mRNA is highly expressed in most if not all mouse tissues, particularly in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given the abundances of the mitochondrial ISR signaling components and the observed reduction in eIF2α phosphorylation in PEBP1 KO cells, we reasoned that among the mitochondrial ISR signaling components, PEBP1 might most likely interact with eIF2α. However, co-immunoprecipitation assays failed to show an interaction between these proteins (data not shown). Since many protein interactions may be too weak or transient for detection by co-immunoprecipitation assay, we used NanoBiT luminescence complementation assay where a pair of interacting proteins brings the large (LgBiT) and small (SmBiT) luciferase fragments together to catalyze bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>). HEK293T cells expressing PEBP1-LgBiT displayed luminescence when co-transfected with eIF2α-SmBiT but not with an empty SmBiT vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Phorbol ester (PMA) treatment, which leads to phosphorylation of PEBP1 at Ser153, enhanced luminescence in cells transfected with WT PEBP1, but not in cells transfected with a non-phosphorylatable S153A PEBP1. This suggested a specific interaction between PEBP1-eIF2α which is enhanced by PEBP1-S153 phosphorylation. This data is consistent with the modest increase of ISR signaling by PEBP1 S153D in the ATF4 reporter assay. As a control, WB analysis demonstrated S153 phosphorylation and that expression levels of the PEBP1 and eIF2α remained unchanged by the PMA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

A phosphomimic S51D but not an S51A point mutant abolished luminescence signal suggesting that the interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2α could be terminated by S51 phosphorylation of eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, this low luminescence signal was explained by loss of PEBP1-LgBiT expression as S51D eIF2α-SmBiT expression likely mimicked ISR shutting down protein synthesis. To resolve this, we performed real-time assay of PEBP1 binding to WT and S51A mutant eIF2α after inducing ISR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation with sodium arsenite. Compared to DMSO-treated controls, arsenite treatment decreased the luminescence in cells expressing PEBP1 with WT eIF2α but not with the S51A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The lack of effect in the S51A mutant suggests that lack of S51 phosphorylation of eIF2α is indeed critical for weaking the interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2α. The S51 phosphorylation-dependent loss of protein-protein interaction is consistent with thermal stabilization of PEBP1 upon mitochondrial stress as proteins in larger complexes are generally less thermally stable. Finally, AlphaFold-Multimer analysis predicted that PEBP1 may bind eIF2α close to the S51 and the KGYID kinase recognition motif of eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting a structural basis for how PEBP1 could influence the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Taken together, these results indicate that PEBP1 acts as an amplifier of the mitochondrial ISR by interacting with eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How the intensity and duration of a stress determine the cellular stress response is complex and remains incompletely characterized. Here, we have identified that PEBP1 amplifies the ISR following mitochondrial dysfunction, but not other inducers of the ISR. Loss of PEBP1 reduced the cytoplasmic ISR as measured by eIF2α phosphorylation upon mitochondrial stress induced by oligomycin or iron chelation, both of which are mediated by the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sekine et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, PEBP1 depletion did not directly affect OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway or repression by oligomycin of genes involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mick et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that PEBP1 is not a general mediator of the effects of OxPhos inhibition. Instead, PEBP1 dynamically interacted with eIF2α suggesting a direct and specific role in modulating ISR.</p><p>Our findings raise the question ‘why do cells utilize an additional protein, PEBP1, for mitochondrial ISR activation?’. PEBP1 did not influence tunicamycin induced stress, which is mediated by the eIF2α kinase PERK. Compared to tunicamycin, mitochondrial stress signals seem to be relatively weak activators of the ISR. For example, at least in the cell types used here, oligomycin caused a less severe inhibition of global protein synthesis and weaker ATF4 induction than tunicamycin. This may reflect differential needs for stress management, where it may be more important to handle mitochondrial stress through HRI-mediated mitophagy which does not require ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakrabarty et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, we propose that PEBP1 may be required for amplifying weak stress signals, especially those that originate from mitochondria. Quantitative comparison of the signaling component amounts in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) illustrates the need for substantial amplification of mitochondrial stress signals. However, efficient signal amplification should not respond to ‘noise’. It was previously suggested that additional regulation of OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway may prevent accidental stress response induction caused by proteolytically processed cytoplasmic DELE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Signal amplification by PEBP1 may in part ensure that ISR activation results from authentic mitochondrial dysfunction. Overall, our results indicate that an efficient relay of mitochondrial stress to the cytosol via the OMA1-DELE1-HRI pathway requires PEBP1, at least in some cell types.</p><p>Mechanistically, luminescence complementation assays indicated that PEBP1 interacts with eIF2α, and that this interaction is reduced upon stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α-S51. Although our interaction data cannot explain the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α in cells expressing PEBP1, the dynamic interaction with eIF2α and the abundance of PEBP1 relative to other components of the mitochondrial ISR pathway suggests that PEBP1 may function as a scaffold protein for efficient signal transduction and amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The current evidence, based on the observations that S153D only slightly increased ATF4 reporter activity and interaction with eIF2α in the luminescence complementation assay, suggests that S153 phosphorylation of PEBP1 is not critical for amplification of mitochondrial ISR. This effectively rules out the main previously indicated mechanism of specificity in PEBP1 signaling, where S153 phosphorylation converts PEBP1 from a RAF inhibitor to a GRK2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skinner et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, induction of ISR with oligomycin, arsenite, or tunicamycin did not induce notable S153 phosphorylation based on WB analysis with the phospho-specific PEBP1 antibody (data not shown).</p><p>The identified role for PEBP1 in ISR may have broad biomedical relevance as small-molecule ISR inhibitors may potentially increase both healthspan and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derisbourg et al., 2021</xref>). Enhancing or prolonging phosphorylation of eIF2α using small molecules is now being explored for disorders associated with dysregulated ISR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). For example, ISR activation is thought to play a causative role in a wide array of cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>). Amplification of mitochondrial stress signals may be particularly important in brain and other tissues with high metabolic demands and vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction. PEBP1 is particularly abundant in the brain, where it is known as the precursor of hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">George et al., 2006</xref>). Given the crucial role of the ISR in the hippocampus for memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>), it will be important to determine whether PEBP1 plays a role in these processes and thus whether PEBP1 could be targeted therapeutically in any age-related cognitive or neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. The use of specific cell lines and the lack of functional data from in vivo experiments limit the generalizability of these findings. Apart from the detected interaction with eIF2α, our analyses are not able to pinpoint the precise mechanism by which PEBP1 enhances eIF2α phosphorylation in response to mitochondrial stresses, but not during tunicamycin-induced ER stress. While the eIF2α kinases are differently located in the cell - PERK on the ER, GCN2 on ribosomes, HRI cytoplasmic, it remains possible that there are also separate pools of eIF2α such as that present on mitochondria as recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakrabarty et al., 2024</xref>). This remains an important point for future research.</p><p>In conclusion, by identifying PEBP1 as an amplifier of mitochondrial stress signals, our study provides new insights into cytoplasmic mechanisms which ensure appropriate responses to acute mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings may have important implications for understanding mitochondrial diseases and in developing new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human cell lines 143B (CRL-8303; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_2270">CVCL_2270</ext-link>) and hTERT RPE-1 (CRL-4000; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_4388">CVCL_4388</ext-link>) were obtained from ATCC.

The MS/MS data were processed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8). Tandem mass spectra were searched against human Uniprot database concatenated with reverse decoy peptides. The peptide search allowed up to four missing trypsin cleavages with mass tolerance for precursor ions 20 ppm in the first search and 5 ppm in the main search. Mass tolerance for fragment ions was 0.02 Da. FDR was adjusted to &lt;1% and minimum score for modified peptides to 40. Sample preparation and proteomics was performed at PTM Biolabs (Hangzhou, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro protein thermal shift assay</title><p>100× SYPRO Orange Protein Gel Stain (Sigma-Aldrich, S5692) was mixed with 1 µM purified recombinant PEBP1 (Cat.No. 14582-HNAE, Sino Biological), and aliquoted it into each well of the 96-well plate in 11.5 µl total volume. 1 µl of oligomycin A were added to obtain the indicated final concentrations.

The protein abundances from the duplicate measurements were averaged for AID. This software ranks most likely shifted proteins by the logarithm of the Multivariate Normal p-value ‘log_Multiv_Norm_pval’, the descending ‘pval_count’ (i.e. in how many pools the protein shows p-value&lt;0.05), and the decreasing magnitude of ‘sum_of_signs’ (i.e. thermal stabilization or destabilization). The AID method does not explicitly use log2 fold changes, but it does consider the relative abundance of proteins compared to all other proteins under different temperature fractions. Since the largest shift for each protein can be at any temperature, this combined pooling and multivariate approach indicates the proteins with most likely changes across the range of temperatures used.</p><p>For comparing responses in real-time monitoring of luminescence complementation assays, <italic><underline>trapz</underline></italic> function in <italic>pracma</italic> package (version 2.4.4) in R was used to calculate AUC.

For comparisons with three or more groups, ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was used. All biological replicate samples were included in the analyses unless clear technical flaws were identified in the preparation of that sample. All experiments were repeated independently at least two to three times, except for proteomics and RNAseq.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-102852-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Proteomics data for the small molecules used for the MS-CETSA experiments.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-102852-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>RNAseq data has been deposited at the NCBI GEO repository (accession GSE247262).

This approach identified PEBP1 as a potentiator of Integrated Stress Response (ISR) induction by various mitochondrial stressors, although the specific dynamics vary by stressor. PEBP1 deletion attenuates DELE1-HRI-mediated activation of the ISR, independent of its known role in the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. These effects can be bypassed by HRI overexpression and do not affect DELE1 processing. Interestingly, in cells, PEBP1 physically interacts with eIF2alpha, but not its phosphorylated form (eIF2alpha-P), leading the authors to suggest that PEBP1 functions as a scaffold to promote eIF2alpha phosphorylation by HRI.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors present a clear and well-structured study, beginning with an original and unbiased approach that effectively addresses a novel question. The investigation of PEBP1 as a specific regulator of the DELE1-HRI signaling axis is particularly compelling, supported by extensive data from both genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Including careful titrations, time-course experiments, and orthogonal approaches strengthens the robustness of their findings and bolsters their central claims.</p><p>Moreover, the authors skillfully integrate publicly available datasets with their original experiments, reinforcing their conclusions' generality and broader relevance. This comprehensive combination of methodologies underscores the reliability and significance of the study's contributions to our understanding of stress signaling.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the study presents exciting findings, there are a few areas that could benefit from further exploration. The HRI-DELE1 pathway was only recently discovered, leaving many unanswered questions. The observation that PEBP1 interacts with eIF2alpha, but not with its phosphorylated form, suggests a novel mechanism for regulating the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). However, as they note themselves, the authors do not delve into the biochemical or molecular mechanisms through which PEBP1 promotes HRI signaling. Given the availability of antibodies against phosphorylated HRI, it would have been interesting to explore whether PEBP1 influences HRI phosphorylation. Furthermore, since the authors already have recombinant PEBP1 protein (as shown in Figure 1D), additional in vitro experiments such as in vitro immunoprecipitation, FRET, or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) could have confirmed the interaction with eIF2alpha. Future studies might investigate whether PEBP1 directly interacts with HRI, stimulates its auto-phosphorylation or kinase activity, or serves as a template for oligomerization, potentially supported by structural characterization of the complex and mutational validation.</p><p>Another point of weakness is the unclear significance of the 1.5-2x enhanced interaction with eIF2alpha upon PEBP1 phosphorylation, as there is little evidence to show that this increase has any downstream effects. The ATF4-luciferase reporter experiments, comparing WT and S153D overexpression, may have reached saturation with WT, making it difficult to detect further stimulation by S153D. Additionally, expression levels for WT and mutant forms are not provided, making it challenging to interpret the results. It would also be interesting to explore whether combined mitochondrial stress and PMA treatment further enhance the ISR.</p><p>Lastly, while the authors claim that oligomycin does not significantly alter the melting temperature of recombinant PEBP1 in vitro, the data in Figure S1D suggest a small shift. Without variance measures across replicates or background subtraction, this claim is less convincing. The inclusion of statistical analyses would strengthen the interpretation of these results.</p><p>Impact on the field:</p><p>The study's relevance is underscored by the fact that overactive ISR is linked to a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive disorders, a field actively being explored for therapeutic interventions, with several drugs currently in clinical trials. Similarly, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a well-established role in brain health and other diseases. Identifying new targets within these pathways, like PEBP1, could provide alternative therapeutic strategies for treating such conditions. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which PEBP1 influences ISR regulation is highly pertinent and could have far-reaching implications for the development of future therapies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102852.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, Cheng et al use the TPP/MS-CETSA strategy to discover new components for the mitochondria arm of the Integrated Stress Response. By using short exposures of several drugs that potentially induce mitochondrial stress, they find significant CETSA shifts for the scaffold protein PEBP1 both for antimycinA and oligomycin, making PEBP1 a candidate for mitochondrial-induced ISR signaling.

The authors utilize thermal proteome profiling (TPP) by which they identify PEPB1 as a thermally stabilized protein upon oligomycin treatment, indicating its role in mitochondrial stress. Moreover, RNA-sequencing analysis indicated that PEBP1 may be specifically modulating the mitochondrial stress-induced ISR, as PEBP1 knock-out reduces phosphorylation of eIF2α. They also show that PEBP1 function is independent of ER stress specifically tunicamycin treatment and loss of PEBP1 does affect mitochondrial ISR but in an OMA1, DELE1 independent manner. Thus, the authors hypothesized that PEBP1 interacts directly with eIF2α, functioning as a scaffolding protein.

We fully agree that it would have been ideal to have additional evidence related to the role of PEBP1 in HRI activation. Unfortunately, we have not been able to find phospho-HRI antibodies that work reliably. The literature seems to agree with this as a band shift using total-HRI antibodies is usually used to study HRI activation. However, with the cell lines showing the most robust effect with PEBP1 knockout or knockdown, we are yet to convince ourselves with the band shifts we see. This could be addressed by optimizing phos-tag gels although these gels can be a bit tricky with complex samples such as cell lysates which contain many phosphoproteins.</p><p>To address the interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2alpha more rigorously we were inspired by the insights you and reviewer #2 provided. While we are unable to do further experiments, we now think it would indeed be possible to do this with either using the purified proteins and/or CETSA WB. These experiments could also provide further evidence for the role of PEBP1 phosphorylation. Although phosphorylation of PEBP1 at S153 has been implicated as being important for other functions of PEBP1, we are not sure about its role here. It may indeed have little relevance for ISR signalling.</p><p>For the in vitro thermal shift assay, we have performed two independent experiments. While it appears that there is a slight destabilization of PEBP1 by oligomycin, the ultimate conclusion of this experiment remains incomplete as there could be alternative explanations despite the apparent simplicity of the assay due the fluorescence background by oligomycin only. We now provide a lysate based CETSA analysis which does not display the same PEBP1 stabilization as the intact cell experiment. As for the signal saturation in ATF4-luciferase reporter assay, this is a valid point.</p><p><bold>Response to Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>We strongly agree that CETSA has a lot of potential to inform us about cellular state changes and this was indeed the starting point for this project. We apologize for being (too) brief with the explanations of the TPP/MS-CETSA approach and we have now added a bit more detail. With regard to the cut-offs used for the mass spectrometry analysis, you are absolutely right that we did not establish a stringent cut-off that would show the specificity of each drug treatment. Our take on the data was that using the p values (and ignoring the fold-changes) of individual protein changes as in Fig 1D, we can see that mitochondrial perturbations display a coordinated response. We now realize that the downside of this representation is that it obscures the largest and specific drug effects. As mentioned in the response to Reviewer #1, we now also think that it would be possible to obtain more evidence for the potential interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2alpha using CETSA-based assays.</p><p><bold>Response to Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Thank you for your assessment, we agree that this manuscript would have been made much stronger by having clearer mechanistic insights. As mentioned in the responses to other reviewers above, we aim to address this limitation in part by looking at the putative interaction between PEBP1 and eIF2alpha with orthogonal approaches. However, we do realize that analysis of protein-protein interactions can be notoriously challenging due to false negative and false positive findings. As with any scientific endeavor, we will keep in mind alternative explanations to the observations, which could eventually provide that cohesive model explaining how precisely PEBP1, directly or indirectly, influences ISR signalling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The data overall are very solid, and I would only recommend the following minor changes:</p><p>(1) Line 187 and line 268: there is perhaps a trend towards slightly increased ATF4-luc reporter with PEBP1-S153D, but it is not statistically significant, so I would tone down the wording here.</p></disp-quote><p>We now modified this part to &quot;This data is consistent with the modest increase…&quot; .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The recently discovered SIFI complex (Haakonsen 2024, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586023-06985-7">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586023-06985-7</ext-link>) regulates both HRI and DELE1 through bifunctional localization/degron motifs. It seems like PEBP1 also contains such a motif, which suggests a potential mechanism for enrichment near mitochondria, perhaps even in response to stress. Maybe the authors could further speculate on this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>While working on the manuscript, we considered the possibility that PEBP1 function could be related to SIFI complex and concluded that here is a critical difference: while SIFI specifically acts to turn off stress response signalling, loss of PEBP1 prevents eIF2alpha phosphorylation. We did not however consider that PEBP1 could have a localization/degron motif. Motif analysis by deepmito (busca.biocomp.unibo.it) and similar tools did not identify any conventional mitochondrial targeting signal although we acknowledge that PEBP1 has a terminal alpha-helix which was identified for SIFI complex recognition. We are not sure why you think PEBP1 contains such a motif and therefore are hesitant to speculate on this further in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 358: references 50 and 45 are identical.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this. Corrected now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure S1D: it looks like Oligomycin has a significant background fluorescence, which makes interpretation of these graphs difficult - do you have measurements of the compound alone that can be used to subtract this background from the data? Based on the Tm I would say it does stabilize recombinant PEBP1, and there is no quantification of the variance across the 3 replicates to say there is no difference.</p></disp-quote><p>You are right, this assay is problematic due to the background fluorescence. The measurements with oligomycin only and subtracting this background results in slightly negative values and nonsensical thermal shift curves. We now additionally show quantification from two different experiments (unfortunately we ran out of reagents for further experiments), and this quantification shows that if anything, oligomycin causes mild destabilization of recombinant PEBP1. We also used lysate CETSA assay which does not show thermal stabilization of PEBP1 by oligomycin, ruling out a direct effect. We attempted to use ferrostatin1 as a positive control as it may bind PEBP1-ALOX protein complex, and it appeared to show marginal stabilization of PEBP1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few comments for the authors to address:</p><p>(1) The MS-CETSA experiment is quite briefly described and this could be expanded somewhat. Not clear if multiple biological replicates are used. Is there any cutoff in data analysis based on fold change size (which correlated to the significance of cellular effects), etc? As expected from only one early timepoint (see eg PMID: 38328090), there appear to be a limited number of significant shifts over the background (as judged from Figure S1A). In the Excel result file, however (if I read it right) there are large numbers of proteins that are assigned as stabilized or destabilized. This might be to mark the direction of potential shifts, but considering that most of these are likely not hits, this labeling could give a false impression. Could be good to revisit this and have a column for what could be considered significant hits, where a fold change cutoff could help in selecting the most biologically relevant hits. This would allow Figure 1D to be made crisper when it likely dramatically overestimates the overlap between significant CETSA shifts for these drugs.</p></disp-quote><p>Fair point, while we focused more on PEBP1, it is important to have sufficient description of the methods. We used duplicate samples for the MS, which is probably the most important point which was absent from the original submission as is now added to the methods. We also added slightly more description on the data analysis. While the AID method does not explicitly use log2 fold changes, it does consider the relative abundance of proteins under different temperature fractions. Since the Tm (melting temperature) for each protein can be at any temperature, we felt that if would be complicated to compare fractions where the protein stability is changed the most and even more so if we consider both significance and log2FC. Therefore, we used this multivariate approach which indicates the proteins with most likely changes across the range of temperatures. To acknowledge that most of the statistically significant changes are not the much over the background as you correctly pointed out, we now add to the main text that “However, most of these changes are relatively small. To focus our analysis on the most significant and biologically relevant changes…” We also agree that it may be confusing that the AID output reports de/stabilization direction for all proteins. In general, we are not big fans of cutoffs as these are always arbitrary, but with multivariate p value of 0.1 it becomes clear that there are only a relatively small number of hits with larger changes. We have now added to the guide in the data sheet that &quot;Primarily, use the adjusted p value of the log10 Multivariate normal pvalue for selecting the overall statistically significant hits (p&lt;0.05 equals -1.30 or smaller; p&lt;0.01 equals -2 or smaller)&quot;. We have also added to the guide part of the table that “Note that this prediction does not consider whether the change is significant or not, it only shows the direction of change”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) On page 4 the authors state &quot;We reasoned that thermal stability of proteins might be particularly interesting in the context of mitochondrial metabolism as temperature-sensitive fluorescent probes suggest that mitochondrial temperature in metabolically active cells is close to 50{degree sign}C&quot;. I don't see the relevance of this statement as an argument for using TPP/CETSA. When this is also not further addressed in the work, it could be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>Deleted. We agree, while this is an interesting point, it is not that relevant in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) To exclude direct drug binding to PEBP1, a thermofluor experiment is performed (Fig S1D). However, the experiment gives a high background at the lower temperatures and it could be argued that this is due to the flouroprobe binding to a hydrophobic pocket of the protein, and that oligomycin at higher concentrations competes with this binding, attenuating fluorescence. These are complex experiments and there could be other explanations, but the authors should address this. An alternative means to provide support for non-binding would be a lysate CETSA experiment, with very short (1-3 minutes) drug exposure before heating. This would typically give a shift when the protein is indicated to be CETSA responsive as in this case.</p></disp-quote><p>Agree. However, we don't have good means to perform the thermofluor experiments to rule out alternative explanations. What we can say is (as discussed above for reviewer #1, point 4) that quantification from two different experiments shows that oligomycin is does not thermally stabilizing recombinant PEBP1. To complement this conclusion, we used lysate CETSA assay which does not show thermal stabilization of PEBP1 by oligomycin. In this assay we attempted to use ferrostatin1 as a positive control as it may bind PEBP1-ALOX protein complex, and it appeared to show marginal stabilization of PEBP1. But since we lack a robust positive control for these assays, some doubt will inevitably remain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors appear to have missed that there is already a MS-CETSA study in the literature on oligomycin, from Sun et al (PMID: 30925293). Although this data is from a different cell line and at a slightly longer drug treatment and is primarily used to access intracellular effects of decreased ATP levels induced by oligomycin, the authors should refer to this data and maybe address similarities if any.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the oversight, the oligomycin data from this paper eluded us at it was mainly presented in the supplementary data. We compared the two datasets and find found some overlap despite the differences in the experimental details. Both datasets share translational components (e.g. EIF6 and ribosomal proteins), but most notably our other top hit BANF1 which we mentioned in the main text was also identified by Sun et al. We have updated the manuscript text as &quot;Other proteins affected by oligomycin included BANF1, which binds DNA in an ATP dependent manner [16], and has also identified as an oligomycin stabilized protein in a previous MS-CETA experiment [23]&quot;, citing the Sun et al paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The confirmation of protein-protein interaction is notoriously prone to false positives. The authors need to use overexpression and a sensitive reporter to get positive data but collect additional data using mutants which provide further support. Typically, this would be enough to confirm an interaction in the literature, although some doubt easily lingers. When the authors already have a stringent in-cell interaction assay for PEBP1 in the CETSA thermal shift, it would be very elegant to also apply the CETSA WB assay to the overexpressed constructs and demonstrate differences in the response of oligomycin, including the mutants. I am not sure this is feasible but it should be straightforward to test.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion. Unfortunately, due to the time constraints of the graduate students (who must write up their thesis very soon), we are not able to perform and repeat such experiments to the level of confidence that we would like.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) At places the story could be hard to follow, partly due to the frequent introduction of new compounds, with not always well-stated rationale. It could be useful to have a table also in the main manuscript with all the compounds used, with the rationale for their use stated. Although some of the cellular pathways addressed are shown in miniatures in figures, it could be useful to have an introduction figure for the known ISR pathways, at least in the supplement. There are also a number of typos to correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are many compounds used. We have attempted to clarify their use by adding this information into the table of used compounds in the methods and adding an overall schematic to Fig S1G and a note on line 132 &quot;(see Figure 1-figure supplement 1G for summary of drugs used to target PEBP1 and ISR in this manuscript). We have also attempted to remove typos as far as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) EIF2a phosphorylation in S1E does not appear to be more significant for Sodium Arsenite argued to be a positive control, than CCCP, which is argued to be negative.

By showing the 30 min and 4 h time points as Fig 1G and Figure 1-figure supplement 1F, our point was to demonstrate that the kinetics of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are relevant. As you correctly pointed out, the stress response induced by sodium arsenite, but also tunicamycin is already attenuated at the 4h time point.

The work, as it is described, presents data suggesting PEBP1's role in the ISR but fails to present a more conclusive mechanism. The idea of mitochondrial stress causing PEBP1 to bind to eIF2a, amplifying ISR is somewhat vague. Thus, the lack of a more defined model considerably weakens the argument, as the data is largely corollary, showing KO and modulation of PEBP1 definitely has a unique effect on the ISR, however, it is not conclusive proof of what the authors claim. While KO of PEBP1 diminishes the phosphorylation of eIF2a, taken together with the binding to eIF2a, different pathways could be simultaneously activated, and it seems premature to surmise that PEBP1 is specific to mitochondrial stress. Could PEBP1 be reacting to decreased ATP? Release of a protein from the mitochondria in response to stress? Is PEBP1's primary role as a modulator of the ISR, or does it have a role in non-stress-related translation? A cohesive model would tie together these separate indirect findings and constitute a considerable discovery for the ISR field, and the mitochondrial stress field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your assessment, we agree that this manuscript would have been much stronger by having clearer mechanistic insights. As with any scientific endeavor, we will keep in mind alternative explanations to the observations, which could eventually provide that cohesive model explaining how precisely PEBP1, directly or indirectly, influences ISR signalling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The data relies on the initial identification of PEBP1 thermal stabilization concomitant with mitochondrial ISR induction post-treatment of several small molecules. However, the experiment was performed using a single timepoint of 30 minutes. There was no specific rationale for the choice of this time point for the thermal proteome profiling.</p></disp-quote><p>The reasoning for this was explicitly stated: &quot;We reasoned that treating intact cells with the drugs for only 30 min would allow us to observe rapid and direct effects related to metabolic flux and/or signaling related to mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of major changes in protein expression levels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Issues</p><p>(1) In Lines 163-166 the authors state &quot;The cells from Pebp1 KO animals displayed reduced expression of common ISR genes (Figure 2F), despite upregulation of unfolded protein response genes Ern1 (Ire1α) and Atf6 genes. This gene expression data therefore suggests that Pebp1 knockout in vivo suppresses induction of the ISR&quot;. This statement should be reassessed. While an arm of the UPR does stimulate ISR, this arm is controlled by PERK, and canonically IRE1 and ATF6 do not typically activate the ISR, thus their upregulation is likely unrelated to ISR activation and does not contribute the evidence necessary for this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the confusion, we aimed to highlight that as there is an increase in the two UPR arms, it is more likely that ISR instead of UPR is reduced. We have now changed the statement to the following:</p><p>&quot;The cells from Pebp1 PEBP1 KO animals displayed reduced expression of common ISR genes (Figure 2F), while there was mild upregulation of the unfolded protein response genes Ern1 (Ire1α) and Atf6 genes.

This conclusion is not supported by evidence. A number of pathways could be activated in these knockout cells, and simply observing an increase in p-eIF2α after knocking out PEBP1 does not constitute an interaction, as correlation doesn't mean causation. This KO could indirectly affect the ISR, with PEBP1 having no role in the ISR. While taken together there is enough circumstantial evidence in the manuscript to suggest a role for PEBP1 in the ISR, statements such as these have to be revised so as not to overreach the conclusions that can be achieved from the data, especially with no discernible mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised this statement by removing the conclusion and stating only the observation: &quot;Western blotting indicated reduced phosphorylation of eIF2α in RPE1 cells lacking PEBP1 (Fig. 3A).&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
