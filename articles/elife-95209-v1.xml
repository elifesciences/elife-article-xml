Here, we investigate the genetic basis underlying the embryonic onset of movement in <italic>Drosophila</italic> focusing on the role played by small non-coding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs). To this end, we first develop a quantitative behavioural pipeline capable of tracking embryonic movement in large populations of fly embryos, and using this system, discover that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> miRNA <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> plays a role in the emergence of movement. Through the combination of spectral analysis of embryonic motor patterns, cell sorting and RNA in situs, genetic reconstitution tests, and neural optical imaging we define that miR-2b-1 influences the emergence of embryonic movement by exerting actions in the developing nervous system. Furthermore, through the combination of bioinformatics coupled to genetic manipulation of miRNA expression and phenocopy tests we identify a previously uncharacterised (but evolutionarily conserved) chloride channel encoding gene – which we term <italic><underline>Mo</underline>vement Modula<underline>tor</underline></italic> (<italic>Motor</italic>) – as a genetic target that mechanistically links <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> to the onset of movement. Cell-specific genetic reconstitution of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> expression in a null miRNA mutant background, followed by behavioural assays and target gene analyses, suggest that <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> affects the emergence of movement through effects in sensory elements of the embryonic circuitry, rather than in the motor domain. Our work thus reports the first miRNA system capable of regulating embryonic movement, suggesting that other miRNAs are likely to play a role in this key developmental process in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well as in other species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>motor system</kwd><kwd>movement</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/098410</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alonso</surname><given-names>Claudio R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S011609/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alonso</surname><given-names>Claudio R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/220277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baden</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Despite the key biological and adaptive roles of movement across animal systems, how developing embryos manage to organise the necessary molecular, cellular, and physiological processes to initiate patterned movement is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hassinan et al., 2024</xref>). Although it is clear that the genetic system plays a role, how genes control the formation, maturation, and function of the cellular networks underlying the emergence of motor control systems remains poorly understood.</p><p>Recent work in our laboratory has shown that miRNAs – which are short regulatory non-coding RNAs that repress the expression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2018</xref>) – have pervasive roles in the articulation of complex movement sequences such as those involved in body posture control in the young <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Issa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Picao-Osorio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Picao-Osorio et al., 2017</xref>); these observations, as well as those from others in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fricke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holm et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadener et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lackinger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weng et al., 2013</xref>) hinted at the possibility that miRNAs might also be involved in the control of more fundamental aspects of motor development and control.</p><p>In this study, we first investigate the impact of miRNA regulation on <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval movement and discover that the miRNA <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> is necessary for normal locomotion in freshly hatched first instar larvae.

To test this possibility, we developed a novel behavioural pipeline capable to detect the first manifestations of embryonic movement, and using this new approach, we established that <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> is indeed essential for the normal development of embryonic movement through a role in the sensory nervous system. Through the combination of bioinformatic miRNA target prediction, gene expression and phenocopy analyses we identified a previously uncharacterised gene predicted to encode a chloride channel – which we call Motor – as a genetic link between miR-2b-1 and its effects on embryonic movement.

The L1 larva is a convenient model to investigate the genetics of movement given that: (i) the assembly of the machinery for movement must be fully completed by this developmental stage so as to satisfactorily propel the animal into the external world, and (ii) if analysed sufficiently early, for example during the first few minutes after hatching, the animal had no real chance of compensating or learning ways around a putative defect, increasing the probability of detecting a movement phenotype by means of a suitable motor test. To extract a signature of larval movement, we applied a whole animal imaging method based on frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Risse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Risse et al., 2013</xref>) which renders high resolution and high contrast movies to both normal and miRNA mutant first instar larvae. This led us to discover that a single miRNA, <italic>miR-2b-1</italic>, had a significant impact on larval movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> belongs to the <italic>miR-2</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marco et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>ΔmiR-2b-1</italic> mutant larvae show a substantial decrease in larval speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggesting that absence of this specific genetic component compromises the ability of the larva to move normally. Given that these larval tests were conducted within a 30 min period post-hatching, we considered the possibility that the defects observed in the larvae stemmed from changes in earlier ontogenetic processes that occur in the embryo. More specifically, we decided to test the possibility that early embryonic movement patterns might be affected by the lack of normal expression of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A novel approach for the quantification of embryonic movement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating the point of action of miRNAs in the neural networks controlling behaviour.

Despite their attributes, these approaches were highly labour intensive and lacked the necessary throughput required to simultaneously analyse large numbers of embryos enabling a sensitive genetic screen.

The camera captures the reflected light after its physical contact with the embryo; in this setting, even a subtle movement performed by the embryo results in a change in the path of reflected light, leading to variations in signal intensity detected by individual pixels in the CCD sensor, allowing for an accurate measurement of embryonic movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). To extract quantitative movement information from individual embryos we applied an image segmentation protocol to define regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to each embryo and collected pixel intensity values from all ROIs at 4 frames/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). The data allow us to plot variations in average grey pixel intensity over embryonic time, which provide a quantitative signature of the ontogeny of movement in the individual embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). From this, we were able to observe distinct phases of movement that are consistent with previous data: namely, the onset of a phase of disorganised movements ~16 hr after egg laying (hAEL) and its transition into a phase characterised by rhythmic bursts of activity and inactivity ~18 hAEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crisp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pereanu et al., 2007</xref>).

Analysis of <italic>CG3638</italic> expression shows that this target meets the predictions of a genuine <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> target in full: expression of <italic>CG3638</italic> is upregulated in <italic>ΔmiR-2b-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and reduced under neural over-expression of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As mentioned above, phylogenetic analysis of <italic>CG3638</italic> reveals that it belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of chloride channel genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki and Mizuno, 2004</xref>), with representatives across distantly related lineages of insects and vertebrates including mammals, strongly indicating a functional role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Comparison of the properties of <italic>CG3638</italic> and its human orthologue reveal the characteristic seven trans-membrane domains with an external carboxyterminal topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>) further supporting orthology, and applying <italic>AlphaFold</italic> – an artificial intelligence computational method able to predict protein structures with atomic accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) – to the proteins encoded by the <italic>Drosophila CG3638</italic> gene and the human TTYH1 gene reveals the marked similarities between these two polypeptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and I</xref>).</p><p>To explore the relationship between <italic>CG3638</italic> and the embryonic movement phenotype displayed by <italic>ΔmiR-2b-1</italic> mutants, we tested the effects of an artificial reduction of <italic>CG3638</italic> in the genetic background of the miRNA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). In this scenario, should the levels of expression of <italic>CG3638</italic> be relevant to the triggering of the embryonic movement phenotype, we predicted that a reduction in <italic>CG3638</italic> expression levels should compensate its cellular effects, and, accordingly, reduce or even rescue the embryonic phenotype. The results of this experiment show that this is indeed the case, with embryonic movement of the <italic>ΔmiR-2b-1</italic> mutant effectively rescued by a reduction in <italic>CG3638</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Based on its modulatory role in embryonic movement we termed <italic>CG3638</italic> as <italic><underline>Mo</underline>vement modula<underline>tor</underline> (Motor</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mapping the focus of action of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> within the known networks underlying embryonic movement</title><p>Having observed the effects of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> on embryonic movement we wondered about the site of action of this miRNA in regard to circuit components previously linked to embryonic movement. In this respect, previous work has identified embryonic motor neuronal components, as well as interneurons and elements of the sensory system as playing key roles in the control of motor development. These include a motor component that includes all embryonic motor neurons which command the stereotypic array of muscles in the embryonic body wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Landgraf and Thor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peron et al., 2009</xref>), as well as specific elements of the sensory system – in particular the chordotonal system – which detect early myogenic movements in the embryo and transmit the information to the pattern generators thus modulating motor patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caldwell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</xref>). To determine which one of these known circuitry elements might be the principal focus of action of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> in connection to embryonic movement control we artificially expressed <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> in each motor and sensory circuit elements – using drivers <italic>OK371-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mahr and Aberle, 2006</xref>) and <italic>iav-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>), respectively – in an otherwise null mutant background for <italic>miR-2b-1</italic>, asking whether these genetic restorations were sufficient to improve or perhaps even rescue normal movement patterns. To ensure that circuit-specific Gal-4 drivers were active and UAS-driven miRNA levels achieved the necessary cumulative values for biological activity, we chose to measure effects on early larval movement patterns tested in 30-min-old first instar larvae (L1s). The results of these experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M and N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>. Here we observe that restoring expression of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> in the motor neuronal domain defined by the OK371 driver is insufficient to affect the defective movement patterns observed in <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, re-establishing expression of the miRNA in all eight chordotonal organs leads to a full rescue of the motor phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) suggesting that this aspect of the sensory system might be the one where <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> exerts relevant actions during the normal development of movement. In line with this, we observe that the mature <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> transcript is indeed expressed in FACS-isolated embryonic chordotonal organs prepared from wild type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>) and, that the genetic target of <italic>miR-2b-1</italic>, <italic>Motor</italic>, is also expressed in these cells in normal embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>, top). In addition, expression of <italic>Motor</italic> in chordotonal organs prepared from <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> null mutants is up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>, bottom) lending further support to a model in which <italic>Motor</italic> is de-repressed in these specific sensory elements. Furthermore, artificial reduction of <italic>Motor</italic> implemented as a stratagem to decrease the effects of de-repression specifically within the chordotonal system is sufficient to rescue normal movement patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>). Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that <italic>miR-2b-1</italic> impacts the emergence of embryonic movement, at least in part, via effects on the sensory circuit components that underlie motor development, rather than affecting the actual generation of motor patterns.</p><p>Our work identifies a miRNA system that plays a role in the emergence of embryonic movement in the fly embryo, and offers a new approach to analyse the roles of non-coding RNAs and protein coding genes at the critical period when patterned movement develops. It has not escaped our attention that our platform may be suitable for testing the effects of drugs and compounds on early motor activity and are indeed exploring this possibility. We are also using the embyonic pipeline reported here to characterise the motor roles of all miRNAs expressed in the Drosophila embryo, seeking to determine the general rules of miRNA action on the emergence of embryonic movement. In complementary work we are also establishing the effects of all Drosophila miRNAs in the movement of young L1 larvae aiming at relating embryonic and larval effects of individual miRNAs. Understanding the molecular elements controlling the onset of motor development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> will put us one step closer to understanding the molecular basis of embryonic movement in other species, including vertebrates, whose embryos seem to undergo remarkably similar transition phases to those reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamburger,

details</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> fruit flies were maintained by standard means; in 25 °C incubators with 50–60% humidity; on a 12 hr light/dark cycle; with molasses food. See reagent and resource table for all <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains used in this project and the respective sources.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Collection of samples for behavioural experiments</title><p>Flies were kept at 25 °C in collection cages with food plates consisting of apple juice agar and yeast paste. Embryos were collected by placing a fresh food plate in the collection cage and allowing flies to lay eggs for 1 hr. Prior to all embryo collections, a pre-collection of 1 hr was performed to reduce female egg storage. In experiments where some embryos were of genotypes that included GFP-tagged balancer chromosomes, those individuals were selected against by fluorescence microscopy. Selected embryos were gently moved to a fresh plate and allowed to develop at 25 °C. All genotypes underwent selection by fluorescence microscopy to ensure consistent exposure to light across groups compared.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Embryo chamber design and 3D-printing</title><p>The 3D-printed embryo chamber was designed on paper to dimensions of 45 mm (L) X 15 mm (W) X 3 mm (D). Four sub-chambers were designed within the main chamber, each with dimensions of 5 mm (L) X 5 mm (W) X 0.5 mm (D) and divided by a boundary wall of 0.4 mm. The design was subsequently coded in OpenSCAD software and printed on a Formlabs Form 2 desktop 3D-printer using biocompatible BioMed Black resin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Embryo movement experiments</title><p>Embryo collections were aged to 14 (±0.5) hours after egg laying (AEL) prior to selection of individuals with the correct genotype determined via the fluorescence balancer. Embryos were subsequently adhered to a piece of tesa double-sided tape that itself was adhered to a microscope slide. Using one end of a pair of dissection forceps and observing through a brightfield microscope, embryos were gently rolled on the tape to break them out of the egg chorion before being transferred to a well of an embryo chamber previously glued with tesa glue dissolved in heptane. 6 embryos were transferred one-by-one to the well prior to the addition of 3 μl of Halocarbon oil (a 50:50 mix of series 27 and series 700). All manipulations, from the dechorionation of the first embryo to the addition of Halocarbon oil, were done within 3 min to ensure minimal dehydration of embryos. This process was repeated for each of the remaining chamber wells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Embryo movement recording</title><p>Movements of embryos across all four wells of the embryo chamber were recorded simultaneously using a Leica DFC 340 FX camera mounted on a Leica M165 FC microscope, with a resolution of 480x360 pixels and a frame rate of 4 frames per second. Incident lighting was directed laterally onto the embryo chamber to avoid glare to the camera from the surface of the Halocarbon oil. Consistent lighting conditions across the four wells of the embryo chamber were ensured through measurement of pixel intensities (mean grey values) within each recorded well in ImageJ software. Recordings were carried out for at least 10 hr to capture the entire duration of embryonic movement up until larval hatching and files were stored in the AVI format with MJPEG compression to ensure compatibility with downstream analysis software. All recordings were carried out at 25 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Embryo movement analysis</title><p>AVI files were opened in ImageJ software and a rectangular ROI of consistent size was applied over each embryo within the chamber. The ‘RoiSet’ of up to 24 ROIs was saved and then used to ‘multi-measure’ the mean grey value (MGV) of each ROI for each frame of the recording – rapid changes within which were caused by embryo movements that altered reflected light to the camera. The resulting list of MGV was exported to Excel software where a background subtraction was applied to remove slow-scale changes to MGV that occurred due to gradual changes in embryo morphology. This involved the generation of a moving average for the MGV of each embryo with a sliding-window of 60 frames or 15 s, which was then subtracted from the MGV for each frame. The choice of 15 s was made empirically based on the duration of individual movements and the rate of morphological change, particularly tracheal gas-filling. Absolute values were taken for deviations from the baseline to create traces that represent embryo movements over time and for all quantifications. Traces were subsequently cropped at larval hatching based on when the vitelline membrane was breached by the head of the larva. Movement was quantified by summing deviations in MGV from baseline prior to larval hatching. A threshold value of 0.01 MGV deviations from baseline, determined empirically by the comparison of traces from unfertilised and live embryos and found to be applicable across recordings, was applied to filter noise that was unrelated to embryo movement. Traces where a different larva had entered the ROI following hatching were removed from the analysis. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was performed in Igor PRO software and was applied to 1 hr overlapping (30 min overlaps) sliding windows of movement traces to extract information about the frequency spectrum of movements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Larval movement experiments</title><p>For all larval movement experiments, we used an imaging method based on frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) – known as FIM (<underline>F</underline>TIR-based <underline>I</underline>maging <underline>M</underline>ethod). This allowed for the quantification of larval movement with a high degree of consistency and accuracy. (See references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Risse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Risse et al., 2013</xref> for more information). A FIM table was obtained from the University of Münster, department of Computer Vision and Machine Learning Systems, for this purpose. First instar larvae were gently moved to fresh agar plates for assessment on the FIM table within 30 min of hatching to ensure consistency of age across larvae tested and reduce the possibility of differences in motor learning. At least 25 larvae were assessed for each genotype across 3 independent recordings. TIFF images were captured for 3 min at a resolution of 1200x1200 pixels and frame rate of 7 frames per second using a Basler acA2040-90um camera. All recordings were carried out at 25 °C in low-light conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Larval movement analysis</title><p>TIFFs were opened in FIMTrack software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Risse et al., 2017</xref>) before running the tracking algorithm with the ‘minimum larval size’ set to 40. All other settings were left as default. Partial tracks, due to larvae crawling off the plate or into one another, were removed from the analysis. Larvae that did not move were considered a 0 value as the FIMTrack software was unable identify them. The L1_acc_dis parameter was extracted for each larva and this was taken as a quantitative measure of larval movement and compared across genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software. The normality of each dataset was determined by the agreement of four tests: D'Agostino &amp; Pearson; Anderson-Darling; Shapiro-Wilk; Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Datasets that at least one of these normality tests identified as not having a normal distribution were further assessed by nonparametric tests. Multiple Mann-Whitney tests with Bonferroni correction were used for comparison of two genotypes in the myogenic and neurogenic phases or at the larval stage. The parametric Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA with Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons tests, or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests were used for comparisons of more than two genotypes assessed in parallel during the miRNA rescue and RNAi experiments. ****=p &lt; 0.0001, ***=p &lt; 0.001, **=p &lt; 0.01, *=p &lt; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>In-situ hybridisation</title><p>In situ hybridisation probes were designed to be 500–1000 bases in length and complementary to the exons of <italic>Btk</italic> mRNA.

There is a very clear logic that drives the reader from one experiment to the next, the experimental design is clearly explained throughout and the relevance of the acquired data is well analyzed and supports the claims made by the authors. The authors made an evident effort to combine imaging, genetic, and molecular data to describe previously unknown early embryonic movement patterns and to identify regulatory mechanisms that control several aspects of it.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors develop a new method to analyze, quantitatively, the onset of movement during the latter embryonic stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. This setup allows for a high throughput analysis of general movement dynamics based on the capture of variations of light intensity reflected by the embryo. This setup is capable of imaging several embryos simultaneously and provides a detailed measure of movement over time, which proves to be very useful for further discoveries in the manuscript. This setup already provides a thorough and quantifiable description of a process that is little known and identifies two different phases during late embryonic movements: a myogenic phase and a neurogenic phase, which they elegantly prove is dependent on neuronal activity by knocking down action potentials across the nervous system.</p><p>However, in this system, movement is detected as a whole, and no further description of the type of movement is provided beyond frequency and amplitude; it would be interesting to know from the authors if a more precise description of the movements that take place at this stage can be achieved with this method (e.g. motion patterns across the A-P body axis).</p><p>Importantly, this highly quantitative experimental setup is an excellent system for performing screenings of motion regulators during late embryonic development, and its use could be extended to search for different modulators of the process, beyond miRNAs (genetic mutants, drugs, etc.).</p><p>Using their newly established motion detection pipeline, the authors identify miR-2b-1 as required for proper larval and embryonic motion, and identify an overall reduction in the quantity of both myogenic and neurogenic movements, as well as an increased frequency in neurogenic movement &quot;pulses&quot;.</p><p>Focusing on the neurogenic movement phenotype the authors use in situ probes and perform RT-PCR on FACS-sorted CNS cells to unambiguously detect miR-2b-1 expression in the embryonic nervous system. The neurogenic motion defects observed in miR-2b-1 mutant embryos and early larvae can be completely rescued by the expression of ectopic miR-2b-1 specifically in the nervous system, providing solid evidence of the requirement and sufficiency of miR-2b-1 expressed in the nervous system to regulate these phases of movement.</p><p>To explore the mechanism through which miR-2b-1 impacts embryonic movement, the authors use a state-of-the-art bioinformatic approach to identify potential targets of miR-2b-1, and find that the expression levels of an uncharacterized gene, CG3638, are indeed regulated by miR-2b-1. Furthermore, they prove that by knocking down the expression of CG3638 in a miR-2b-1 mutant background, the neurogenic embryonic movement defects are rescued, pointing that the repression of CG3638 by miR-2b-1 is necessary for correct motion patterns in wild-type embryos. Therefore, this paper provides the first functional characterization of CG3638, and names this gene Motor.</p><p>Finally, the authors aim to discriminate which elements of the embryonic motor system miR-2b-1/Motor are required. Using directed overexpression of miR-2b-1 and Motor knockdown in the motor neurons and the chordotonal (sensory) organs, they prove that the miR-2b-1/Motor regulatory axis is specifically required in the sensory organs to promote normal embryonic and larval movement.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The initial screening to identify miRNAs involved in motion behaviors is performed in early larval movement. The logic presented by the authors is clear - it is assumed that early larval movement cannot proceed normally in the absence of previous embryonic motion - and ultimately helped them identify a miRNA required for modulation of embryonic movement. However, it is possible that certain miRNAs play a role in the modulation of embryonic movement while being dispensable for early L1 behaviors. Such regulators might have been missed with the current screening setup.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95209.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review)</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript, ‘A microRNA that controls the emergence of embryonic movement’ by Menzies, Chagas, and Alonso provides evidence that <italic>Drosophila</italic> miR-2b-1 is expressed in neurons and controls the expression of the predicted chloride channel CG3638, here named &quot;Motor&quot;. Loss of the miRNA leads to movement phenotypes that can be rescued by downregulation of Motor; using specific drivers, the authors show that a larval movement phenotype (slower movement) can be rescued by knockdown of Motor in the chordotonal organs, suggesting that the increase in Motor found in the chordotonal organs is likely the root of the movement defects. Overall, I found the data presented in the manuscript of reasonable quality and are well enough supported by the presented data.</p><p>The genetic and phenotypic analysis seems to be correct.

Especially in a work like this one, which uses plenty of different approaches and techniques and has a concise main text, description in the figure legends can really help the reader to understand the technical aspects of the experimental design. In my opinion, this will also help highlight the effort the authors put into exploring different and often new technical approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for highlighting this point and agree with them that the original figure legends lacked detailed information. In this revised version of our paper we edited all figure legends providing higher detail on experiments and information displayed (see Main text p12-16, Supplementary Information p2-5). We hope this change will improve the clarity and accuracy of the description of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>(1) Is there evidence that the early movement phenotype is actually linked to the larval movement phenotype? I noticed that the chordotonal driver experiment was only examined for larval movement. Is this driver not expressed earlier? Could the authors check the early phenotype using this driver? Are there early drivers that are expressed in chordotonal organ precursors (not panneuronal) and does the knockdown of CG3638 in these specific cells suppress the early phenotype?</p><p>(2) More broadly, I would like to understand the function of the early embryonic movements. My concern is that they may only be a sign that the nervous system is firing up. If the rescue of the late miRNA mutant phenotype with chordotonal organ expression is only through a late change in the expression of CG3638, then the larval phenotype is probably not due to a developmental change, but a change in the immediate functioning of the neurons. Would this suggest that the early pulsing is not required for anything, at least at our level of understanding? If the driver is actually expressed early and late, then perhaps the authors could test later drivers to delimit the early and late functions of the miRNA?</p></disp-quote><p>The comments by Reviewer 2 in the points above are important and enquire about the biological role of early embryonic movements and whether these movements are linked to later larval activity or are somewhat irrelevant to the behaviour of the animal at later stages.</p><p>To address this important question, we conducted a new experiment in which we reduced neural activity specifically in the embryo (i.e. from 10hs AEL until the end of embryogenesis) and tested whether this treatment had any impact on larval movement. If – as put by Rev2 – the ‘early pulsing is not required for anything’ and the larval phenotype emerges from an acute change in neuronal physiology, then our experiment should show no effects at the larval stage. The results shown in Figure S4 (see Supplementary Information, p5) show that this is not the case: artificial reduction of neural activity during embryogenesis leads to a statistically significant reduction in larval speed, similar to that caused by the loss of miR-2b-1. This shows that modifications of embryonic activity impact larval movement.</p><p>Furthermore, earlier work on the biological role of embryonic activity identified an activity-dependent ‘critical period’ during late embryogenesis (Giachello and Baines, 2015; Ackerman et al., 2021): manipulations at or around this critical period result in both locomotor and seizure phenotypes in larvae. We cite these papers in the main text (p7).</p><p>In addition, two recent papers (Zeng et al., 2021; Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021) – which we cite in the main text (p5) – show that inhibition of muscle activity specifically during the embryonic period prevents the generation of normal neural activity patterns in both, embryo and larva. Similar results are observed when proprioceptive sensory inputs to the central nervous system are blocked, with larval locomotion also disrupted.</p><p>Altogether, the data already in the literature plus our new addition to the paper, show that early embryonic movements play a key role in the development of the nervous system and larval locomotion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Given the role in the larval chordotonal organs, have the authors also checked the adult movements?</p></disp-quote><p>The question of whether miR-2b-1 action in chordotonal organs affects behaviour at later stages of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> life cycle is interesting and was the reason why we assessed different genetic manipulations at the larval stage. However, we believe that assessing adult locomotor phenotypes is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors state that mir-2b-1 is a mirtron. I do not believe this is correct. It is not present in an intron in Btk from what I can see. Also, in the reference that the authors use when stating that mir-2b is a mirtron, I believe mir-2b-1 is actually used as a non-mirtron control miRNA. As mirtrons are processed slightly differently from regular hairpins and often use only the 3' end of the hairpin for miRNA creation, this may not be a trivial distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Rev2 for highlighting this point: indeed, as they say, miR-2b-1 is located in the 3’UTR of host gene Btk, rather than in an intron. Accordingly, in this revision we remove the comment on miR-2b-1 being a mirtron (p6) and deleted the citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For miRNA detection, the authors use in situ hybridization and QPCR. Both methods show that the gene is expressed but not that the mature miRNA is made. If the authors wanted a truly independent test for the presence of the miRNA, a miRNA sensor might be a better choice and it would hint at which part of the hairpin makes the functional miRNA. This is probably not necessary but could be a nice addition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Rev2 for drawing attention to this point and allowing this clarification. The qPCR protocol we used is based on the method developed by Balcells et al., 2011 (w/303 citations) (see Materials and Methods section in Supplementary Information, p14) which allows the specific amplification of mature miRNA transcripts, and not their precursors. This method for mature miRNA PCR is so robust that it has even been patented (WO2010085966A2). To ensure that the reader is clear about our methods, we state in the main text (p6) that we perform &quot;RT-PCR for the mature miRNA transcript&quot;. [NB: miRNA sensors provide a useful method to assess miRNA expression but can also act as competitive inhibitors of physiological miRNA functions, titrating away miRNA molecules from their real targets in tissue; therefore, results using this method are often difficult to interpret.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Curious about mir-2b-1 and any overlap with the related mir2b-2 and the mir2a genes. I am just wondering about the similarity in their sequences/targets and if they might have similar phenotypes or enhance the phenotypes being scored by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point raised by REV2 and indeed miR-2b-1 does belong to the largest family of microRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the miR-2 family, discussed in detail by Marco et al., 2012. However, we consider that performing tests of additional miRNA mutations, both individually and in combination with miR-2b-1, is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Related to this, the authors show that the reduction of a single miRNA target suppresses the miRNA loss of function phenotype. This indicates that this target is quite important for this miRNA. I wonder if the target site is conserved in the human gene that the authors highlight.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another interesting comment by Rev2. To pursue their idea, we have performed a blast for the miR-2b-1 target site in the human orthologs of CG3638 and did not find a match suggesting that the relationship between miR-2b-1 and CG3638 is not evolutionarily preserved between insects and mammals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors do not describe properly how the miRNA screening was performed and just claim that only miR-2b-1 mutants presented a defective motion phenotype in early L1. How many miRNAs were tested, and how candidates were selected is never explicitly mentioned in the text or the Methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We identified miR-2b-1 as part of a genetic screen aimed at detecting miRNAs with impact on embryonic movement, but this full screen is not yet complete. Seeing the clear phenotype of miR2b-1 in the embryo prompted us to study this miRNA in detail, which is what we report in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The initial screening to identify miRNAs involved in motion behaviors is performed in early larval movement. The logic presented by the authors is clear - it is assumed that early larval movement cannot proceed normally in the absence of previous embryonic motion - and ultimately helped them identify a miRNA required for modulation of embryonic movement. However, it is possible that certain miRNAs play a role in the modulation of embryonic movement while being dispensable for early L1 behaviors. Such regulators might have been missed with the current screening setup. Although similar changes to those described for the neurogenic phase of embryonic movement are described for the myogenic phase in miR-2b-1 mutants (reduction in motion amplitude), this phenotype goes unexplored. This is not a big issue, as the authors convincingly demonstrate later that miR-2b-1 is specifically required in the nervous system for proper embryonic and larval movement, and the effects of miR-2b-1 on myogenic movement might as well be the focus of future work. However, it will be interesting to discuss here the implications of a reduced myogenic movement phase, especially as miR-2b-1 is specifically involved in regulating the activity of the chordotonal system - which precisely detects early myogenic movements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Rev1 for their interest in that loss of miR-2b-1 results in a decrease in movement during the myogenic phase, in addition to the neurogenic phase. Indeed, two recent papers (Zeng et al., 2021; Carreira-Rosario et al., 2021) – which we cite in the main text (p5) – show that inhibition of muscle activity during a period that overlaps with the myogenic phase prevents the formation of normal neural activity patterns and larval locomotion. They also observe the same when inhibiting proprioceptive sensory inputs to the central nervous system. This could suggest that the effects of miR-2b-1 on the myogenic phase might have ‘knock-on’ effects upon the later neurogenic phase and larval movement. However, we note that genetic restoration of miR-2b-1 expression specifically to neurons completely rescues the larval speed phenotype (Fig. 3G), suggesting that the dominant effect of miR-2b-1 upon movements is through its action within neurons. To recognise Rev1’s comment we have added a short sentence to the text (p7) suggesting that ‘the effects of miR-2b-1 observed at earlier stages (myogenic phase) are possibly offset by normal neural expression of miR-2b-1’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>FACS-sorting of neuronal cells followed by RT-PCR convincingly detects the presence of miR-2b-1 in the embryonic CNS. However, control of non-neuronal cells would be required to explore whether miR-2b-1 is not only present but enriched in the nervous system compared to other tissues. This is also the case in the miR-2b-1 and Janus expression analysis in the chordotonal organs: a control sample from the motor neurons would help discriminate whether miR-2b-1/Janus regulatory axis is specifically enriched in chordotonal organs or whether both genes are expressed throughout the CNS but operate under a different regulation or requirements for the movement phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The RNA in situ hybridisation data included in the paper (Fig. 3B) show that RNA probes for miR2b-1 precursors reveal very strong signal in neural tissue – with very low signal detected in other tissues – strongly indicating that expression of miR-2b-1 is highly enriched in the nervous system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As I mentioned above, I felt the presentation was a bit overstated. The authors present their data in a way that focuses on movement, the emergence of movement, and how their miRNA of interest is at the center of this topic. I only point to the title and name that they wish to give the target of their miRNA to emphasize this point. &quot;Janus&quot; the GOD of movement and change. The results and discussion section starts with a paragraph saying, &quot;Movement is the main output of the nervous system... how developing embryos manage to organise the necessary molecular, cellular, and physiological processes to initiate patterned movement is still unknown. Although it is clear that the genetic system plays a role, how genes control the formation, maturation and function of the cellular networks underlying the emergence of motor control remains poorly understood.&quot; While there is nothing inherently untrue about these statements, it is a question of levels of understanding. One can always argue that something in biology is still unknown at a certain level. However, one could also argue that much is known about the molecular nature of movement. Next, I am not sure how much this work impacts the area of study regarding the emergence of movement. The authors show that a reduction of a miRNA can affect something about certain neurons, that affects movement. The early movements, although slightly diminished, still emerge. Thus, their work only suggests that the function of some neurons, or perhaps the development of these neurons may impact the early movements. This is not new as it was known already from early work from the Bate lab. Later larval movements were also shown to be modified in the miRNA mutants and were traced to &quot;janus&quot; overexpression in the chordotonal organs. As neurons are quite sensitive to the levels of Cl- and Janus is thought to be a Cl- channel, this could lead to a slight dysfunction of the chordotonal neurons. So, based on this, the work suggests that dysfunction of the chordotonal organs could impact larval movement. This was, of course, already known. The novelty of this work is in the genes being studied (important or not). We now know that miR 2b-1 and Janus are expressed in the early neurons and larval chordotonal neurons and their removal is consistent with a role for these genes in the functioning of these neurons. This is not to trivialize these findings, simply to state that these results are not significantly changing our overall understanding of movement and the emergence of movement. I would call it a stretch to say that this miRNA CONTROLS the emergence of movement, as in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>As already mentioned in our provisional response, on this point we politely – but strongly – disagree with Rev2’s suggestion that the findings are inflated by our language. We also note that they criticise our use of the verb ‘control’, yet this is a standard textbook term in molecular biology to describe biological processes regulated by genetic factors: given that miR-2b-1 regulates movement patterns during embryogenesis, to say that miR-2b-1 ‘controls’ embryonic movement in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is reasonable and in line with the language used in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the name Janus should be changed as it is already being used. A quick scan of flybase shows that there is a Janus A and B in flies (phosphatases) and I am surprised the authors did not check this. I was initially worried about the Janus kinase (JAK) when I performed the search. While I understand that none are only called Janus, studies of the jan A and B genes refer to the locus as the janus region, which could lead to confusion. The completely different molecular functions of the genes relative to CG3638 add to the confusion. Thus, I ask that the authors change the name of CG3638 to something else.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this omission. In the revised MS we propose a new name – Movement Modulator (Motor) – for the gene previously described as Janus (CG3638) to avoid annotation issues at FlyBase due to other, unrelated genes that include this word as part of their names. All instances where Janus was used are now replaced by Motor (abstract; main text pages 9-10; Figure 4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
