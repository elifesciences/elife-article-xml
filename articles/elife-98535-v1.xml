through cell competition. During development, cell competition enables healthy cells to eliminate less fit cells that could jeopardize tissue integrity, and facilitates the elimination of pre-malignant cells by healthy cells as a surveillance mechanism to prevent oncogenesis. Malignant cells also benefit from cell competition to promote their expansion. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the mechanisms governing cell competition, particularly those common to developmental competition and tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here, we show that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Flamingo (Fmi) is required by winners to maintain their status during cell competition in malignant tumors to overtake healthy tissue, in early pre-malignant cells when they overproliferate among wildtype cells, in healthy cells when they later eliminate pre-malignant cells, and by supercompetitors as they compete to occupy excessive territory within wildtype tissues. ‘Would-be’ winners that lack Fmi are unable to overproliferate, and instead become losers. We demonstrate that the role of Fmi in cell competition is independent of PCP, and that it uses a distinct mechanism that may more closely resemble one used in other less well-defined functions of Fmi.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Flamingo</kwd><kwd>cell competition</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM131914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Axelrod</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P400PB_199258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez Bosch</surname><given-names>Pablo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the planar cell polarity protein Flamingo is required by winners to maintain their status during cell competition in multiple models as they compete to occupy excessive territory within wildtype tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dividing cells in proliferative tissues must maintain tissue homeostasis and structural integrity as well as preserve their genetic integrity. One of the mechanisms operating in proliferative tissues to achieve these requirements is cell competition. Cell competition is a process in which cells of a higher fitness (‘winners’) eliminate less fit neighbors (‘losers’), by inducing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Norman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Giacomo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>) and/or extrusion from the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Norman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohashi et al., 2021</xref>). Cell competition was first recognized in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>), when Morata and Ripoll studied the growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> carrying a mutation in the gene for the ribosomal protein RpS17 (termed <italic>minute</italic>). Animals heterozygous for this <italic>minute</italic> mutation are viable but develop slowly due to decreased proliferation rates. They further observed that clones of cells carrying this <italic>minute</italic> mutation in a wildtype background were eliminated from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> developing wing. Since then, extensive advances have been made in our understanding of the process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morata, 2021</xref>). We now know that cell competition can be triggered by mutations that cause a disadvantage, such as the aforementioned <italic>minute</italic> cells, and can also be triggered by mutations that confer a proliferative advantage, such as ectopic expression of proto-oncogenes such as Myc or Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moreno and Basler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Cova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hogan et al., 2009</xref>). In this case, the process is known as supercompetition, and wildtype cells behave as losers and are eliminated from the tissue by the mutant supercompetitors. The ‘survival of the fittest’ effect observed in cell competition has been shown to be critical during embryonic and larval development as well as for tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amoyel and Bach, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maruyama and Fujita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morata, 2021</xref>). Much additional research has shown that cells and their neighbors are constantly evaluating their fitness, and that the active elimination of less fit cells is critical to maintain tissue integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ellis et al., 2019</xref>), maintain chromosomal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baillon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ji et al., 2021</xref>), ameliorate effects of cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Merino et al., 2015</xref>), and suppress tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Vreede et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While cell competition has been observed in many cell types, much attention has focused on studies in epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vincent et al., 2013</xref>). Polarity is a hallmark of epithelial tissues, and loss of polarity plays a prominent role in triggering cell competition and in the process of eliminating loser cells. Cells harboring mutations in apicobasal polarity genes have been shown to induce and/or regulate cell competition when surrounded by wildtype cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutations in apicobasal polarity genes <italic>scribble</italic> (<italic>scrib</italic>), <italic>discs large</italic> (<italic>dlg</italic>), and <italic>lethal giant larva</italic> (<italic>lgl</italic>) all trigger cell competition when induced clonally (i.e. surrounded by wildtype cells), and the clones are eliminated from the epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hariharan and Bilder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morata and Calleja, 2020</xref>). However, clones that are deficient for any of these polarity genes can survive if they are competing against less fit cells, or if they carry additional mutations that confer a growth advantage. For example, when <italic>lgl</italic> clones, which would be eliminated when surrounded by wildtype cells, are made to express elevated levels of Myc, the competition is reversed, and they instead become winners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Froldi et al., 2010</xref>). This context dependence and fitness surveillance highlights the complexity of cell competition and its plasticity.</p><p>In epithelial tissues, cell competition is critical to suppress tumorigenesis, as polarity-deficient clones are prone to malignancy. When <italic>scrib</italic> mutant epithelial cells acquire elevated activity of a proto-oncogene such as the constitutively active <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, these clones acquire malignant properties of ectopic growth and invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pagliarini and Xu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumby and Richardson, 2003</xref>). Surveillance and rapid elimination of cells that develop polarity defects therefore serves to protect epithelia from oncogenesis. This competitive mechanism is known as epithelial defense against cancer (EDAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maruyama and Fujita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kon and Fujita, 2021</xref>). Through EDAC, normal epithelial cells eliminate neighboring transformed cells by inducing apoptosis or by inducing their apical or basal extrusion from the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohashi et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, tumors that exhibit more aggressive properties and escape the defense mechanisms not only proliferate but actively engage in cell competition to promote their own growth and malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vishwakarma and Piddini, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Madan et al., 2022</xref>). For example, growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC<sup>-/-</sup> intestinal adenomas requires active elimination of wildtype cells, and inhibiting cell death in the wildtype tissue hampers adenoma growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to apicobasal polarity, epithelial tissues are planar polarized. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling polarizes cells within the plane of the epithelium to orient cellular structures, cell divisions, and cell migration during development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simons and Mlodzik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vladar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butler and Wallingford, 2017</xref>). Intercellular Fmi homodimers scaffold the assembly of a set of core PCP proteins: on one side of a cell, Frizzled (Fz), Dishevelled (Dsh), and Diego (Dgo) comprise a complex that interacts with another complex containing Van Gogh (Vang) and Prickle (Pk) on the opposite side of the adjacent cell. Fmi homodimers transmit differential signals in opposite directions to communicate the presence of either protein complex to the other, linking the proximal and distal complexes and mediating asymmetric signaling between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Struhl et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to establishing planar polarity, numerous reports have suggested links between PCP signaling and cancer progression, promoting cell motility, invasiveness, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weeraratna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katoh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katoh and Katoh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gujral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">VanderVorst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">VanderVorst et al., 2023</xref>). Its roles, however, remain poorly characterized.</p><p>To probe a potential connection between PCP and cancer, we employed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye tumor model. We discovered a requirement for Fmi, but not other core PCP proteins, in tumor-associated cell competition. We found that aggressive tumors require Fmi to outcompete the neighboring wildtype tissue. We then found that this Fmi requirement is not unique to tumor competition; in several developmental cell competition scenarios, removing Fmi from winner cells prevents them from eliminating their neighbors and transforms them into losers. ‘Would-be’ winners that lack Fmi show both a decrease in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis. By several criteria, we show that this function for Fmi is independent of its role in PCP signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flamingo is required for tumorigenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ras<sup>V12</sup> tumors</title><p>Planar polarity has been linked to tumorigenesis in several organisms, tumor models, and patient tumor samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaucká et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puvirajesinghe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">VanderVorst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>).

We then imaged tumor size through the pupal cuticle. We observed that tumor growth was unaffected by knockdown of any of the core PCP genes at third instar larval or at early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–H</xref>). We then asked whether PCP signaling might be required by tumors when they’re confronted by wildtype cells. To test this hypothesis, we created clonal tumors in the eye disc by expressing <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi under control of ey-Flp. In this model, nearly every cell in the eye disc will perform chromosomal recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), producing an eye disc composed of approximately 50% wildtype and 50% tumor cells. Under these conditions, tumor cells expand aggressively, displacing wildtype cells and causing massive overgrowth of the eye disc and metastasis to the larval brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>). We created clonal tumors that were also null for either <italic>fmi</italic>, <italic>fz</italic>, <italic>dgo</italic>, <italic>vang</italic>, or <italic>pk</italic> and evaluated them for their ability to grow and metastasize when confronted with wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–P</xref>). Remarkably, only <italic>fmi</italic> interfered with tumorigenesis, restraining growth of tumors in the eye disc and preventing them from invading neighboring tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). To ensure that the growth inhibitory effect of loss of Fmi in clonal tumors but not in whole eye tumors was not a result from comparing a null allele in clonal tumors vs RNAi in whole eye tumors, we generated <italic>fmi</italic> RNAi clonal tumors and compared them to control RNAi clonal tumors.

We therefore assessed whether depleting Fmi in wing disc &gt;&gt;Myc winner clones would also reverse the competition outcome. We used hsp-Flp to generate twin spot clones expressing UAS-Myc, and as in eye discs, those clones behaved like supercompetitors. Myc clones were on average 1.7 times larger than the homozygous RFP+ (hRFP) twin spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, when &gt;&gt;Myc clones lacked Fmi, their ability to compete was severely impaired, producing much smaller clones, being on average half as large as their hRFP twin spots, and thus, like in eye discs, behaved as one would expect of losers when competing against wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>fmi<sup>E59</sup></italic> Myc clones were also highly fragmented in the wing disc, a phenomenon we did not observe in eye discs. As observed in eye discs, removing Fmi from the wildtype losers had no effect on the ability of &gt;&gt;Myc clones to compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Similarly, making clones mutant for <italic>fmi</italic> alone had no effect on their growth in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>In the setting of tumorigenesis, either tumor cells or wildtype cells may emerge as winners of cell competition. Tumors outcompete wildtype cells in the processes of invasion and metastasis, whereas transformed pre-malignant cells are often eliminated by wildtype cells through competition-dependent defense mechanisms such as EDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kon and Fujita, 2021</xref>). We therefore further explored the potential requirement for Fmi in a system in which both outcomes occur at different times. In eye discs, cells lacking Scrib display a proto-oncogenic behavior, losing polarity and overproliferating in the developing eye disc. However, as eye development progresses, they subsequently become losers, and are eliminated via JNK-mediated apoptosis during late third instar and pupal development so that they are virtually absent from the tissue before the fly ecloses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumby and Richardson, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Using the ey-Flp system to activate RNAi against <italic>scrib</italic> in eye discs, we confirmed that downregulation of <italic>scrib</italic> generated clones that perdure through larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D , E, and M</xref>) but were eliminated from the tissue by the end of pupal development and were not detected in the adult eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and F’</xref>). Compared to control RFP clones, which represented around 40% of the eye cell population in early third instar larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and remained at roughly that proportion in the adult eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and C’</xref>), <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones began to be eliminated at or before the time the morphogenetic furrow progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and were almost completely absent in adult eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and F’</xref>). Their elimination left scars in the adult eye, likely because the structure of the eye is established with the passing of the morphogenetic furrow, and the compound eyes were smaller compared to wildtype eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>). Wildtype cells therefore behave as winners when confronted with <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones during late larval and pupal development.</p><p>We then evaluated the effect of removing Fmi from the wildtype winner clones in <italic>scrib</italic> cell competition. Loss of <italic>fmi</italic> in wildtype cells had little impact on the size of <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones in third instar larval discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H, and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but as development progressed, wildtype winner cells depleted of <italic>fmi</italic> lost their ability to compete with and eliminate <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones; the <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones survived during pupal development and indeed constituted the majority of the adult eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and I’</xref>), showing a reversal in the competition outcome much as the outcome of &gt;&gt;Myc competition is reversed when the winners lack Fmi. The surviving <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi cells failed to differentiate, and instead produced large scars in the adult eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and I’</xref>). We also observed considerable lethality in this population of flies, presumably due to the uncontrolled proliferation of <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi cells that could not be eliminated.</p><p>During &gt;&gt;Myc supercompetition, removing Fmi from the loser wildtype cells showed no effect in cell competition in eye and wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and G</xref>). We therefore considered what might happen if <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi loser clones are made to lack Fmi. However, this situation is more complex than the &gt;&gt;Myc competition, since <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones have been previously documented to initially overproliferate, perhaps behaving as winners, before ultimately becoming losers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumby and Richardson, 2003</xref>). We were unable to quantify this early proliferation of <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi eye clones before they are eliminated by their wildtype neighbors, as the discs are too small for us to dissect and count. However, assuming that they are behaving as winners in early larval development, one might expect that removing Fmi from <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones would impair their ability to overproliferate early, such that by third instar, they would be smaller than <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones with intact Fmi. Indeed, this is what we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J, K, and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Previous reports have shown that activation of JNK mediates engulfment and elimination of <italic>scribble</italic> clones during cell competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ohsawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>). However, JNK signaling is also responsible for increased tumor growth and invasion in Ras-activated cells or scrib mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Igaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leong et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore asked whether the role of Fmi in tumorigenesis and cell competition could be related to the regulation of JNK signaling. Confirming previous observations, we detect activation of JNK signaling via the <italic>puckered</italic> lacZ reporter <italic>puc<sup>E69</sup></italic> both in Ras<sup>V12</sup>, <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) and <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones in eye discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). However, Ras<sup>V12</sup> tumors lacking <italic>fmi</italic>, despite displaying cell death in tumor cells competing with wildtype neighbors, show no change in Puc activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>).

We therefore conclude that Fmi acts independently of JNK signaling.</p><p>Cell competition does not rely solely on apoptosis to eliminate loser cells.

To evaluate whether Fmi is also required to maintain a higher proliferative ratio in winners, we quantified mitotic cells in winner clones with and without Fmi. The wing disc displays distributed cell divisions throughout larval development, in contrast to eye discs, where passing of the morphogenetic furrow limits proliferation as cells start differentiating into compound eye cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolff and Ready, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsachaki and Sprecher, 2012</xref>). Therefore, for the quantification of proliferation, the wing is a better model than the eye disc. When wing disc &gt;&gt;Myc clones were depleted of Fmi, cell proliferation, as measured by pHis3 staining, was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q–S</xref>). Taken together, these observations directly link the need for Fmi to proliferation and induced apoptosis, the two key events of cell competition, in several models of cell competition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Fmi-mediated cell-cell communication is not required for competition between winners and losers</title><p>Previously, some key players involved in cell competition, including Flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rhiner et al., 2010</xref>) and Xrp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baillon et al., 2018</xref>), were shown to be either up- or downregulated during competition.

If Fmi is involved in these determinative intercellular communication events by signaling as a trans-homodimer, it should be required in both prospective winner and loser cells.

Cells that would otherwise behave as winners instead behave as losers when they lack Fmi. Fmi is notable in that it is required in cell competition in each of four distinct competition scenarios examined: Ras<sup>V12</sup> <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi tumors, Myc supercompetitor clones in eye and wing discs, wildtype cells vs <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi loser clones in pupal eyes, and likely <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi clones in larval eye discs. Just how universal this requirement is in other cell competition scenarios in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and perhaps in competition in other organisms remains to be determined.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fmi acts in cell competition independently of PCP</title><p>Several arguments support the conclusion that the role for Fmi in cell competition is distinct from its role in PCP signaling. First, Fmi is the only core PCP component among the six that were surveyed to inhibit the ability of Ras<sup>V12</sup> <italic>scrib</italic> RNAi tumor clones to compete in the eye. If Fmi’s role in cell competition were to signal winner fate to losers and vice versa by mirroring its role in PCP signaling, where it signals the presence of proximal (Vang, Pk) components in one direction and the presence of distal components (Fz, Dsh, Dgo) in the other direction between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strutt and Strutt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutt and Strutt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Struhl et al., 2012</xref>), then one might expect either the proximal or distal components to also be required in winner clones. No such requirement was observed. Second, in PCP signaling, Fmi functions as a trans-homodimer to transmit those signals and requires the cadherin repeats and other extracellular domains, implying its function as a trans-homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>). In PCP signaling, removing Fmi from either of two adjacent cells completely blocks PCP signaling. In contrast, in cell competition, while Fmi is required in winners, removing Fmi from losers has no effect on competition. Thus, the model of bidirectional signaling via Fmi is not supported by our results.</p><p>These observations, however, do not rule out the possibility that Fmi trans-homodimers contribute to intercellular signaling among winner cells. Nonetheless, as discussed above, adhesion seems not to be a meaningful part of the function for Fmi in winners, as an adhesion-deficient Fmi construct (<italic>fmiΔCad</italic>) fully rescues both competition and clone adhesion. The potential contributions of adhesion vs other possible signaling mechanisms are discussed at more length below.</p><p>Unlike the other core PCP genes, <italic>fmi<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutations are lethal due to requirements in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Usui et al., 1999</xref>). Though not fully characterized, its roles in the nervous system appear to be distinct from PCP signaling. Fmi is required for outgrowth and guidance of the R8 axon of the eye to the M3 layer of the medulla via a mechanism that appears independent of other components of the core PCP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Senti et al., 2003</xref>), but does interact with Golden goal, a transmembrane phosphoprotein that is not associated with PCP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takechi et al., 2021</xref>). Growth of the dendrites of dorsal da neurons is also regulated by Fmi. During embryogenesis, da dendrites in fmi mutant embryos emerge precociously and overgrow as they approach the dorsal midline, and later, during larval growth, dendrites from opposite sides fail to avoid each other (tile) and instead overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sweeney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Fmi is classified as an atypical cadherin and a Class-B adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (AGPCR), as it contains in its extracellular domain several conserved functional domains including cadherin repeats, epidermal growth factor-like repeats, laminin A G-type repeats, and a GPCR autoproteolytic inducing (GAIN) domain that contains within it a GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Einspahr and Tilley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sreepada et al., 2022</xref>). These extracellular domains are followed by seven transmembrane domains and an intracellular C-terminal domain. Although much remains to be learned about this large subfamily of GPCRs, a general model has emerged in which activation by membrane bound or extracellular protein, peptide, proteoglycan or small molecule ligand, or mechanical force exposes a tethered ligand at the N-terminus of the C-terminal fragment in the GAIN domain that, upon exposure, interacts with the transmembrane portion to activate a G-protein signaling cascade. In many but not all AGPCRs, the tethered ligand is exposed by GAIN domain-mediated autoprotolysis of its GPS. Non-cleaved AGPCRs are hypothesized to expose the tethered ligand by an allosteric conformational change. Some de-orphanized AGPCRs interact with multiple ligands, and ligand binding can result in partial or full activation. In some cases, it appears that engineered truncation of portions of the extracellular domain can produce some level of ligand-independent activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>When expressed in da neurons, an Fmi construct lacking the cadherin, laminin G, and EGF-like repeats partially rescued the embryonic dendritic overgrowth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting a function independent of homodimerization. The G protein Gαq (Gq) has been proposed to function downstream of Fmi to mediate this repressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). A recent preprint reports the resolved structure of the CELSR1 extracellular domain, showing that the protein has two distinct domains: an adhesion domain comprised of the first eight cadherin repeats, and a compact domain that extends from the ninth cadherin repeat to the transmembrane domains that is involved in GPCR signaling. Indeed, they demonstrated that a CELSR1 construct lacking only the cadherin repeats 1–8 retains the ability to activate Gαs, which has been predicted to interact with CELSR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandekar et al., 2024</xref>). Notably, our results showed that a similar Fmi construct lacking the cadherin domains substantially rescues the requirement for Fmi in winner cells during cell competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These observations suggest that supplying adhesion is not the principal function of Fmi in these events, but are consistent with the possibility that homodimeric adhesion, or interaction with a different ligand, normally activates the receptor, and that the truncated FmiΔCad behaves as a constitutively activated receptor capable of binding to either Gα proteins. While no biochemical characterization of Fmi has been reported, the human orthologs CELSR1-3 have been studied in detail. CELSR2 is autoproteolytically cleaved while CELSRs 1 and 3 are not, yet all three couple to GαS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huong Bui et al., 2023</xref>). Additional efforts will be required to determine the functional ligand(s) for Fmi and whether it signals similarly. Furthermore, AGPCRs participate in a wide variety of developmental and physiologic events through diverse effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Einspahr and Tilley, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sreepada et al., 2022</xref>).

Through the process of EDAC, epithelial tissues use cell competition to eliminate transformed pre-neoplastic cells by removing them from the tissue via directed cell death or extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). Pre-neoplastic cells that escape EDAC may accumulate additional mutations to become malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watanabe et al., 2018</xref>). Malignant tumors not only escape EDAC, but acquire properties that allow them to outcompete wildtype cells, facilitating invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Suijkerbuijk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohashi et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, competition between clones within tumors further selects far more aggressive tumor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Parker et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another commonality between developmental and oncogenic cell competition is the involvement of the transmembrane protein Flower (Fwe). In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, multiple isoforms of Fwe signal fitness; expression of Fwe<sup>Lose</sup> isoforms mark losers for elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rhiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madan et al., 2019</xref>). Forced expression of Fwe<sup>Lose</sup> induces cell competition and elimination of the loser, suggesting that Fwe comparison is involved in the sensing and/or initiation of differential fitness. This contrasts with Fmi, whose differential expression does not act as a trigger for competition, but which is needed in winners to allow them to win, suggesting that Fmi is involved after sensing in the execution of functions necessary to manifest winner behavior.</p><p>Evidence is accumulating that a human ortholog of Fmi, CELSR3, is expressed at high levels in a range of solid tumors, including lung, prostate, pancreatic, hepatic, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, and in some cases has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katoh and Katoh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Erkan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goryca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2021c</xref>).

The posterior half was discarded, and the anterior part was inverted, after which the fat body and digestive tissue (mouth hooks, salivary glands, and gut) were removed. Inverted larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)+0.02% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 30 min at room temperature (RT).

Incubations with secondary antibodies were done for 90 min at room temperature in PBS-T. Secondary antibody was washed three times with PBS-T. Incubations in phalloidin (1:200) and DAPI (1 µg/mL), if required, were done in PBS-T for 15 min followed by washing at room temperature before mounting. Stained samples were mounted in 15 μL Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs).

We used the following secondary antibodies from Thermo Scientific: 488-goat α-rabbit, 546-goat α-mouse, 594-donkey α-mouse, 647-donkey α-mouse, Alexa 635- and Alexa 350-conjugated phalloidin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>Images of whole discs were taken with a Leica SP8 system equipped with a White Light Laser and HyD detectors. A ×40, NA 1.5 Leica objective and 1.51 refractive index immersion oil were used. Image stacks were taken in 8-bit at 1024×1024 px resolution, and a pinhole of 1 airy unit (AU), using a z-step of 0.3 μM. For automated image quantification pipelines, residual tissue from the leg or haltere discs was removed in Fiji (fiji.sc, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the peripodial cells at the apical section of the Z-stack.</p><p>Adult eyes and RFP/GFP signal from pupae and eye discs isolated from late third instar larvae were imaged on a Leica MZ16F Stereomicroscope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Eye disc clone analysis</title><p>Eye imaginal discs representative slices were selected to measure the size of RFP+ clones.

Cell ratios were obtained as the fraction of GFP+ cells vs RFP+ twin spot cells. Cell ratios were transformed as the log10(ratio) and graphed as violin plots including all data points, median, and quartiles. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 10. Data was analyzed using either unpaired, two-tailed t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), or an ordinary one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Apoptosis quantification</title><p>Apoptotic cells marked with positive Dcp1 staining were scored when located one to three cells away from a clone boundary, as those were arbitrarily deemed as caused by cell competition.

The difference in apoptosis between WT and &gt;&gt;Myc (or &gt;&gt;Myc, <italic>fmi<sup>E59</sup></italic>), GFP+ cells in each disc was then calculated (GFP minus WT cells) and plotted on the right. The mean difference of the analysis was also plotted in the same graph as a dashed line. The statistical differences were obtained using a paired, two-tailed t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Cell proliferation quantification</title><p>Clone proliferation ratios were measured in ImageJ. First, we obtained the number of GFP+ cells vs the cells outside the GFP+ clones by using the same macros used to quantify GFP clones and then counting the total cells in the disc by counting the DAPI nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez Bosch and Axelrod, 2024</xref>), and then subtracting the GFP+ cells from the total DAPI cell counts. Then, pHis3-positive cells were located by using the 3D Find maxima function from the ImageJ 3D Suite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mcib3d.frama.io/3d-suite-imagej/">https://mcib3d.frama.io/3d-suite-imagej/</ext-link>). To do so, the pHis3 channel was processed as follows: (1) specks were removed by using the Remove Outliers (radius of 5, threshold of 50), then the background was removed with a 2<italic>P</italic>x 3D Gaussian Blur and the Subtract background function (rolling ball radius = 10 px, with sliding parabolic and disabled smoothing). Last, the pHis3+ peaks were found using the 3D Maxima finder (minimum threshold of 5 px, with a XY and Z radius of 3 px and discarding all peaks below the noise level of 20).</p><p>GFP+, pHis3 cells were obtained by first creating a binary mask of the GFP channel by smoothing the image with a 5 px 3D Gaussian blur and then using a Li threshold to create the mask. To ensure proper quantification, correct thresholding of the clones was visually assessed and adjusted when needed. Then, all pHis3 peaks that were inside the GFP+ clone were counted as proliferative GFP+ cells. Last the proliferative ratio of GFP+ cells was obtained by dividing the fraction of pHis3 cells inside GFP clones by the fraction of pHis3 cells outside of GFP+ clones. The log10 of the proliferative ratio was plotted as a violin plot representing each disc as a data point and indicating the median and quartiles. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 10. Data was analyzed using an ordinary one-way ANOVA and the groups were compared to each other using a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98535-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for figure and figure supplements.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98535-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All images acquired for the study are available in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/">BioStudies</ext-link> database under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1513">S-BIAD1513</ext-link>.

While Flamingo depletion has no impact on tumour growth (upon induction of Ras and depletion of Scribble throughout the eye disc), and no impact when depleted in WT cells, it specifically tunes down winner clone expansion in various genetic contexts, including the overexpression of Myc, the combination of Scribble depletion with activation of Ras in clones or the early clonal depletion of Scribble in eye disc. Flamingo depletion reduces proliferation rate and increases the rate of apoptosis in the winner clones, hence reducing their competitiveness up to forcing their full elimination (hence becoming now &quot;loser&quot;). This function of Flamingo in cell competition is specific of Flamingo as it cannot be recapitulated with other components of the PCP pathway, does not rely on interaction of Flamingo in trans, nor on the presence of its cadherin domain. Thus, this function is likely to rely on a non-canonical function of Flamingo which may rely on downstream GPCR signaling.</p><p>This unexpected function of Flamingo is by itself very interesting. In the framework of cell competition, these results are also important as they describe, to my knowledge, one of the only genetic conditions that specifically affect the winner cells without any impact when depleted in the loser cells. Moreover, Flamingo do not just suppress the competitive advantage of winner clones, but even turn them in putative losers. This specificity, while not clearly understood at this stage, opens a lot of exciting mechanistic questions, but also a very interesting long term avenue for therapeutic purpose as targeting Flamingo should then affect very specifically the putative winner/oncogenic clones without any impact in WT cells.</p><p>The data and the demonstration are very clean and compelling, with all the appropriate controls, proper quantifications and backed-up by observations in various tissues and genetic backgrounds.

The biggest concern is the overstatement of the results that loss of fmi from Myc-overexpressing clones turns them into losers. This is not shown in a compelling manner in the revised manuscript and the authors need to tone down their language or perform more experiments to support their claims. Additionally, the data about apoptosis is not sufficiently explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We take issue with this reviewer’s framing of their criticism. First, the reviewer is selectively reporting the results published in PMID: 20679206. They correctly state that those authors show that small discreet clones of RasV12 lgl are eliminated (Fig. 3B), but they omit the fact that the authors also show that larger RasV12 lgl clones induce apoptosis in the surrounding wild type cells, and therefore behave as winners (Fig. 3C). Hence, the size of the clone appears to determine its winner/loser status. Of course, lgl is not scrib, and it is not a certainty that they would behave similarly, but they also show that large RasV12 scrib clones induce considerable apoptosis of the neighboring wild type cells.</p><p>The reviewer then discusses “continuous” clones induced by ey-flp, as we use in our manuscript. Here, the term “continuous” is probably misleading; because ey is expressed ubiquitously in the disc from early in development, it is most likely the case that the majority of cells have flipped relatively early, resulting in ~half the cells becoming clone and the other ~half twin spot. The clone cells then likely fuse to make larger clones. We show that ey-flp induced RasV12 scrib clones also behave as winners. It is logical to conclude that this is because they are large. The reviewer talks about “a privileged environment that insulates them from competition,” but if they were insulated from competition, how could they become winners? Because they occupy more territory than the wild type cells, and because they induce apoptosis in the wild type neighbors, they are winners.</p><p>Having shown that ey-flp induced RasV12 scrib clones behave as winners, we then remove Fmi from these clones, and show that they behave as losers by the same criteria: they occupy less area than the wild type cells (our Fig. 1 and Fig. 1 Supp 2), and they induce apoptosis in the wild type cells (our Fig 4A-H).</p><p>With respect to the comment about additional experiments are needed to support the claim that loss of Fmi from Myc winners converts them to losers, we’re not sure what additional data the reviewer would want. As for the tumor clones, we show that &gt;&gt;Myc clones get bigger than the twin control clones (Fig. 2), and we measure similar low levels of apoptosis in each (Fig. 4I-K, O). In contrast &gt;&gt;Myc fmi clones are out-grown by wild type clones, and apoptosis is higher in the &gt;&gt;Myc fmi clones than in the wild type clones (Fig. 4L-N, P-S). We therefore believe it is correct to say that &gt;&gt;Myc clones become losers when Fmi is removed.</p><p>In additional comments, the reviewer takes issue with using winner and loser language at the point in the manuscript where we have only shown the clone sizes but not yet the apoptosis data, and about this we agree. We have changed the language accordingly.</p><p>Re explanation of the apoptosis data, see the response to reviewer #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Bosch et al. reveal Flamingo (Fmi), a planar cell polarity (PCP) protein, is essential for maintaining 'winner' cells in cell competition, using <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal epithelia as a model.

While induction of apoptosis and JNK activation are commonly observed outcomes in various cell competition conditions, it is crucial to determine the specific mechanisms through which they are induced in fmi-depleted clones.

Here, our goal is to report the phenomenon. We understand and share with the reviewer the interest in better understanding the relationship between Fmi and JNK signaling in competition. The role of JNK in competition, tumorigenesis and cell death is infamously complex. In some preliminary experiments, we explored some epistasis experiments, but these were inconclusive so we elected to not report them here.

The biggest concern is the overstatement of the results that loss of fmi from Myc-overexpressing clones turns them into losers. This is not shown in a compelling manner in the revised manuscript and the authors need to tone down their language or perform more experiments to support their claims.</p><p>(1) I do not agree with the language used by the authors last paragraph of p. 4 stating loss of fmi from Myc supercompetitors (Fig. 2) makes them losers. At this point in the paper, they only use clone size as a readout. By definition, losers in imaginal discs die by apoptosis, which is not measured in this figure. As such, the authors do not prove that fmi-mutant Myc over-expressing clones are now losers at this point in the manuscript. The authors should discuss this in the results section regarding Fig. 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the language in text and figure legend to acknowledge that the clone size data alone do not demonstrate competition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to point #1, I do not agree with the language in the legend of Fig. 2H that the graph is measuring &quot;supercompetition&quot;. They are only measuring clone ratios, not apoptosis. Growing to a smaller size does not make a clone have loser status without also assessing cell death.</p><p>(a) I suggest that the authors remove the sentence &quot;A ratio over 0 indicates supercompetition of nGFP+ clones, and below 0 indicates nGFP+ cells are losers.&quot; in the legend to Fig. 2H. Instead, they should describe the assay in times of clone ratios.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid point, as at this point in the manuscript we did not quantify cell death and proliferation. However, based on decades of knowledge of supercompetiton, Myc clones are classified as super-competitors in every instance they’ve been studied. (Myc clones show apoptosis when competing with WT cells, while at the same time they eliminate WT neighbors by apoptosis to become winners. Their faster proliferation rate may be what ultimately makes them winners.) We changed the language to address this distinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Fig. 4, they do attempt to monitor apoptosis, which is the fate of bona fide losers in imaginal tissue. However, I have several concerns about these data (panels 4I-K, O and P have been added to the revised manuscript.)</p><p>(a) In Fig. 4I-K, why is there no death of WT cells which would be expected based on de la Cova Cell 2004? The authors need to comment on this.</p><p>(b) Cell death should also be observed in the Myc over-expressing clones but none is seen in this disc (see de la Cova 2004 and PMID: 18257071 Fig. 4). The authors need to comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand why the reviewer raises these two points. We see some cell death in &gt;Myc eye discs both in winners and losers, as displayed in the graph. In our hands, the levels were on average very low. The example shown is representative of the analysis and shows apoptosis both in WT and &gt;Myc cells, highlighted by the arrows in 4J. We added a mention to the arrows in the figure legend to make it clearer. In the main text, we already compared our observations to the same publication the reviewer mentions (De la Cova 2004).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) The data in panel 4O is not explained sufficiently in the legend or results section. What do the lines between the data points in the left side of the panel mean? Why is there a bunch of clustered data points in the right part of the Fig. 4O, when two different genotypes are listed below? I would have expected two clusters of points. The authors need to comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to convey as much information as possible in an informative manner in these graphs, and we regret not explaining better the analysis shown. We modified the legends for the apoptosis analysis to better explain the displayed data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) What is the sample size (n) for the genotypes listed in this figure? The authors need to comment on this and explicitly list the sample size in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the n for both conditions to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(e) In panels 4L-N, why is the death occurring in the apparent center of the fmiE59&gt;&gt;Myc clone. If these clones are truly losers as the authors claim, then apoptosis should be seen at the boundaries between the fmiE59&gt;&gt;Myc clone and the WT clones. The results in this figure are not compelling, yet this is the critical piece of data to support their claim that fmiE59&gt;&gt;Myc clone are losers. The authors need to comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>The majority of cell death in this example is observed 1-3 cells away from the clone boundary. In some cases, we observe cell death farther from the boundary, but those cells were not counted in our analyses. As described in our methods, we only considered for the analysis cells at the clone boundary or in the vicinity, as those are the ones that most probably have apoptosis triggered by the neighboring clone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(f) There is no red line in Fig. 4O and 4P, in contrast to what is written in the legend in the revised manuscript. This should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching the error about the line. We have now simplified the graph by removing the line at Y=0 and just leave one dashed line, representing the mean difference between WT and &gt;&gt;Myc cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) On p. 10, the reference Harvey and Tapon 2007 to support hpo-/- supercompetitor status is incorrect.

And additionally, in the dissection methods: “Third instar wandering larvae (120 hrs AEL) were dissected…” We have included in this revision the length of the heat-shock (15 min).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have read the rebuttal and some of my concerns are not sufficiently addressed.</p><p>(8) I raised the point of continuously-generated clones becoming large enough to evade competition, and I disagree with the authors' reply. I think that competition of RasV12, scrib (or lgl) competition largely depends the size of the clone, which is de facto larger when generated by continuous expression of flp (such as eyeless or tubulin promoters used in this study). I think that at that point, we are at an impasse with respect to this issue, but I wanted to register my disagreement for the record. Related to this, one possible reason for the fragmentation of the fmimutant Myc overexpressing clones in the wing disc is because they were not continuously generated and hence did not merge with other clones.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the discussion above in the public comments. We remain unclear about what, exactly, the reviewer disagrees. As stated above, we think they are correct that the size of the clone is critical in determining winner vs loser status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Although the authors have addressed some of my concerns, I still feel that a detailed mechanistic understanding is essential. I hope the authors will conduct additional experiments to solve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We also consider the mechanism of interest and will pursue this in the future. To test our hypotheses we require a set of genetic mutants that are still in the making that will help us dissect the function and potential partners of Fmi, and we hope to have these results in a future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>- There is no clear demonstration that the relative decrease of clone size in UASMyc/Fmi mutant is mostly driven by either a context dependant suppression of growth and/or an increase of apoptosis (the latter being the more classic feature of loser phenotype).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that it is driven by both, and refrain from making assumptions about the magnitude of contribution from each. This question is something that we will be interested to explore in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The distribution of cell death in Fmi/UAS-Myc mutant is somehow surprising and may not fit with most of the competition scenarios where death is mostly restricted to clone periphery (although this may be quite variable and would require much more quantification to be clear).</p></disp-quote><p>While we observe some cell death far from clone boundaries, most of the dying cells are a few cells away from a clone boundary. In other publications quantifying cell death, examples of cell death farther from the boundary are not rare (See for example Moreno and Basler 2004 Fig 6, De la Cova et al. Fig 2, Meyer et al 2014 Fig 2). We did not count cells dying far from clone boundaries in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I just noticed a few mistakes in the legend :</p><p>Figure 3M legend is missing (it would be useful to know at which stage the quantification is performed)</p></disp-quote><p>Another reviewer brought to our attention the problems with Fig 3 legend. We restored the missing parts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be good to give an estimate of the number of larvae observed when showing the representative cases in Figure 1 .</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We now include these numbers in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
