activities. Volume transmission is the major mode for 5-HT transmission but mechanisms underlying 5-HT signaling are still largely unknown. Abnormal brain 5-HT levels and function have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Neurexin (<italic>Nrxn</italic>) genes encode presynaptic cell adhesion molecules important for the regulation of synaptic neurotransmitter release, notably glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission. Mutations in <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. However, the role of <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes in the 5-HT system is poorly understood. Here, we generated a mouse model with all three <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes disrupted specifically in 5-HT neurons to study how Nrxns affect 5-HT transmission. Loss of <italic>Nrxns</italic> in 5-HT neurons reduced the number of serotonin neurons in the early postnatal stage, impaired 5-HT release, and decreased 5-HT release sites and serotonin transporter expression. Furthermore, 5-HT neuron-specific <italic>Nrxn</italic> knockout reduced sociability and increased depressive-like behavior. Our results highlight functional roles for Nrxns in 5-HT neurotransmission, 5-HT neuron survival, and the execution of complex behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurexin</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitters</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH130582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Futai</surname><given-names>Kensuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS085215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Futai</surname><given-names>Kensuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM107000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30MH122146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules in the serotonin system which regulate neuron survival and serotonin neuromodulation through active zone formation and serotonin release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neurons in the raphe nuclei (RN) project their axons throughout the brain and modulate social interactions, stress responses, and valence among other processes. Abnormalities in 5-HT signaling have been extensively reported in neuropsychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia (SCZ), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lesch and Waider, 2012</xref>). 5-HT reaches postsynaptic specializations through volume transmission or at synapses and synaptic triads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belmer et al., 2017</xref>). While much work has focused on deciphering receptor and reuptake dynamics in 5-HT signaling, the functional component important for 5-HT release remains undefined.</p><p>Nrxn genes (<italic>Nrxn1-3</italic>) encode alpha-, beta-, and gamma- (<italic>Î±/Î²Nrxn1-3, Î³Nrxn1</italic>) isoforms, and regulate synapse specification and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>). Copy number variations and mutations in Nrxns are associated with ASD and SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>). Numerous studies of <italic>Î±</italic> and <italic>Î²Nrxn</italic> KO mice demonstrate impaired excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>). While Nrxns regulate fast synaptic transmission, no studies have examined the role of Nrxns in central neuromodulatory systems like the 5-HT system. Therefore, elucidating the impact of Nrxns in 5-HT transmission will allow a better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the functions of Nrxns in the 5-HT system by assessing signaling properties and behavior in 5-HT neuron-specific Nrxn triple knockout (TKO) mice. We demonstrated that the loss of <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes reduced 5-HT release and the number of 5-HT neurons and release sites in the mouse brain. Moreover, the lack of Nrxns in 5-HT neurons altered social behavior and depressive-like phenotypes. Our findings highlight Nrxns as functional regulators of 5-HT signaling and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of <italic>Nrxn</italic> isoforms in 5-HT neurons and validation of the Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mouse line</title><p>To characterize <italic>Nrxn</italic> genes expressed in 5-HT neurons, we analyzed scRNAseq data from a published database consisting of over 900 single-cell 5-HT neuron datasets (~1 million reads/cell) which generated 11 different 5-HT neuron clusters from the principal dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), caudal DRN (cDRN), and median raphe nucleus (MRN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ren et al., 2019</xref>).

The RFP/5-HT ratio between Cntl and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice was comparable at P7 but reduced by increasing age specifically in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice suggesting the postnatal loss of Cre-positive 5-HT neurons in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice. To further elucidate the mechanism underlying reduced 5-HT release in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice, we confirmed the expression of RIM, a major active zone protein, in synaptophysin-positive 5-HT terminals in ultra-thin sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

To examine the role of Nrxns in 5-HT system-related behaviors, we next assessed social behavior. Cntl and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO underwent a direct social interaction test to examine naturally occurring interactions between a subject mouse and a juvenile stimulus mouse. In trial 1, the stimulus mouse was unfamiliar to the subject mouse. After 24 hr, the subject mouse was re-exposed to the same stimulus mouse (trial 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Social investigation was measured across both trials and as a reduction in time that the subject mouse spent investigating the stimulus mouse in trial 2. We found that Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice spent less time exploring the stimulus mouse in trial 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and differed in their investigation of the stimulus mouse across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) compared with littermate Ctnl mice. These results suggest that Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice have deficits in sociability. To further study sociability in the Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice, we performed a three-chamber social interaction test (3CST), in which a stimulus mouse was confined to a cylinder to limit direct interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Both littermate Cntl and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice showed similar preferences for a stimulus mouse than for a second empty cylinder in a different chamber (days 1 and 2) and for a novel stimulus mouse than for the previously encountered juvenile conspecific (day 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Cntl and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice showed different investigation behavior on day 1. However, there were no differences in exploration time between groups which contrasts the sociability deficits observed in the direct social interaction test.

The study of cerebellins, secreted protein-binding partners of Nrxns, indirectly implicates Nrxns in serotonergic system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Seigneur et al., 2021</xref>). While cerebellin knockout was shown to alter DRN 5-HTergic circuits, Nrxn roles in central neuromodulatory systems have never been addressed. Here, we provide evidence that Nrxns control neuromodulatory 5-HT release. We found that the DRN and hippocampus displayed &gt;40% reduction in 5-HT release in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice. Fev expression begins in the embryonic stage and is found in a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons (~60% of 5-HT neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Scott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Therefore, the impact of Nrxn TKO during development and non-Cre expressing 5-HT neurons should be noted. However, consistent with the robust functional deficit observed in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice, the structural deficit identified by RFP-positive fiber and release site densities were significant (&gt;50%), suggesting that the roles of Nrxns in the 5-HT system are cell survival and the formation of functional components important for 5-HT release.</p><p>Given the predominance of non-junctional specializations, we speculate that Nrxns reside at 5-HT release sites that lack a direct postsynaptic target. The ability of Nrxns to couple with release machinery triggering 5-HT vesicle exocytosis and their roles in postsynaptic differentiation at synapses are yet to be explored. Decreased 5-HT neuron number and release sites suggest that 5-HTergic Nrxns contribute to cell survival and fiber formation. Indeed, Nrxns are important for cerebellar granule cell survival through regulating the autocrine neurotrophic-factor (NTF) secretory machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Uemura et al., 2022</xref>). Sparse pan-Nrxn deletion has also been shown to blunt inferior olive neuron climbing fiber projections in the cerebellum while complete removal of Nrxns at climbing fiber synapses did not alter climbing fiber axons but impaired synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). It is interesting that the loss of Cre+ 5-HT Nrxn TKO neurons is limited to the early postnatal stage. This may suggest that matured 5-HT neurons use the NTF supply from surrounding non-5-HT and Cre-negative 5-HT neurons. The possibility of Cre expression altering properties related to 5-HT neuron function in place of Nrxn deletion cannot be excluded. Further investigation is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cell death in Nrxn TKO 5-HT neurons.</p><p>Overall behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of ASD in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice are milder than null Nrxn KO mouse lines, suggesting that Nrxns in other cell types are also important in complex behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Born et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dachtler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Etherton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grayton et al., 2013</xref>). The observed deficits in sociability in the direct social interaction test and in the depressive-related forced swim test contrast the normal behaviors of Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice in the 3CST and tail suspension tests. The 3CST limits direct interaction with a stimulus mouse and it is possible that the mode and novelty, as there were genotype differences observed on initial encounter, of social interaction are critical to Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice. Additionally, the forced swim test was performed following the tail suspension test, and it is possible that Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice are more susceptible to stress rather than despair-associated coping responses. Of note, the <italic>Fev<sup>Cre</sup></italic> line limits Cre expression in up to 60% of 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), indicating a need for a more 5-HT neuron-specific Cre line to fully understand the roles of 5-HTergic Nrxns in animal behaviors.</p><p>Our results reveal that Nrxns expressed in midbrain 5-HT neurons are important for cell survival and maintaining the presynaptic molecular function of 5-HT release sites.

For each section, two z-stack steps at 10â15 Âµm spacing were used to image the different 5-HT neuron populations. The ratios obtained from four to six images from each brain were averaged to generate a mean for the MRN and DRN of each animal. Images from the DRN and MRN were acquired using identical settings, and data analyses were performed using ImageJ as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Uchigashima et al., 2020a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>RIM1/2 density analysis</title><p>We analyzed RIM1/2 expression in 5-HT terminals projected in the CA1 pyramidal layer. To assess the density of RIM1/2 puncta in RFP- and SERT-positive fibers, four stained sections from each of four Fev/RFP (Cntl) and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO brains containing the dorsal hippocampus were imaged (1024 Ã 1024 pixels) using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, FV1200) with a Ã60 oil-immersion objective (NA 1.4). For each brain, 10â15 consecutive images were acquired with 0.2 Âµm steps and 18â33 RPF-/SERT-positive fibers were chosen. Because confocal microscopes can reach <italic>z</italic>-axis resolutions of 500 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schermelleh et al., 2010</xref>), we measured the RIM signal found in two or more consecutive RFP-/SERT-positive terminals. RPF-/SERT-positive fibers in Cntl (81 fibers) and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO (78) mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3 mice per genotype), respectively, were subjected to imaging analysis using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>All electrophysiological experiments were performed on male mice aged 10 weeks or older. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were removed and quickly cooled in ice-cold, pre-oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) aCSF containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 11 <sc>D</sc>-glucose, 0.4 ascorbic acid, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Coronal slices (400 Âµm) containing the dorsal hippocampus or DRN were prepared in ice-cold aCSF using a vibratome (VT1200 S, Leica Biosystems). Slices were recovered in oxygenated aCSF at room temperature (22â24Â°C) for at least 1 hr before use. Slices were then transferred to a recording chamber perfused at a rate of 1 ml/min with room temperature, oxygenated aCSF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry</title><p>5-HT measurements were performed in the radiatum of dorsal CA3 and DRN. All experiments and analyses were performed blind to genotype. To detect 5-HT release, carbon-fiber electrodes were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hashemi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matsui and Alvarez, 2018</xref>). Carbon-fiber electrodes consisted of 7-Âµm diameter carbon fibers (Goodfellow) inserted into a glass pipette (A-M Systems, cat# 602500) with ~150â200 Âµm of exposed fiber. The exposed carbon fibers were soaked in isopropyl alcohol for 30 min to clean the surface. Next, the exposed fibers were coated with Nafion solution (Sigma) to improve detection sensitivity by inserting the carbon fiber into Nafion solution dropped in a 3-mm diameter circle of twisted reference Ag/AgCl wire for 30 s with constant application of +1.0 V potential. The carbon-fiber electrodes were air dried for 5 min and then placed in a 70Â°C oven for 10 min. A modified 5-HT voltage ramp was used, in which the carbon-fiber electrode was held at +0.2 V and scanned to +1.0 V, down to â0.1 V, and back to +0.2 V at 1000 V/s delivered every 100ms. Prior to recording, the electrodes were conditioned in aCSF with a voltage ramp delivered at 60 Hz for 10 min.</p><p>5-HT release was evoked with electrical stimulation (30 pulses, 30 Hz, 150 or 250 ÂµA, 1 ms) from an adjacent custom-made bipolar tungsten electrode every 10 min. The stimulating electrode was placed ~100â200 Âµm away from the carbon-fiber electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">John et al., 2006</xref>). Recordings were performed using a Chem-Clamp amplifier (Dagan Corporation) and Digidata 1550B after low-pass filter at 3 kHz and digitization at 100 kHz. Data were acquired using pClamp10 (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with custom written VIGOR software using Igor Pro 8 (32-bit; Wavemetrics) running mafPC (courtesy of M.A. Xu-Friedman). Carbon-fiber electrodes were calibrated with 1 ÂµM 5-HT (Serotonin HCl, Sigma) at the end of the experiment to convert peak current amplitude of 5-HT transients to concentration. Three consecutive traces were averaged from each recording condition for analysis. Background-subtracted peak 5-HT transients and area under the curve were determined by subtracting the current remaining after TTX (tetrodotoxin citrate, Hello Bio) application from the maximum current measured. Dopamine HCl and FLX HCl were obtained from Sigma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>All behavioral experiments were performed on male mice aged 8 weeks or older. Animals were habituated to the testing room for at least 30 min before each experiment and all tests were conducted under dim red-light conditions and white noise to maintain a constant ambient sound unless otherwise noted. All experiments and analyses were performed blind to genotype. Animals were used in only one behavioral paradigm for the direct social interaction test and fear conditioning. Mice underwent tests for locomotion, anxiety, repetitive behaviors, and depression in the following order: locomotor activity, open field, elevated plus-maze, grooming, marble burying, tail suspension test, and forced swim test. At least 2 days of rest were given in between all tests except for the tail suspension test and forced swim test, during which mice were allowed to rest for at least 7 days in between. Another cohort of mice completed the object interaction test followed by at least 2 days of rest before undergoing rotarod. Behavioral testing apparatuses were cleaned with 0.1% Micro-90 (International Products Corporation) between each mouse.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Locomotor activity</title><p>Locomotor activity of each mouse was tracked in photobeam activity chambers (San Diego Instruments) for 90 min.

Each mouse was placed individually into a standard mouse cage and allowed to habituate for 5 min followed by the introduction of a novel male juvenile mouse. The activity was monitored for 10 min and social behavior initiated by the subject mouse was measured by an experimenter sitting approximately 2 m from the testing cage with a silenced stopwatch. Scored behaviors were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kogan et al., 2000</xref>): direct contact with the juvenile including grooming and pawing, sniffing including the anogenital area and mouth and close following (within 1 cm) of the juvenile. After 24 hr, the 10 min test was run again with the previously encountered mouse. Any aggressive encounters observed between animals led to exclusion of the subject mouse from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-6"><title>Three-chamber social interaction test</title><p>Using a standard three-chamber design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moy et al., 2004</xref>), the apparatus consisted of a neutral central zone (18 Ã 40.5 Ã 22 cm) connecting two identical compartments (each 19.5 Ã 40.5 Ã 22 cm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Molas et al., 2017</xref>). Each of the outer compartments housed a caged cylinder (8 cm diameter, 18 cm height; 1 cm between each vertical rod) to allow limited, but direct physical contact between the subject and stimulus animals. Subject mice were placed in the central zone and habituated to an empty apparatus for 5 min then briefly removed to place a juvenile mouse under one of the two caged cylinders while the other caged cylinder remained empty (counterbalanced). The subject mouse was then returned to the apparatus to freely explore all three compartments for 5 min/day for three consecutive days using the same juvenile placed in the same compartment. On day 3, a novel juvenile mouse was placed in the empty caged cylinder. On days 1 and 2, the preference ratio was calculated as: (total social stimulus investigation â total nonsocial stimulus investigation)/(total investigation).

Animals were not habituated in the testing room to avoid untimely association with auditory cues. Using the ANY-maze fear conditioning system (Ugo Basile SRL), mice were placed in a fear conditioning cage (17 Ã 17 Ã 25 cm) in a sound-attenuating box. The paradigm was performed under no light conditions using two different contexts (context A and B). Mice underwent four phases with 24 hr in between each session: habituation, acquisition, auditory recall, and contextual recall. On day 1 (context A), mice were habituated to five 30-s presentations of the CS+ and CSâ (white noise) at 80 dB sound pressure level. The inter-cue interval was pseudorandomized and each session with the CS+ or CSâ was 10 min. The presentation order of the CS+ and CSâ trials were counterbalanced across animals. On day 2 (context A), discriminative fear conditioning was performed by pairing the CS+ with a US (1 s foot shock, 0.75 mA, 5 CS+/US pairings; intertrial interval: 22â125 s). The onset of the US coincided with the last second of the CS+. On day 3, auditory recall was measured in context B with five presentations of CS+ and CSâ. On day 4, the contextual recall was measured in context A for 10 min. ANY-maze software was used to analyze freezing behavior (no movement detected for 1 s), which was scored automatically with an infrared photobeam assay in the fear conditioning cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-10"><title>Object interaction test</title><p>The test was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Molas et al., 2017</xref>.

Mice were placed in the start arm to habituate to the apparatus for 5 min. Following habituation, they were presented with identical inanimate objects located at opposite ends of the T-maze arms for 5 min/day on two consecutive days.

Neurexin loss-of-function has been linked to multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but it is unknown which synapses are affected upon Neurexin loss to cause the characteristic clinical features. It is in this context that the present paper makes an interesting contribution. The manuscript shows that deletion of all Neurexins specifically in serotonergic neurons causes a defect in serotonin release in various brain regions and subtle ASD-like and depression-related behavioural defects. These interesting observations show that not only fast-acting transmitter systems but also modulatory ones depend on Neurexin function, and they are in accord with the notion that defects in serotonergic signalling contribute critically to the clinical features of neuropsychiatric disorders caused by Neurexin loss. However, the present study contains several loose ends that prevent clear-cut conclusions. Most importantly, (i) it remains unclear whether Neurexin loss causes a genuine defect in the serotonin release machinery or simply a reduction of serotonergic axons and release sites, and (ii) the behavioral data require complementary readouts to bolster the still preliminary findings.</p><p>The present paper clearly has potential, but appears premature in its current form, even for a short-report-like submission. It documents two interesting initial discoveries, but contains several related loose ends that prevent clear-cut conclusions, as the authors themselves concede in the second and the last paragraphs of their discussion.</p><p>1. The voltammetry data in Figure 2 show nicely and convincingly that 5-HT release is reduced in Fev-Cre- Neurexin-TKO dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus. It remains unclear, though, whether this phenotype is due to a genuine defect in the 5-HT release machinery or to a reduction of 5-HT axons and release sites in the two brain regions tested, as Figure 3 would indicate. Given the known functions of Neurexins, this is an important distinction that needs to be assessed. This issue could, for instance, be addressed in tissue or neurons of Fev-Cre- Neurexin-TKO and control mice by (i) directly measuring triggered synaptic vesicle fusion in 5-HT terminals using SynaptopHluorin or a related reporter after cell-type specific expression, or by (ii) quantitatively assessing components of the transmitter release machinery or of synaptic vesicle clusters in SERT-positive axons. Furthermore, the data shown in Figure 3 should be complemented by Western blot analyses of SERT levels in hippocampus and dorsal raphe nucleus, which is more sensitive and easier to quantify than immunolabeling in tissue.</p><p>2. The behavioral data in Figure 4 indicate subtle ASD-like and depression-related defects in the Fev-Cre- Neurexin-TKO. This is clearly interesting. However, complementary readouts would bolster the still preliminary findings, e.g. the three-chamber test to study sociability and social memory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Cheung et al. investigate the role of the Neurexin family of synaptic adhesion proteins in regulating the function of serotonergic neurotransmission. The function of presynaptic Neurexins has been extensively characterized in the regulation of fast synaptic transmission, but whether they also play a role in neuromodulatory systems such as the serotonergic system remains largely unknown. This question is particularly pertinent given that both Neurexins and serotonergic signaling have been linked to the etiology of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. To address this issue, the authors first demonstrate that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus express multiple Neurexin isoforms. The authors then delete all Neurexin isoforms specifically from these neurons, and investigate the consequences on 5-HT (serotonin) release, serotonergic innervation, and behavior. They report a substantial reduction in 5-HT release in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus, accompanied by a modest reduction in serotonin receptor (SERT)-positive fibers as well as alterations in social and depression-like behaviors.</p><p>This study addresses an important and timely question. While the molecular mechanisms that govern fast synaptic neurotransmission have been the subject of extensive investigation over several decades, the equivalent mechanisms at neuromodulatory release sites have received far less attention. In recent years this is beginning to change, and the present observation that Neurexins regulate serotonergic neurotransmission provides an interesting contribution to this growing field. The experiments appear thoroughly and carefully conducted, and the manuscript and figures are very well prepared and clearly presented. The behavioral characterization is comprehensive and well executed, even though only a few selective behavioral abnormalities were observed.</p><p>However, the conclusions that can be drawn from the present study are somewhat limited in scope, due to the lack of any mechanistic experiments that may begin to explain the observed phenotypes. The study is purely descriptive, and the analysis of serotonergic signaling is essentially limited to the analysis of two relatively general functional parameters, i.e. 5-HT release and density of SERT-positive fibers. Given what is previously known about the role of Neurexin in fast synaptic transmission, many questions arise regarding the mechanisms by which Neurexins may function in a system that is primarily geared toward volume transmission and in which most release sites do not have an associated postsynaptic structure. Importantly, the authors do acknowledge the need for detailed mechanistic studies, and they are careful to present only conclusions that are supported by their data. Nevertheless, additional mechanistic experiments would help to strengthen the notion that Neurexins are important players in serotonergic signaling.</p><p>1. The authors state that &quot;Given the predominance of non-junctional specializations, we speculate that Nrxns reside at 5-HT release sites that lack a direct postsynaptic target&quot; (Discussion, p. 7). This is an interesting point and one that could be expanded further, including experimentally. Could it be shown experimentally that Neurexins are present at non-synaptic structures? What extracellular interaction partners might they bind to here?</p><p>2. The authors state that their data indicate &quot;that the primary role of Nrxns in the 5-HT system is the formation of functional components important for 5-HT release&quot; (Discussion, p. 7). This too could be tested experimentally, e.g. through immunohistochemical oder ultrastructural analysis of presynaptic terminals.</p><p>3. What are the consequences of conditional single deletion of Nrxn1, 2 or 3 on the key phenotypes?</p><p>4. Please state whether all experiments were conducted blind to genotype. This is mentioned in some but not in other sections, leaving the impression that not all experiments were conducted blind to genotype â is this true? If so, it should be stated explicitly.</p><p>5. Were any controls conducted with Fev-Cre mice alone to exclude an effect of Cre expression on serotonergic synaptic transmission and behavior, or have these controls been previously published? If not, please discuss the possibility that the observed changes may result from Fev-Cre expression rather than from the deletion of Neurexins.</p><p>6. For the behavioral experiments, mice were used at age 8 weeks or older. Is this also true for the other experiments? Please state the age range used for each experiment.</p><p>7. Please state the genetic background for the mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is the first to report effects of genetic deletion of neurexins from serotonergic neurons. The authors used a nice combination of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with electrical stimulation to assess serotonin release, immunofluorescence for serotonin transporter, and a wide range of behavioral assays. Loss of neurexins reduced serotonin release and serotonin transporter immunoreactivity in the dorsal raphe nucleus and dorsal hippocampus. The conditional knockout mice showed reduced social interaction and increased depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. These data constitute strong evidence for a function of neurexins in serotonergic neurons in neurotransmission and in a subset of behaviors. Overall, the conclusions are well supported by the data. This analysis of the role of neurexins in serotonergic neurons is an important contribution to the field.</p><p>1. One aspect which would benefit from further analysis is a more in-depth study of exactly how serotonergic axons and release sites are altered upon loss of neurexins. As the authors discuss, the observed difference in SERT immunofluorescence could reflect a difference in axon arbors or a difference in SERT overall expression or local aggregation. Since the conditional KO mice include a tdTomato reporter, is there enough signal from the tdTomato (alone or amplified by immunostaining) to determine whether loss of neurexins affects the axon arbors? Overall expression of SERT could be assessed by Western blot. It would also be interesting to assess the localization of active zone proteins in the serotonergic axons. Co-labeling of bassoon, ELKS, or RIM with SERT could be assessed by a super-resolution or expansion microscopy approach. Co-labeling of SERT with VGlut3 might also be informative. I do not expect all of these additional experiments to be performed but some further information would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2. While I follow the reason for studying the DRN, it is puzzling to me why the authors focused additionally on the dorsal hippocampus rather than a region with stronger serotonergic innervation. The effect of fluoxetine on the FSCV signal is substantial in DRN but weak in the hippocampus raising some question about specificity of the signal for serotonin.</p><p>3. There is a related publication that was not cited. Seigneur et al. (2021; Molecular Psychiatry; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01187-x) found that Cbln-2 functions in dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in regulating serotonin release and behavior. Since the only known signaling mechanism for Cbln-2 is through a neurexin-Cbln-GluD complex, this indirectly implicates neurexins. It would be a valuable discussion point to compare the current results with those of Seigneur et al. (2021).</p><p>4. It may be best to refer to the control mice as 'control' or 'Con' rather than 'WT' since these were Cre-negative littermates and Fev/RFP mice, thus mostly not strictly WT.</p><p>5. There seems to be very low sensitivity in the Q-PCR assay in Figure 1D, as only 2 or 4 of the 23 control cells showed signal for Nrxn2 and Nrxn3, respectively, although a greater fraction of cells express these genes (panel C). Pooling cells may be preferable. The more effective detection of Nrxn1 in control cells confirms its deletion with Fev-Cre, so it is likely that Nrxn 2 and 3 were also deleted.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neurexins in serotonergic neurons regulate serotonin transmission and complex mouse behaviors&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are three remaining issues that need to be addressed, and a suggestion, as outlined below:</p><p>1. To demonstrate the involvement of Nrxns in 5HT release in the hippocampus, the authors change the statistical analysis in Figures 2F and 2J from a two-way repeated measure ANOVA to a paired t-test. This new statistical analysis now supposedly shows that fluoxetine treatment increases 5HT transients in control mice but not in TKO mice in the hippocampus, leading to the conclusion that &quot;the lack of statistical significance in the TKO group is due to greatly reduced 5-HT release in TKO slices that reaches the limitation of FSCV sensitivity&quot;. However, there is no justification for changing this statistical analysis. The original analysis, which used a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, was fully correct and convincingly demonstrated a lack of a genotype effect (genotype main effect, F1,9 = 0.01351, p = 0.91; drug x genotype interaction, F1,9 = 0.09308, p = 0.7672). The paired t-test now conducted for the revised manuscript is an inappropriate statistical analysis, since there is no statistical comparison of genotypes, only of drug effect within each genotype, making it impossible to make any statistical claims on a genotype effect. This analysis must be corrected back to the original version, i.e. the two-way repeated measures ANOVA, to avoid falsifying the conclusions.</p><p>2. The authors must provide information on the age of the mice used for the RT-PCR and voltammetry experiments (Figures 1 and 2). The only information on the age of mice is given for data in Figures 3 and 4, it appears. To facilitate finding this information, the authors must add a summary of the ages of the mice for all experiments to the 'Animals' section of the Methods part. Given that Nrxns are differentially involved at different time points of synapse development and function, it is important to know at which developmental time points analyses were performed.</p><p>3. As regards additional behavioral experiments, the reviewers acknowledge that the authors did the three-chamber test to assess social interaction, but did not obtain further evidence for ASD-like behavior in the mutants. This warrants a more conservative, differentiated, discussion of the role of defects in the serotonergic system in neuropsychiatric conditions caused by Nrxn loss.</p><p>4. The reviewers suggest including the effect on neuron survival in the title as it is a rather surprising and important finding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85058.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Our collaborators, Drs. Konno and Watanabe, are experts in high-resolution immunohistochemistry imaging and performed confocal imaging against control and TKO tissues given our limited experience with super-resolution microscopy. We first confirmed the expression of active zone proteins, RIM1/2, in SERT-positive fibers in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region in ultra-thin (100 nm) sections (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2) and then measured the density of RIM1/2 in SERT/RFP-positive fibers (Figure 3N and 3O). We believe that using ultra-thin sections as a confirmational experiment allowed us to use our existing resource of confocal microscopy to quantify RIM1/2 proteins localized in serotonergic terminals. Importantly, we found that RIM1/2 density is significantly reduced in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice compared with control mice. This imaging study suggests that Nrxn TKO in 5-HT fibers reduced active zone density and therefore 5-HT release sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice showed similar performance to Cntl mice. However, Cntl and Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice showed different investigation behavior on Day 1. There were no differences in exploration time between groups which contrasts the sociability deficits observed in the direct social interaction test. We consider that the different results of the direct social interaction test and 3CST can be due to two possibilities: (i) 3CST limits direct interaction with a stimulus mouse and it is possible that the mode and novelty of social interaction are critical to Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice, as there were genotype differences observed on initial encounter in both experiments, and (ii) the mild behavioral deficit in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO mice can be due to intact serotonergic circuitry mediated by Cre-negative 5-HT neurons (which constitute approximately 40% of the total 5-HT neurons, Figure 3M).

Were any controls conducted with Fev-Cre mice alone to exclude an effect of Cre expression on serotonergic synaptic transmission and behavior, or have these controls been previously published?

The authors used a nice combination of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with electrical stimulation to assess serotonin release, immunofluorescence for serotonin transporter, and a wide range of behavioral assays. Loss of neurexins reduced serotonin release and serotonin transporter immunoreactivity in the dorsal raphe nucleus and dorsal hippocampus. The conditional knockout mice showed reduced social interaction and increased depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test. These data constitute strong evidence for a function of neurexins in serotonergic neurons in neurotransmission and in a subset of behaviors. Overall, the conclusions are well supported by the data. This analysis of the role of neurexins in serotonergic neurons is an important contribution to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this Reviewerâs comment about our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. One aspect which would benefit from further analysis is a more in-depth study of exactly how serotonergic axons and release sites are altered upon loss of neurexins. As the authors discuss, the observed difference in SERT immunofluorescence could reflect a difference in axon arbors or a difference in SERT overall expression or local aggregation. Since the conditional KO mice include a tdTomato reporter, is there enough signal from the tdTomato (alone or amplified by immunostaining) to determine whether loss of neurexins affects the axon arbors? Overall expression of SERT could be assessed by Western blot. It would also be interesting to assess the localization of active zone proteins in the serotonergic axons. Co-labeling of bassoon, ELKS, or RIM with SERT could be assessed by a super-resolution or expansion microscopy approach. Co-labeling of SERT with VGlut3 might also be informative. I do not expect all of these additional experiments to be performed but some further information would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. First, we performed western blotting against SERT and found that NrxnTKO in 5-HT neurons reduced SERT expression in the brainstem and hippocampus, but not in the midbrain. These results are incorporated in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1. Next, we performed confocal imaging labeling RFP, SERT, and RIM1/2 (active zone marker) in Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO and Fev/RFP (control) mice. Because our department is not equipped to perform super-resolution microscopy, we overcame the z-axis resolution issue by imaging ultra-thin sections (100 nm) and confirmed RIM1/2 expression in SERT fibers. Our new findings strongly support that Nrxn TKO in 5-HT neurons reduces the number of release sites in serotonergic terminals. These results are included in Figures 3N and 3O, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While I follow the reason for studying the DRN, it is puzzling to me why the authors focused additionally on the dorsal hippocampus rather than a region with stronger serotonergic innervation. The effect of fluoxetine on the FSCV signal is substantial in DRN but weak in the hippocampus raising some question about specificity of the signal for serotonin.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on the hippocampal circuit because first, we observed reduced SERT expression in the hippocampus, and second, we observed abnormal direct social interaction which can be regulated by the dorsal hippocampal circuit (Hitti &amp; Siegelbaum, 2014). We apologize that we chose the wrong statistical method to quantify the effect of fluoxetine to confirm 5-HT release in FSCV. In the initial manuscript, we chose a two-way repeated measures ANOVA for this experiment. However, since we are comparing FSCV transients before and after fluoxetine treatment within the genotype, a paired t-test for each genotype should be applied. The new statistical analysis using paired t-test demonstrates statistical significance in control but not Fev/RFP/NrxnTKO hippocampus. We consider that the reason for the lack of statistical significance in the TKO group is due to greatly reduced 5-HT release in TKO slices that reaches the limitation of FSCV sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is a related publication that was not cited. Seigneur et al. (2021; Molecular Psychiatry; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01187-x) found that Cbln-2 functions in dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in regulating serotonin release and behavior. Since the only known signaling mechanism for Cbln-2 is through a neurexin-Cbln-GluD complex, this indirectly implicates neurexins. It would be a valuable discussion point to compare the current results with those of Seigneur et al. (2021).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We included this paper in the Discussion section (page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It may be best to refer to the control mice as 'control' or 'Con' rather than 'WT' since these were Cre-negative littermates and Fev/RFP mice, thus mostly not strictly WT.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We switched our abbreviation from WT to control (Cntl).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There seems to be very low sensitivity in the Q-PCR assay in Figure 1D, as only 2 or 4 of the 23 control cells showed signal for Nrxn2 and Nrxn3, respectively, although a greater fraction of cells express these genes (panel C). Pooling cells may be preferable. The more effective detection of Nrxn1 in control cells confirms its deletion with Fev-Cre, so it is likely that Nrxn 2 and 3 were also deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We performed digital PCR against pooled single-cell cDNA libraries and confirmed that pooled Nrxn TKO in 5-HT neurons express significantly lower levels of Nrxn2 and Nrxn3 genes compared with that of control neurons. These results are included in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are three remaining issues that need to be addressed, and a suggestion, as outlined below:</p><p>1. To demonstrate the involvement of Nrxns in 5HT release in the hippocampus, the authors change the statistical analysis in Figures 2F and 2J from a two-way repeated measure ANOVA to a paired t-test. This new statistical analysis now supposedly shows that fluoxetine treatment increases 5HT transients in control mice but not in TKO mice in the hippocampus, leading to the conclusion that &quot;the lack of statistical significance in the TKO group is due to greatly reduced 5-HT release in TKO slices that reaches the limitation of FSCV sensitivity&quot;. However, there is no justification for changing this statistical analysis. The original analysis, which used a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, was fully correct and convincingly demonstrated a lack of a genotype effect (genotype main effect, F1,9 = 0.01351, p = 0.91; drug x genotype interaction, F1,9 = 0.09308, p = 0.7672). The paired t-test now conducted for the revised manuscript is an inappropriate statistical analysis, since there is no statistical comparison of genotypes, only of drug effect within each genotype, making it impossible to make any statistical claims on a genotype effect. This analysis must be corrected back to the original version, i.e. the two-way repeated measures ANOVA, to avoid falsifying the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. As suggested by the reviewers, we changed our statistical method for the FLX experiment in Figures 2F and 2J back to two-way repeated measures ANOVA test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors must provide information on the age of the mice used for the RT-PCR and voltammetry experiments (Figures 1 and 2). The only information on the age of mice is given for data in Figures 3 and 4, it appears. To facilitate finding this information, the authors must add a summary of the ages of the mice for all experiments to the 'Animals' section of the Methods part. Given that Nrxns are differentially involved at different time points of synapse development and function, it is important to know at which developmental time points analyses were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we did not include the age information of animals that were tested in RT-qPCR and voltammetry experiments. The revised manuscript includes the ages of animals in these experiments in the Materials and methods section, including the Animals and other sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As regards additional behavioral experiments, the reviewers acknowledge that the authors did the three-chamber test to assess social interaction, but did not obtain further evidence for ASD-like behavior in the mutants. This warrants a more conservative, differentiated, discussion of the role of defects in the serotonergic system in neuropsychiatric conditions caused by Nrxn loss.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewersâ comment that our new behavior data doesnât provide further evidence for ASD-like behavior in the mutant mice. Our revised manuscript includes conservative statements in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The reviewers suggest including the effect on neuron survival in the title as it is a rather surprising and important finding.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed. The revised title is âNeurexins in serotonergic neurons regulate neuronal survival, serotonin transmission, and complex mouse behaviorsâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
