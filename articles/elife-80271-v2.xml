circuits. These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision. However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. To investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression, we used a mouse model of rod degeneration (<italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic>). Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher and more stable for natural movies than checkerboard noise as degeneration progressed. The main change in RGC responses with photoreceptor degeneration was a decrease in response gain. These results suggest that gene therapies for rod degenerative diseases are likely to prolong cone-mediated vision even if there are changes to cone morphology and density.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our sense of sight depends on the retina, a thin layer of cells at the back of each eye. Its job is to detect light using cells called photoreceptors, then send that information to the rest of the brain. The retina has two kinds of photoreceptors: rods (active in dim light) and cones (which detect colour and work in bright light). We rely heavily on cone cells for vision in our daily lives.</p><p>Retinitis pigmentosa is a progressive eye disease affecting photoreceptors. In the early stages of this disease, rods gradually die off. Next, cone cells start to die, inevitably resulting in blindness. There is currently no cure, although some experimental treatments are being developed that aim to prevent rod death or replace missing rod cells.</p><p>However, it is unclear if these therapies will be effective, because we do not fully understand how rod death affects cone cells – for example, whether or not it damages the cones irreversibly. Scalabrino et al. therefore set out to track how the signals that cones send to the brain changed over time during progression of the disease using genetically altered mice that reproduced the symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa.</p><p>In these mice, rod cells die off over several months, followed by complete loss of cones a few months later. Initial microscopy experiments looking at the shape and appearance of the cone cells revealed that the cones started looking abnormal long before all the rods died. Next, to determine if these unhealthy cones had stopped working, Scalabrino et al. measured the activity of the mice’s retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in bright light – in other words, when cones are normally active.</p><p>RGCs transmit signals from photoreceptors to the brain, like a ‘telephone line’ between our brains and eyes. Applying a technique called information theory – which was originally used to determine how efficiently signals travel down telephone lines – to these experiments revealed that the RGCs still sent high-quality visual information from the cones to the brain. This is was surprising because the cones appeared to be dying and were surrounded by dead rods.</p><p>This study sheds new light on the biological processes underpinning a devastating eye disease. The results suggest that treatments to restore vision could work even if given after a patient’s cones start looking unhealthy, giving hope for the development of new therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>retinal ganglion cell</kwd><kwd>retinitis pigmentosa</kwd><kwd>cyclic nucleotide gated channel</kwd><kwd>bipolar cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY024280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sampath</surname><given-names>Alapakkam P</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jeannie</given-names></name><name><surname>Field</surname><given-names>Greg D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY5722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Field</surname><given-names>Greg D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The retina compensates for rod death and deteriorating cones to retain high-fidelity visual signaling to the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rod photoreceptor degeneration frequently leads to cone photoreceptor degeneration and death. Well before all rods have died, cones exhibit clear changes in morphology and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sahel et al., 2010</xref>). This is likely due to the loss of trophic factors and structural support provided by rods to nearby cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campochiaro and Mir, 2018</xref>). The extent to which these changes in cone structure and function compromise the ability of the retina to reliably signal visual scenes at high light levels is not clear. One possibility is that rod degeneration has an immediate impact on the ability of the retina to reliably signal visual scenes at cone-mediated light levels. Alternatively, homeostatic plasticity or redundancy in retinal circuitry may compensate for photoreceptor loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Care et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). Such mechanisms could facilitate reliable signaling at the level of retinal output, despite deterioration in photoreceptor function. Identifying the extent to which changes in photoreceptor morphology impact retinal output will inform treatment timepoints for gene therapies aimed at halting rod loss to preserve cone-mediated vision.</p><p>To examine the impact of progressive rod loss on cone-mediated visual signaling, we used a mouse line that models a human form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a blinding disorder characterized by initial degeneration of rod photoreceptors that ultimately leads to cone degeneration. This mouse line, <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic>, contains an insertion that interrupts translation of Cngb1, the beta subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel in rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Without this subunit, normal channels fail to form, causing rods to be tonically hyperpolarized and ultimately resulting in rod death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hüttl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). This degeneration is relatively slow, with approximately 30% rod loss at 1 month postnatal, complete loss of rods by 7 month postnatal, and complete cone loss by 8–9 months postnatal. Slow degeneration in this model provides a relatively large temporal window in which to assay changes in retinal signaling to increasing amounts of rod loss and accompanying changes in cone morphology and density. Slower forms of RP are also more common among the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grover et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>), and thus slow degeneration models may be more therapeutically informative than animal models with relatively rapid photoreceptor degeneration (e.g., <italic>rd1</italic> and <italic>rd10</italic>).</p><p>To determine the changes in cone-mediated retinal signaling induced by progressive rod loss, we measured changes in the signaling of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the ‘output’ neurons of the retina. Deterioration in the fidelity of RGC signals captures net changes in retinal circuit function induced by rod degeneration: these RGC responses account for changes in retinal circuits that compensate or exacerbate deteriorating photoreceptor function. Large-scale multielectrode arrays (MEAs) were used to measure the visual responses of hundreds of RGCs simultaneously in individual retinas while presenting a variety of visual stimuli: for example, checkerboard noise and natural movies. Three features of RGC signaling were specifically investigated. First, we measured when and how the spatiotemporal receptive fields (RFs) under cone-mediated conditions were altered by rod degeneration. These RFs are indicative of the visual features that are being signaled by the RGCs to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), and thus changes in these RFs represent changes in the kind of information being transmitted to the brain. Second, we probed how and when the spontaneous activity of RGCs was altered by rod degeneration. Many previous studies have noted the emergence of oscillations in the spontaneous activity of RGCs in animal models of RP. Such activity could disrupt the ability of the retina to encode stimuli. However, limited rodent models have been used to identify when these oscillations emerge relative to rod and cone photoreceptor death. These models result from different mutations, which cause distinct changes in rod physiology from those in <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice; when and how oscillations arise may be mutation specific and may not be ideal for capturing aspects of this heterogenous human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stasheff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stasheff et al., 2011</xref>). Third, we explored when and how rod degeneration impacts the fidelity of visual signals transmitted to the brain. Information theory was used to quantify changes in the fidelity of signaling naturalistic and artificial stimuli as a function of photoreceptor degeneration.</p><p>From 1 to 7 months of age in <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice, there were marked and clear changes in cone morphology and density resulting from rod degeneration. When assaying the spatiotemporal RFs of RGCs as a function of degeneration, there were subtle changes to the temporal RFs of RGCs as cone morphology changed. However, the spatiotemporal RFs of RGCs were remarkably stable until the latest stages of degeneration (5–7 months). The primary change to cone-mediated RGC responses was a decrease in response gain as photoreceptors were lost. Second, oscillations in the spontaneous activity of RGCs did not emerge in this mouse model until all light responses were eliminated (~9 months). This indicates that the onset of oscillatory activity can depend strongly on the genetic cause of RP, and thus may not be a concern for gene or cell therapy in at least some forms of RP. Third, as rods died and normal cone morphology deteriorated, the ability of RGCs to reliably signal the content of natural movies – under cone-mediated conditions – was remarkably robust until the latest stages of degeneration (~7 months; total rod loss with severe cone morphology changes and death). Thus, the fidelity of information transmission was relatively stable despite a reduction in response gain. This suggests that one or more mechanisms in the retina serve to compensate for deteriorating photoreceptors. Furthermore, these results suggest a broad therapeutic window in which to treat RP as cone-mediated visual signaling remains surprisingly robust despite clear changes in cone morphology and density.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> cones slowly degenerate lagging rod death</title><p>Photoreceptors in <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice gradually die as a consequence of the <italic>Cngb1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While rods die first, shown by the shrinking outer nuclear layer (ONL) over time, cones are present until ~8 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, cone structure begins to deteriorate at 3 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle). Cone outer segments gradually shorten and eventually disappear prior to total cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By 7 months, nearly all rods are lost and only cone cell bodies remain; clear outer segment structure is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right). How does this deterioration in cone morphology and potential changes in cone function impact the ability of the retina to transmit visual information to the brain? Answering this question is particularly important given that humans primarily use cone vision for most tasks. One possibility is that cone-mediated signaling at the level of the RGCs is robust to changes in cone morphology. Alternatively, RGC signaling at cone-mediated light levels may rapidly deteriorate as rods are lost and cone morphology becomes abnormal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cone morphology and density change with rod degeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Estimated fraction of surviving rods (black) and cones (cyan) relative to wild-type (WT) densities from 1 to 7 months of age in <italic>Cngb1</italic><sup><italic>neo/neo</italic></sup> mice.

The MEAs measured the spiking activity in 186–560 RGCs within individual samples of retina from 31 mice (see ‘Materials and methods’). Animals were used at 1-month intervals from 1 to 7 months of age (postnatal). To estimate the spatiotemporal RFs of RGCs, we used checkerboard noise and computed the spike-triggered average stimulus (STA) for each RGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>).</p><p>We measured RF structure at two light levels: a low mesopic level (100 Rh*/rod/s) at which cones are just beginning to be activated and a low photopic level (10,000 Rh*/rod/s). We chose the lower light level because <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice have severely compromised rod function even in surviving rods, thus we expected to see significant changes in visual signaling between WT and <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). We chose the higher light level because it largely, if not completely, isolated cone-mediated signaling, thereby allowing us to examine the net impact of rod dysfunction and death on cone-mediated retinal output.</p><p>The STA estimates the linear component of each RF. We were particularly interested in changes to the spatial or temporal integration of visual input, which are estimated by changes in the spatial and temporal RFs, respectively. However, some RGC types (i.e., direction-selective RGCs) do not have an RF that can be decomposed into unique spatial or temporal filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borghuis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devries and Baylor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>), which makes it an ill-posed problem to separately analyze changes in spatial or temporal integration. Thus, we focused the analysis on RGCs with RFs that were well-approximated by a space-time-separable RF model: the outer product of two vectors, one describing the spatial RF and the other the temporal RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). The time-dependent spiking activity of these RGCs in response to a checkerboard stimulus was also well-approximated by a linear–nonlinear Poisson model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which is assumed when using the STA as an estimate of the RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identifying spatial and temporal receptive field (RF) components.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike-triggered average stimulus (STA) that is space-time-separable.

RGCs for which &gt;60% of the variance in the full space-time STA was captured by a separable RF model were included in the analysis. This threshold was chosen because it captured a clear mode in the distribution of all RGCs from WT retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Across timepoints of degeneration, 8028 out of 12,997 RGCs met this criterion.

RGCs passing this criterion had a wide range of spatial RF sizes and temporal RF durations and consisted of both ON and OFF classes. Thus, several, but not all, RGCs met this criterion. The decrease in the fraction of RGCs with space-time-separable RFs at the latest stages of degeneration (5–7 months; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and under photopic conditions was accompanied by a decrease in the total fraction of RGCs that were light responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). ‘Light responsive’ was defined by how strongly the spike rate was modulated by the checkerboard stimulus (see ‘Materials and methods’).

Overall, spatial RF structure was relatively stable until the latest stages of degeneration: the largest change from WT in spatial integration was 15% (at 4 months). Changes in temporal integration were greater, with the largest change being 88% (4 months), but these changes fluctuated over time and were non-monotonic with degeneration (see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>We also analyzed the spatial and temporal RF properties of a specific RGC type, ON brisk-sustained RGCs, which exhibited a mosaic-like pattern of RFs across the MEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ravi et al., 2018</xref>). These RGCs have space-time-separable RFs and could be readily identified by their spike train autocorrelation functions. This irreducible RGC type tracked the spatial and temporal RF trends displayed in the entire population (dark gray distribution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that trends across the population were representative of trends in individual cell types. To check that these trends were not driven by experiment-to-experiment variability, we also analyzed changes in RF structure by experiment, rather than pooling all RGCs at individual timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These trends were not driven by experimental variance.</p><p>Given that photoreceptors are dying, it is potentially surprising that spatiotemporal RF structure is relatively stable under mesopic conditions. Fewer photoreceptors ought to result in diminished sensitivity, even if the area of spatial integration or the duration of temporal integration is relatively stable. Thus, we analyzed the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the STAs that may be expected to be noisier with photoreceptor death (see ‘Materials and methods’). The SNR of the STAs generally drifted down over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>); however, even these changes were relatively small until 5 months (compared to WT, there was a 5 and 15% decline in SNR in the 4- and 5-month experimental groups, respectively; p-value: 0.19 and 0.04). This trend was preserved in the ON brisk-sustained population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, dark gray distributions). Of note, the STA measurements were based on 30 min of checkerboard stimuli, which may be a sufficiently long period of time to average away noise and/or compensate for diminished gain. To more directly assess changes in response gain, we inspected the contrast response functions (also called ‘static nonlinearities’) across RGCs, which capture the relationship between the stimulus (filtered by the RF) and the spiking output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>). The gain of these contrast response functions steadily decreased as a function of degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; also observed for ON brisk-sustained cells shown in dark gray distributions). This trend was not driven by experiment-to-experiment variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the analyses above do not provide much insight into the extent that noise may be changing with degeneration. One source of noise is signal-independent increases in spontaneous activity. Several rodent models of retinal degeneration exhibit increased spontaneous activity arising as 5–10 Hz oscillations in RGC spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Margolis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stasheff, 2008</xref>). These oscillations are reported to occur throughout the degeneration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stasheff et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of such oscillations may minimally impact the RF measurements as they would be largely averaged away when computing the STA, but they could contribute to the lower SNR of the STAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>) along with the decreased gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we analyzed the spontaneous activity of RGCs in WT and <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> animals from 1 to 9 months to check for oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

First, we examined the information rates for checkerboard stimuli in units of bits/spike instead of bits/s to control for the number of spikes. Under both mesopic and photopic conditions, the bits/spike plots exhibited similar trends to the bits/s plot, indicating that the change was not simply the product of reduced spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we compared the information rate to the firing rate for checkerboard stimuli and the natural movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).

It is possible that cone-mediated signals in RGCs, the ‘output’ neurons of the retina, rapidly deteriorate with the loss of rods and concomitant changes in cone morphology. Alternatively, it is conceivable that RGC signaling is robust to photoreceptor degeneration. We have measured cone-mediated responses from thousands of RGCs from <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice as rod and cone photoreceptors degenerated. We have spanned early timepoints at which most rods remain and there was little to no cone death or changes in cone morphology, to timepoints at which all rods were lost and cones exhibited abnormal morphologies and were beginning to die. We find that despite clear changes in cone morphology and density, RF structure and signal fidelity remained relatively stable until the latest stages of degeneration. In this mouse line, oscillatory spontaneous activity among RGCs did not arise until all or nearly all photoreceptors were lost in contrast to previous results from other RP models. This study highlights how RGC physiology can change or remain robust along different axes, from RFs to contrast response functions to response reliability/information rates. Thus, to get a comprehensive understanding of how RP (and interventions including gene/cell therapy, implants, and optogenetics) impacts visual function, many axes should be considered.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison to previous studies of RGC signaling in retinitis pigmentosa</title><p>Few studies track cone-mediated RGC signaling at many timepoints across RP, in part because in many animal models, the degeneration progresses quite rapidly. Focusing on RGC signaling has the advantage that it includes degradation in visual signaling caused by the degeneration of photoreceptors as well as downstream changes in retinal circuitry. Thus, it captures net changes in retinal processing that deteriorate signaling along with mechanisms that may serve to preserve signaling. Additionally, examining cone-mediated vision instead of rod vision focuses on changes that are most likely to be relevant for humans, given the high reliance on cone-mediated vision. The <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> degeneration rate (relative to the life span of a mouse) is also more similar to the temporal progression of humans with RP, who typically have gradual rod loss over many decades and relative preservation of the cone-dense fovea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hull et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous work in a <italic>P23H</italic> rat model of RP (<italic>rho</italic> mutation) indicated a monotonic decrease in RF size, a monotonic increase in the duration of temporal integration, and a rise in spontaneous activity as photoreceptors died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sekirnjak et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, using <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice we observed small shifts in RF size and temporal duration during degeneration, but these changes were not monotonic with disease progression. The only features of visual signaling that we found to change monotonically were response gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and the fraction of RGCs that were light responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While we do not know why non-monotonic changes are occurring for some RF properties, they largely occurred in the 3- to 5-month range. During this time, there is a transient decrease in the rate of rod death (4–5 months) and cone death begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consequently, there may be complex changes to retinal circuitry as the retina reacts to a temporary stabilization in rod numbers and an acceleration in cone death. Intracellular studies of the light-driven synaptic currents impinging onto bipolar cells and RGCs during this time will be important for understanding the origin of these non-monotonic changes in RF properties.</p><p>We further speculate that the differences between these studies arise from degeneration having different causes in <italic>P23H</italic> rats versus <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice. The rat model involves a mutation in rhodopsin, which causes issues with protein folding and trafficking that are not thought to initially change the dark current of rods or their resting glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jones and Marc, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Machida et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakami et al., 2011</xref>). However, the <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> rods exhibit a sharply reduced dark current, are tonically hyperpolarized, and thus likely release less glutamate onto postsynaptic bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). These differences in rod physiology and how rods signal to downstream circuits are likely to have consequences for how the retina responds to rod death (see next section). Fully understanding how different origins of rod degeneration impact retinal circuits and RGC signaling is an important direction for future RP studies.</p><p>A novel feature of this study is the use of information theory to assay the reliability of visual signaling during retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Information theory has been used extensively in the vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems, as well as other sensory systems to quantify encoding performance of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fairhall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rieke et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Ruyter van Steveninck et al., 1997</xref>). In general, sensory neurons with more reliable and selective responses exhibit higher information rates, measured in bits per second or bits per spike. Information theory has not been used previously to assay the effects of neural degeneration on sensory coding. Information theory has the advantage in that it provides a way of comparing the signal fidelity across neurons that transmit information about very different sorts of features (e.g., color vs. motion). It has the potential disadvantages that it is a data-hungry analysis and can be prone to certain biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paninski, 2003</xref>). The relatively long and stable nature of MEA experiments allowed us to overcome these limitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koch et al., 2004</xref>), we found a broad range of information rates across the population of RGCs, even in control (WT) retinas. What was perhaps surprising is how stable these information rates were under photopic conditions until those latest stages of degeneration. This indicates that while gain diminishes with degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), the precision and reliability of RGC spiking remain relatively stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This is because information will depend more on the precision of spiking than on the total number of spikes. For a neuron with Poisson spiking, reliability will go down in lower spike rates, but RGCs exhibit much more reliabe spiking than is consistent with a Poisson process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, this reliability of RGC signaling was more robust when using natural stimuli compared to checkerboard noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This difference may be the result of natural stimuli having spatiotemporal correlations that are not present in checkerboard noise, and homeostatic mechanisms that preserve retinal signaling during degeneration can potentially exploit these correlations for higher fidelity signaling.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Stability of estimated information rates to trial number and trial duration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example rasters illustrating the subsampling for fewer trials.

First, homeostatic plasticity has been documented in models of photoreceptor loss in which the retina remodels to preserve signal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Care et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leinonen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen et al., 2020</xref>).

It is possible these RGCs were losing their light response completely, or that changes in their light response properties made them relatively unresponsive to checkerboard noise.

Previous studies on other models of RP, particularly <italic>rd1</italic> and <italic>rd10</italic> mouse models of <italic>Pde6b-</italic>RP, have shown abnormal spontaneous activity in two frequency bands: 1–2 Hz and 5–10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Margolis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menzler and Zeck, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poria and Dhingra, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stasheff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ye and Goo, 2007</xref>). Abnormal horizontal cell activity is the source of the 1–2 Hz oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haq et al., 2014</xref>), while AII amacrine cells are the likely source of the higher frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borowska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ivanova et al., 2016</xref>). Elevated and/or oscillatory spontaneous activity is a cause for concern in retinal degeneration because it is noise that competes with and deteriorates visual signals, particularly near threshold. It is unclear whether RGC oscillations also develop in humans with RP, although reports of phosphenes in RP patients could be explained by spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gekeler et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While previous studies have observed the emergence of oscillations in rodent models of RP (e.g., <italic>rd10</italic>) prior to the loss of photoreceptors and visual signaling, we only found evidence of spontaneous activity following total loss of photoreceptor signals in <italic>Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup></italic> mice (9 months, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At 9 months, we could not elicit visual responses from retinas when the video display was switched from ‘off’ (0 Rh*/rod/s) to ‘on’ and displaying a ‘white’ screen (20,000 Rh*/rod/s). Furthermore, at 9 months, there was no clear ONL and cells that labeled for cone arrestin were very sparse, dysmorphic, and did not co-label for M-opsin, indicating near total photoreceptor loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even at 7 months, when nearly all the rods and ~30% of the cones have died, we observed no evidence for changes in spontaneous activity or oscillations.</p><p>We suggest that the differences of when oscillations originate may be produced by differences in the resting membrane potential of bipolar cells across different genetic disorders leading to RP. <italic>Pde6b</italic> mutations (<italic>rd1/10</italic>) result in chronically depolarized PRs, which continually release glutamate onto ON bipolar cells. This ultimately keeps the Trpm1 cation channels closed and causes ON bipolar cells to be chronically hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de la Villa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koike et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Morgans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Slaughter and Miller, 1981</xref>). Rhodopsin mutations produce a similar phenotype. However, photoreceptors lacking Cngb1 are chronically hyperpolarized, resulting in a decrease in glutamate release and chronic depolarization of ON bipolar cells. Eventually, the total loss of photoreceptors results in ON BCs that are chronically hyperpolarized due to downregulation of proteins involved in the metabotropic glutamate receptor cascade, including Trpm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gayet-Primo and Puthussery, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Strettoi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Strettoi and Pignatelli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Varela et al., 2003</xref>).

This is a promising observation from the perspective of gene therapy for rescuing photoreceptors for RP45: it suggests that elevated spontaneous activity and oscillation in RGC spiking will be avoided given that gene therapy is delivered prior to total cell loss.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for therapy</title><p>Our findings on the longevity of cone vision are potentially useful in determining the time window for therapeutic intervention in patients with RP45. Both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that late intervention does not ultimately halt photoreceptor cell death despite improvements to visually guided behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bainbridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cideciyan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardiner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jacobson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koch et al., 2012</xref>). It is currently unclear whether the continued degeneration is slowed by therapy or not, or what the long-term implications are for vision restoration. This study suggests that cone preservation is a realistic therapeutic target because cone-mediated signaling by RGCs is minimally perturbed by massive rod loss. However, it is not clear that rod-directed gene therapy will be successful at preserving cone (or rod) vision if it is delivered at a timepoint after which most of the rods have died. Thus, an important direction for future work is to determine at what timepoint rod-directed gene therapies need to be delivered to halt rod death such that cone vision can continue to function normally throughout the remaining life span of the treated individual.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were used according to Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (protocol A084-21-04) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology guidelines for the use of animals in vision research.

The STA estimates the spatial and temporal integration of visual signals within the RF of an RGC. For many RGCs, the STA is not space-time-separable, meaning it cannot be expressed as the outer product of a function that depends only on space and a function that depends only on time. This precludes separately analyzing changes in spatial or temporal integration. To identify RGCs with space-time-separable RFs, SVD was performed on each STA. RGCs with STAs that were well-approximated by a rank 1 factorization were kept for further analysis of their spatial and temporal RFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): these were cells for which the rank 1 approximation captured &gt;60% of the variance in the STA.

The mutual information rate was computed as the quotient of the mutual information and the time length of the response pattern. Analysis of trial number and trial duration indicated that both were sufficiently large to produce stable estimates of the information rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Light-responsive RGCs</title><p>The proportion of RGCs that were light responsive was determined by computing a ratio between the variance and the mean in the peristimulus time histogram from the responses to the natural movie stimuli. The distribution of this ratio in an experiment was bimodal with unresponsive and responsive RGCs falling in each mode. A threshold was applied to each experiment to exclude the unresponsive RGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spontaneous activity and power spectral analysis</title><p>The frequency spectra of spontaneous activity were calculated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) applied to spike times binned at 1 ms from 30 min of spontaneous activity. Spectra were analyzed using a frequency range from 0.1 to 35 Hz. Peaks in the spectra were quantified for every RGC by computing: <italic>abs(b-a)/abs(a-b</italic>), where <italic>b</italic> represents the power at a baseline frequency level and <italic>a</italic> represents the maximum power. The baseline level was estimated by finding the average power in the 0.1–2 Hz range because this range was consistently flat across experiments and cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Significant changes across all assays were assessed using the two-way Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, a nonparametric test used to determine whether two sets of samples arise from the same distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Massey, 1952</xref>). p-Values were corrected for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction. Error bars indicate the range of values within 2 standard errors (SEs) of the mean, which was estimated by bootstrapping the mean 2000 times.</p><p>To measure whether differences across timepoints could be produced by other factors (e.g., experiment-to-experiment variability), a parametric linear mixed effects model was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). The mixed effects model accounts for retina-to-retina variability by adding each experiment as a random effect. This procedure permitted making broad-level inferences about the RGC populations without dependence on experimental variability. In addition, the sex of the animal was considered by including it as an interaction term with the degeneration conditions. This step enabled determining whether degeneration conditions were associated with information rates and RF sizes in a sex-independent fashion. The model indicated that conclusions about the impact of degeneration on RGC signaling were insensitive to both sex and experiment-to-experiment variability.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Mice were used according to Duke University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines (protocol A084-21-04) and the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology guidelines for the use of animals in vision research.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80271-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data to generate all summary plots in Figures 1-11 are included in the following GitHub repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mishek-thapa/cng-data">https://github.com/mishek-thapa/cng-data</ext-link> and are also available as source data files with the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are 4 reviewers all with mixed enthusiasm. Everyone appears to think that the observation that even without most rods and with quite abnormal cone morphologies the retinal output under photopic conditions is relatively well preserved is an impactful result. And the reviewers mostly are satisfied with the quality of the data and the presentation. However, all reviewers had conceptual concerns and some technical concerns. It is hard to summarize them entirely but this is what I glean to be essential. Note this is not a complete list – you are highly encouraged to go through the comments on each of the reviewers.</p><p>1. All reviewers identify the authors' claim that they have characterized the &quot;retina as a whole&quot; as a major weakness of the study. There are several suggestions by the various reviewers that the authors should consider. These include:</p><p>– Some characterization of the number of cells that retain their light responsiveness. The primary quantification of this is in Figures 2E/F. How this is just the fraction of RGCs that have separable S-T receptive fields NOT the fraction that is light responsive. As noted by Reviewer #2 this feels like a fundamental measure that must be included to assess the visual responsiveness of the 'retina as a whole&quot;.</p><p>– Select a cell type to follow over time. Some reviewers suggest direction-selective cells since they are readily classified and the authors have a history of readily recording these cell types. However, the authors have made clear that they want to stick to cells with separable space-time receptive fields, in which case perhaps they can select say the brisk transient cell.</p><p>2. There is a technical concern regarding the very low repeat reliability the authors show even for RGC responses in wild-type retinas indicating that the vast majority of RGC spike trains contain little information about naturalistic or white noise stimuli. As noted, if repeat reliability is so low, it is unlikely that the LN models predict the responses well. Perhaps you can show what fraction of the variance their LN models explain. If the models are not a good description of the RGC responses in their recordings, then using the model parameters to compare responses across genotypes and time is suspect. Moreover, Inter-experimental variation is well documented in retinal recordings (incl. MEA). Because one can get many cells in an individual recording and cell #s can be unevenly distributed across recordings, it is important to confirm that key trends hold when n = experiments rather than n = cells.</p><p>3. There were several specific questions regarding the implementation of information theory approaches. This is potentially the general result of the study and therefore should be strengthened.</p><p>4. All reviewers have made comments regarding the conceptual advance. Reviewer 4 noted that the evidence of homeostatic compensation is limited. Reviewer 2 asked for more discussion regarding how this particular model of photoreceptor degeneration compares to the many others that have been studied. Reviewer 4 states that the interpretation provided by the authors that homeostatic plasticity preserves information encoding in the retinal output is rather weak since the study does not actually show any homeostatic changes in circuits (unlike other studies on this topic).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3</p><p>Can the authors provide an explanation for what happens at 4M?</p><p>Legend is missing an explanation of gray/dark bars and teal diamonds.</p><p>Figures 3 and 5</p><p>Would the point about variance be clearer with a quantification of variance or change in variance over time?</p><p>Figure 7: Is the figure missing a significance asterisk for panel G?</p><p>Figure 9 legend: reference to lines is incorrect.</p><p>Line 231:</p><p>Can the authors provide more explanation for why there would be a change in SNR but only at one time point?</p><p>Line 255</p><p>What is the explanation for how photopic RGC signaling is maintained with lower gain and lower SNR if oscillations cannot provide the explanation?</p><p>Line 386</p><p>Why does this model not have oscillatory spontaneous activity until 9M while the other RP models have oscillatory activity?

All reviewers identify the authors' claim that they have characterized the &quot;retina as a whole&quot; as a major weakness of the study. There are several suggestions by the various reviewers that the authors should consider. These include:</p><p>– Some characterization of the number of cells that retain their light responsiveness. The primary quantification of this is in Figures 2E/F. How this is just the fraction of RGCs that have separable S-T receptive fields NOT the fraction that is light responsive. As noted by Reviewer #2 this feels like a fundamental measure that must be included to assess the visual responsiveness of the 'retina as a whole&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback and enthusiasm for the significance of the study. For clarity, new text in the manuscript is blue.</p><p>We now include a quantification of the fraction of RGCs in our experiments that retain light responses as a function of degeneration. This is in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The number of RGCs measured on the MEA was given by the number of spike clusters that exhibited a refractory period (3ms after the spike) with less than 10% contamination and a spike rate of greater than 0.1Hz. The number of those RGCs with visually driven responses was estimated from the checkerboard noise stimulus by computing the ratio between the mean spike rate and the variance: spike rates modulated by the stimulus will exhibit a high variance to mean ratio. We set this threshold at a range of 0.9 -1.2 sec/spike depending on the experiment. Under photopic conditions, this fraction did not change until 5M and fell to zero at 9M. (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D and lines 167-174)</p><p>We regret generating the impression that we were characterizing the “retina as a whole”. In fact, we never use that phrase. We do use the phrase quantifying the “net impact” of photoreceptor degeneration on RGC output, meaning a measurement that nets the impact of changes in the photoreceptors with changes in retinal circuits. We believe our study accomplishes this for those RFs that are approximately linear and space-time separable as well as for information transmission. We have refined and clarified our language on this point at Lines 63-66.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Select a cell type to follow over time. Some reviewers suggest direction-selective cells since they are readily classified and the authors have a history of readily recording these cell types. However, the authors have made clear that they want to stick to cells with separable space-time receptive fields, in which case perhaps they can select say the brisk transient cell.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have added an analysis of a specific RGC type: ON brisk sustained RGCs. Their photopic and mesopic receptive fields and information rates are tracked throughout the manuscript (Figures 3-6 and 8-10). Example receptive field mosaics, temporal receptive fields, and spike train autocorrelation functions for WT and 4M Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup> animals are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-F. These RGCs follow the trends displayed by the larger population of RGCs in each analysis. We chose this cell type because they are readily identified by their spike train autocorrelation functions compared to other RGC types and they have approximately space-time separable receptive fields (RFs). There are many text changes associated with adding an analysis of the ON Brisk sustained RGCs (see lines 202-207; 227-229; 264-267, etc).</p><p>We chose not to focus on direction selective RGCs because we are analyzing the spatial and temporal RFs of RGCs in Figures 3-5 and direction-selective RGCs do not have space-time separable RFs (see example in Figure 2C-D). Thus, those cells could not be used to track those receptive field properties across degeneration. Also, we did not collect responses to drifting gratings or bar responses across a range of speeds or contrasts, so we are unable to reliably distinguish the different types of direction-selective RGCs (e.g., ON vs ON-OFF) from these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There is a technical concern regarding the very low repeat reliability the authors show even for RGC responses in wild-type retinas indicating that the vast majority of RGC spike trains contain little information about naturalistic or white noise stimuli. As noted, if repeat reliability is so low, it is unlikely that the LN models predict the responses well. Perhaps you can show what fraction of the variance their LN models explain. If the models are not a good description of the RGC responses in their recordings, then using the model parameters to compare responses across genotypes and time is suspect. Moreover, Inter-experimental variation is well documented in retinal recordings (incl. MEA). Because one can get many cells in an individual recording and cell #s can be unevenly distributed across recordings, it is important to confirm that key trends hold when n = experiments rather than n = cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The first question raised here is regarding the repeatability of the responses to checkerboard noise and natural movies shown in Figures 8-10: some RGCs exhibit high repeatability, some exhibit low repeatability as quantified by their information rates. The reviewers are concerned about those cells with low repeatability and the ability of capturing their responses with an LN model. This is a valid concern, but to be clear, we are NOT fitting an LN model to cells with low information rates. Note, in Figures 3-6, where an LN model is being used to estimate the spatial and temporal components of the RFs, we are fitting a subset of all the RGCs: those with space-time separable RFs (see Figure 2). Those particular cells exhibit high information rates and highly reproducible responses, and an LN model captures 55-60% of the variance in the spike rate. We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B to show that the LN model is capturing their responses reasonably well. We explain this in the Methods (lines 717-726) and Results (lines 147-151).</p><p>In addition, the information rates we estimated in mouse are consistent with past studies from guinea pig (Koch et al., 2004 and Koch et al., 2006). We have updated the example neurons to better reflect the reliability of the cells near the median of the MI distributions in Figures 8-10.</p><p>The second point raised here is with regards to analyzing experiment-to-experiment variability and the extent to which that could contribute to effects that we observed. We have added many supplemental figures (see the figure supplements to Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10) that show the per-experiment effects. None of the trends we described or highlighted in this study were caused by experiment-to-experiment variability. We also make this point at several locations in the Results (e.g. lines 208-211; 228-229; 266-268, etc).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There were several specific questions regarding the implementation of information theory approaches. This is potentially the general result of the study and therefore should be strengthened.</p></disp-quote><p>We handle these as they arise for each individual reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. All reviewers have made comments regarding the conceptual advance. Reviewer 4 noted that the evidence of homeostatic compensation is limited. Reviewer 2 asked for more discussion regarding how this particular model of photoreceptor degeneration compares to the many others that have been studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have a subsection that compares RP models (Discussion – line 435): Comparison to previous studies of RGC signaling in retinitis pigmentosa. We think this is a reasonably comprehensive comparison to other studies. If there are specific animal models we are missing that the reviewer(s) would like to see us discuss, please indicate those models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 4 states that the interpretation provided by the authors that homeostatic plasticity preserves information encoding in the retinal output is rather weak since the study does not actually show any homeostatic changes in circuits (unlike other studies on this topic).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 4 that this is a possible alternative. We discuss this alternative in the Discussion section (lines 514-520).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>Can the authors provide an explanation for what happens at 4M?</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional text at lines 455-462:</p><p>“While we do not know why non-monotonic changes are occurring for some RF properties, they largely occurred in the 3-5M range. During this time, there is a transient decrease in the rate of rod death (4-5M) and cone death begins (Figure 1). Consequently, there may be complex changes to retinal circuitry as the retina reacts to a temporary stabilization in rod numbers and an acceleration in cone death. Intracellular studies of the light-driven synaptic currents impinging onto bipolar cells and RGCs during this time will be important for understanding the origin of these non-monotonic changes in RF properties.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Legend is missing an explanation of gray/dark bars and teal diamonds.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have added legends to each figure indicating what the gray bars signify, and we identify what the diamonds mark in each figure caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3 and 5</p><p>Would the point about variance be clearer with a quantification of variance or change in variance over time?</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps, but we think the variance is reasonably clearly represented by showing the full distributions as well as the gray bars indicating the (50% and 80% intervals) below the distributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7: Is the figure missing a significance asterisk for panel G?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this. We have corrected in the updated Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9 legend: reference to lines is incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for alerting us to this mistake. The Figure 9 legend has been corrected to change “teal” to “orange”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 231:</p><p>Can the authors provide more explanation for why there would be a change in SNR but only at one time point?</p></disp-quote><p>The SNR of the STA is going to be related to the precision of RGC firing (but less sensitive than measuring information because the SNR averages over many stimuli). So long as the response precision remains high, the SNR of the STA would also be expected to remain high provided that the gain hasn’t dropped to a very low value. The largest decrease in information (reflecting a decrease in spiking precision) occurs at 7M (Figure 9C), and hence we think this is driving the large change in the SNR of the STAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 255</p><p>What is the explanation for how photopic RGC signaling is maintained with lower gain and lower SNR if oscillations cannot provide the explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand the Reviewer’s question, the answer is the same as for the question immediately preceding this one. The SNR of the STA is (to a large degree) tracking the precision of spiking (e.g. the information rate for checkerboard stimuli). The information rates were even more robust for natural movies, but we are not measuring the SNR for that stimulus and stimuli with very distinct statistics can drive very different responses in the RGCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 386</p><p>Why does this model not have oscillatory spontaneous activity until 9M while the other RP models have oscillatory activity? Is the difference associated with timing?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to the discussion to expand on oscillatory activity (Lines 555-570). In summary, we hypothesize the onset of oscillatory activity is due to the resting potential of ON bipolar cells. Briefly, Cngb1<sup>neo/neo</sup> and rd1/10 rods have different resting membrane potential during degeneration (hyperpolarized and depolarized respectively). This likely produces different resting membrane potentials in the rod bipolar cells because of differences in rod glutamate release. We suggest these differences may initiate oscillations at different timepoints during the degeneration process.</p></body></sub-article></article>
