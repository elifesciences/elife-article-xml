Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Patch-clamp recordings showed that CBD acts at submicromolar concentrations to shift the voltage dependence of Kv7.2/7.3 channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a dramatic enhancement of current at voltages near –50 mV. CBD enhanced native M-current in mouse superior cervical ganglion starting at concentrations of 30 nM and also enhanced M-current in rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD may contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cannabinoids</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>Kv7.2</kwd><kwd>M-current</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Dravet syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS36855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Bruce P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Bruce P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS105076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolf</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54HD090255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolf</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HR0011-19-2-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woolf</surname><given-names>Clifford J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bean</surname><given-names>Bruce P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles R.

How CBD ameliorates epileptic activity is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Franco and Perucca, 2019</xref>). Unlike Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the other major phytocannabinoid in marijuana, CBD does not activate CB1 or CB2 G-protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pertwee, 2005</xref>). At micromolar concentrations, CBD has inhibitory effects on a wide range of proteins, including many receptors and channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ibeas Bih et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Watkins, 2019</xref>). Like many classic antiepileptic agents, CBD inhibits voltage-dependent sodium channels in a state-dependent manner, with reported half-maximal concentrations of ~2–10 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghovanloo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mason and Cummins, 2020</xref>). However, as CBD reduction of overall epileptiform activity can be detected in brain slice preparations at much lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2010</xref>), the importance of sodium channel inhibition for CBD’s anticonvulsant effects remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). Other molecular targets that could mediate antiepileptic actions of CBD have been described, notably antagonism of the lipid-activated G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sylantyev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaplan et al., 2017</xref>), and electrophysiological effects correlated with GPR55 antagonism have been described at concentrations of CBD as low as 200 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sylantyev et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The most potent effect of CBD on a well-defined electrophysiological function so far reported is an inhibition of endocannabinoid modulation of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Straiker et al., 2018</xref>). This effect of CBD is mediated by a negative allosteric effect on CB1 receptors, with CBD acting at a site distinct from the primary binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laprairie et al., 2015</xref>). Electrophysiologically, this inhibitory negative allosteric effect is detectable at 100 nM and is substantial at 500 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Straiker et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we report that CBD acts at concentrations as low as 30 nM to activate neuronal M-current, a non-inactivating potassium current mediated by Kv7 channels that activate at subthreshold voltages. CBD shifts the voltage dependence of activation of these channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, resulting in a significant activation of Kv7 current at subthreshold voltages. These results suggest that the activation of neuronal M-current may be one mechanism by which CBD exerts its antiepileptic action.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CBD activates heterologously expressed Kv7.2/7.3 channels</title><p>We discovered the ability of CBD to activate Kv7.2/7.3 channels in a screen using fluorescence signals from thallium entry evoked by depolarization of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 channels.

Enhancement of M-current is a clinically proven mechanism of antiepileptic action, as demonstrated by the clinical efficacy of retigabine, an antiepileptic drug that acts by enhancement of current through Kv7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wickenden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tatulian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunthorpe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sills and Rogawski, 2020</xref>). Our results suggest that the clinical efficacy of CBD could result at least in part by the enhancement of the Kv7-mediated M-current in central neurons. As in the case of retigabine, it remains to be determined exactly which populations of neurons are most sensitive to this enhancement of M-current, and how these effects alter the overall network activity relevant to epileptic activity.</p><p>Interestingly, the effect of CBD in enhancing the neuronal M-current is the opposite of the effect of cannabinoids that act as agonists at the CB1 receptor, which inhibit M-current in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schweitzer, 2000</xref>). Thus, the fact that CBD is not a CB1 agonist – and actually acts as an allosteric antagonist at CB1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laprairie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Straiker et al., 2018</xref>) – may be an important aspect of its mechanism of action. The opposite effects on M-current of CBD and CB1 agonists like THC fit well with the history of the development of CBD as an antiepileptic drug, which began with anecdotal evidence that extracts from a particular strain of cannabis with high CBD and low THC (‘Charlotte’s Web’) were an effective adjunctive therapy for a child with Dravet syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maa and Figi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams and Stephens, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In doing our experiments, an important step was discovering that use of plastic containers and plastic tubing could greatly reduce the apparent effects of solutions with CBD at submicromolar concentrations, likely reflecting loss of CBD by absorption into plastic as occurs with other cannabinoids with similarly high lipophilicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Christophersen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hippalgaonkar et al., 2011</xref>). This issue complicates a comparison of the concentration dependence with which CBD affects various targets potentially relevant for its antiepileptic activity. Although published data for CBD inhibition of sodium channels have typically reported half-blocking concentrations of 2–10 μM, we have found that when using glass reservoirs and tubing to apply well-defined concentrations of CBD to isolated neurons, substantial inhibition of steady-state ‘persistent’ sodium current can be seen with 30–100 nM CBD (unpublished results). CBD at 100 nM also significantly depresses endocannabinoid modulation of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Straiker et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the overall effects of submicromolar concentrations of CBD on neuronal excitability could involve multiple actions. Further work will be required to evaluate the relative importance of actions on various targets to CBD’s antiepileptic action.</p><p>Our results add to recent experiments demonstrating that Kv7.2/7.3 channels are susceptible to enhancement by a wide variety of agents acting by several different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manville and Abbott, 2018c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manville and Abbott, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miceli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanyo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kurata, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Such agents include endogenous compounds like GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manville et al., 2018b</xref>), the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manville et al., 2020</xref>), and arachidonic acid metabolites and derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schweitzer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schweitzer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsson et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsson et al., 2020b</xref>), as well as a variety of natural products including cilantro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manville and Abbott, 2019</xref>). Further development of Kv7.2/7.3 enhancers for treating epilepsy and other neuronal disorders seems promising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maljevic and Lerche, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vigil et al., 2020</xref>), especially because retigabine has been withdrawn from clinical use because of a number of off-target side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brickel et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to other compounds recently found to enhance Kv7.2/7.3 channels, CBD has the distinction of having already been successfully used in multiple epilepsy clinical trials. However, CBD is far from a perfect drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sekar and Pack, 2019</xref>) as it requires large dosages and has a complex pharmacokinetic profile that limit its effective oral administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millar et al., 2019</xref>). Improved knowledge of CBD’s most important molecular targets should allow for the design of novel compounds that retain its key molecular actions but with improved pharmacokinetics and reduced

Calculation of the enhancement of current at –50 mV during the stair-step protocol was confined to cells in which the current was at least 20 pA in control in order to minimize any error resulting from imperfect leak correction. For determining activation curves, the voltage dependence of activation was measured from the initial tail current at a step to –50 mV following 1 s depolarizations to voltages between –100 mV and +40 mV from a holding potential of –80 mV. Tail current was averaged over a 1 ms interval starting at a time when the immediate jump in current had settled, typically 0.8–1.6 ms after the voltage step. Plots of normalized tail current versus test voltage could be fit well by a Boltzmann function raised to the fourth power. The midpoint of activation was measured in a fit-independent manner by calculating the test voltage at which tail current reached half of its maximal value (reached at voltages between 0 to +40 mV) using linear interpolation between the test voltages straddling the midpoint. Calculation of shifts of activation midpoint by CBD was confined to cells in which the maximal tail current at –50 mV was at least 100 pA and in which the activation curve in CBD was fit well by a Boltzmann function raised to the fourth power.</p><p>CBD (Cayman Chemical, Cat# 90080, CAS 13956-29-1) was prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO, which was diluted in the external Tyrode’s solution to the final concentration.

Electrodes were 2–4 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution consisting of 140 mM K aspartate, 13.5 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, 9 mM HEPES, 14 mM creatine phosphate (Tris salt), 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Tris-GTP, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH, with shanks wrapped with Parafilm to allow optimal series resistance compensation (70–80%). Seals were formed in Tyrode’s solution consisting of 155 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, and cells were lifted in front of quartz fiber flow pipes attached to a temperature-controlled aluminum rod. M-current was recorded with external Tyrode’s solution containing 1 μM TTX and 10 μM CdCl<sub>2</sub> and quantified by measuring the current at the end of a 1 s step to –50 mV from a steady holding potential of –30 mV, after subtracting linear leak current determined by extrapolation of current measured at voltages between –80 mV and –90 mV. However, the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> show raw records with no correction of capacitative current or leak current. Recordings were made at 37°C.</p><p>Voltage commands were delivered and current signals were recorded using a Digidata 1321A data acquisition system (Molecular Devices) controlled by pCLAMP 10.3 software (Molecular Devices). Current and voltage records were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz. For display, current records were smoothed by binomial (Gaussian) smoothing using a smooth factor of 101 sampling intervals, equivalent to low-pass filtering with a time constant of about 80 μs. Analysis was performed with Igor Pro 6.12 (WaveMetrics) using DataAccess (Bruxton Software) to import pClamp data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Preparation of rat hippocampal neurons</title><p>Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from rat embryos (E19–E20). Pregnant female Sprague–Dawley rats were anesthetized with isoflurane. The skin was washed with 70% ethanol, the peritoneal cavity was opened, and embryos were transferred into ice-cold preparation solution Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS (Gibco, Cat# 14170-112) with 5 mM HEPES (Gibco, Cat# 15630-080) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Cat# 11360-070) in a 100 mm Petri dish on ice. Heads and brains were sequentially dissected from embryos, with the ice-cold preparation solution exchanged during each step. Under a dissecting microscope, the meninges were stripped away from the cerebral hemispheres and dorsal hippocampi were dissected with a fine scissor. The hippocampal pieces were transferred into a pre-warmed preparation solution containing 37U papain (Worthington, Cat# LS003126), 5 mM L-cysteine (Sigma, Cat# C7352), and 1080U DNase I (Sigma, Cat# DN-25), incubated at 37°C for 15 min, and then washed three times with enzyme-free warmed preparation solution. The preparation solution was then exchanged for a titration medium (EMEM, ATCC, Cat# 30-2003), 5% FBS (Gibco, Ca# 16140-071), and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco, Cat# 15140-122), and the hippocampal pieces were titrated using Pasteur pipettes fire-polished to two different tip sizes. After determining cell density using a hematocytometer, a maintenance medium (Neurobasal media [Gibco, Cat# 21103-049], 2% B27 [Gibco, Cat# 17504-044], 5 mM glutamine [Gibco Cat# 25030-081], and 1× P/S) was added into cell suspension to make cell density of 1–1.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL. Five poly-D-lysine (Sigma, Cat# P-7405)-coated coverslips (Fisherbrand, Cat# 12-545-80) were placed in 35 mm dishes and 2–3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were plated in each 35 mm dish (≥4–6 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/coverslip). Neurons were maintained for 13–17 days in vitro (DIV). Every 2–3 days, half of the medium was removed from the 35 mm dishes and replaced with the same volume of the fresh maintenance solution.</p><p>All experiments using animals were performed according to an institutional IACUC-approved protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Electrophysiology with rat hippocampal neurons</title><p>Recordings were made from neurons after 13–17 DIV. Neurons with three processes and a pyramidal shape were selected for recording. To avoid problems arising from absorption of CBD to plasticware, recordings were made in an all-glass chamber made by attaching a glass ring (18 mm outer diameter, 3 mm height, Thomas Scientific 6705R24) to a glass-bottom microwell dish (MatTek# P35G-1.5-20C). Whole-cell recordings were obtained using patch pipettes with resistances of 2.2–2.5 MΩ when filled with the internal solution, consisting of 140 mM K-gluconate, 9 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.09 mM EGTA, 9 mM HEPES, 14 mM creatine phosphate (Tris salt), 4 mM MgATP, and 0.3 mM Tris-GTP, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The shank of electrode was wrapped with Parafilm to allow optimal series resistance compensation. Seals were obtained and the whole-cell configuration established in Tyrode’s solution consisting of 155 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, with added 1 μM TTX. Reported membrane potentials are corrected for a liquid junction potential of –13 mV between the K-gluconate-based internal solution and the Tyrode’s solution in which current was zeroed at the start of the experiment. The amplifier was tuned for partial compensation of series resistance (typically 40–70% of a total series resistance of 4–10 MΩ), and tuning was periodically readjusted during the experiment. Currents were recorded with a Multiclamp 700B Amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 5 kHz with a low-pass Bessel filter, and digitized using a Digidata 1322 A data acquisition interface controlled by pCLAMP 9.2 software (Molecular Devices). Recordings were made at 30°C.</p><p>M-current was evoked by 500 ms steps to –50 mV from a steady holding potential of –30 mV. Stock solutions of 10 mM CBD in DMSO and 20 mM XE-991 in DMSO were made in glass vials and diluted into Tyrode’s solution (in glass vials) as 20 μM CBD or 60 μM XE-991 on the day of recording. Aliquots of these solutions were applied directly into the glass chamber and mixed with a 100 μL pipettor to make final concentrations of 1 μM CBD or 3 μM XE-991, respectively. To minimize any residual effect of CBD from the previous recording, the glass chamber was rinsed with 70% ethanol for three times and distilled water for three times before putting a new coverslip into the chamber.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

A strength of this work is the finding that CBD activates Kv7 channels a heterologous system and endogenous M-currents (presumptive Kv7 channels) in neurons from rats and mice. The observation of consistent effects suggests across cell-types and species that this result is robust and will translate to Kv7 M-current in other cell types. Another strength is the identification of the basic mechanism by which CBD acts: shifting the voltage dependence of Kv7 current activation to more negative voltages. This study finds that 100 nM concentration of CBD can activate Kv7 M-current, a concentration that is reported to be ineffective against most other CBD-modulated proteins, though a direct comparison of effective concentrations against other CBD targets is not tested here. Results are interpreted with appropriately nuanced discussion considering the promiscuous effects of CBD on membrane proteins and the range of other molecules that modulate Kv7 channels.</p><p>A claim of this manuscript is that CBD acts at lower concentrations on Kv7 than it acts on its many other targets. As nicely described in the methods, careful solution handling is needed to observe sensitivity of Kv7 channels to 100 nM CBD. I noted that DRG neuron Nav current is inhibited by 300 nM CBD in your recent study. Clarifying how distinct the concentration-response of Kv7 and Nav currents are with the same solution handling seems important to substantiate this claim.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The strengths of this study are its identification of a novel potential mechanism for the anti-epileptic actions of CBD, the evaluation across four modalities/cell types (thallium flux, patch clamp in CHO cells over expressing Kv7.2/Kv7.3, mouse super cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, and cultured mouse hippocampal neurons), and the finding that M current is activated by concentrations of CBD that are similar to those achieved in the plasma of patients administered CBD as an anti-epileptic. The experiences of the authors with plastic versus glass and the adsorption of CBD will be very helpful for others following up on their studies.</p><p>The only limitation of this study is that it doesn't explore the mechanism(s) for CBD enhancement of M current (e.g., interactions with PIP2, etc.), however the primary finding of this study is so significant for the field and it will undoubtedly stimulate much additional experimentation, that this is a minor limitation and doesn't negatively affect the impact of the work presented here.</p><p>1.

The authors show that cannabidiol enhances expressed KV7.2/KV7.3 channel activity in cell line at very low doses with a half maximal concentration for activating the current at -50 mV being approximately 200 nM. As KV7.2/KV7.3 channels encode for the M-current in neurons, they also tested the effects of cannabidiol on the M-current in cultured rat SCG neurons and hippocampal neurons. Cannabidiol at 300 nM enhanced the M-current in SCG neurons. However, 1 μm cannabidiol produced a much smaller effect at enhancing the M-current in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Figure 3).</p><p>Overall, the effects of cannabidiol on the M-current are interesting and this may be the potential mechanism of action by which cannabidiol exerts its' anti-epileptic effects. The study is, though, very limited and could be extended to include the effects of cannabidiol on neuronal activity. It might also be interesting to test whether compounds with similar structures to cannabidiol also enhance the M-current.</p><p>1) The authors state that they tested a library of 154 compounds chosen from the 'structures with known or possible ion channel modulating activity' (page 4).

Thus, the authors should investigate whether low concentrations of cannabidiol (100 nM) that have been reported to reduce epileptiform activity in brain slices reduce hippocampal neuronal action potential firing and if so, whether this is by activating the M-current. This would be a really important and essential experiment to determine if cannabidiol exerts its anti-epileptic effect by enhancing the M-current.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73246.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] A claim of this manuscript is that CBD acts at lower concentrations on Kv7 than it acts on its many other targets.

After submission of the manuscript, we have been doing further experiments on different kinds of sodium channels in a variety of preparations using glass reservoirs and tubing. We have found that CBD inhibits different kinds of sodium channels with different potency. The inhibition of sodium channels is strongly state-dependent, so the concentration-response is complicated and dependent on the voltage protocol. Most relevant for potential anti-epileptic action, we see inhibition of subthreshold persistent sodium current in native central neurons (predominantly carried by Nav1.6 channels) by concentrations similar to those that enhance M-current, with substantial effects at CBD concentrations as low as 30 nM in both cases. Therefore, we currently think it likely that the anti-epileptic effects of CBD could involve both M-current enhancement and state-dependent sodium channel inhibition. In the revised paper, we include new data on native M-current in sympathetic neurons with lower concentrations of CBD than we studied initially. The new data demonstrates enhancement by 30 nM CBD. And, we have added a sentence to the Discussion mentioning our unpublished data showing that 30 nM CBD also produces some inhibition of persistent sodium current in some central neurons. We note that submicromolar concentrations of CBD also significantly depress endocannabinoid modulation of synaptic transmission (Straiker et al., 2018), suggesting that overall effects of submicromolar concentrations of CBD on neuronal excitability may well involve multiple actions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1.

To define the dose-response of native channels, we have now done new experiments with 10, 30 and 100 nM CBD, along with dummy applications of CBD-free solutions. The data show a clear enhancement of native M-current by 30 nM CBD and increasing effects as the CBD concentration increases. We have added these new data to Figure 2. However, the data do not allow a clear determination of an EC<sub>50</sub> value. Unlike the cloned channels where we could define the midpoint of activation and use this as a measure of effect, in the neurons we found it impossible to define complete G-V curves because of the difficulty of distinguishing M-current from other currents at voltages positive to -30 mV. We spent several weeks experimenting with various blocker cocktails to inhibit other channels but were unable to sufficiently block other channels activated positive to -30 mV to enable quantification of pure M-current at these voltages. Therefore, we were unable to quantify the concentration-dependence of CBD’s action by the value of the shift of midpoint, as we did for the cloned channels. We believe the best procedure is to display all of the data for all the cells at each concentration, as we have now done in Figure 2B. At all concentrations of CBD, there is substantial cell-to-cell variability in the degree of enhancement, which we believe may reflect different degrees of activation of the channels at -50 mV in the basal condition. Despite this cell-to-cell variability, the collected results show clearly that 30 nM CBD enhances the current and there is a clear increase of effect with higher CBD concentrations.</p><p>Quantification in hippocampal neurons was even more difficult. The reason we did experiments with hippocampal neurons in culture instead of in slice is that in early experiments studying excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons in brain slice experiments, we found that concentrations of CBD at concentrations as high as 2 μm had almost no effect on firing when applied to slices, even though they strongly inhibit firing of acutely-isolated neurons. We believe this is because the tissue in the slice soaks up the highly lipophilic CBD and prevents effective application to the cell being recorded from, even at levels of several uM. We note that published experiments with CBD in brain slice preparations have generally used far higher concentrations of CBD to see electrophysiological effects, very likely reflecting this problem. We turned to experiments with cultured hippocampal neurons because this allowed application of well-defined CBD concentrations. However, a limitation of cultured neurons is that there a large cell-to-cell variability in the size of the XE-991 sensitive current, and some cells have none. You can see this variability in the data in Figure 3B and 3D, where you can see that a significant fraction of cells had very little or no current inhibited by XE-991. An even bigger challenge with the cultured neurons was obtaining whole-cell recordings that were stable for more than ~ 5-10 minutes before there were changes in leak current. With low concentrations of CBD, it takes ~7-8 minutes for the effects to reach steady-state. A third limitation of quantifying effects on M-current in hippocampal neurons, even in brain slice recordings of M-current under control conditions, is that because the channels are in the axon initial segment, the currents recorded in the soma are relatively small and often have their apparent voltage-dependence shifted in the depolarizing direction (e.g. Yamada-Hanff and Bean, J Neurosci. 33:15011-15021, 2013) so that to separate them from other currents it is necessary to use XE-991, as we did (Figure 3). However, recovery from XE-991 is too slow to allow an “XE-991-subtraction” quantification of both control and CBD-enhanced current, which is why we had to do experiments with a separate population of neurons to test whether XE-991 prevented the enhancing effect of CBD (Figure 3C,D).</p><p>Since the reviews, we have tried hard to develop a preparation of hippocampal or cortical neurons that would allow application of low concentrations of CBD for long enough to quantify their effects on M-current, but this has been unsuccessful. We spent several weeks doing experiments with acutely-dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons. These allow robust recordings with little change in leak current, but we found that the acutely-isolated hippocampal neurons have little or no M-current, probably because of loss of the axon. We also tried a variety of culture conditions and longer culture times with both mouse and rat hippocampal cultures and also mouse cortical cultures but were ultimately unable to find a preparation where recordings of M-current lasted long enough to allow studies with CBD below 1 uM. So far, the most promising preparation is a preparation of cultured cortical neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent cells, which appear to have substantial M current based on retigabine (and CBD) responses in multi-electrode array recordings, but as the differentiation procedure has a turn-around time of 8 weeks, it will be many months before we can hope to obtain detailed dose-response data with whole-cell recordings, even if the preparation allows good quantification of M-current with somatic recordings – which is still uncertain since the channels may be primarily in axons.</p><p>Because the channels underlying most native M-current in both sympathetic neurons and central neurons are likely Kv7.2/7.3 channels, we think it is very likely that the characteristics of CBD enhancement in sympathetic neurons provide a good model for effects on central neurons. However, we agree this has not yet been shown directly and are careful not to imply that it has.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If the EC50 values for cannabidiol differ in hippocampal neurons compared with that obtained for expressed KV7.2/KV7.3 currents in cell lines or the M-current in SCG neurons, it raises questions on whether cannabidiol may exert its anti-epileptic effects via activation of the M-current. Thus, the authors should investigate whether low concentrations of cannabidiol (100 nM) that have been reported to reduce epileptiform activity in brain slices reduce hippocampal neuronal action potential firing and if so, whether this is by activating the M-current. This would be a really important and essential experiment to determine if cannabidiol exerts its anti-epileptic effect by enhancing the M-current.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data leave open the question of how important activation of M-current is for the overall effect of CBD on epileptic activity. Since our new experiments show activation of native M-current in SCG neurons at 30 nM CBD, we think it is justified to at least suggest that this could be one mechanism of CBD’s anti-epileptic effect. However, as noted above, since submitting the manuscript we have done experiments using glass reservoirs and tubing to study effects of CBD on various kinds of sodium channels and have found that 30 nM CBD can significantly inhibit persistent sodium current in central neurons. Therefore our current working hypothesis is that CBD’s efficacy for epilepsy may reflect combined actions to inhibit sodium current (particularly persistent sodium current and perhaps resurgent sodium current) and to activate M-current. Indeed, these two actions simultaneously would seem ideal for inhibiting firing of cortical pyramidal neurons, where spikes are initiated in the axon initial segment where there is a large persistent sodium current from Nav1.6 channels and also high expression of Kv7.2/7.3 channels that strongly control spike generation. We currently do not have a good experimental preparation that allows dissection of the relative importance of the two mechanisms. We are studying effects on sodium current in acutely dissociated Purkinje and hippocampal neurons, where we can study effects of CBD at submicromolar concentrations, but these acutely dissociated neurons do not have M-current. The cultured hippocampal neurons have M-currents but have small sodium currents and feeble action potential firing compared to slice or acutely dissociated neurons, so they are not well-suited for looking at changes in excitability. We plan to try to develop an all-glass method for local application of CBD in brain slice preparations but we expect it will be challenging with low concentrations of CBD, which take 5-10 minutes to approach steady-state even when applied directly to an acutely isolated cell body with no other tissue around.</p><p>In writing the revised version, we have been careful to avoid any implication that activation of M-current is necessarily the only mechanism of CBD’s anti-epileptic action and have added a mention of our on-going experiments showing that low concentrations of CBD also inhibit persistent sodium current..</p></body></sub-article></article>
