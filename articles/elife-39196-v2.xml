activator. While requirement of distinct neurons in defined circuits for different learning and memory phases have been studied in detail, only little is known regarding the gene regulatory changes that occur within these neurons. We here use the fruit fly as powerful model system to study the neural circuits of CrebB-dependent appetitive olfactory LTM. We edited the <italic>CrebB</italic> locus to create a GFP-tagged <italic>CrebB</italic> conditional knockout allele, allowing us to generate mutant, post-mitotic neurons with high spatial and temporal precision. Investigating CrebB-dependence within the mushroom body (MB) circuit we show that MB α/β and α’/β’ neurons as well as MBON α3, but not in dopaminergic neurons require CrebB for LTM. Thus, transcriptional memory traces occur in different neurons within the same neural circuit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39196.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brains can store different types of memories. You may have forgotten what you had for lunch yesterday, but still be able to remember a song from your childhood. Short-term memories and long-term memories form via different mechanisms. To establish long-term memories, the brain must produce new proteins, many of which are common to all members of the animal kingdom. By studying these proteins in organisms such as fruit flies, we can learn more about their role in our own memories.</p><p>Widmer et al. used this approach to explore how a protein called CrebB helps fruit flies to remember for several days that a specific odor is associated with a sugary reward. These odor-reward memories form in a brain region called the mushroom body, which has three lobes. Input neurons supply information about the odor and the reward to the region, while output neurons pass on information to other parts of the fly brain. CrebB regulates the production of new proteins required to form these long-term odor-reward memories: but where exactly does CrebB act during this process?</p><p>Using a gene editing technique called CRISPR, Widmer et al. generated mutant flies. In these insects CrebB could be easily deactivated ‘at will’ in either the entire brain, the whole mushroom body, each of the three lobes or in specific output neurons. The flies were then trained on the odor-reward task, and their memory tested 24 hours later. The results revealed that for the memories to form, CrebB is only required in two of the three lobes of the mushroom body, and in certain output neurons. Future studies can now focus on the cells shown to need CrebB to create long-term memories, and identify the other proteins involved in this process.</p><p>In humans, defects in CrebB are associated with intellectual disability, addiction and depression. The mutant fly created by Widmer et al. could be a useful model in which to investigate how the protein may play a role in these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>long-term memory</kwd><kwd>Creb</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003497</institution-id><institution>Bundesbehörden der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SynaptiX</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18A017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII5_180316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription factor CrebB mediates long-term memory formation in different neurons within the mushroom body learning circuit, including mushroom body intrinsic and output neurons but not dopaminergic input neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Short-term memories (STMs) rely molecularly on rapidly acting biochemical processes altering the weight of defined synaptic connections. In contrast, long-lasting forms of memories require more permanent molecular changes including alterations of the transcriptional program. The cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is an evolutionarily conserved basic leucine zipper transcription factor, which is involved in long-term memory (LTM). Activated CREB binds to cAMP response element (CRE) sites of target gene regulatory regions promoting transcription. CREB is regulated by numerous cellular events, responding to a diverse set of physiological stimuli. It has been shown that the transcription factor CREB is implicated in many biological processes, including circadian rhythm, stress, metabolism, cell survival and drug adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlezon et al., 2005</xref>). However, CREB is best known for its role in memory formation. Studies in vertebrates and invertebrates showed that CREB-dependent gene transcription is a crucial component of long-term memory formation, but not of short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin and Tully, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Silva et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kida and Serita, 2014</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains two CREB-like genes: <italic>CrebA</italic> and <italic>CrebB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smolik et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Usui et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>CrebB</italic>, that produces multiple protein isoforms, has been shown to be essential for LTM in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Fruit flies associate odors with different reinforcing stimuli. Sugar as reward paired with an odor, induces LTM that requires protein synthesis and lasts for several days. Flies display memory as a selective approach of the previously sugar-paired odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>). The mushroom body (MB) is regarded as a main center of olfactory associative memory in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heisenberg et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dubnau et al., 2001</xref>). MB intrinsic neurons forming the predominant lobe system are called Kenyon cells (KCs). Olfactory information is transmitted by projection neurons (PNs) from the antennal lobe to the calyx of the MB, where they directly synapse onto KCs. KCs can be further subdivided into three major morphological and functional types, α/β, α′/β′ and γ neurons, forming the lobe system of the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>). MB lobes are tiled by spatially separated input from Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) as well as dendritic arbors of MB output neurons (MBONs). Dopaminergic innervation provides critical input to the MB circuit as conditioning signal. DANs of the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster respond to sugar and convey the reinforcing effect of sugar to defined MB lobe compartments, while other DANs are involved in other types of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Output of the KCs is transmitted to other brain regions by 34 MBONs that fall into 21 discrete anatomical classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While there is a wide consensus that CrebB is involved in LTM formation, it remains less clear in which neurons CrebB is required to induce LTM. Previous studies using overexpression of a <italic>CrebB</italic> repressor or RNAi to inhibit CrebB in the MB and MBONs resulted in conflicting interpretation of CrebB requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>). To shed light onto this question we created a <italic>CrebB</italic> conditional knockout allele (<italic>CrebB<sup>cKO</sup></italic>) allowing us to study CrebB function in defined cells. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we replaced the endogenous <italic>CrebB</italic> gene with a GFP-tagged <italic>CrebB</italic> gene flanked by FRT sites. The generation of an in-frame CrebB::GFP fusion protein allowed us to precisely monitor CrebB expression and localization in the nervous system. Moreover, flippase (FLP) mediated FRT recombination allowed us to delete <italic>CrebB::GFP</italic> from the genome in genetically accessible cells hereby generating null mutant cells, within an otherwise wildtype animal. We used cell-type specific CrebB knockout in defined sets of neurons of the mushroom body circuit and assessed appetitive olfactory long-term memory. Our findings show that removing CrebB from the MB results in animals that are able to form STM, but no LTM, indeed highlighting the critical function of CrebB for LTM in the MB. Interestingly, removing CrebB in α/β and α’/β’, but not in the γ lobe affected LTM further supporting the differential role of the three major MB lobe system in different phases of memory formation. We found that removing CrebB from the dopaminergic PAM neurons did not affect LTM, while genetic excision of the CrebB gene in MBON α3 severely reduced LTM formation. Thus, multiple neurons require CrebB within the same neural circuit to form an appetitive LTM trace.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and verification of a <italic>CrebB</italic> conditional knockout allele</title><p>To investigate the spatial requirement of CrebB for LTM formation within the mushroom body circuit we generated a <italic>CrebB</italic> conditional knockout allele (<italic>CrebB<sup>cKO</sup></italic>) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett and Liu, 2014</xref>).

Previous studies made use of RNAi-lines to knock-down <italic>CrebB</italic> RNA levels or the expression of a repressor isoform to block CrebB, which resulted in conflicting results. It has been shown that temporal control of inhibiting transgene expression is critical, since expression throughout the development of the flies may produce neuroanatomical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, it has been suggested that defects in LTM correlate with the amount of <italic>CrebB-RNAi</italic> or <italic>CrebB</italic> repressor expression. It seems that the usage of different inducible gene expression systems or the number of transgene copies can strongly influence the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>). Experimental parameters, such as when and how strong inhibiting transgenes are expressed may bias the results and affect the study of the role of CrebB in LTM. We therefore performed experiments in which we genetically removed <italic>CrebB<sup>cKO</sup></italic> specifically in adult flies after completion of brain development. Thus, the removal of the CrebB locus only occurred in post-mitotic, fully- differentiated neurons after eclosion. However, even with adult-specific knockout induction, neuroanatomical abnormalities cannot be completely ruled out.</p><p>The cAMP signaling pathway mediates synaptic plasticity required for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee, 2015</xref>). The transcription factor CrebB is downstream of the cAMP signaling pathway and its activity regulation during the memory formation process is crucial for LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fropf et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that pan-neuronal CrebB knockout disrupted LTM, but left STM and MTM intact.</p><p>While there is strong consensus that the MB plays a central role in LTM, if protein synthesis and CrebB activity are required in KCs remains debated. A study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref> reported that CrebB mediated gene transcription is required for aversive spaced LTM in DAL neurons but not in MB neurons. In contrast, two groups suggested in recent articles CrebB necessity in the MB for aversive and appetitive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musso et al., 2017</xref>). Our results, that were obtained using an alternative gene disruption strategy, also demonstrate CrebB necessity in the MBs for LTM formation. Thus, our findings, together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musso et al., 2017</xref>), convincingly show that CrebB activity is indeed required in KCs for LTM. It is conceivable that in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref> CrebB inhibition was insufficient to disrupt LTM formation, leading to conflicting conclusions about the role of CrebB in KCs.</p><p>MB α/β, α′/β′ and γ neurons, perform distinct roles in different memory types and phases. Functional studies that used <italic>UAS-shibire<sup>ts</sup></italic> to block synaptic transmission revealed different temporal requirements of the three major KC subtypes for olfactory associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</xref>). Output from MB α/β neurons is required for appetitive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>). The α/β lobe neurons are particularly important for LTM, as suggested by multiple other lines of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akalal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>). It has also been proposed that appetitive LTM depends on the activity of CrebB in MB α/β neurons. Flies expressing a <italic>CrebB</italic> repressor isoform constitutively in MB α/β neurons exhibited a reduced LTM performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>). Coherent with previous work, our results indicate requirement of CrebB in MB α/β neurons for LTM. However, we observed intact LTM after induction of CrebB knockout in MB γ neurons, which have a main role in memory acquisition and expression of STM. It has been reported that expression of an adenylyl cyclase coding <italic>rutabaga</italic> transgene in MB γ neurons could restore STM in <italic>rutabaga</italic> mutant flies, but not LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, output from MB γ neurons was shown to be necessary for STM, though appetitive LTM formation and retrieval did not require γ lobe neuron output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, a study observed an increased calcium response in MB γ neurons after aversive spaced conditioning that depends on CrebB activity. Expression of a <italic>CrebB</italic> repressor isoform throughout development in MB γ neurons blocked this LTM memory trace and impaired LTM measured 24 h after aversive spaced training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akalal et al., 2010</xref>). For appetitive memory, we found unaffected LTM in flies with adult-specific CrebB knockout in MB γ neurons. Thus, our results suggest that CrebB is not necessary in those neurons for appetitive olfactory LTM.</p><p>MB α′/β′ neurons only contribute to around 18% of the total number of KCs and therefore were often neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2009</xref>). The importance of CrebB to drive LTM formation in α′/β′ lobe neurons has not been assessed before. Our findings argue that LTM formation requires CrebB activity in MB α′/β′ neurons. It has been suggested, that α′/β′ KCs play an essential role in LTM formation and consolidation. Disrupting synaptic activity from MB α′/β′ neurons after appetitive olfactory conditioning prevented LTM, but retrieval of LTM was independent of MB α′/β′ output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>MBONs, which are the downstream neurons of the KCs, can be classified into 21 cell types. Dendrites of different MBON types innervate specific regions of MB lobes and dopaminergic projections align with MBON dendrites, forming distinct compartmental units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). Dopamine is released during learning to stimulate plasticity of specific KC-MBON synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). DANs from the PAM cluster were shown to be critical for learning the value of carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, it has been found that MBON α1 synapse onto a subset of PAM neurons that innervates the α1 compartment forming a recurrent network loop, which is necessary for the formation and consolidation of appetitive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>). This feedback circuit motif was also observed in other MB compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, plasticity in PAM neurons that lasted not less than 24 h was described. Caloric frustration memory, a new long-lasting memory form, reduced PAM neuron response to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musso et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that modifying efficacy of PAM neuron synapses is involved in appetitive LTM formation. However, we found that LTM does not depend on CrebB activity in MB afferent PAM neurons. This suggests that DANs induce synaptic modifications between KCs and MBONs, but CrebB mediated structural changes in PAM neurons are not required for olfactory appetitive LTM.</p><p>Remarkably, we found that flies with CrebB knockout in MBON α3 showed impaired appetitive LTM. This is the first report that LTM requires CrebB activity in MBONs. MBON α3 are efferent from the MB and dendrites were found to project to the MB α lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plaçais et al., 2013</xref>). It is likely that CrebB mediated transcription in MBON α3 leads to changed efficiency of the postsynaptic sites. The altered KC-MBON synapses would skew the MBON network towards approach behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>). An alternative possibility is that plasticity is induced in MBON α3 presynapses. MBON α3 have presynaptic terminals in the superior medial, the superior intermediate and the superior lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). A recent report suggested that MBON α3 also connect to DAL neurons, which have axonal processes in the MB and are essential for aversive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a recurrent loop back to the KCs would be possible. It has been shown that CrebB is required in DAL neurons for aversive spaced LTM, but not for appetitive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies will be required to reveal the role of this anatomical network for olfactory LTM formation.</p><p>While we here specifically focused on the neural circuits requiring CrebB for appetitive olfactory memory it will be interesting to extend the research to aversive memory, since the molecular and neuronal mechanisms are not identical between those two forms of memory. Prior to appetitive learning, it is necessary to deprive flies of food, since motivational drive is critical for memory formation. Furthermore, flies have to be hungry to efficiently express the learned association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>).

Brains were washed at least five times with PBST (PBS with 0.3% triton X-100) before primary antibodies were added for overnight incubation at 4°C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Eyeless (1:400, courtesy of Uwe Waldorf), chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam ab13970), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen A-6455), guinea pig anti-CrebB (1:400), rabbit anti-Tyrosine hydroxylase (1:100, Merck AB152), mouse anti-Repo (1: 20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank 8D12), mouse anti-Discs large (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank 4F3). Brains were washed again before the overnight incubation at 4°C with secondary antibodies. The used secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa fluorescent proteins (488, 567 or 647; Molecular Probes) and diluted 1:200. After a last washing step, brains were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 or Vectashield with DAPI H-1200 (Vector Laboratories) on a microscope slide.

The odors benzaldehyde (Fluka, 12010) and limonene (Sigma-Aldrich, 183164) were used. 60 μl of benzaldehyde was applied in plastic containers measuring 5 mm in diameter and 85 μl of limonene was applied in plastic containers measuring 7 mm in diameter. Odor delivery was effected with a vacuum pump adjusted to a flow rate of 7 l/min. Filter papers were soaked with distilled water or with a 1.5 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, 84100) solution the day before the experiment and left to dry at room temperature overnight.</p><p>19–21 h before conditioning groups of 60–100 flies were put into plastic vials with wet cotton wool on the bottom for starvation. For appetitive olfactory conditioning, flies were loaded in tubes lined with water filter papers. After an acclimatization period of 90 s, a first odor was presented for 2 min. Then, the odor was removed and animals were transferred within 60 s to tubes lined with sucrose filter papers. Subsequently, the second odor was presented for 2 min.</p><p>For the memory tests, flies were moved to a two-arm choice point where they could choose between limonene and benzaldehyde for 2 min. After this period, the number of flies within each arm was counted and a preference index was calculated.</p><p>PREF = ((N<sub>paired odor</sub> – N<sub>control odor</sub>) 100)/N<sub>total</sub></p><p>One memory experiment consisted of two groups with reciprocal conditioning, in which the sucrose paired odor was exchanged. The preference indices from these two groups were averaged to calculate a performance index (PI).</p><p>To measure short-term memory, flies were tested immediately after conditioning. Middle-term memory was examined 3 h after conditioning. For those experiments, animals were put back into starvation vials after training and were starved until the test. Flies tested for 24 h memory were put in food vials after conditioning for 3–5 h and then transferred to starvation vials until the test.</p><p>Flies used for memory experiments were reared at 18°C and collected after hatching (0–3 d old flies). To induce expression of flippase, flies were moved for 6 d to 29°C. For the starvation period before conditioning and until the test, those animals were kept at 25°C. Flies used for the non-induced FLP expression experiments were kept at 18°C after collection (for 6 days) and during the starvation time.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multiple neurons encode CrebB dependent appetitive long-term memory in the mushroom body circuit&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leslie C Griffith as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alex C Keene (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper brings conditional CRISPR tools to the problem of localization of CrebB function in memory formation. The authors have generated and validated a new tool for the investigation of the role of CREB that will likely be used by many investigators. They march through several of the cell types required for appetitive LTM formation and show that some, but not all, require an intact CrebB gene.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are several critical controls that need to be done in order for this paper to be a convincing contribution.</p><p>1) The genotypes in the figures suggest that <italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup></italic> was not used for the anatomical experiment, but rather that <italic>FLP</italic> was activated developmentally for the anatomy. It is problematic to use the developmentally expressed FLP and loss of GFP signal to interpret the behavioral data, which is supposed to restrict FLP expression to the adult. Authors must show anatomical data for animals that had adult-specific FLP induction. Lack of phenotype for some of the <italic>Gal4</italic>s could be due to lack of adequate conversion.</p><p>2) This raises a second point. The anatomical figures are of very low quality. Higher mag images and a counterstain for the areas where FLP is expressed are required to allow assessment of the efficacy of the adult-specific FLP outs.</p><p>3) The authors also need to do temperature controls. They should show how experimental flies behave (STM and LTM) when kept at the low temperature through development and adulthood. This is important for the conclusion that the manipulation of CrebB was restricted to the adult fly and that this changed LTM.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39196.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several critical controls that need to be done in order for this paper to be a convincing contribution.</p><p>1) The genotypes in the figures suggest that Gal80<sup>ts</sup> was not used for the anatomical experiment, but rather that FLP was activated developmentally for the anatomy.
