between competing bacteria to degrade cell wall peptidoglycan. Although Taes share a common substrate, they exhibit distinct antimicrobial potency across different competitor species. To investigate the molecular basis governing these differences, we quantitatively defined the functional determinants of Tae1 from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance and a high-throughput in vivo genetic approach called deep mutational scanning (DMS). As expected, combined analyses confirmed the role of critical residues near the Tae1 catalytic center. Unexpectedly, DMS revealed substantial contributions to enzymatic activity from a much larger, ring-like functional hot spot extending around the entire circumference of the enzyme. Comparative DMS across distinct growth conditions highlighted how functional contribution of different surfaces is highly context-dependent, varying alongside composition of targeted cell walls. These observations suggest that Tae1 engages with the intact cell wall network through a more distributed three-dimensional interaction interface than previously appreciated, providing an explanation for observed differences in antimicrobial potency across divergent Gram-negative competitors. Further binding studies of several Tae1 variants with their cognate immunity protein demonstrate that requirements to maintain protection from Tae activity may be a significant constraint on the mutational landscape of <italic>tae1</italic> toxicity in the wild. In total, our work reveals that Tae diversification has likely been shaped by multiple independent pressures to maintain interactions with binding partners that vary across bacterial species and conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>type VI amidase effector</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>topology</kwd><kwd>cognate immunity</kwd><kwd>deep mutational scanning</kwd><kwd>host–microbe interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IR-RMN-THC FR3050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simorre</surname><given-names>Jean-Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chou</surname><given-names>Seemay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sanghvi-Agarwal Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chou</surname><given-names>Seemay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sapiro</surname><given-names>Anne L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct surfaces of an interbacterial competition cell wall toxin mediate interactions with different cellular binding partners, resulting in an inherent evolutionary trade-off across the toxin superfamily.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria live in dense polymicrobial communities where competition for nutrients and space impacts survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peterson et al., 2020</xref>). To combat neighboring rivals, some Gram-negative bacteria use a contact-dependent toxin delivery system called the type 6 secretion system (T6SS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jani and Cotter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>) that injects a cocktail of effectors from the donor cell directly into nearby recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Russell et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hood et al., 2010</xref>). A bacterium’s T6S arsenals include several types of protein effectors with distinct activities that each compromise essential cellular pathways or components, such as recipient peptidoglycan (PG) or membranes. Although many T6S bacteria deploy similar toxins, interbacterial outcomes can vary considerably depending on the bacterial species engaged in T6S-mediated competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Russell et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The molecular basis of this organism-level specificity of interbacterial T6SSs remains poorly understood.</p><p>A potential source of specificity could be the T6S-delivered toxins themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaCourse et al., 2018</xref>). T6S toxins can belong to large superfamilies comprised of diverse homologs. One such example is the <italic>T</italic>6S <italic>a</italic>midase <italic>e</italic>ffector (<italic>tae</italic>) superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>tae</italic>s encode hydrolase enzymes that induce recipient cell lysis by breaking down the major structural component of bacterial cell envelopes, PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell et al., 2011</xref>). Tae toxins are known to be structurally and biochemically diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2012</xref>). Given that targeted PG substrates can also vary in a species-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vollmer et al., 2008a</xref>), such diversity could potentially impact toxin antibacterial specificity. Tae toxins divide into four phylogenetically distinct subfamilies (Tae1–4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2012</xref>) that hydrolyze different amide bonds within PG, and toxins within the same subfamily can have unique PG compositional preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These observations raise the possibility that T6SS organismal specificity may be linked, in part, to the biochemical diversity of delivered toxins. Such a model would predict that physiological features of recipient microbes may have driven divergent evolution of T6S effector diversity. To address this hypothesis, a quantitative, molecular understanding of T6S effector specificity is needed. However, comprehensive functional analyses are challenging for toxins such as the Taes, given that they act on cellular substrates with complex, three-dimensional (3D) structures in vivo. In cells, PG is a cross-linked macromolecule that forms a contiguous, mesh-like network that is structurally heterogeneous, insoluble, and dynamically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vollmer and Seligman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furchtgott et al., 2011</xref>). These features are not well captured through in vitro functional studies that necessarily focus on soluble PG fragments.</p><p>To probe Tae–cell wall interactions in a physiologically relevant context, we developed a high-throughput genetic approach known as deep mutational scanning (DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furchtgott et al., 2011</xref>) that surveys the entire Tae enzyme for functional determinants of toxicity in live <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells. We focused on Tae1 (previously known as Tse1) from the common soil bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, which is known to interact with a wide range of microbes, including <italic>E. coli</italic>. We found that an extended surface across the entire Tae1 enzyme is important for mediating in vivo degradation of cell walls. Furthermore, we present evidence that Tae1 functional determinants can be quite distinct depending on the compositional context of PG. Finally, we discovered that the evolutionary potential for Tae1 potency against a broad range of cell wall types may be constrained by orthogonal functional requirements, such as Tae1 interactions with its cognate immunity protein during T6S-mediated competition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DMS identifies determinants of Tae1 function in vivo</title><p>To understand how sequence diversity within the Tae protein superfamily impacts interbacterial toxicity, we must first probe how each amino acid residue contributes to Tae function. Biochemical assays of Tae protein binding to and degradation of PG use isolated, purified sacculi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2012</xref>), which differ from the turgor-stretched PG layer in the periplasm of living cells. Thus, these assays likely identify only a subset of determinants that govern how Tae engages with PG in vivo. To define comprehensively and quantitatively all the amino acid residues in Tae that are important for its function in vivo, we developed a DMS experiment in live bacterial cells that allows us to examine the contributions of amino acid substitutions at every Tae residue in a physiologically relevant context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elazar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barad et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We adapted a DMS approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fowler and Fields, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubin et al., 2017</xref>) to study the Tae1 protein from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which is injected into <italic>E. coli</italic> and leads to cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Russell et al., 2011</xref>).

Periplasmic expression of wild-type Tae1 (Tae1<sup>WT</sup>), but not catalytically inactive Cys30Ala Tae (Tae1<sup>C30A</sup>), results in rapid cell lysis upon induction due to cell wall degradation by the toxin. Cells expressing <italic>tae1<sup>WT</sup></italic> are depleted from the population faster than cells expressing inactive Tae1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutations that increase or decrease the rate of Tae1-induced lysis can be identified by sequencing and analyzing plasmid copy numbers in the population over time.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deep mutational scanning (DMS) identifies amino acid residues important for Tae1 function in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the function of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Tae1 toxin in lysis of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

In our assay, the fitness score reflects a difference in the antibacterial capacity of the Tae1 variant in vivo when compared to the wild type: relative enrichment of a variant indicates reduced Tae1-dependent cell death or loss of function (LOF) and yields a positive fitness score, whereas relative depletion of a variant indicates increased cell death or gain of function (GOF) and yields a negative fitness score.</p><p>To validate our approach, we examined the canonical catalytic dyad residues of Tae1 to assess whether our screen accurately identified known functional determinants.

We found that all variants were expressed; five substitutions did not exhibit major visible decreases in protein levels (G42S, S144A, S147A, G48S, G56S). Our results led us to hypothesize that these five surface substitutions may play direct roles in Tae1–PG interactions.</p><p>We hypothesized that an extended surface of Tae1 may be required for substrate binding and hydrolysis in vivo. Given that Tae1 likely engages with larger and even sometimes insoluble fragments of PG within the intact cell wall, we conducted a series of in vitro biochemical assays of LOF<sup>clus</sup> variants using either intact PG sacculi or fragments that encompass more than the minimal peptide region. To address whether distal surfaces of Tae1 bind PG, we experimentally mapped Tae1 binding sites by two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) using <sup>15</sup>N-labeled, catalytically inactive Tae1<sup>C30A</sup> (Tae1<sup>N15</sup>) in complex with larger, soluble fragments of PG.

Observed spectral differences allowed us to identify and quantitate chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) across the protein, which serve as indicators of the residues involved in direct substrate interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schanda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maya-Martinez et al., 2018</xref>). Mapping these shifts onto the Tae1 structure, we observed CSPs for residues located within the catalytic core as well as for a variety of both buried and exposed residues outside of the core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). While CSPs for buried residues could be due to interaction-dependent enzyme conformational or dynamical changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>), contiguous clusters of CSPs localized to the protein surface are suggestive of Tae1–PG binding. Such putative binding regions extended all the way to surfaces on the protein face opposite of the catalytic core. In fact, we identified shifts in six of the validated LOF<sup>CLUS</sup> residues, Leu21, Gly42, Gly48, Ala52, Gly56, and Ser144 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that these residues are necessary for Tae1-induced lysis because they bind PG.</p><p>To determine if these functional distal residues that bind PG are also required for hydrolysis, we focused our studies on two highly expressed variants, Tae1<sup>S144A</sup> and Tae1<sup>G48S</sup>, for which we expressed recombinant forms and purified.

We then conducted degradative assays with PG sacculi purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Tae enzymes were incubated with PG sacculi, and the resulting fragments were quantitatively assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Despite being relatively far from the active site, these amino acid substitutions decreased Tae1 activity. Together, these data reveal that numerous sites distributed around the Tae1 surface physically interact with PG, and that these distal interaction sites are important for cell wall-degrading toxicity in vivo. Moreover, these results suggest our DMS-based approach can faithfully uncover novel and unexpected functional determinants in vivo, providing important clues to evolutionary pressures that may be acting on <italic>tae1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The functional landscape of Tae1 is sensitive to PG differences</title><p>Our results point to a model in which Tae1 might interact with more structures of PG outside of the catalytic site, and these interactions are important for in vivo toxicity.

The number of tolerant residues did not change (four in both) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Overall, 58% of residues were classified differently than in our initial screen in M9 media. We mapped the LOF<sup>clus</sup> and GOF<sup>clus</sup> residues onto the Tae1 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also saw that the previous ring-like band of LOF<sup>clus</sup> determinants emanating from the catalytic groove was greatly diminished in <italic>E. coli<sup>DMet</sup></italic>. Given that our biochemical experiments suggest that these sites are important for extended PG-binding, we hypothesize that such contact interfaces may be less functionally critical in cellular conditions where the cell wall matrix is more loosely packed around the enzyme. Alternatively, these changes could be indirectly due to other metabolic or physical changes to the cell under D-Met growth conditions. In order to reveal any effects of sacculi architecture on extended Tae1 binding, we tested the two LOF variants Tae1<sup>G48S</sup> and Tae1<sup>S144A</sup>, confirmed to physically interact with long PG fragments in our NMR experiments, for any differential binding with sacculi obtained from plain or D-Met media. Although we did not observe major binding differences in our pull-down analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), we do want to acknowledge the low sensitivity of this assay. There is a need for better tools to improve this analysis. Overall, our comparative screening approach revealed that compositional changes to PG dramatically alter the functional landscape of Tae1, suggesting that these variants are sensitive to differences in cell wall architecture.</p><p>The <italic>E. coli<sup>DMet</sup></italic> DMS screen also yielded a larger and distinct set of top-performing GOF<sup>clus</sup> variants with amino acid substitutions that localized to both the catalytic groove and opposing faces of Tae1. When we compared fitness scores for the GOF<sup>clus</sup> variants from the D-Met screen to the initial M9 screen, we found that only a small subset of substitutions showed similar effects across both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Condition-specific phenotypes suggest that Tae1 toxicity in vivo is highly context-dependent and optimizable for specific PG forms. To test this hypothesis, we conducted lysis assays in D-Met and M9 media for three GOF variants uniquely identified in the D-Met screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). All three substitutions increased cell lysis in <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in D-Met but not M9 minimal media. For two of the variants, Asp134Asn and Ser147Ile, the increase in lysis may be due to higher expression levels based on Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Together, these results suggest that Tae enzymes could possibly be engineered to target specific bacteria with certain cell wall structures. Given that the structure and composition of PG vary across bacterial species, our results also potentially point to a selective pressure underlying natural sequence-based diversity in the Tae1 superfamily. Namely, cell wall features associated with particular rival species a given bacterium must antagonize may drive evolved substrate specificity differences in interbacterial competition toxins such as the Tae enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A hyperactive variant of Tae1 is naturally encoded by other <italic>tae</italic> homologs</title><p>A number of context-independent Tae1 variants that significantly outperformed wild-type enzyme across both DMS conditions were also identified through our comparative approach.

We considered several explanations, none of which are mutually exclusive. First, it is possible that structural rearrangements introduced by the Cys110Ser substitution may disrupt Tae1 interactions with critical molecular partners present in natural T6S-mediated interbacterial interactions but not in our DMS set-up. During T6S competition, Tae1 from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> must be delivered to neighboring cells by a complex T6S secretion apparatus that we bypassed with an engineered secretion signal in our screen. Furthermore, Tae1 injected into nearby kin cells is deactivated through binding by a cognate immunity protein, <italic>T</italic>6S <italic>a</italic>midase <italic>i</italic>mmunity protein 1 (Tai1), preventing lysis. Tai1 is specifically encoded by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and not <italic>E. coli</italic>. Second, it is possible that we have not sampled Tae1 fitness across contexts that accurately represent bacterial rivals or competition conditions most relevant for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the wild.</p><p>We therefore investigated whether Ser110 naturally occurs in any Tae1 representatives outside of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by searching for family members that encode a serine at residue positions comparable to Cys110, as predicted by structure-based alignments. Surprisingly, we found that approximately half of <italic>tae1</italic>-carrying bacterial species encoded serine residues at the Cys110 position, while some encoded tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To examine how these three variant classes are taxonomically distributed, we generated a phylogenetic tree of all associated bacterial species and observed correlated divisions across taxonomic clades and the residues at the Cys110 position, with the exception of one <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Considering this observation, we hypothesized that <italic>tae1</italic> evolution may have been locally constrained due to the requirement for Tai1-dependent immunity to prevent self-antagonism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Hyperactive variant Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> evades binding and inhibition by cognate immunity</title><p>We reasoned that if Tae1 proteins are too structurally divergent, the toxin may evade binding by the cognate Tai1 partner in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Tai1<sup>PA</sup>) and consequently antagonize kin cells or other closely related species. To assess whether the Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> variant affects Tae1–Tai1 interactions, we first assessed whether Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> adopted any major structural changes by solving its 3D crystal structure (PDB ID: 7TVH) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We did not observe any major structural rearrangements that would immediately implicate distinct modes of Tai1<sup>PA</sup>-binding (RMSD = 0.746, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, we did observe some key side chain alterations near the Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> active site, which is the enzyme region most intimately engaged with Tai1<sup>PA</sup> upon binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most notably, we found that His91 protruded away from the active site of Tae1<sup>C110S</sup>, which would sterically clash with a loop of Tai1<sup>PA</sup> that typically inserts into the catalytic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Our structural observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cys110 position is important for Tai1 recognition; therefore, serine at this position in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may be disfavored to preserve immunity to the toxin. We generated a tree for the Tai1 protein family, similar to our tree for the Tae1 protein family. Consistent with this possibility, the tree for Tai1 has a similar branching pattern that is coincident with the residue variation at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure

We measured Tai1-binding affinity (Kd) for recombinant Tae1<sup>WT</sup> and Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> proteins by isothermal titration calorimetry and found that Tae1<sup>WT</sup> bound Tai1 with ~36-fold greater affinity than Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> (9.5 nM Kd and 349.6 nM Kd, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Toxin–immunity complexes are typically associated with binding affinities in the nM range; thus, reduction may preclude the ability of Tai1 to effectively bind its toxin partner in vivo. To test whether Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> evades Tai1-dependent immunity in vivo, we constructed a strain of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> harboring this mutation (<italic>PA<sup>C110S</sup></italic>) with a wild-type strain (<italic>PA<sup>WT</sup></italic>). We reasoned that if Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> escapes Tai1-binding and therefore immune protection, we would observe a decrease in <italic>PA<sup>C110S</sup></italic> fitness compared to a wild-type strain (<italic>PA<sup>WT</sup></italic>) specifically when grown on solid media which induces T6S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Indeed, for <italic>PA<sup>C110S</sup></italic> we observed substantially reduced growth compared to <italic>PA<sup>WT</sup></italic> on solid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) but not in liquid media, where T6S is not induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This phenotype strongly suggests that Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> lyses kin cells at a faster rate than Tai1 can bind and inhibit killing, leading to a fitness cost for this strain. Furthermore, we conducted a contact-dependent competition. This assay was done in the same way as the fitness assays but with the addition of a prey cell <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Here, an attacking <italic>PA</italic> strain could still inject Tae1 into kin cells but also into the prey cells. Again, for <italic>PA<sup>C110S</sup></italic> we observed a substantially reduced competitive index compared to <italic>PA<sup>WT</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). This observation further supports that the <italic>PA<sup>C110S</sup></italic> strain likely lacks sufficient Tai1 immunity, in turn leading to a diminished competitive capacity against <italic>E. coli</italic> prey cells.</p><p>Together, our in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the fitness cost of evading Tai1-binding likely limits the proliferation of Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> in the wild. This interaction presents an evolutionary bottleneck that impedes certain toxin variants, such as Tae1<sup>C110S</sup>, from broadly taking hold across all species. More generally, our DMS screening approach allowed us to systematically probe function across different in vivo contexts, identifying two distinct but important selective pressures – substrate-specificity and toxin–immunity interactions – that may, in combination, shape diversity across the Tae1 toxin superfamily.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Tae superfamily of interbacterial toxins is phylogenetically, structurally, and functionally diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Russell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chou et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that sequence-based differences in <italic>tae</italic> homologs shape Tae proteins and their complex substrate, the PG that constitutes the bacterial cell wall. Our studies revealed that Tae1 engages PG through a circumferential interface that is more extensive than most proteases or other enzymes. This unexpectedly large interaction surface may be key for dictating species-specific toxicity of Tae proteins and consequently serve as a major driver of Tae superfamily diversification. This surface could also mediate processivity across PG. Taes have many other binding partners as well. These toxins interact with the T6SS apparatus for secretion, which likely limits effector size to a single, minimal catalytic unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Russell et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, unlike other larger multi-domain housekeeping PG hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vollmer et al., 2008b</xref>), Tae toxins rely on a relatively restricted set of surfaces to mediate many distinct, functional interactions. Our unbiased, high-throughput DMS analyses revealed that determinants for Tae1 cell wall-binding and immunity-binding partially overlap. Our findings suggest that accommodation of multiple, distinct functions likely constrains evolution of Tae enzymes in nature despite intrinsic potential for enhanced toxicity. Extensive Tae functional surfaces may also point to the existence of additional unknown interaction partners within bacteria. This principle may prove true for other T6S toxins and proteins; comprehensive mapping of functional determinants by DMS may power further functional discovery.</p><p>Complementing traditional biophysical approaches with DMS allowed us to probe molecular interactions in physiological states that are difficult to capture in vitro. Our current understanding of enzyme interactions with the bacterial cell wall draws mostly from biochemical analyses conducted in solution, posing a fundamental challenge for proteins with 3D highly crosslinked macromolecular substrates. Considering the architectural complexity of the bacterial cell wall, a large ring-like surface looping around Tae1 seems critical for toxicity in vivo. This observation could be due to at least two possible modes of binding that we posit may be unique to enzymes with macromolecular substrates. First, we theorize that a more extensive, nonlinear substrate binding domain may enable an enzyme to specifically recognize a particular conformational state. 3D configurations of the cell wall may be an important feature for a toxin like Tae1 to detect, given that this could affect protein localization to specific cell wall features that have distinct shapes. It has been previously observed that a critical hole size in the cell wall is necessary for bacterial lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daly et al., 2011</xref>; thus localized action of PG enzymes may provide an important advantage for Tae toxins. Another potential advantage of binding a specific substrate configuration is that this would enable a Tae enzyme to distinguish between different species or incorporation states of PG fragments. Indeed, certain endogenous enzymes, such as FtsN, interact exclusively with complex PG chains of a certain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ursinus et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility is that the large functional surface comprises several different PG-binding domains that streamline substrate recognition or underlie enzyme processivity. This has been suggested for a cell wall digesting enzyme, Lysostaphin from <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, which exhibits two large PG-binding surfaces on opposite sides of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzalez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>). Multi-step binding would support the ‘smart autolysins’ model postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch, 1990</xref>. This model hints at the ability of hydrolase enzymes to recognize ‘stretched’ areas of PG. The resulting advantage for hydrolytic cell wall enzymes is that this type of recognition decreases substrate search dimensionality from random 3D diffusion to facilitated diffusion by searching along the PG sacculus one plane at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kari et al., 2017</xref>). This may be particularly important for rapid, effective recognition of substrates within a large cage-like 3D target like the cell wall, which is key for potent, fast-acting toxins. This mechanism is also commonly adopted by DNA-binding proteins, which dock nonspecifically to DNA before searching for specific cut sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terry et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stracy et al., 2021</xref>). Multi-step binding may also lead to processive activity along PG by ensuring that Tae enzymes remain tethered to the cell wall substrate after each hydrolysis event, which would allow for ‘stepwise chewing.’ This would be yet another mechanism to increase the odds of localized, lytic activity.</p><p>In total, our combined use of biophysical and high-throughput genetic approaches uncovered novel insights into Tae toxin activity inside bacterial cells, providing a window into how small, single-domain enzymes carry out several, distinct functions in vivo. Our leveraging of a multipronged strategy was critical for overcoming technical obstacles inherent to proteins that interact with complex, insoluble molecules, providing access to a class of macromolecular interactions that are not well understood. The biophysical and kinetic parameters of proteins with 3D highly crosslinked macromolecular substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Broendum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McLaren and Packer, 1970</xref>) are dissimilar from those well-established for small, soluble substrates, and future adoption of combinatorial approaches such as ours may improve our understanding of general binding principles across these important enzymes that are ubiquitous across life. Additionally, the ability to quickly generate rich quantitative heatmaps for enzymes across different experimental conditions enables more sophisticated computational analyses. Predictive representation learning of unbiased, functional datasets across multiple biological conditions could help us anticipate a priori the functional consequences of sequence-based phylogenetic diversity. A deeper understanding of functional design principles would also enable more effective leveraging of evolutionary innovations to engineer new molecules tailored to physiological contexts with important, useful applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of long chains of PG</title><p>PG isolation and HPLC analysis were conducted according to an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stankeviciute et al., 2019</xref>) with the following modifications.

This vector contains the pelB signal sequence that would allow the expression of Tae1 variants in the cell periplasm. The preparation of variants was achieved through an error-prone PCR mutagenesis kit (GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit, Agilent Technologies), following the manufacturer’s instructions in order to ensure high proportion of single-mutant variants. The variants were cloned via restriction enzyme cloning. In order to track the behavior of variants, each one was barcoded with a unique DNA sequence. The barcodes were introduced immediately after the Tae1 coding sequence via Gibson assembly cloning (In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit, Takara Bio). Our next-generation sequencing strategy comprised two stages. First, the entire library was sequenced to determine the barcode corresponding to each variant. This was accomplished using 300 bp forward and reverse reads on the MiSeq Illumina platform (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3). Using this information, a dictionary was prepared to demonstrate the relationships between variants and barcodes. The dictionary was prepared by following previously published scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mavor et al., 2016</xref>) with some modification (see the GitHub directory ‘ChouLab dictionary’ for the steps and scripts). For each of the subsequent DMS experiments, 25 bp reads on a NextSeq Illumina platform (conducted at Chan Zuckerberg BioHub) were used to sequence only the barcode region. For data analysis and DMS scores calculations, we used Enrich2 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rubin et al., 2017</xref>). The barcode dictionary was used to convert barcodes to variants. Please see the ‘Choulab DMS data analysis’ GitHub directory for detailed information on data analysis in Enrich2. For the DMS experiments in this study, the DMS library was grown for 3 hr at 37°C in M9 minimal medium (or M9 supplemented with 20 mM D-Met) before distributing across a 96-well plate. A set of 24 wells was combined for each experimental time point in order to obtain enough DNA for library amplification. Libraries were amplified for nine cycles using Phusion high-fidelity polymerase to minimize any masking of differences in abundance. The libraries were gel purified, quantified using Qubit, and their concentrations were adjusted according to Illumina instructions before sequencing. The 0 hr time point (DMS library before any growth) was chosen as the input of the 96-well plate incubation. After growth to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.2, protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were collected 2 hr after induction that would serve as the output time point.

The distance between a candidate position and a cluster of positions is calculated as the average of the distance between the candidate position and the three closest nonself positions in the cluster.

The cell counts were obtained by injecting 20 µl of fixed cells onto a flow cytometer (Attune NxT by Thermo Fisher), using three mix cycles, a flow rate of 100 µl per min, BL1 (340 nm) and YL2 (360 nm) lasers, and forward scatter at 900 and side scatter at 500. The competitive index represents the ratio of the final cell counts over the initial cell counts. The cell counts at each time point were calculated as the number of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells divided by the number of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Flow cytometer data were analyzed using the FlowJo software.

Stock solutions of Tae1 and Tai1 were dialyzed overnight at 277 K in the same buffer (50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris 7.0). The cell was filled with 200 µl of Tai1 protein at a concentration of 20 µM to which 150 µM of Tae1 protein was titrated. For 25 titrations of 1.5 µl of Tae1 into Tai1, the heat of binding was recorded. Data were extracted and fitted using the single-site binding model following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> crystal structure</title><p>Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> protein crystals were generated by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 25°C from a 1:1 mixture of 10 mg/ml protein (in 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) with 0.2 M sodium thiocyanate, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 20% PEG3350 for 24 hr (same conditions that were used for initial structure of Tae1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaCourse et al., 2018</xref>]).

The sacculi from each media were used in eight pull-down assays, four assays using 1 µM enzyme and four assays using 0.1 µM enzyme. In each assay, the E-64 inhibitor (MilliporeSigma; Cat# E3132) was added at 10-fold excess of the enzyme concentration. The assays containing enzyme, inhibitor, and sacculi were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with shaking, followed by centrifugation to pellet the sacculi, completely removing the supernatant, resuspending the sacculi in 2× Laemmli sample loading buffer, and boiling for 15 min at 100°C in preparation for SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting.

We focused our work on the lytic activity of a toxin known as Tae1 involved in Type VI Secretion-mediated competition between bacteria.</p><p>All three reviewers provided valuable and actionable feedback on our manuscript. We were particularly pleased to see that many of the reviewer points were common across more than one reviewer. Of particular note, reviewers requested (1) improvement in technical quality for several Western blot analyses and (2) one more layer of experimental evaluation regarding how different bacterial cell wall structures may impact toxin variant binding in vitro. We are confident that we can experimentally address these two major suggestions in a timely manner, as described in Section 2. Other more minor points of feedback and our responses are also described in this section.</p><p>A third major suggestion from one of the reviewers is to more fully characterize the effects of some Tae1 variants on in vivo interbacterial competition assays. For reasons we elaborate on in Section 4, we feel that the nature of this experiment falls outside the scope of this study. Furthermore, the experiments required to pursue this direction rigorously fall outside the scope of what is feasible for us at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the planned revision (1 total) - completed</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Request.</italic> All 3 reviewers asked us to provide more experimental evidence addressing the hypothesis that differential PG affinity across Tae1 variants could explain variation in toxic activity.</p><p><italic>Response.</italic> We agree that this is an interesting point to follow up on further. To be clear, we also do not know whether this hypothesis is true at this stage, but we have devised an approach to ask the question experimentally across a subset of our DMS variants.</p><p><italic>Experimental plan.</italic> Reviewer 1 suggested that we quantify in vitro binding affinities for PG using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). However, given that ITC requires high concentrations of well-defined homogeneous substrates, which we are not able to generate for more complex higher order structures of cell wall PG, we propose a pull-down based approach.</p><p>To summarize, we propose conducting pull-downs using insoluble, purified cell wall sacculi from our two <italic>E. coli</italic> grown under the two conditions as bait for recombinant Tae1 proteins. Given that intact sacculi or inherently insoluble, we can simply collect bound Tae1 through centrifugation of sacculi pellets and examine the amount of Tae1 associated by Western blot analysis. These will need to be conducted across a titration of Tae1 concentrations and also with catalytic activity inhibited to avoid solubilization of sacculi. We will attempt this through either C30A backgrounds or in the presence of a chemical or Tai1 inhibitor.</p><p>If there is indeed differential affinity for PG underlying Tae1 variant functional differences, we would expect to see greater relative association of Tae1 variants with the type of cell wall sacculi that they more effectively lyse in our DMS screen. We would expect the reverse trend to also be true (lower affinity for less active variants).</p><p><italic>Result</italic>. While we were waiting to hear from <italic>eLife,</italic> we completed this proposed experiment above. In summary, we were unable to detect any major differences in Tae pelleting across conditions (see new Figure S5). Although the sensitivity of our pull-down assay inherently limits are detection to gross differences, our results suggest that there are no dramatic differences in bulk sacculus binding properties across conditions or variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Experimental revisions (2 total)</italic></p><p>– Improve technical quality of Western blot analyses (Reviewers 2, 3)</p></disp-quote><p>Two reviewers commented on the smeared appearance of Tae1 bands in our Western blot analyses. We repeated these experiments with more careful attention to lysate preparation, using a higher percentage SDS gel for better separation of low molecular weight proteins as suggested. Although we still saw some “smeariness” due to the fact that these cells have undergone lysis and tend to be “gooey”, these modifications did indeed improve the crispness of our bands. See updated panels for Figure 4F and 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Examine expression levels of WT and C110S Tae1 variant in vivo (Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 requested additional context regarding Tae1 expression levels in P. aeruginosa to more precisely assess whether increased self-intoxication by Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> in P. aeruginosa was due to differences in toxin activity or toxin levels. This was a good suggestion, and we examined this in two ways by Western blot analysis: comparison of native Tae1 expression levels in P. aeruginosa cells (1) grown alone in liquid culture, and (2) in P. aeruginosa cells grown together with <italic>E. coli</italic> on solid media under conditions matching our competition assays in this study. Our analyses suggest that Tae1<sup>C110S</sup> does not express at a higher level than Tae1<sup>WT</sup>, ruling out the possibility that variation in bulk expression levels underlie competition outcomes we observe.</p><p>1.

While we actually agree that results for these suggested lines of inquiry would indeed be interesting (we hope to see others do it!), we feel that these analyses fall outside the scope of this manuscript. Given the labor intensiveness of both requests, we also unfortunately must comment that these are not feasible for us to execute rigorously. Please see more information about each of these aspects below.</p><p>1. Analysis of additional DMS variants in interbacterial competition assays (Reviewer 2)</p><p><italic>Scope.</italic> We absolutely agree that examining Tae1 variants in the context of interbacterial competitions would be a critical orthogonal approach in order to validate that the DMS results have any bearing on competition outcomes. However, we feel that major focus of this paper is on the more molecular and biophysical insights that our approach can offer. Our study tests our assumptions about the kinds of features and surfaces that are important for proteins that engage with non-canonical complex substrates. It is, of course, interesting to think about the implications of this for physiological phenotypes and the drivers of toxin evolution. It is also exciting to imagine how this kind of information could be used to one day engineer certain interbacterial outcomes. We hope that others in the field will push our efforts into these directions, but we do not feel that these directions are essential for our conclusions. However, our conclusions on the molecular and biophysical aspects have helped generate interesting hypotheses in microbial ecology that could be followed up on by others.</p><p><italic>Feasibility</italic>. In order to conduct well-controlled <italic>P. aeruginosa: E. coli</italic> competition assays for our Tae1 variants, we would need to generate a significant number of new <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains encoding point mutations for each of our variants across several genetic backgrounds. The competitions themselves also require a considerable amount of work to optimize and quantify. The first author of this paper, who was the primary driver of this work, is no longer in my lab or in academia. As for myself, I am also in the middle of a transition out of academia and am actively ramping down my lab at UCSF. I no longer have the space or appropriate set-up to support this longer-term effort.</p><p>1. Conduct additional DMS screens in more conditions (Reviewer 1)</p><p><italic>Scope.</italic> We love this idea! In fact, we hope that others are motivated to adopt our workflow to run many more DMS screens for T6S toxins, as we believe these screens provide a lot of useful and sometimes surprising insights that could be of great interest to others. However, we believe that the primary goal of this paper is to establish this methodology as a compelling approach for studying toxins and, more generally, proteins with complex cellular substrates. It does not</p><p>necessarily fall within the scope of this paper to fully assess the mechanistic implications of cell wall diversity across a wide range of conditions.</p><p><italic>Feasibility.</italic> In our experience, rigorously conducting DMS screens requires a significant amount of effort and resources to establish consistent experimental conditions. Also, a non-trivial number of costly sequencing-based experiments are required across control and variables for the results to be statistically sound and meaningful. Furthermore, experimental validation of results are ultimately important for our ability to confidently generate hypotheses stemming from these datasets. As stated above, the first author of this paper, who was the primary driver of this work, is no longer in my lab or in academia. As for myself, I am in the middle of a transition out of academia and am actively ramping down my lab at UCSF. I no longer have the space or appropriate set-up to support this longer-term effort.</p></body></sub-article></article>
