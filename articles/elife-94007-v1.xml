While previous studies have analyzed the metabolic requirements for flight, it is still unclear how bat metabolism supports these unique features, and no study has integrated metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics to characterize bat metabolism. In this work, we performed a multi-omics data analysis using a computational model of metabolic fluxes to identify fundamental differences in central metabolism between primary lung fibroblast cell lines from the black flying fox fruit bat (<italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>) and human. Bat cells showed higher expression levels of Complex I components of electron transport chain (ETC), but, remarkably, a lower rate of oxygen consumption. Computational modeling interpreted these results as indicating that Complex II activity may be low or reversed, similar to an ischemic state. An ischemic-like state of bats was also supported by decreased levels of central metabolites and increased ratios of succinate to fumarate in bat cells. Ischemic states tend to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which would be incompatible with the longevity of bats. However, bat cells had higher antioxidant reservoirs (higher total glutathione and higher ratio of NADPH to NADP) despite higher mitochondrial ROS levels. In addition, bat cells were more resistant to glucose deprivation and had increased resistance to ferroptosis, one of the characteristics of which is oxidative stress. Thus, our studies revealed distinct differences in the ETC regulation and metabolic stress responses between human and bat cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bat metabolism</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>ischemia</kwd><kwd>flux modeling</kwd><kwd>succinate accumulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2019-T2-1-138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE-T2EP30120-0012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itahana</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/OFIRG/MOH-000639</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itahana</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016017</institution-id><institution>Duke-NUS Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Block Grants</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itahana</surname><given-names>Koji</given-names></name><name><surname>Tucker-Kellogg</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>To investigate why bats are long-lived and cancer-resistant, multi-omic data from bat and human cells was analyzed using computational flux modeling, suggesting dysregulation of succinate-fumarate dynamics and an ischemic-like basal metabolism in bat cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bats display many characteristics that set them apart from other mammals, including the capacity for wing-powered flight, low rates of cancer incidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seluanov et al., 2018</xref>), high longevity quotient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austad and Fischer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austad, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilkinson and South, 2002</xref>), and ability to carry many viruses (as a reservoir) without ill health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Each of these traits has distinct metabolic requirements and can affect overall metabolic activity. For example, flight is an energy-intensive process that requires high metabolic rates and ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas and Suthers, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maina, 2000</xref>). Resistance to cancer depends on multiple factors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) management, DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), and the ability to efflux genotoxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koh et al., 2019</xref>), all of which have metabolic underpinnings. Longevity and disease resistance both require tolerance to metabolic and oxidative stresses, and the ability to dampen inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kacprzyk et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Multiple studies have documented individual aspects of metabolic regulation in bats. Metabolic rates of bats during flight (ATP production) have been documented to be approximately three times greater than basal metabolic rates in other mammals of similar size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas and Suthers, 1972</xref>). In most other mammalian species, increased ATP production also creates increased production of ROS in the mitochondria, which can eventually lead to DNA and cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buffenstein et al., 2008</xref>), and activate inflammasome responses. On the other hand, low amounts of ROS are a part of homeostasis and have been linked to beneficial effects on survival in multiple contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mittler, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Meo et al., 2016</xref>). It is conceivable that the homeostatic amount of ROS for a healthy cell is species-specific, as different species may have different ways of coping with the adverse effects of ROS accumulation, e.g., ROS-induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, or may activate downstream pathways such as inflammasomes at different levels of ROS. Hence, for bats to be able to have a high metabolic rate without concomitant cellular/DNA damage would require one of the following to be true – improved decoupling of ATP production from ROS production (reduced leakage of electrons, so less ROS is produced), improved antioxidant defense to neutralize generated ROS, or improved repair of damage resulting in fewer deleterious effects of ROS (e.g. less inflammasome activation).</p><p>Different studies have proposed different mechanisms of ROS tolerance or antioxidant defense in bats including lower hydrogen peroxide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet-Rossinni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunet-Rossinni and Austad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Podlutsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ungvari et al., 2008</xref>), improved DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foley et al., 2018</xref>), higher expression of heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chionh et al., 2019</xref>) and/or a drug efflux factor, ABCB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koh et al., 2019</xref>), and positive selection for efficient mitochondria. While the reasons could be multifactorial, no studies have performed a systems-wide comparison of mitochondrial metabolism between bats and higher mammals such as humans. Such characterization of the basal energy metabolism of bats and how it is different from other mammals such as humans could shed light on mitochondrial activity/ROS management and hint toward metabolic factors that underlie/support desirable traits in bats, e.g., longevity, low cancer/mutation rates, and disease tolerance. Toward this goal, we compared the basal metabolism of cells from black flying fox fruit bat <italic>Pteropus alecto</italic> (<italic>P. alecto</italic>) and human cells. <italic>P. alecto</italic> is a member of the Pteropodidae family and is among the largest fructivore bats in the world. It has a lifespan of over 20 years and is documented to co-exist with lethal zoonotic viruses like Hendra and Nipah viruses. Using a primary lung fibroblast cell line that our group had established earlier from <italic>P. alecto</italic> (PaLung), we conducted a comparison between PaLung cells and human primary fibroblasts WI-38 cells to elucidate fundamental metabolic differences in the mitochondria.</p><p>Since bats and humans are very different species, it is likely that data from any one high-throughput platform (e.g. transcriptomics) would show many differences. Hence, to identify consistent differences in the metabolic regulation of <italic>P. alecto</italic> and humans, we looked for concordance between multiple high-throughput platforms: whole-cell transcriptomics, mitochondrial proteomics, and whole-cell metabolomics. To integrate the different omics results, we use constraint-based flux sampling, which is a computational modeling technique that simulates metabolic flux patterns using existing knowledge about metabolic network connectivity and topology. Constraint-based flux modeling has been used previously for comparing metabolic phenotypes across cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurich et al., 2017</xref>), understanding metabolic regulation of macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bordbar et al., 2012</xref>), studying ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>), characterizing microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jansma and El Aidy, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ezzamouri et al., 2023</xref>), optimizing metabolite production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patil et al., 2004</xref>), and understanding metabolic contributors of disease pathology, e.g., diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ravi and Gunawan, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, our results show that PaLung cells have differences in basal metabolism that resemble ischemia, including the possibility of low or reverse activity of Complex II in the electron transport chain (ETC). Finally, we characterized the response of bat cells to cellular stresses such as oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, and a type of cell death related to ischemia, viz. ferroptosis, and results were consistent with our prediction of ischemic-like basal metabolism in PaLung cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomics identifies differences in oxidative phosphorylation between PaLung cells and WI-38 cells</title><p>To understand the differences in cellular-scale metabolism between PaLung cells (<italic>P. alecto</italic>) and WI-38 cells (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), we performed whole-cell transcriptomics on the two cell lines. Transcriptomics detected a total of 21,952 mRNA transcripts in bat PaLung cells and 58,830 transcripts in human WI-38 cells, respectively. Since the bat genome is not as well annotated as the human genome, we performed downstream differential expression (DE) analysis using the set of 14,986 common transcripts found in both PaLung and WI-38 cells. DE analysis was performed using the DEseq pipeline, which was modified to normalize for the different transcript lengths in both species (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This method yielded a total of 6247 transcripts that passed our cutoff thresholds (|log fold change| ≥ 1 and FDR &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because there is no standard way of normalizing RNAseq data for inter-species comparison, we also repeated the analysis in the EdgeR package, using a recently published normalization method gene length corrected trimmed mean of M-values (GeTMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smid et al., 2018</xref>). Both methods yielded very similar results with minor discrepancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and we chose to perform further downstream analysis using the DEseq-generated DE transcript list. A summary of transcriptomics results for core metabolic pathways can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and the list of transcripts that passed our DE cutoffs can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The number of transcripts passing our DE cutoffs (6247) was extremely high, suggesting that multiple pathways are differentially regulated between the two species. We then performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), searching against the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO BP) database. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 2 and 3</xref> contain the list of enriched gene sets in PaLung and WI-38 cells respectively. Since the <italic>P. alecto</italic> genome is less fully annotated than the human genome, pathways with incomplete annotation may be incorrectly predicted to be downregulated in PaLung cells. Hence, we only studied differentially regulated pathways that were upregulated in PaLung. When we filtered PaLung-upregulated gene sets for significance (indicated by FDR &lt; 0.25 and normalized enrichment score |NES| &gt; 1), and for relevance to metabolism, only 21 gene sets remained. Many were relevant to secondary metabolism or anabolic/catabolic housekeeping, five were related to the TCA cycle and electron transport (including ‘ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling, respiratory electron transport, and heat production by uncoupling proteins’) and three were related to hypoxic stress (such as ‘cellular response to hypoxia’ in the Reactome Pathway database). The genes belonging to both oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and response to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) gene sets had increased transcriptional expression in PaLung cells. This was interesting because, conventionally, these two pathways are active under opposing conditions (high oxygen for OxPhos vs low oxygen for hypoxia), and so would not be expected to vary in concert with each other. This hinted toward non-trivial regulation of central metabolism in PaLung cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RNAseq data analysis of PaLung and WI-38 cells for differential expression and pathway enrichment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow of bioinformatics analysis pipeline for RNAseq data from PaLung (<italic>P. alecto</italic>) and WI-38 (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>) cells (<italic>n</italic>=3).

Unexpectedly, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) under basal conditions was lower in PaLung cells compared to WI-38 cells. Notably, bat cells have much lower maximal respiratory capacity compared to WI-38 cells, indicated by FCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggested that PaLung cells are able to carry out less OxPhos than WI-38 cells. While this observation agrees with earlier studies showing mild depolarization in the mitochondria of bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vyssokikh et al., 2020</xref>), it is in sharp contrast with our observation of increased OxPhos machinery in PaLung cells, using transcriptomics and proteomics. Taking a closer look at the omics results, we observed that the GSEA-flagged upregulation in OxPhos was driven mostly by the upregulation of Complex I subunits, for both the proteomic and transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that in the basal state, PaLung cells might have partial decoupling of Complex I from the ETC, meaning that electrons emerging from Complex I might not proceed through the entirety of the ETC. This partial decoupling of Complex I might result in lower overall ATP synthesis, creating continued demand for ATP production from other sources. This would be consistent with our transcriptomic finding that both OxPhos-related and hypoxia-related genes were upregulated in PaLung cells. To build a self-consistent interpretation of these paradoxical omics and functional datasets, we proceeded to perform computational modeling of mitochondrial metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Computational flux modeling suggests that Complex II of the ETC may run in reverse in PaLung cells</title><p>To understand the metabolic consequences of having higher Complex I activity but lower overall respiration, we turned to constraint-based flux modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We started with Mitocore, a published model of mitochondrial metabolism, that includes both core mitochondrial reactions and supporting cytoplasmic reactions from central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, folate cycle, urea cycle, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Mitocore provides the set of metabolic reactions that can occur in a cell without specifying the activity, abundance, expression, or utilization of each element. To establish a model for each species, we took a species-specific subset of Mitocore reactions (called a <italic>context-specific reconstruction</italic>) based on the presence and absence of gene/protein expression in the transcriptomic/proteomic data for each species (see Materials and methods). This resulted in a PaLung model with 409 reactions and 324 metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>), and a WI-38 model with 437 reactions and 341 metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. We then performed uniform flux sampling (5000 samples) of the two models without imposing any constraints on either model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The individual metabolic models are then simulated using constraint-based flux sampling methods to give a distribution of possible fluxes for each reaction in the model. Comparing these flux distributions between the two models allows the detection of metabolic reactions that are likely to be differentially regulated in response to user-imposed constraints on metabolism.

This network of metabolic reactions (defined by nodes and arrows) is converted from the format of reaction equations into the format of a matrix called the stoichiometric matrix. Each row of the matrix represents a single metabolite in the network and each column represents a single reaction in the network. The (<bold><italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic></bold>) element of matrix <italic>S</italic> represents the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite <italic>i</italic> in reaction <italic>j</italic>. Stoichiometric coefficients indicate how many copies of each reactant or product are consumed or produced when the reaction is utilized (often 1 or –1). By converting all the reactions of a metabolic network into this matrix format, a single column represents a single reaction in the metabolic network, including all metabolites produced or consumed in it. For example, the first column of the matrix (corresponding to reaction R1) has the value of –1 for the <italic>Glc</italic> row and 1 for <italic>G6P</italic> row, indicating that in reaction R1, one unit of <italic>Glc</italic> is consumed and one unit of <italic>G6P</italic> is produced. Likewise, each row of the matrix represents all sources of production and consumption for a single metabolite. For example, the second row of the matrix (corresponding to the metabolite <italic>G6P</italic>) has the values of 1, –1, and –1 for the reactions R1, R2, and R3, respectively. This indicates that one unit of <italic>G6P</italic> is produced in reaction R1, while one unit of G6P is consumed in reactions R2 and R3, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Example of a flux vector. A flux vector contains as many elements as the number of reactions in the network, and their values are typically unknown. Flux values indicate the rate at which the corresponding reaction is utilized (a forward reaction is a positive flux, and a reverse reaction is a negative flux). The goal of flux sampling is to obtain values (or distributions) for each element of the flux vector. (<bold>C</bold>) The product of the stoichiometric matrix and the flux vector (written as the product <italic>Sv</italic>) results in a set of linear algebra equations. Each linear equation has flux variables and stoichiometric coefficients. If we assume the flux is balanced in the system, then everything produced has somewhere to go or some reaction to consume it. This steady-state assumption is described mathematically by setting the matrix product to zero (<italic>Sv</italic> = 0). (<bold>D</bold>) The process of flux sampling searches the space of possible flux vectors <italic>v</italic> to find those that satisfy <italic>Sv</italic> = 0. Sampling is typically necessary because the set of equations from (<bold>C</bold>) is usually underdetermined and does not have a unique solution for the flux variables <italic>v</italic>. The computational sampling process outputs flux vectors that satisfy the equations (i.e. <italic>feasible</italic> vectors), and that also capture a diversity of feasible behaviors for how the metabolic network could achieve steady state. From this set of flux vectors, we plot histograms (distributions) of the feasible values of the flux variable for each reaction in the metabolic network. This theoretical delineation of feasible behaviors can be used for drawing biological inferences by assuming that the actual biological pathway activity falls within the feasible range of the theoretical model. When comparing two models such as bat and human, inferences arise from reactions or pathways where feasible behaviors become infeasible or vice versa. This can be seen by identifying reactions, whose flux histograms show large differences between the human and bat models.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94007-fig3-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the metabolomics data from PaLung and WI-38 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) plot shows the separation between the three PaLung samples and the three WI-38 samples in the metabolomics data.

The first constraint is that the PaLung model must have greater activity of Complex I than the WI-38 model. This constraint was inspired by the transcriptomic/proteomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>) and by inferring that the flux through Complex I in PaLung cells would be greater than the flux through Complex I in WI-38 cells. (see ‘Constraints for flux sampling’ in Materials and methods). The second constraint, based on our oxygen consumption data, is that the WI-38 model must have higher oxygen intake into the mitochondria than the PaLung model. When the PaLung and WI-38 models were simulated under these two constraints, the flux histograms for PaLung cells had shifted to very low or negative flux values for Complex II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Complex II is also called succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and is part of both the TCA cycle and the ETC. SDH generally catalyzes the conversion of succinate into fumarate, accompanied by a reduction of the endogenous Quinone pool. However, SDH has also been documented to catalyze the reverse reaction, converting fumarate to succinate, although this is unconventional. Such an unconventional ETC paradigm where Complex I proceeds forward but Complex II proceeds in reverse (toward the accumulation of succinate) has been observed in other systems, e.g., in murine retinal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisbach et al., 2020</xref>) and human hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>), under ischemic or hypoxic conditions. In these cases, the resulting accumulation of succinate was found to be useful in fueling other cells in the tissue or in avoiding reperfusion injury when ischemic conditions were abruptly removed. During conventional ETC, both Complex I and Complex II operate in parallel and produce electrons that are shuttled downstream to Complex III, Complex IV, and ATP synthase. However, prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>) has documented an alternative in which the electrons obtained from Complex I can be consumed by Complex II operating in reverse, rather than traversing the rest of the ETC. Accordingly, the low or negative flux values for Complex II in our PaLung simulations indicate that the electrons obtained from Complex I may accumulate at Complex II or potentially even get consumed by Complex II operating in reverse (bypassing the rest of the ETC) in PaLung cells. To further interrogate central carbon metabolism in PaLung cells and to validate if our predictions of unconventional SDH activity might be borne out by metabolic measurements, we undertook targeted metabolomics of small organic compounds for both PaLung and WI-38 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Metabolomics supports the possibility of low/reverse Complex II activity in PaLung cells</title><p>Mass spectrometry-based targeted metabolomics was performed on both PaLung and WI-38 cell lines, resulting in the absolute quantification of 116 metabolites from central carbon metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). Since we were comparing different species, we looked at relative ratios of metabolites within each species. As predicted by our hypothesis, metabolomics showed that the ratio of succinate-to-fumarate was much higher in PaLung cells (5.44±0.67) compared to WI-38 cells (1.07±0.012) (p&lt;0.001), consistent with succinate accumulation in PaLung cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, the ratio of other serial TCA metabolites, e.g., citrate/succinate or fumarate/malate, showed only mild or insignificant differences between PaLung and WI-38 cells. We interpreted this as an indication that the TCA cycle acts in a truncated manner in PaLung cells, with SDH operating in reverse to support succinate accumulation. Interestingly, previous studies have documented such SDH phenomena (with the low or reverse activity of Complex II) during ischemic/hypoxic states that had low metabolic rates and high levels of AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisbach et al., 2020</xref>).

ATP/ADP ratio is a golden standard for the measurement of cellular energy status, and our results suggest lower metabolism in PaLung cells. Another corroborating measurement for energy status is adenylate energy charge, with lower values indicating slower metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson and Walton, 1967</xref>). We found that PaLung cells had lower adenylate energy charge compared to WI-38 cells (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). From these parameters, we infer that PaLung cells have lower ATP synthesis, consistent with our earlier observations of lower OCR in PaLung cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To check if slower metabolism would also translate to slower glycolysis in PaLung cells, we first checked our transcriptomics and metabolomics data. Both omics datasets showed mixed signals along the glycolysis pathway (with partial upregulation and partial downregulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), yielding no predictions for glycolysis utilization. However, metabolomics showed higher levels of intracellular lactate in WI-38 cells than in PaLung cells, suggesting that PaLung cells could have lower glycolytic flux than WI-38 cells. Finally, we assessed glycolysis levels using a Seahorse XF Analyzer to quantify the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). This revealed that PaLung cells had lower ECAR compared to WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). From these observations of low ECAR, low lactate, and low ATP/ADP ratio, combined with the earlier findings of low OCR, we conclude that PaLung cells have less energy production and a lower level of basal metabolic activity than WI-38 cells.</p><p>Reduced OxPhos and glycolysis in PaLung cells somewhat resemble an ischemic-like state with inadequate oxygen and glucose supply.

The ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG ratio) was not significantly different between the two cell lines (WI-38 cells: 36.45±3.6 vs PaLung cells: 30.94±2.97). However, PaLung cells had a twofold higher concentration of total intracellular glutathione, compared to WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also found that PaLung cells had a higher NADPH/NADP ratio (1.5-fold) compared to WI-38 cells. Overall, the metabolomics data indicated that PaLung cells had a nearly 2.5-fold higher ratio of NADP/NAD, i.e., a higher resting concentration of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We wondered if apart from combatting ROS, the high glutathione levels might also help PaLung cells avoid ischemia-induced ferroptosis. Recent studies have reported that ischemia-induced ferroptosis causes tissue damage and that inhibition of ferroptosis attenuates ischemia-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2021</xref>). Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic, programmed form of cell death, which is iron-dependent and occurs via glutathione depletion-induced lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ursini and Maiorino, 2020</xref>). Given that PaLung cells showed upregulation of glutathione/NADPH antioxidant system and genes related to hypoxia response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and ischemic metabolism, we tested whether PaLung cells can better tolerate ferroptosis-inducing conditions. Ferroptosis was induced by erastin, an SLC7A11/xCT inhibitor. While WI-38 cells showed high sensitivity to erastin-induced ferroptosis that were prevented by a ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1, PaLung cells were resistant to erastin-induced ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Similarly, PaLung cells were more resistant to cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis, compared to WI-38 cells and had almost sevenfold lower cell death than WI-38 cells (3.5% cell death in PaLung cells compared to 24.4% cell death in WI-38 cells upon cystine deprivation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

Both WI-38 and PaLung cells showed decreased GSH/GSSG ratio under cystine deprivation, which indicates both cell lines are under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Cystine deprivation decreased total glutathione levels in WI-38 cells by 94.5%, nearly depleting glutathione reserves. In contrast, cystine deprivation in PaLung cells resulted in only a modest 29.5% decrease, and PaLung cells still maintained a total glutathione level higher than non-cystine-deprived WI-38 cells. The higher levels of total glutathione, GSH, and GSSG under cystine deprivation might explain the high resistance of PaLung cells under ferroptosis-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F, G, and H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we integrated high-throughput omics and computational metabolic modeling to perform a novel comparison of central metabolism between cell lines from two mammalian species. Specifically, we have identified core differences in mitochondrial metabolism between primary lung fibroblasts of the black flying fox fruit bat <italic>P. alecto</italic> (PaLung) and the primary human lung fibroblast cell line WI-38. Although data are still limited to these two cell lines, this is the first comprehensive analysis combining proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and constraint-based flux modeling between human and bat cells. Our analysis suggests that PaLung cells exhibit basal metabolism that resembles an ischemic-like state and that this state may be linked to low or reverse activity of Complex II of the ETC (also called SDH). Compared to WI-38 cells, PaLung cells also show a higher tolerance to cellular stresses such as nutrient deprivation and ischemia/ROS-driven cell death via ferroptosis.</p><p>Hypoxia response (including glycolysis) and OxPhos compensate for each other by gene expression, dependent on different levels of oxygen availability. However, our analyses (GSEA from whole-cell transcriptomics) indicated that genes related to glycolysis and OxPhos were simultaneously upregulated in PaLung cells (bat) compared to WI-38 cells (human). Although multiple glycolytic genes were upregulated in PaLung cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), lactate production (inferred via both LDH expression levels and ECAR measurement) in PaLung cells was not higher than in WI-38 cells. This raises an important caveat about using ECAR to infer glycolytic flux, because ECAR depends only on the amount of lactate produced, and glycolytic pyruvate that enters the TCA cycle may remain invisible to ECAR measurements.</p><p>Our observation about the upregulation of OxPhos in PaLung cells via GSEA (transcriptomics and proteomics) also raises an important point of concern, namely that high signals of a certain pathway in GSEA can be driven by a narrower subset of genes. For instance, in both our transcriptomic and proteomic GSEA results, the ETC genes upregulated in the PaLung samples did follow the frequency distribution expected when taking into account the total subunit counts of each ETC complex (CI: 44, CII: 4, CIII: 10, and CIV: 19 subunits). However, the sheer absolute number of Complex I genes upregulated was enough for GSEA to declare the entire OxPhos gene set as upregulated in PaLung cells. While this does not say if the other ETC complexes were upregulated in PaLung, it shows the outsized effect Complex I genes have on the entire OxPhos pathway, simply because of overwhelming numbers. Hence, while interpreting GSEA results, it is necessary to survey the constituent genes that are responsible for the predicted up/downregulation of the overall pathway. Indeed, we found that the upregulation of OxPhos pathway in PaLung cells in GSEA was due to high gene expression of the Complex I components in the ETC. However, our experimental analysis revealed a puzzling result: despite high Complex I expression, oxygen consumption was low in PaLung cells.</p><p>To interpret the metabolic implications of heightened Complex I and lower oxygen consumption, we turned to constrained-based metabolic flux sampling. Flux sampling is a technique that can simulate possible states of a metabolic network. Compared to higher resolution methods such as isotope-labeled fluxomics, flux sampling is a coarse-grained qualitative approach to study metabolic flux. However, it can be used as a tool to generate testable hypotheses in exploratory studies such as ours. Indeed, metabolomics was able to verify our simulation predictions of succinate accumulation in PaLung cells, a phenomenon that could result from low/reverse activity (fumarate to succinate) of Complex II of ETC (SDH). The succinate-to-fumarate ratio in well-oxygenated PaLung cells was found to be similar to those found in ischemic states of human cells from multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>). From this, we infer that the TCA cycle in PaLung cells does something different than the TCA cycle in human WI-38 cells, which is also corroborated by our observation that PaLung cells have a low metabolic rate. We also confirmed using cell culture assays that PaLung cells have a much longer survival during glucose deprivation than WI-38 cells.</p><p>We also found that PaLung cells had higher loads of mitochondrial ROS, consistent with having the lower expression of <italic>SOD1</italic> and <italic>SOD2</italic>. On the other hand, PaLung cells highly express glutathione peroxidase 3 (<italic>GPX3</italic>), contain twofold higher levels of glutathione, and maintain a higher NADPH/NADP ratio compared to WI-38 cells. These data suggest that PaLung cells maintain a standing pool of NADPH and glutathione that can act against high levels of mitochondrial ROS. Therefore, the previously published generalization that bats have lower free radical production than other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet-Rossinni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2009</xref>) may require moderation. Future work can address whether PaLung cells have a higher threshold for homeostatic ROS and whether ROS have both beneficial and detrimental effects in bats, as has been observed in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clément and Pervaiz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shields et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The key novelty of our results is the suggestion of a basal ischemic-like state in PaLung cells accompanied by higher ROS production and higher glutathione and NADPH levels. Multiple studies have shown strong links between ischemia, ROS, and ferroptosis (an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of cell death). Despite having ischemic-like metabolism and higher ROS levels, we observed that PaLung cells were more resistant to ferroptosis than WI-38 cells. Ferroptosis occurs via ROS-induced lipid peroxidation following ischemia and is conventionally blocked via the action of glutathione peroxidase 4 (<italic>GPX4</italic>). While <italic>GPX4</italic> expression levels were low in PaLung cells, <italic>GPX3</italic> (a commonly secreted form of glutathione peroxidase) was highly expressed. Future studies are needed to determine the function of GPX3 in the stress response and whether it contributes to the ferroptosis resistance of PaLung cells.</p><p>Our identification of a metabolic state in bats that resembles ischemia is also tied to conventional wisdom about bat flight. During flight, the metabolic rate of bats can go 2.5–3 times higher than that of other mammals, consuming approx. 1200 calories per hour, resulting in an immense drain on stored energy reserves, and the potential depletion of up to 50% of stored energy in fructivore bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voigt and Speakman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelm et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, a basal state with a low metabolic rate may serve to conserve energy during non-flying periods. In addition, the accumulated succinate during this ischemic-like state can also be transported into the bloodstream and serve as a metabolic stimulant for other fast-metabolizing cell types as needed, similar to examples of succinate shuttling between two cell types in retinal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisbach et al., 2020</xref>). Low metabolic rates have also been linked to longevity by many studies, which demonstrate that calorie restriction contributes to an extended lifespan across various species. In our experiments, <italic>P. alecto</italic> also showed higher expression of genes involved in NAD synthesis and its phosphorylation pathways, in agreement with other studies that have linked higher flux through the NAD biosynthesis pathway with slower aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chini et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given that we compare two vastly different species, our work is subject to some technical limitations due to assumptions of comparability. Specifically, (1) we perform GSEA using human-derived GO terms and gene sets, (2) we map proteomic peptides between human and <italic>P. alecto</italic> proteins, and (3) we use human-derived metabolic mitochondrial models for computational flux sampling. However, such assumptions are unavoidable and currently serve as the best recourse, until further research into bats can provide better bioinformatic tools more suited to bats. In addition, reference genomes for less studied organisms like bats may not be as well annotated as other organisms. Since we perform transcriptomic analyses only using genes identified in both species, observed downregulation of a pathway in PaLung cells might be because the constituent genes were not annotated as well, and not because they weren’t expressed as highly. For exactly this reason, we have focused on pathways that were upregulated in bats, and we made no conclusion about pathways downregulated in bats.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that we performed multi-omics comparisons between individual cell lines. Extending the current study to primary tissues or cell lines from other species of bats might provide further information about generalized metabolic differences between bats and humans. The differences we observe in our study could also be cell-type dependent. For example, our choice of fibroblast cell lines may explain why we observed PaLung cells to have lower oxygen consumption than WI-38 cells, even under uncoupled conditions. Future work can study muscle cells in the same species to obtain broader metabolic insights. The current study can be considered a starting point to both generate hypotheses for future work and to establish analysis pipelines for inter-species comparisons of metabolism, using multi-omics data and computational flux modeling simulations.</p><p>In summary, using multi-omics datasets (transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic) and computational modeling, we have compared the basal metabolic states of a human cell line and a <italic>P. alecto</italic> cell line. Our work points toward important differences in ETC regulation (potential low/reverse Complex II activity) and antioxidant response (higher glutathione and NADPH) that could contribute to ischemia/redox management and ferroptosis resistance in <italic>P. alecto</italic>. Future research can extend the idea further to identify if such regulation is a pan-bat feature and if such metabolic fingerprints might also contribute to cancer resistance and increased longevity in bats.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell cultures and reagents</title><p>WI-38 cells (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0579">CVCL_0579</ext-link>) from <italic>H. sapiens</italic> (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:NCBITaxon_9606">NCBITaxon_9606</ext-link>) were purchased from Coriell Institute.

The expression levels of all enzymes of the mitocore model were checked in our proteomics and RNAseq datasets, and enzymes were marked as missing if they had &lt;5 counts in two out of three samples (for each PaLung and WI-38) for transcriptomics, and &lt;2000 abundance in two out of three samples for proteomics. Reactions in the mitocore model whose activity depended on the presence of missing genes were iteratively removed from the model while ensuring that the removal of reactions would not result in absence of flux-carrying capacity for ATP production, TCA cycle, or glycolysis. The final reconstructed model for PaLung cells contained 409 reactions and 324 metabolites, and the reconstructed model for WI-38 cells contained 437 reactions and 341 metabolites. We call these PaLung and WI-38 models the ‘reconstructed models’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Flux sampling</title><p>For each species, we first obtained a feasible range of metabolic flux levels for each reaction by performing flux sampling on the ‘reconstructed’ model for that species. To perform flux sampling, we generated 5000 flux vectors through uniform sampling using the COBRA toolbox v3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heirendt et al., 2019</xref>). We call this round of flux sampling the ‘control simulation’ as there are no constraints imposed on the flux of the reactions for Complex I and oxygen consumption, meaning that these reactions are free to assume any flux values that satisfy the steady-state assumption. Next, we repeated the flux sampling process for a case where the PaLung model was forced to have higher flux through the Complex I reaction than the WI-38 model, and lower flux through the oxygen consumption reaction than the WI-38 model. We call this the ‘constrained simulation’. The setting of constraints is explained in the following section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Constraints for flux sampling</title><p>Constraining reaction fluxes in a metabolic network is usually accomplished by setting a lower bound or an upper bound (or both) on the feasible range of the flux values for individual reactions. When a lower bound is set, flux sampling will only output flux vectors where the flux for that reaction is greater than or equal to the set lower bound. Similarly, setting an upper bound ensures that flux sampling will only output flux vectors where the reaction flux is less than or equal to the set upper bound. To ensure that the PaLung model would have higher Complex I activity and lower mitochondrial oxygen consumption than the WI-38 model, we set flux constraints as follows. We first computed the maximum possible fluxes of the Complex I reaction (Reaction ID: CI_MitoCore) in both PaLung and WI-38 models. We then set the lower bound of the PaLung Complex I reaction flux to a value equal to 70% of its theoretical maximum. Similarly, we set the upper bound of the WI-38 Complex I reaction at a value equal to 30% of its theoretical maximum value. This ensured that the PaLung model would have higher flux through the Complex I reaction, in comparison to the WI-38 model. A similar process of identifying maximum possible fluxes and setting lower and upper bounds was followed for the oxygen consumption reaction (Reaction ID: O<sub>2</sub>tm) to ensure that the lower bound of the reaction in the WI-38 model was higher than the upper bound in the PaLung model. Flux sampling was then performed for both the constrained PaLung model and the constrained WI-38 model to obtain 5000 flux vectors (as with the control simulation). More details about setting flux sampling constraints and the effects of using different constraint values can be found in Appendix 3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MitoSOX assay and antimycin A treatment</title><p>PaLung and WI-38 cells were cultured on six-well plates and treated with either DMSO or antimycin A (1 μΜ) for 16 hr.

Toward this goal, we first set constraints on the Complex I reaction (CI_MitoCore) and the mitochondrial oxygen transport reaction (O<sub>2</sub>tm) in our metabolic models of PaLung (P model) and WI-38 (W model). In an ideal scenario, these two reactions are completely independent of each other in flux space and setting constraints/thresholds on one reaction does not affect the feasible flux space of the other reaction. However, in our case we observed that constraining one reaction also limits the feasible flux space of the other reaction. Hence, we follow the below protocol in setting our constraints, to ensure that the Complex I flux of bats is higher than humans and vice versa for the O<sub>2</sub> flux. We call this the 30-70 protocol as the bounds are set to 30% or 70% of the feasible flux range for each reaction.</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Compute the minimum and maximum flux possible through CI_MitoCore for the two models.

General Statements [optional]</p></disp-quote><p>We thank all three reviewers for their valuable comments and sincerely appreciate the diligence and their attention to detail in reading our manuscript “Multi-omic analysis of bat versus human fibroblasts reveals altered central metabolism.” All three reviewers agreed that our work is significant, and reviewers described the strengths of our work as follows: novel insight into bat metabolism, providing a first-of-its-kind comprehensive study using multi-omics approaches and modelling for inter-species comparison, and providing a valuable stepping stone for further research on bat metabolism.</p><p>The reviewers also raised individual questions about specific points in our work and made suggestions for improving the strength of our claims. We agree with the reviewers' assessments in most cases and will incorporate their suggestions into the text, analyses, and interpretation of our work. Our point-by-point responses explain how we will address each of the reviewers’ concerns, on both the wet bench and computational aspects of our work. These include redoing the following: glucose deprivation cell death assay, transcriptomics analysis using current bioinformatics pipelines, GSEA analysis for both transcriptomics and proteomics data, and flux sampling using modified constraints. Several requests for additional information have been addressed by providing the relevant rationale/justification in our responses. Reviewer 2 suggested biochemical validation of the upregulation of Complex I in bat cells. However, it remains challenging to perform such validation using qPCR or Western blotting in the bat species for reasons that are detailed in our responses. Therefore, following Reviewer 1's suggestion, we have decided to moderate our claims in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Reviewer 1 Major comments</p><p>1. Regarding Figure 1A, the authors mention 'n = 3' for a single cell line. Does this refer to three different passages or three independent experiments? Please provide a more detailed description to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the comment. We apologize for not providing sufficient descriptions of the cells and experiments. Our datasets in Figure 1 were generated from three independent experiments, comparing the cell lines WI-38 (W) and PaLung (P) respectively: W1 vs P1, W2 vs P2, and W3 vs P3. These sets of cells were harvested at different passages in each experiment. Cells were generally subcultured at a 1:2 ratio and they were collected at passage numbers 26 (W1), 30 (W2), and 35 (W3) or 5 (P1), 6 (P2) and 7 (P3). We will provide these details in the Material and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In relation to Figures 1C and 1D, the authors state in the figure legend that the 'GSEA analysis identifies Respiratory electron transport and Cellular response to hypoxia as the top metabolic pathways that are differentially regulated between PaLung and WI-38 cells.' (Lines 140-144). However, the criteria for selecting these terms as the top metabolic pathways is not clear. In the lists in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, the authors' proposed term, 'Respiratory electron transport,' is ranked 126th, and 'Cellular response to hypoxia' is ranked 79th. Conversely, terms related to the TCA cycle are ranked 66th and 82nd, and another term that seems to be related to hypoxia, 'OXYGEN-DEPENDENT PROLINE HYDROXYLATION OF HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR Α,' is ranked 62nd. Could the authors please provide a clarification for their choice of 'Respiratory electron transport' and 'Cellular response to hypoxia' as the top metabolic pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this question. When presenting results in our original submission, we chose to display gene sets that satisfied the following requirements –</p><p>1) The gene set pertains to central metabolism (defined as being a sub-gene set of the superfamily Cellular Metabolic Process GO:0044237)</p><p>2) The gene set satisfies the FDR &lt; 0.25 threshold commonly used for GSEA analysis (as opposed to p &lt; 0.05 used in conventional statistics). Justification for why a higher FDR threshold is used for GSEA can be found on the GSEA FAQ website.</p><p>(https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/FAQ)</p><p>3) Has a nominal enrichment score with absolute value &gt;= 1</p><p>4) When multiple similar gene sets (by biological pathway) satisfy the above constraints, we pick the largest gene set (by gene count) to get a more high-level comparison of metabolism</p><p>It was from these criteria that we originally displayed the respiratory electron transport gene set (over the similar TCA cycle gene sets, although the TCA gene sets were ranked higher), and the cellular response to hypoxia gene set. In response to this reviewer’s later comments about the bioinformatics pipeline used (minor comment 1), we propose to redo our RNAseq analysis using updated methods such as STAR. We will also redo our GSEA using the newly updated results from the improved pipeline and will follow the same steps listed above to identify the core metabolic processes that are altered in PaLung cells. When describing these new results in the manuscript text, we will point out explicitly that the GSEA pathways chosen for display/discussion are not the absolute top pathways shown by GSEA, but among the top few metabolic gene sets and were selected by this protocol for display. In addition, we will also add supplemental material showing ES plots similar to the ones in Figure 1 for other similar gene sets that may be ranked higher in the GSEA ranking than the ones displayed in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the Materials and methods section (lines 419-421), the authors mention, 'GSEA was run against the complete Gene ontology biological process (GO BP) gene set list (containing 18356 gene sets).' However, they narrow down the gene dataset for analysis (lines 136-138, 'we filtered our gene dataset to contain only genes listed under the Gene ontology category Cellular Metabolic Process (GO ID:0044237), resulting in a truncated list of 4794 genes.'). I'm concerned that this selective approach might introduce bias into the resultant pathways. Is this selective approach commonly employed in this type of analysis? And isn't there a need for adjustments to avoid potential bias?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying this error on our side. It is true that in our initial analysis, we ‘filtered our gene dataset to contain only genes listed under the Gene ontology category Cellular Metabolic Process (GO ID:0044237), resulting in a truncated list of 4794 genes.’ Hence this line was included in the original version of the manuscript. However, owing to the same concerns raised by this reviewer, we later decided against this approach and ran the GSEA analysis using ALL genes detected in our RNAseq experiments (without filtering for metabolic genes). Figures 1C-D, and Supplementary Tables 2-3 were all generated from this GSEA analysis with the complete gene set list. However, it was an oversight on our part to not amend the manuscript text in lines 136-138. We propose to remove the corresponding lines in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors noted that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) is quite high (6,247 out of 14,986) as per lines 134-135, stating that &quot;The number of differentially expressed genes (6,247) was extremely high, suggesting that multiple pathways are differentially regulated between the two species.&quot; However, this large number of DEGs could indicate either an improper correction procedure or a need for a more stringent threshold. The authors should address this issue to avoid potential misinterpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion. The words “differentially expressed” are problematic in an inter-organism comparison. In our original submission, we never used the 6247 “differential expressed” genes as a pre-filter for downstream analysis, and our GSEA analyses used ALL genes common to both organisms. For the revised manuscript, we will refrain from using the term differentially expressed in the transcriptomic context. As suggested by reviewer 3, we will simply refer to them as genes that pass our cutoff threshold. In addition, we will also make our thresholds more stringent (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and |log fold change| &gt; 1.5).</p><p>In terms of the correction procedure, in addition to the typical normalization performed, we also do correct for differences in transcript/gene length in different organisms as part of our analysis, and we believe this correction should suffice for inter-species comparison of RNAseq experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 2B, the samples labeled as W1 and P1 appear to be outliers. This raises questions about the integrity of the sampling or analysis process. Please describe about this.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the comment and concern. Indeed, proteomics was done in pairs of PaLung and WI38 samples on different days, (P1, W1), (P2, W2), (P3, W3). It is possible that there might have been batch effects in the first pair that caused them to be outliers. Therefore, in addition to the main figure (n = 3), we will redo the proteomics analysis, including GSEA, after discarding the pair (P1, W1) and include this additional analysis in the supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Regarding the GSEA analysis of Figure 2, they are using the full set of GSEA. However, this reviewer is wondering if this is appropriate when analyzing mitochondrial fractions, as I believe using the entire GSEA set could introduce a bias. Is this a common approach? Shouldn't the authors be focusing on mitochondrial-related sets within the GSEA, and then determining the upregulated and downregulated pathways from there?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this reviewer’s question, we propose to redo the GSEA analysis of the proteomics data using gene sets that are more specific for mitochondria. An example can be found in the Mitocarta database (https://www.broadinstitute.org/mitocarta/mitocarta30-inventory-mammalian-mitochondrial-proteins-and-pathways), which contains a gene set file (MitoPathways3.0.gmx). This gene set file is tailored for GSEA and contains 1136 mitochondrial genes sorted into 149 mitochondrial pathways/gene sets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors describe in lines 195-197, &quot;GSEA-flagged upregulation in OxPhos was driven mostly by the upregulation of Complex I subunits, for both the proteomic and transcriptomic data (Figure 2G, Supplementary Figure S1D).&quot; However, within this analysis, the number of genes composing each subgroup of the mitochondrial Complexes are 44 for Complex I, 4 for Complex II, 10 for Complex III, and 19 for Complex IV (https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/639). The authors mention that the genes of Complex I were dominant in the ETC, but, might this just be reflecting the original difference in the number of genes? As this reviewer believes this could have a significant impact on the authors' current claims, this reviewer suggest the authors to carefully reconsider this point, comparing the actual results with the proportion expected from the difference in gene numbers. (Even in Figure S1D, it appears to correlate with the number of genes: C1 39.3%, C3 10.7%, C4 10.7%, C2 3.5%)</p></disp-quote><p>Combined response for points 7 and 8 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. As pointed out in Major Point 7, if the authors' claim of enrichment in Complex I is indeed due to the large number of genes included in the Complex I subgroup (https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/639), can the assumption of High Complex I flux truly be considered valid? In that case, this constraints model would become inappropriate, and the validity of the inferred low or reverse activity of Complex II would be diminished. Therefore, a careful re-examination is desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret points 7 and 8 as having distinct but related concerns. (1) Is the enrichment of ETC just an artifact of Complex I having many subunits? (2) Is the ETC gene set enriched because of upregulation Complex I, or because of multiple mitochondrial complexes and it only appears to be dominated by the Complex I significance due to Complex I having many subunits? (3) Is the enrichment of Complex I just an artifact of Complex I having many subunits? Responses to these concerns are below.</p><p>In the first concern, the reviewers ask if it’s true that the proportion of observed Complex I genes (out of all possible Complex I genes) is larger than the proportion of observed Complex II, Complex III or Complex IV genes (compared to all possible Complex II, Complex III, and Complex IV genes), in the final GSEA core enrichment set. The reviewer suggested we compare the actual results versus the proportion expected from the difference in gene numbers. Therefore, we performed the following statistical analysis:</p><p>The null hypothesis is that the number of Complex I-IV genes observed in the core enrichment set match the frequencies of genes expected from the number of subunits in each complex. For transcriptomics, a chi-square test of goodness-of-fit for the observed counts of ETC genes in the core enrichment set vs expected counts based on gene proportions (Complex I: 44; Complex II: 4; Complex III: 10; Complex IV: 19) fails to reject the null hypothesis (that the observed counts are drawn from the expected frequencies) with a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.6419 (chi-square statistic = 1.6779; dof = 3). The failure to reject the null hypothesis means that the actual results are similar to the expected frequencies by proportion.</p><p>This is no contradiction with our statements, because we do not claim that Complex I is preferentially enriched in PaLung in comparison to other ETC complexes. In fact, we do not make any claims or assertions about the other complexes of the ETC such as Complex II, Complex III and Complex IV from a transcriptomic or proteomic perspective.</p><p>To address the second concern, we will rephrase our text slightly, because we don’t mean to make a claim that Complex I is the only reason why the ETC gene set is enriched. Our claim is only that due to the absolute number of genes in Complex I (which is proportional to expected frequencies), significant enrichment of Complex I alone may be sufficient for GSEA to call the entire ETC gene set upregulated, without requiring a strong signal-to-noise ratio of enrichment due to the other complexes. We will modify the text in our manuscript to clarify this issue.</p><p>For the third concern, our claim of upregulated Complex I is substantiated by the fact that in proteomics, gene sets specific to Complex I are upregulated in PaLung. This observation is independent of other ETC Complex genes.</p><p>In summary, our claims are the following,</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is true that Complex I-specific gene sets are upregulated in PaLung cells. This underlies our assumption of higher flux through Complex I for flux modelling.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is possible that these upregulated Complex I genes may be causing the broader ETC gene set to be flagged as upregulated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is not possible to infer from this analysis alone whether Complex II, Complex III and Complex IV are also up- or down-regulated, because individual gene sets for these complex activity/assembly were not flagged as up- or down-regulated in our analysis (unlike with Complex I).</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. (option, takes about 1-2 months). This reviewer believes that the authors' most important claim, concerning the high activity of Complex I and the low activity of Complex II, lacks strong evidence as no biochemical data of the activities of each mitochondrial complex are presented to substantiate this. Unless additional biochemical experimental data is provided, the assertions should be toned down. While the abstract mentions &quot;complex II activity may be low or reversed,&quot; it is stated with certainty in line 108 of the introduction, &quot;associated with the low or reverse activity of Complex II.&quot; Based on the present data, this reviewer believes that the claim remains speculative. Therefore, I suggest moderating the overall argument or adding the biochemical data. While the results from metabolomics are supportive, they do not serve as direct evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and we thank the reviewer for noticing that certain locations have a higher strength of assertion. We will change the flagged line (Line 108) and moderate our assertion about possible low-to-reverse activity of Complex II and avoid over-interpreting the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Regarding Figure 5, the title of the figure states &quot;lower antioxidant response&quot;, but it doesn't seem that the data in the figure actually shows a lower antioxidant response.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this discrepancy. We propose to modify the title of Figure 5 to “ROS and antioxidant system measurements in PaLung and WI-38 cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. In lines 109-110 of the Introduction, the authors state, &quot;we confirmed our prediction of ischemic-like basal metabolism in PaLung cells by characterizing the response of bat cells to cellular stresses such as oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, and a type of cell death related to ischemia, viz. ferroptosis.&quot; However, can the assertion that the cells are in an ischemic-like state be confirmed simply because they are resistant to several types of cellular stress?</p></disp-quote><p>We will moderate our language to clarify that resistance to nutrient deprivation and cellular stress are consistent with an ischemic-like state, but do not confirm an ischemic-like state. This change applies to both the results &amp; Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 Minor comments</p><p>1. The authors mention the use of cufflinks/Tophat for mapping/quantification. However, support for these software programs has ended and the creators of these programs themselves recommend using the successor programs. I recommend re-analysis using a more current pipeline (such as HISAT2/StringTie, STAR/RSEM, etc.). Furthermore, the transcriptomics section of the methods should also include the program used for cleaning and trimming.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to this issue. For our revision plan, we propose to redo the transcriptomic analysis with the newer pipelines suggested by the reviewer and update our RNAseq results in the manuscript text, figures, and supplementary material as required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. As for the Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR) data presented in Figure 2F, it makes sense that it's low at the basal level. However, it's perplexing that it is also low even under uncoupled conditions, especially considering the high energy demand associated with flight in this species. Could the authors provide their interpretation on this apparent contradiction?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive and insightful comments. We also did not expect that bat cells would have a lower capacity than WI-38 cells under uncoupled conditions (which indicate maximal respiratory capacity). Given that flight is an energetically demanding activity (Maina JN 2000), bat cells are expected to have a high oxygen consumption capacity. Future research can test one possible interpretation, which is that this phenomenon might be cell-type dependent. For example, bat muscle cells, which possess numerous mitochondria and are the primary drivers of flight, might have a higher maximal respiratory capacity than human muscle cells. In contrast, bat fibroblasts, which might play a less important role in flight, might not require such a high capacity. Additionally, <italic>P. alecto</italic> can hibernate. To endure the challenging conditions of hibernation, bat fibroblasts may have adapted to reduce their oxygen intake and limit energy use. Because further analysis of different cell types will be essential to pursue these issues, we will incorporate them into the Discussion section. We hope this will be useful for future research to better understand the cell biology of bats.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Maina JN.

Compared to the other histograms, we found that the CV histogram for the WI-38 samples in subset 1 had a more uniform distribution and included much higher values. Delving deeper into WI-38 subset 1, we identified 180 proteins that had a CV value greater than 0.7, suggesting that these proteins showed either high standard deviations or low mean abundance. Plotting the mean log(abundance) for the WI-38 samples across all four subsets, we found that subset 1 did not have lower abundances than the other subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The abundance distribution for the 180 high-CV proteins also matched the abundance distribution for the rest of subset 1. All of this suggests that the observed asymmetry in the volcano plot is caused by a high standard deviation in 180 proteins in the WI-38 sample, which could be a batch and species-specific effect of metabolic regulation.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Histograms of coefficient-of-variation (CV) for the four protein subsets (defined by p-value and log fold change).</title><p>Each row corresponds to a different subset indicated by the title above.

In lines 249-252, it is stated, &quot;The low or negative flux values for Complex II in our PaLung simulations indicate that the electrons obtained from Complex I may accumulate at Complex II or potentially even get consumed by Complex II operating in reverse (bypassing the rest of the ETC) in PaLung cells.&quot; However, isn't the basic process of electron transfer done through Complex I-III-IV, independent of Complex II?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. It is true that in conventional ETC, both Complex I and Complex II operate in parallel and feed electrons to Complex III and downstream. However, in cases of dysregulated ETC observed with the reverse activity of Complex II, it is possible that the electrons generated by Complex I do not proceed to Complex III and could be utilized by Complex II for its reverse activity (Bisbach et al., Cell reports 2020; Chouchani et al., Nature 2014). This phenomenon has been pointed out by earlier studies, two examples of which are shown below. In place of our earlier sentence, we will amend our manuscript text to say the following-</p><p>“During conventional ETC, both Complex I and Complex II operate in parallel and produce electrons that are shuttled downstream t to Complex III, Complex IV, and ATP synthase.

Reference genomes for bats are not as well annotated as for human. Downregulation of a pathway may result from some genes being excluded from the analysis because of poor annotation of the P. Alecto genome compared to human. The authors state: &quot;Genes with counts per million (CPM) &lt; 1 in more than 3 out of 6 samples were discarded from downstream analysis&quot;. So, if the gene was not annotated, was it assigned a zero value and discarded? Was it discarded if it was zero in one species (e.g. bat) or set to 0? If such genes were excluded, while in reality not being mapped, they could have skewed the pathway analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point here. It is true that reference genomes for less studied organisms like bats may not be as well annotated as other organisms. Indeed, the seeming down-regulation of a pathway in bats might be because the constituent genes were not annotated as well, not because they weren’t expressed as highly. For exactly this reason, we analysed pathways that were upregulated in bats, and made no conclusion about pathways downregulated in bats. We will make this more clear in our text.</p><p>For the question of discards, the reviewer’s interpretation is correct. Our transcriptomic comparison was performed only using genes/transcripts common to both organisms. If a gene was not detected in the bat experiment, it was removed from the comparison. We will clarify in the discussion that this discard would exclude genes that are unmapped in bat, and the pathway analysis might under-estimate bat-specific biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The major findings of this paper were based on the omic data, followed by some experimental validations. However, the quality of these omic data or the results are not solid enough to motivate the authors to validate these findings. For example, both of the GO terms enriched by the DEGs in Figure 1 are not the top terms as claimed by the authors (not even significant after multiple test correction). Also, even though the 2 GO terms in Figure 2 are quite significant, the expression pattern seems not very consistent among the replicates, which make the enrichments not so solid. This highlights an inconsistency among different omic datasets, which may generate some conflicting results. For example, the low level of metabolites from TCA cycle (Figure 4c) seems not consistent with the high level of TCA-related protein, as described in Figure 2c &amp; d. For the purpose of improving the manuscript quality, the authors may have to evaluate the consistency among the multiple omic datasets or to optimize their bioinformatic pipeline to enhance the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the choice of GO terms, we agree this should be cleaner. When we redo our transcriptomic analysis with STAR, the results will be displayed using topmost gene sets according to the criteria in our response for Major Point 2 of Reviewer 1.</p><p>Regarding the consistency between different omic measurements, we believe it is possible to make inferences about pathways or gene sets when multiple -omic measurements agree at multiple levels of biology (metabolites / proteins / RNA). For example, when metabolites, proteins, and transcripts exhibit up-regulation of the same pathway, then we can infer with moderate confidence that the pathway has increased utilization or increased importance. However, the converse is not true. The absence of agreement between different levels of biology (metabolites / proteins / RNA) could be due to genuine biological complexities and/or errors of measurement/analysis. Many biological changes occur at one level of measurement without altering other levels of measurement, such as phosphorylation affecting protein degradation without affecting RNA. Any pathway can have up-regulation of one measure and down-regulation of another due to genuine regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, multi-omic agreement is a positive result, but multi-omics disagreement produces no result, and does not produce a problem or a contradictory result. Previous studies found a correlation &lt; 0.3 between transcriptomic and proteomic levels in the same cells (Haider S and Pal R 2013, Gunawardana Y et al. 2013,Bathke J et al. 2019, Xu JY et al. 2020).Thus, it is no surprise that our data for bat and human ratios (P/W) have a correlation of 0.223 between the proteomic fold-change and the transcriptomic fold-change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Scatter plot of Log fold change of proteomic data vs Log fold change of transcriptomics data.</title><p>Each point represents a protein/gene that was detected in both proteomics and transcriptomics experiments.

The dominant up-regulation of complex I in ETC is interesting and is the main finding of this paper. However, no experimental evidence was provided to prove the greater activity of Complex I, for example, metabolites changes. In addition, the genes encoding proteins belong to ETC complex I, II, III and IV vary a lot, with much more genes encoding complex I. Therefore, the author should consider the background gene number when they compare the up-regulated gene number differences in each complex. For example, a fisher-exact test could be done to see if complex I has significantly more genes been up-regulated than a random expectation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this issue. This is similar to reviewer 1’s concern about the proportion of ETC complexes raised in major points 7 and 8. As per our response earlier, we do not claim that Complex I genes are upregulated more than other complexes. A chi-square test shows that the proportion of ETC complex genes observed in the core enrichment set of the GSEA gene set is in keeping with the expected frequencies based on the number of genes in each complex. Our claim is only that due to the sheer number of genes in Complex I (even though it is in proportion with expected frequencies), significant enrichment of Complex I alone may be sufficient in most cases to call the entire ETC gene set upregulated, without requiring a strong signal-to-noise ratio of enrichment from the other complexes. We will modify our manuscript to clarify this, and we are grateful for feedback to improve our communication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 Minor comments</p><p>- The author may have to add the p value or FDR for each GSEA plot, even though some of the FDR are not significant.

This ensured that the PaLung model would have higher flux through the Complex I reaction, in comparison to the WI-38 model.&quot;</p><p>How do the results hold with different thresholds ? Are these findings robust with e.g. in ranges between 10 to 50% (90-50%) (instead of only 30% and 70%). Furthermore, the histogram figures doesnt seem to reflect a 70% of maximum lower bound for complex I (threshold at a value of 30 seems like extremity of tail).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good question, whether our simulation results depend on the thresholds we used. We propose to perform additional flux sampling with thresholds proposed by the reviewer in the range of 10-50%. To help readers interpret the modelling already shown, we will point out that the output flux histograms are the result of combined constraints on Complex I and oxygen intake, so the feasible ranges can be narrower than the flux constraint on Complex I. For the simulations suggested by the reviewer, we warn that using the suggested 10-50% thresholds might generate a conflict with oxygen intake rates and could result in infeasible scenarios. (In that case, the set of possible flux configurations would be the empty set, and would not be plotted in the revised manuscript.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

All conclusions are based on high-throughput data, however it is accepted that some validation should be provided. Please provide qPCR or WB (if good antibodies are available) validation for several most significantly differentially expressed genes supporting the pathways identified in Figure 2 (preferably supporting the conclusions about Complexes I/II).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's valuable suggestions. As the reviewer is aware, it is challenging to find human antibodies to detect bat proteins. Furthermore, for a fair comparison, human antibodies should detect bat proteins with the same affinity as they do human proteins. We aligned the Complex I proteins from humans and bats and found that their homology was relatively low, which suggests that it would be difficult to validate our findings using Western blotting.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same challenges apply to validation by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Comparing gene expression by qPCR between different species can be difficult due to several factors, including genetic differences, primer specificity, and the choice of reference genes.</p><p>Different species can have variations in their gene sequences, which can affect the binding of qPCR primers and lead to differences in amplification efficiency. Therefore, primers must be designed to target conserved regions of the gene of interest to ensure specificity. However, finding such regions that are conserved between species can be difficult when the gene sequences are not well conserved. In addition, even if the primer annealing region is conserved, amplification efficiency may not be the same if the sequences of the entire amplicon have some variations. As mentioned above, the sequences of the genes in Complex I between humans and bats are not very well conserved.</p><p>Nevertheless, we selected eight genes in Complex I that were upregulated in PaLung bat cell lines in our RNAseq or proteomics analysis of mitochondrial proteins, and tested the primers. These genes were NDUFA3, NDUFA7, NDUFA10, NDUFA13, NDUFB2, NDUFB9, NDUFS2, and NDUFV2. The primer sequences were 100% matched to human sequences, but had one or two mismatches to bat sequences. Although we were able to amplify the human fragments well, we were unable to amplify the bat fragments of these genes efficiently or at all. Furthermore, we could not amplify the GAPDH fragments for both human and bat cell lines at comparable levels, even though the primer sequences for GAPDH were 100% matched to both human and bat sequences. Possible explanations for this include variation in GAPDH expression levels between the cell lines, differences in GAPDH amplification efficiency during PCR, or a combination of both factors, even though GAPDH is one of the most commonly used reference genes for qPCR analysis.</p><p>In this situation, we believe that RNAseq provides a fair comparison between two different species, as it represents the percentage of expression of a given gene relative to the total mRNA expression. Therefore, rather than attempting to evaluate our findings by Western blot or qPCR, we decided to moderate our conclusions and avoid over-interpreting the data, as suggested by Reviewer 1 in Major Comment 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. If the main findings of this paper can be further confirmed by additional experiments or data, it will be a very nice paper. This could be a potential mechanism that bats used to switch metabolism modes between two metabolic extremes: flight and hibernation, which require high and low energy. However, the usage of only the lung fibroblasts of human and bat may limit the ability of generalizing this 'ischemic-like state' of ETC in most of the bats tissue/organs. While I agree what the authors mentioned in the Discussion section, that to extend to primary cells of other species can help generalize this finding, studying the metabolism state of different cell type of bats (e.g., muscle cells responsible for flight; myocytes and neurons for hibernation) probably can provide more insights into the evolution of various interesting phenotypes of bats.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. We agree that extending the current study to different bat cell types, such as myocytes and neurons, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of metabolic adaptations in bat. This valuable suggestion is beyond the capacity of our laboratory resources and the timeline of this work (i.e., acquisition of primary tissues and generation of cell lines). Our current study provides the first comprehensive comparison of bat and human, to generate interest for subsequent work. We sincerely apologise for this limitation and appreciate the reviewer's understanding. We will include an additional discussion indicating that our work, characterizing differences in TCA cycle, OxPhos and ROS responses in PaLung, acts as a stepping stone for further research that can deepen our understanding of bat metabolism and physiology.</p><p>Reviewer 2 Minor comments</p><p>- How did mitochondrial DNA content per cell compared between the two species? Could the results be affected by the number and size of the mitochondria per cell in each species? An indirect measurement of mitochondrial DNA yield in the fractionation experiment would be the total DNA amount that was obtained in mitochondrial fractions per cell lysed.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and thoughtful suggestions. The questions about mitochondrial DNA content per cell, and the potential impact of mitochondrial number and size, are indeed relevant to studies of mitochondrial function and metabolism. However, we believe these measurements may not be essential in the context of our study. Regarding the comparison of mitochondrial DNA content between the two species, the genes we observed to be differentially expressed in the mitochondria of bats and humans were encoded by nuclear DNA. As such, measuring mitochondrial DNA content would not significantly alter our main findings.</p><p>We acknowledge that our results could potentially be affected by mitochondrial morphology, including the number, size, and fragmentation status of mitochondria. One common approach to evaluating mitochondrial morphology is the use of fluorescence dyes specific to mitochondria, in addition to electron microscopy. However, we found that PaLung bat cells can export most of the staining dyes used to visualize mitochondria, which makes it difficult to accurately assess these parameters. The strong export activity in PaLung cells is due to the high expression of ABCB1 transporter (Koh <italic>et al.</italic>, Nat Commun 2019).</p><p>In summary, dyes for assessing mitochondrial morphology have had different behaviors and affinities across species, so we do not wish to assert any conclusions that may be generated through these techniques. We request your understanding that such technical difficulties have prevented us from performing a morphological evaluation of mitochondria to further elucidate our findings.

Many of the other pathways pertain to anabolism/catabolism or secondary metabolism (e.g., RNA catabolism, translation, amide metabolic process, seleno amino acid metabolism, chondroitin sulfate metabolism etc).
