the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, long before the origin of the bird crown-group. Frugivorous birds play an important role in seed dispersal today. However, evidence of fruit consumption in early birds from outside the crown-group has been lacking. <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is one of the earliest-diverging birds, only slightly more crownward than <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic>, but its cranial anatomy has been poorly understood, limiting trophic information which may be gleaned from the skull. Originally hypothesised to be granivorous based on seeds preserved as gut contents, this interpretation has become controversial. We conducted high-resolution synchrotron tomography on an exquisitely preserved new skull of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, revealing remarkable cranial plesiomorphies combined with a specialised rostrum. We use this to provide a near-complete cranial reconstruction of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, and exclude the possibility that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was granivorous, based on morphometric analyses of the mandible (3D) and cranium (2D), and comparisons with the 3D alimentary contents of extant birds. We show that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> provides the earliest evidence for fruit consumption in birds, and indicates that birds may have been recruited for seed dispersal during the earliest stages of the avian radiation. As mobile seed dispersers, early frugivorous birds could have expanded the scope for biotic dispersal in plants, and might therefore explain, at least in part, the subsequent evolutionary expansion of fruits, indicating a potential role of birdâplant interactions in the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Birds and plants have a close relationship that has developed over millions of years. Birds became diverse and abundant around 135 million years ago. Shortly after, plants started developing new and different kinds of fruits. Today, fruit-eating birds help plants to reproduce by spreading seeds in their droppings. This suggests that birds and plants have coevolved, changing together over time. But it is not clear exactly how their relationship started.</p><p>One species that might hold the answers is an early bird species known as <italic>Jeholornis</italic>. It lived in China in the Early Cretaceous, around 120 million years ago. Palaeontologists have discovered preserved seeds inside its fossilised remains. The question is, how did they get there? Some birds eat seeds directly, cracking them open or grinding them up in the stomach to extract the nutrients inside. Other birds swallow seeds when they are eating fruit. If <italic>Jeholornis</italic> belonged to this second group, it could represent one of the early steps in plant-bird coevolution.</p><p>Hu et al. scanned and reconstructed a preserved <italic>Jeholornis</italic> skull and compared it to the skulls, especially the mandibles, of modern birds, including species that grind seeds, species that crack seeds and species that eat fruits, leaving the seeds whole. The analyses ruled out seed cracking. But it could not distinguish between seed grinding and fruit eating. Hu et al. therefore compared the seed remains found inside <italic>Jeholornis</italic> fossils to seeds eaten by modern birds. The fossilised seeds were intact and showed no evidence of grinding. This suggests that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> ate whole fruits for at least part of the year.</p><p>At around the time <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was alive, the world was entering a phase called the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, which was characterized by an explosion of new species and an expansion of both flowering plants and birds. This finding opens new avenues for scientists to explore how plant and birds might have evolved together. Similar analyses could unlock new information about how other species interacted with their environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Early Cretaceous</kwd><kwd>Jehol Biota</kwd><kwd><italic>Jeholornis</italic></kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>birdâplant interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001772</institution-id><institution>University of New England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001264</institution-id><institution>Linnean Society of London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Anne Sleep Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007129</institution-id><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2020MD026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Linyi Key Research and Development Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020ZX028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42288201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhonghe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41402017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Synchrotron's Imaging and Medical Beamline</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M13126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42002016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Unionâs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie grant agreement</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No 101024572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Han</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fruit consumption of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was evidenced and indicates seed dispersal was present from early in avian radiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Birds are among the most speciose extant vertebrate groups, playing unique ecological roles through their diverse flight and dietary adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prum et al., 2015</xref>). Crown-group birds include both specialised and opportunistic frugivores, that collectively are major consumers of fruits and important agents of seed dispersal. However, the occurrence of fruit consumption among early birds, outside the crown-group, is not yet clear. The early ecological diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous (&gt;130 Ma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) was a landmark event in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, adding considerably to species richness of terrestrial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benson, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), and with impacts on the evolutionary histories of other flying groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benson et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clapham and Karr, 2012</xref>). This was followed by a considerable long-term expansion of the abundance and disparity of fruits and fruit-like structures through much of the Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksson et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eriksson, 2008</xref>), as part of the major floral transition from gymnosperm- to angiosperm-dominated floras that is often referred to as the âCretaceous Terrestrial Revolutionâ (KTR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lloyd et al., 2008</xref>). A macroevolutionary connection between early birds and this important event of fruit evolution has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pejchar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sekercioglu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiffney, 2004</xref>), but is so far unsubstantiated by fossil evidence of fruit consumption by early birds, limiting our understanding of the evolutionary origins of an important aspect of plantâanimal interactions.</p><p>The Jeholornithiformes from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China are one of the earliest-diverging avian lineages and are morphologically very distinct from crown-group birds, retaining an elongate, bony tail, which is absent in all other birds except for the Late Jurassic <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>). They also possess several advanced, flight-related morphologies, suggesting a unique form of powered flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">OâConnor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>). The most abundant jeholornithiform, <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, has been interpreted as the earliest granivorous bird, based on the reportedly âdeepâ mandible and traces identified as seeds preserved in the abdominal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>). Reduced dentition and the presence of a gastric mill further suggest a herbivorous diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâConnor et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is no consensus on whether seeds entered the gut of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, and other early birds, through deliberate and destructive seed consumption (granivory), or through consumption of fleshy propagules such as true angiosperm fruits or gymnosperm arils (herein referred to as âfruit consumptionâ for convenience, encompassing both consumption of all types of fleshy diaspores, not limited to true fruits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ksepka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">OâConnor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâConnor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">OâConnor and Zhou, 2020</xref>). Indeed, a recent review identified these as âseed mealsâ without clarification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller and Pittman, 2021</xref>). Clarifying between these two hypotheses has significant implications with regard to the early evolution of birdâplant interactions, because fruit consumption could result in beneficial co-evolutionary mutualism, whereas seed consumption does not. This therefore is relevant to understanding whether early birds could have been important agents of seed dispersal with a potential mutualistic co-evolutionary influence on plant evolution during the KTR.</p><p>Interpretations regarding diet in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> and other potentially granivorous early birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ksepka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>) have previously been framed using qualitative observations and subjective assessments, with minimal formal comparison to extant species, and in the absence of a detailed understanding of jeholornithiform cranial anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LefÃ¨vre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">OâConnor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâConnor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou and Zhang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>). We here report an exquisitely preserved new <italic>Jeholornis</italic> specimen, STM 3â8, from the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature, Pingyi, China. We use high quality three-dimensional (3D) data acquired through the synchrotron tomography to reveal the key cranial features of this taxon and build a precise and almost complete cranial reconstruction of this key stem bird. This information is used to test and determine the two diet hypotheses of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, through geometric morphometric (GMM) analyses of the mandible (3D) and cranium (2D), and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) 3D visualisations of the alimentary contents of extant birds. Our approach demonstrates the importance of applying multiple methods simultaneously to solve complex palaeoecological questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cranial anatomy</title><p><italic>Jeholornis</italic> has been frequently studied and cited because of its key phylogenetic position, and many specimens are known.

The postorbital is proportionally large with a well-developed jugal process that contacts the jugal, forming a robust, complete postorbital bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is a plesiomorphy shared with non-avian theropods and other stem birds including <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> and <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>), contrasting with the reduced or absent postorbital bar in the Ornithothoraces including modern birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2020b</xref>). The squamosal possesses a postorbital process that likely contacted the postorbital to form the supratemporal arch. The ventral process of the squamosal is short and would not have contacted the quadratojugal. The squamosal of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is remarkably anteroposteriorly broad even compared to that of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rauhut, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>). A complete bony upper temporal bar is supposed to exist based on the articular facet in the postorbital, while this bar is broken and probably linked by ligament in Late Cretaceous bird <italic>Ichthyornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Field et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The palatal complex is nearly completely preserved, including the palatine, pterygoid, and vomer; the absence of the ectopterygoid is most likely preservational (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The palate of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> exhibits few modifications from the non-avian theropod condition, and closely resembles that of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rauhut et al., 2018</xref>). The palatine is broad with a well-developed jugal process that contacts the maxilla. The pterygoid is elongated with no sign of the shortening that occurs in more derived birds and the pterygoid flange is well developed, indicating the presence of an ectopterygoid. The vomer is dorsoventrally thin with bifurcated caudal flanges oriented nearly vertical to the rostral body, similar to the condition in <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the temporal and palatal regions retain plesiomorphies, the rostrum of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is heavily modified. The new specimen reveals that its premaxillae corpora are fused while the frontal processes remain separate. Rostral fusion of the premaxillae is also present in extant birds, confuciusornithiforms and several enantiornithines for example <italic>Linyiornis</italic> and <italic>Shangyang</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang and Zhou, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

These were included in a 3D GMM analysis of the mandible and a 2D analysis of the cranium of extant birds and select extinct pennaraptorans (for landmark definitions see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>), to evaluate the similarity of the mandible and cranium of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> to extant birds with different diets. Our main analysis is intended to test how seeds entered the gut of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> by distinguishing between two hypotheses, either (1) fruit consumption or (2) seed consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). For this analysis, diets of extant birds were separated into five categories: (1) Seed-crackers (parrots): granivores that de-husk and fragment seeds using the beak prior to ingestion; (2) Seed-crackers (passerines): granivores that de-husk but do not extensively fragment seeds using the beak prior to ingestion; (3) Seed-grinders: granivores that primarily process seeds using a gastric mill, with minimal beak processing; (4) Fruit eaters; and (5) Other diets (such as folivores, carnivores, and omnivores). Our supplemental analysis includes a further split of âOther dietsâ, separating the âOther dietsâ category into: (1) Probing for invertebrates; (2) Grabbing/pecking for invertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>); (3) Piscivores; (4) Animal-dominated omnivores; (5) Carnivores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>); (6) Nectarivores; (7) Omnivores; (8) Plant-dominated omnivores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>).

differentiate among diets in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">NavalÃ³n et al., 2019</xref>), but that they may be capable of ruling out the occurrence of certain diets.</p><fig-group><fig

portion of mandibular shape variation (PC1: 38.16%) is related to the relative length of the mandible compared to its rostral depth: positive values of PC1 indicate short, deep mandibles, whereas negative values indicate long, low mandibles. PC2 explains 32.98% of variation and is also related to the relative depth of the mandible, with positive values indicating low mandibles with coronoid eminence absent or less developed, and negative values indicating deep mandibles with a large coronoid eminence. PC3 (10.25% of variation) is related to the curvature, with positive values indicating a straight profile in lateral view, and negative values indicating rostroventral curvature of the rostral portion of the mandible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>).</p><p>The results plot <italic>Jeholornis</italic> near the centre of mandibular morphospace. Seed-crackers, especially parrots, are clearly separated from the other diet types including <italic>Jeholornis</italic> in mandibular morphospace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). They occupy a distinct region with high, positive values of PC1 and low, negative values of PC2, reflecting their deep and anteroposteriorly short mandibles with a large coronoid process and deep mandibular symphysis, which suits their seed-cracking diet by reducing the beak failure risk during cracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Soons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soons et al., 2010</xref>). The frugivorous parrot â <italic>Psittrichas fulgidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billerman et al., 2020</xref>) â has a shallow mandible compared to those seed-cracking parrots, and plots closer to the distribution of non-parrots, consistent with the hypothesis that species can secondarily lose specialisations associated with their ancestral diet.</p><p>Seed-cracking passerines also occupy an area with negative PC2 values compared to most frugivores and seed-grinders, being closer to seed-cracking parrots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). They also show negative values of PC3, indicating that they have more downward inclined mandibles, which is related to their ability to de-husk seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Meij and Bout, 2008</xref>). Therefore, finches are also clearly distinct from the position of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> in mandibular morphospace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>), rejecting the previous hypothesis of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> as a seed-cracker (both parrot- and finch-type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>).</p><p><italic>Jeholornis</italic> is plotted within the overlapping range of frugivores, seed-grinders, and birds with âother dietsâ in our main analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Frugivores and seed-grinders show wide and highly overlapping distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>), indicating that âseed-grindingâ granivores, which do not engage in pre-processing of seeds using the beak, exhibit little specialisation of mandibular morphology compared to âseed-crackingâ granivores. Therefore, although our results exclude <italic>Jeholornis</italic> from being a seed-cracker, they cannot distinguish between the hypotheses that seeds entered the gut of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> due to fruit consumption, or due to seed-grinding granivory.</p><p>Our supplemental analyses find that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was unlikely to have had a probing or piscivorous diet; probing birds occupy negative PC1 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and piscivores occupy positive PC2 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Euclidean distances in the full multivariate shape space suggest that the mandible of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is relatively similar to those of various omnivorous (e.g. <italic>Podica</italic>), seed-grinding (e.g. <italic>Calandrella</italic>), frugivorous (e.g. <italic>Crax</italic>), and invertebrate pecking (e.g. <italic>Picus</italic>) birds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2âsource data 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Cranial morphospace</title><p>Cranial shape distinguishes between our focal diet categories less effectively than mandibular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Nevertheless, some separation is still evident, especially between seed-crackers and other dietary groups. This also indicates that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was not a seed-cracking granivore. Extant seed-crackers occupy positive values of both PC1 and PC2, compared to more centrally positioned frugivores and seed-grinders. Variation in PC1 (45.31%) is related to the relative length of the rostrum compared to the jugal bar, with positive values indicating a shorter rostrum. Variation in PC2 (14.34%) is related to the depth and curvature of the rostrum, with positive values indicating deeper and rostroventrally curved rostra, present in seed-crackers and toucans (<italic>Ramphastos</italic>, which differs from seed-crackers in having a negative PC1 score). Variation in PC3 (9.35%) is related to the relative size of the orbit and naris, with positive values indicating smaller orbits and naris. Because some fossil samples included in our analyses are incomplete, we did not include the skull roof in this analysis. Our results indicate that seed-crackers have relatively short, deep and rostroventrally curved rostra compared to most other birds, including <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, <italic>Sapeornis</italic>, and other Mesozoic taxa.</p><p>Similar to the results of the mandible analyses, the results of the supplemental analyses of cranial shape also exclude <italic>Jeholornis</italic> from possessing a probing or piscivorous diet; probing birds occupy negative PC1 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and piscivores occupy positive PC2 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).The other diets are also not readily distinguishable in the supplemental analyses of cranial shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplements 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). Euclidean distances in the multivariate shape space, excluding PC3 (which describes the large-scale differences between stem- and crown-group birds) suggest that the cranium of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is similar to those of various frugivorous (e.g. <italic>Manucodia</italic>), seed-grinding (e.g. <italic>Pedionomus</italic>), and invertebrate pecking (e.g. <italic>Hymenops</italic>) birds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2âsource data 4</xref>).</p><p>Mesozoic taxa are mostly separated from modern birds along PC2 and PC3, occupying negative values of PC2 and positive values of PC3 separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Among them, <italic>Jeholornis</italic> and <italic>Sapeornis</italic> are more similar to extant birds along PC2, which describes rostral morphology. This may reflect the dietary specialisation of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> and <italic>Sapeornis</italic> (as fruit or seed consumers) compared to other Mesozoic taxa. Nevertheless, they cluster with other Mesozoic taxa along cranial PC3, indicating conservative aspects shared with non-avian theropods, especially a proportionally small orbit and external naris.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Alimentary content analyses</title><p>Our morphometric analyses indicate that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was not a âseed-crackerâ, but do not distinguish between frugivorous and seed-grinding granivorous diets.

The seed remains are highly fragmented in seed-cracking parrots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas in seed-cracking passerines, although the crop contents are almost intact, those in the stomach are also highly fragmentary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1E, F</xref>). This is consistent with behavioural observations of finches and other granivorous passerines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billerman et al., 2020</xref>), in which seed-cracking passerines use the beak only to remove the outer coats of seeds, and do not fragment the seed before ingestion, differing from parrots that can fragment seeds prior to ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Fragmentation of seeds in passerines is primarily achieved through the gastric mill, similar to some seed-grinders for example <italic>E. migratorius</italic> (Passenger pigeon) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Although their mandibular and cranial shapes occupy the morphospace in which several diets overlap, including frugivory and gastric seed-grinding granivory, these diets can be distinguished through comparing the condition of ingested remains in the alimentary tract in modern birds.</p><p>Known stomach contents preserved in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> take two forms in different fossil specimens, which include: (1) individuals with sparsely distributed and entirely intact seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>), and (2) those with a relatively small concentration of gastroliths without any seed remains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâConnor et al., 2018</xref>). Our comparisons with modern birds indicate that the first group of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> individuals ingested fleshy propagules (fruit consumption), rather than consuming seeds for nutrient extraction (destructive seed consumption). We cannot interpret the presence of gastroliths in the second group of individuals, because gastroliths are widespread in extant birds with a wide range of diets for example insectivory, granivory, and frugivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gionfriddo and Best, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">OâConnor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piersma et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wings, 2007</xref>), making it impossible to infer diet from this evidence alone. Crucially, no <italic>Jeholornis</italic> specimen preserves seeds and gastroliths together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">OâConnor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">OâConnor and Zhou, 2020</xref>) (and preserved seeds within <italic>Jeholornis</italic> are not abraded), which would be required as evidence for seed-grinding granivory.</p><p>Variation in alimentary contents among individuals of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> are best interpreted as evidence of seasonal variation in diet, or potentially other intraspecific variation in diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">OâConnor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâConnor et al., 2018</xref>). Though the influence of preservational biases cannot be completely excluded yet, the recurring occurrence of specific sets of stomach contents among individuals suggests that these reflect habitual rather than exceptional dietary variation. It is possible that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> consumed fleshy propagules during the seasons in which such food sources were available, but fed on other food sources during other seasons, which is also consistent with the seasonal climate of the western Liaoning region during the Early Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2006</xref>). However, we currently lack strong evidence of what diet items were consumed by <italic>Jeholornis</italic> in addition to fruits. Mandibular and cranial shape excludes <italic>Jeholornis</italic> from being having a probing/piscivorous diet, and is consistent with omnivory, grabbing/pecking for invertebrates, or processing foliage (using the gastric mill). Seasonal dietary shifts are widely known in modern birds that feed on fruits as a substantive part of their diet such as Ruffed Grouse (<italic>Bonasa umbellus</italic>) and Hoatzin (<italic>Opisthocomus hoazin</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billerman et al., 2020</xref>), since plants usually bear fruits only in certain seasons rather than throughout the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corlett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Howe, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilman et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings suggest that the dietary flexibility of fruit consumption may be traced back to the earliest stages of bird evolution.</p><p>The evidence for fruit consumption in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> demonstrates that early birds with seeds preserved in the abdominal area cannot be identified as granivores without further evidence from cranial morphology, or the co-occurrence of abraded or fragmented seeds with gastroliths. It was recently suggested that <italic>Sapeornis</italic>, <italic>Eogranivora</italic>, and even some enantiornithines may have consumed fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ksepka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayr et al., 2020</xref>). However, the evidence for this remains equivocal. <italic>Sapeornis</italic> and <italic>Eogranivora</italic> preserve apparently whole seeds in the crop, but only gastroliths in the abdominal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with both seed-grinding granivory and passerine-like seed-cracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is so far the only Mesozoic bird that provides strong evidence of fruit consumption. However, this should not be taken as evidence that fruit consumption was rare. Direct evidence on diet in fossil birds is rare and preserved gut contents are limited to just a few individuals from a small number of Early Cretaceous fossil deposits in China and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">OâConnor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller and Pittman, 2021</xref>). Given this low level of current knowledge, evidence for fruit consumption in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is important in demonstrating for the first time that at least some early birds ate fruits.</p><p>Flight-related anatomical specialisations suggest that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was a competent flier in spite of its early-diverging phylogenetic position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">OâConnor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou and Zhang, 2002</xref>). Although flight is not an exclusive adaptation to fruit consumption, compared to non-volant animals, flight allows birds and bats to more easily obtain patchily distributed but energy-rich food sources in difficult to access and widely dispersed locations, including fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benson et al., 2018b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benson et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer, 1998</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and may in part explain the high prevalence of fruit consumption (and especially the consumption of small fruits such as berries) among extant birds compared to most other tetrapod groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiffney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tiffney, 1992</xref>).</p><p>Although true fruits are only present in angiosperms, seed ferns, and gymnosperms evolved functionally analogous fleshy-coated propagules such as arils and other fleshy accessory tissues much earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tiffney, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiffney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrera, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lovisetto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contreras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herendeen et al., 2017</xref>). Such structures represent specialisations for animal-mediated seed dispersal. Early fruit-producing angiosperms were present by the Early Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eriksson et al., 2000b</xref>), alongside multiple groups of gymnosperms with fleshy propagules including cycadales, ginkgoales, and gnetales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tiffney, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiffney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu, 1999</xref>) â which are also present in Jehol Biota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leng and Friis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2001</xref>). The alimentary contents preserved in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> were preliminarily described as ginkgo-like seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou and Wu, 2006</xref>) and more likely to be gymnospermous due to their relatively large sizes, but have not been confidently identified with detailed comparisons with all the potential Early Cretaceous fruits/arils. In addition, although the poor preservation of these ingested seeds prevents any detailed taxonomic identification, three morphotypes have been grouped in previous studies based on size and shape: morphotype-1 in smaller size with a circular shape and curved striations, morphotype-2 in larger size with an oval shape, and morphotype-3 in similar size to morphotype-1 but with a strongly tapered pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">OâConnor et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, considering that early birds such as those from the Jehol Biota would encounter both gymnosperms and angiosperms, we suggest that during the origin of fruit consumption among birds, early frugivorous birds were likely to be opportunistic and targeted fleshy propagules from both groups, rather than being âgymnosperm specialistsâ.</p><p>Given the importance of frugivorous birds today as agents of seed dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pejchar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sekercioglu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiffney, 2004</xref>), the early occurrence of fruit consumption in birds may signify the origin of an important component of modern-like biotic dispersal systems, providing new opportunities for co-evolutionary mutualisms, though future research is expected to provide solid confirmation for this hypothesis. The occurrence of specialised seed dispersal by animals during the Early Cretaceous has previously been proposed indirectly, based on the presence of aril-producing gymnosperms and early fruit-producing angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eriksson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksson et al., 2000a</xref>). However, the identification of these fruit eaters has been uncertain and fruit consumption was almost unmentioned in the recent review of early bird diets, owing to the lack of available evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller and Pittman, 2021</xref>). Evidence for fruit consumption in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> provides direct evidence of fruit consumption in early birds, long before the origin of the bird crown-group. This provides an important indication of the possibility that birds were recruited by plants for seed dispersal very early in their evolutionary history, during the Early Cretaceous.</p><p>Fossil birds have low preservation potential and are known primarily from sites of exceptional preservation. Outside of the Jehol Biota, the fossil record of early birds is poorly sampled, both in space and time. However, evidence from less complete fossil remains suggests that birds had a wide geographic distribution by the Early Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiappe and Witmer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Close et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a âhiddenâ taxonomic, and most likely ecological, diversity of Mesozoic birds. Diversification of birds therefore may explain, at least in part, the evolutionary expansion of fruit abundance, especially angiosperm fruits, that occurred through the Cretaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eriksson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksson et al., 2000a</xref>). Direct evidence for the diet of extinct species is rare. However, evidence in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> indicates the potential for at least opportunistic fruit consumption among early birds in general. It therefore increases support for the hypothesis that birdâplant interactions are likely to have played at least some role in the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiffney, 2004</xref>). Specifically, the occurrence of fruit consumption in one of the earliest-diverging bird lineages raises the possibility of synergistic evolutionary influences, with birds enabling seed dispersal for plants, and obtaining a rich energy resource in return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muller-Landau and Hardesty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dennis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlo and Morales, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlo et al., 2022</xref>). New discoveries and comparative analyses are required to test this hypothesis, by deeper insights into the ecologies of early bird species, and the potential role of the birds during the transition from gymnosperm- to angiosperm-dominated floras.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Taxonomy of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> STM 3â8</title><p><italic>Jeholornis</italic> STM 3â8 was collected from the Jiufotang Formation (~120 Ma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2004</xref>) at the Dapingfang locality in Chaoyang, Liaoning province, preserving a complete and mostly articulated skull, and a few postcranial elements including the vertebral column, the pelvic girdle and fragmentary hindlimbs.

The 3D models of the cranial elements of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> STM 3â8 were reassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>) by the following steps: all the left elements with better preservation were mirrored to create the right half, except for the pterygoid, for which the better-preserved right one was used as the reference; all the elements were relatively relocated to build a complete skull according to their articulations and anatomical geometry. Since most elements are only slightly dislocated with the articulations/articulation facets preserved, this reassembled model is largely reliable, with the location of the preorbital ossifications being the highest uncertainty.

We then sampled another seed-cracking passerine <italic>C. lapponicus</italic> (Lapland longspur, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), and found the same situation of the contents as in <italic>G. fuliginosa</italic>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Seed-grinding granivores: <italic>E. migratorius</italic> (Passenger pigeon, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), a seed-specialist pigeon, is a seed-grinder that entirely uses gastroliths to crack the seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billerman et al., 2020</xref>). Its crop contains numerous, well-defined and intact seeds, whereas seeds are highly fragmented in the stomach, similar to those in <italic>C. carolinensis</italic> and <italic>G. fuliginosa</italic>, together with two large, round gastroliths. Another representative, <italic>P. torquatus</italic> (Plains-wanderer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2AâD</xref>) is a general, small-sized seed-grinder. The seeds preserved in the alimentary tract of <italic>P. torquatus</italic> are comparatively more intact than those in other seed specialists such as parrots, pigeons, and finches, but many seeds show partial breakages and the gastroliths they contained are much smaller. This indicates that <italic>P. torquatus</italic> might utilise another strategy of abrasion to digest the seeds rather than entirely fragmentation. To test this interpretation, we sampled another seed generalist, <italic>T. rumicivorus</italic> (Least seedsnipe, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E, F</xref>). The seed remains are in the same condition as in <italic>P. torquatus</italic> â not fragmentary but abraded with partial breakages, along with small gastroliths, confirming the strategy used by those general seed-grinders.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-74751-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The new specimen reported here (<italic>Jeholornis</italic> STM 3-8) is housed and available for future researchers to check at Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature, China.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nathan Jud (Reviewer #2); Chris Torres (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an exceptional specimen, but have raised reservations about the analyses and inferences presented. In light of their feedback, we would like to request the following essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please critically evaluate the alternative hypothesis that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is neither frugivorous nor granivorous and that the observed gut contents instead represent facultative frugivory. In our view, addressing this point requires additional analyses, rather than just text revision.</p><p>2. The (co-)evolutionary implications of this discovery remain unclear as presented, and need to be explored further. The seeds are perhaps more likely gymnospermous than angiospermous. There are multiple origins of fleshy accessory tissues in gymnosperms, suggesting that plants were recruiting vertebrate seed dispersers repeatedly, and although crown birds may not be ancestrally frugivorous, the multiple origins of frugivory in crown birds suggests dietary lability. The abundance of animal-dispersed plants, and the frequency with which frugivory evolved in crown birds means that the appearance of facultative, opportunistic, or seasonal frugivory in stem birds is perhaps not particularly surprising.</p><p>3. What is the evidence that seed dispersal by frugivorous birds enhances diversification rates through increased speciation rates or decreased extinction rates in either plants or birds? Please cite relevant studies that evaluated this hypothesis.</p><p>4. The treatment of the plant material seems weak, as the seeds are not described and the brief mention of gymnospermous accessory tissues masks complex plant-animal interactions related to seed dispersal among non-angiosperms. Please improve documentation and analyses.</p><p>5. Please address the points raised in the reviewers' full reports, which are appended below.</p><p>6. Given the concerns raised, there was a feeling that claims were worded too strongly, and that language should be toned down throughout.</p><p>Please note that, in light of the fact that the study's key claim currently seems insufficiently supported, we will send your revised manuscript out for re-evaluation and that eventual acceptance is not guaranteed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Our main comment is related to experimental design as the possibility that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was not a specialist granivore or frugivore was not evaluated to the same extent as granivory and frugivory in your study. This third hypothesis would be important to address using multiple methods simultaneously. This is supported by the PCA data where there is overlap between the granivory and frugivory data points and the 'other diet' data points.</p><p>The idea of a bird-plant link in the Early Cretaceous is interesting and could be spelled out more, along with further consideration of the uncertainties revealed in key studies e.g., Hulme 2002.</p><p>Hulme, P.E., 2002. Seed-eaters: Seed Dispersal, Destruction and Demography. Seed dispersal and frugivory: Ecology, evolution, and conservation, p.257.</p><p>However, this is secondary to our main comment above which is related to experimental design and the data incompletely supporting the conclusions proposed.</p><p>We suggest two options to consider [### Note from the Senior Editor: our clear preference is Option 2 ###]:</p><p>1) Narrow the scope of the conclusions to those which can be well supported by the data available i.e., a study showing that, for the seed components of the diet of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, whether granivory or frugivory is most supported.</p><p>2) Alternatively, we suggest to undertake a more holistic diet analysis based on multiple lines of evidence that tests hypothesis 3 and then using the results to inform the conclusions (which may or may not be related to granivory or frugivory).</p><p>We hope you find the comments provided helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As far as I can tell, the descriptions and comparisons of skull morphology are detailed and well done. The argument that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was not a seed cracker is strong, and the interpretation of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> as at least seasonally frugivorous is well-reasoned. It does nicely show that volant birds were recruited for endozoochory early. It will be a pleasure to see this published. Nonetheless, I do have some minor questions and concerns/recommendations about the botany and co-evolutionary implications that I think would make the manuscript stronger, along with some minor suggestions regarding the writing clarity that can be adopted at the authors' discretion.</p><p>Line 60. Using plesiomorphic as an adverb strikes me as odd. It seems to me the meaning the sentence is unchanged if the word plesiomorphically is omitted and instead it reads &quot;retaining an elongate bony tail&quot;</p><p>Line 64. In what way is <italic>Jeholornis</italic> the most representative jeholornithiform? Are other jeholornithiforms somehow less representative?</p><p>Line 75. Consider substituting or adding &quot;seed predation&quot; alongside granivory. This widely used term emphasizes the ecological difference between feeding on seeds vs. other forms of herbivory as it kills a &quot;whole plant.&quot;</p><p>Line 77. Consider changing to &quot;mutualistic co-evolutionary influence,&quot; or perhaps &quot;co-diversification&quot; is what you mean; however, see my comment about lines 342-343 below.</p><p>Like 86. &quot;Complete&quot; or &quot;precise&quot; might be a better word choice than &quot;accurate.&quot; Are previous reconstructions inaccurate? Perhaps they are just incomplete or poorly resolved, but not inaccurate.</p><p>Line 95. Because of its phylogenetic positionâ¦ Because modifies a verb, in this case &quot;studied&quot; &quot;Due to&quot; means &quot;caused by&quot;. Or, to put it another way, <italic>Jeholornis</italic> has been frequently studied because of its phylogenetic position.</p><p>Line 130. I suggest &quot;indicates that rostral fusion evolved earlier (or deeper in bird phylogeny) than previously thought.&quot; I also suggest that the authors point out what other characters it now precedes to emphasize the point that paleontology reveals the order of character changes along branches.</p><p>Line 225: I don't think the parentheses are necessary.</p><p>Lines 260-263. I encourage the authors to describe the seeds, or at least to summarize the morphological diversity, number of types, (and perhaps their organization) if they were all previously described in O'Connor et al. (2018). What are their morphology, dimensions, and size variation? Do all of them have longitudinal striations? Based on the figures, these seeds appear to be quite large for Cretaceous angiosperms (Tiffney 1984; Eriksson et al. 2000; 2008). Is it more likely that these are seeds of a gymnospermous plant? I suspect so.</p><p>Lines 274-277. The hypothesis about seasonal frugivory in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is both reasonable and interesting. Some indication of warm climate with seasonality of precipitation is supported elsewhere in the Jehol biota by Ding et al.'s (2016) analysis of fossil woods. It may be worth citing that work.</p><p>Lines 305-315. Extant gymnosperms that use endozoochory for seed dispersal use a variety of accessory tissues, not just arils. Ginkgo, cycads, and some extinct groups have a fleshy sarcotesta (outer seed coat). An aril is a fleshy appendage of the seed coat or the funiculus. Some gymnosperms have fleshy subtending bracts (Ephedra), and some have fleshy accessory tissues such as bracts (Ephedra), cones (Juniperus), receptacle and epimatium (Podocarpaceae), or fleshy cones with numerous seeds (Juniperus). See Tiffney (1986, 2004); Herrera (1989); Lovisetto et al. (2012); Contreras et al. (2017); Nigris et al. (2021). I suggest Herrera (1989) as an earlier citation than Herendeen et al. (2017) for line 306.</p><p>Line 318. Why small? What does small mean? Small enough to fit in their mouth?</p><p>Line 321. I suggest &quot;early and repeated&quot; instead of &quot;ancient&quot;. It appears to be clear that there are multiple origins of frugivory/omnivory within crown group birds, and it is not clear that the MRCA of crown-group birds was frugivorus (Felice et al. 2019). This lability in bird diet and repeated origin of frugivory might actually better support the authors' argument that diffuse coevolution between angiosperms and frugivorous birds contributed the KTR. There is now good evidence that volant birds have been repeatedly recruited by plants as endozoochorous seed dispeserers, even prior to the evolution of the MRCA of extant birds.</p><p>Line 342-343. Can you provide a citation linking dispersal mode to diversification rate? Eriksson and Bremer (1992) in the journal 'Evolution' found no relationship between dispersal mode and diversification rate in angiosperms, although Carlo and Morales (2015) in the journal 'Ecology' showed evidence that frugivorous birds increase plant Î± diversity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74751.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is an exceptional specimen, but have raised reservations about the analyses and inferences presented.

These additional analyses delimit among a larger number of dietary categories than our original analyses, which we believe is what Referee 1 required.</p><p>Note that our original manuscript did claim facultative frugivory, and we had consistently used the terms âseasonal frugivoryâ or âpartial frugivoryâ in our initial submission. Also that we suggested explicitly that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> may have taken other diet items including e.g. insectivory. Nevertheless, we have attempted to clarify this further in the revised manuscript (also see below in the reply to Reviewer 1). In particular, we now refer more often to âfruit consumptionâ, describing the behaviour of taking fruit instead of a dietary class. Note that this is not so different to many extant birds, which show different levels of frugivory, mainly taking fruit (including many temperate birds taking berries) or only as a proportion of the diet rather than their strict diet class.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The (co-)evolutionary implications of this discovery remain unclear as presented, and need to be explored further. The seeds are perhaps more likely gymnospermous than angiospermous. There are multiple origins of fleshy accessory tissues in gymnosperms, suggesting that plants were recruiting vertebrate seed dispersers repeatedly, and although crown birds may not be ancestrally frugivorous, the multiple origins of frugivory in crown birds suggests dietary lability. The abundance of animal-dispersed plants, and the frequency with which frugivory evolved in crown birds means that the appearance of facultative, opportunistic, or seasonal frugivory in stem birds is perhaps not particularly surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this point may be separated to three parts:</p><p>1) By providing direct evidence of fruit-consumption in early stem birds, we provided the mechanism for the bird-plant co-evolutionary mutualism. Our study provides the first direct clear evidence of habitual fruit-consumption in an early-diverging bird outside the crown group, and this is the importance of our findings. Direct evidence of co-evolution itself is almost impossible to preserve in fossils. Therefore, even in our initial submission, we opted to tone down the relevant statements rather than making them too strong and specific. We generally restricted our discussions to the first step to this topic â the existence of the mechanism not the actual, direct evidence of this mutualism.</p><p>We think that the evidence of fruit-consumption in stem birds that we provided here is important. The referee summary suggests that this might be thought to be likely, even in absence of evidence. But that is a hypothesis and is contingent on various factors, in particular that crown-group birds are a good model for stem birds, in spite of various anatomical and functional differences. Our data provides a test of this hypothesis, which is important beyond the supposition of what might have been likely or unlikely in absence of evidence. It is worth noting that fruit, and other animal-dispersed reproductive structures (e.g. the fleshy diaspores of gymnosperms) were probably not as abundant in the Early Cretaceous as they are today (e.g. see works by Ericksson on fruit evolution). Therefore, the world was not the same back then as it is today, and it is not strictly correct to say that the high frequency of fruit-consumption by birds today makes the occurrence of fruit-consumption in the Early Cretaceous unsurprising. In fact, the importance and frequency of this interaction today is precisely what makes it so important to find direct evidence on the question of whether it happened at all in the Early Cretaceous.</p><p>2) This point is also mentioned in the âLine 321â comment from Reviewer 2. The lability in bird diet and multiple origins of frugivory in crown birds actually supports our argument that although we cannot decide the gymnosperm or angiosperm affiliation of the gut content in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> yet, considering that early birds such as those from the Jehol Biota would encounter both gymnosperms and angiosperms, early frugivorous birds were likely to be opportunistic and targeted small, fleshy propagules from both groups, rather than being âgymnosperm specialistsâ.</p><p>3) As we stated in the Discussion part: âThe occurrence of specialised seed-dispersal by animals during the Early Cretaceous has previously been proposed indirectly, based on the presence of aril-producing gymnosperm and early fruit-producing angiosperms (Eriksson, 2008; Eriksson et al., 2000a). However, the identification of these frugivores has been uncertain and frugivory was almost unmentioned in the recent review of early bird diets (Miller and Pittman, 2021). Evidence for at least seasonal frugivory in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> provides direct evidence of frugivores and thus indicated highly likely seed-dispersal by animals during the Early Cretaceous for the first time.â We evidenced a long-standing speculation in this area that many researchers are interested â we think this is how important scientific works are made. It is like a âmissing linkâ has been supposed to exist between birds and non-avian reptiles for a long time, but the discovery of <italic>Archaeopteryx</italic> evidenced it and showed the world how it looks â maybe also not âsurprisingâ but no doubt important and inspiring.</p><p>Eriksson O. 2008.

This is supported by the PCA data where there is overlap between the granivory and frugivory data points and the 'other diet' data points.</p><p>The idea of a bird-plant link in the Early Cretaceous is interesting and could be spelled out more, along with further consideration of the uncertainties revealed in key studies e.g., Hulme 2002.</p><p>Hulme, P.E., 2002. Seed-eaters: Seed Dispersal, Destruction and Demography. Seed dispersal and frugivory: Ecology, evolution, and conservation, p.257.</p><p>However, this is secondary to our main comment above which is related to experimental design and the data incompletely supporting the conclusions proposed.</p><p>We suggest two options to consider [### Note from the Senior Editor: our clear preference is Option 2 ###]:</p><p>1) Narrow the scope of the conclusions to those which can be well supported by the data available i.e., a study showing that, for the seed components of the diet of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, whether granivory or frugivory is most supported.</p><p>2) Alternatively, we suggest to undertake a more holistic diet analysis based on multiple lines of evidence that tests hypothesis 3 and then using the results to inform the conclusions (which may or may not be related to granivory or frugivory).</p><p>We hope you find the comments provided helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comment and suggested solutions. We have replied to this in details in the previous âAn Appraisal of Whether the Authors Achieved their Aims, and Whether the Results Support their Conclusions:Â â part, since this is also the main point there. As we said there, there might be some misunderstanding about our study because that the word 'frugivorous' might be misleading to 'specialised frugivorous' to some readers including the reviewer. Actually Option 1 it seems what we claimed all along the manuscript that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> is at least partially frugivorous but not a specialist frugivore. We only need to rigorously rule out a granivorous explanation of the presence of seeds in the gut of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, to demonstrate the partially frugivorous diet of <italic>Jeholornis</italic>, then we could indicate the occurrence of bird-plant interactions in Early Cretaceous. As we also replied in the previous part: the seed dispersal and frugivore ecology studies of the modern taxa show that, for most frugivores, fleshy fruits are a non-exclusive food resource, which is supplemented with other foods like animal prey and plants, and therefore avian frugivores occupy a wide range of diet space that is highly overlapping with some other diets. Therefore, this would not represent a narrowing of the scope of our conclusions ('at least partial frugivory') as concerned by the reviewer. However, to avoid this kind of understanding, as we stated in previous part: we use adjectives such as 'partial', 'seasonal' and 'opportunistic' as many as we could in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Knowing its holistic diet as the Option 2 may not be actually that necessary to our seed dispersal story, so that has almost no relation with our main goal in this study, but we agree that maybe some other readers will also be interested in a more detailed diet of this early avian lineage. Therefore, we conducted supplemental analyses by dividing 'other diets' further to test what diets <italic>Jeholornis</italic> possibly/impossibly had as supplements of frugivory, which would be testing the reviewerâs 'hypothesis 3'. We excluded some diets in the supplemental analyses and pointed out that what diet are possible to supplement fruits when the fruit resources are not available. More details were described in the previous part of reply. We expect these additional analyses would address the reviewerâs concern here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As far as I can tell, the descriptions and comparisons of skull morphology are detailed and well done. The argument that <italic>Jeholornis</italic> was not a seed cracker is strong, and the interpretation of <italic>Jeholornis</italic> as at least seasonally frugivorous is well-reasoned. It does nicely show that volant birds were recruited for endozoochory early. It will be a pleasure to see this published. Nonetheless, I do have some minor questions and concerns/recommendations about the botany and co-evolutionary implications that I think would make the manuscript stronger, along with some minor suggestions regarding the writing clarity that can be adopted at the authors' discretion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for supporting our claim!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 60.

I encourage the authors to describe the seeds, or at least to summarize the morphological diversity, number of types, (and perhaps their organization) if they were all previously described in O'Connor et al. (2018). What are their morphology, dimensions, and size variation? Do all of them have longitudinal striations? Based on the figures, these seeds appear to be quite large for Cretaceous angiosperms (Tiffney 1984; Eriksson et al. 2000; 2008). Is it more likely that these are seeds of a gymnospermous plant? I suspect so.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the summary of descriptions and more likely gymnosperm affinity of the ingested seeds in the paragraph discussing the identification of these seeds: âThe alimentary contents preserved in <italic>Jeholornis</italic> were preliminarily described as ginkgo-like seeds (Zhou and Wu, 2006) and more likely to be gymnosperm due to their relatively large sizes, but have not been confidently identified with detailed comparisons with all the potential Early Cretaceous fruits/arils. In addition, although the poor preservation of these ingested seeds prevents any detailed taxonomic identification, three morphotypes have been grouped in previous studies based on size and shape: morphotype-1 in smaller size with a circular shape and curved striations, morphotype-2 in larger size with an oval shape, and morphotype-3 in similar size to morphotype-1 but with a strongly tapered pole (OâConnor et al., 2018).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 274-277.

Extant gymnosperms that use endozoochory for seed dispersal use a variety of accessory tissues, not just arils. Ginkgo, cycads, and some extinct groups have a fleshy sarcotesta (outer seed coat). An aril is a fleshy appendage of the seed coat or the funiculus. Some gymnosperms have fleshy subtending bracts (Ephedra), and some have fleshy accessory tissues such as bracts (Ephedra), cones (Juniperus), receptacle and epimatium (Podocarpaceae), or fleshy cones with numerous seeds (Juniperus). See Tiffney (1986, 2004); Herrera (1989); Lovisetto et al. (2012); Contreras et al. (2017); Nigris et al. (2021). I suggest Herrera (1989) as an earlier citation than Herendeen et al.

It appears to be clear that there are multiple origins of frugivory/omnivory within crown group birds, and it is not clear that the MRCA of crown-group birds was frugivorus (Felice et al. 2019). This lability in bird diet and repeated origin of frugivory might actually better support the authors' argument that diffuse coevolution between angiosperms and frugivorous birds contributed the KTR. There is now good evidence that volant birds have been repeatedly recruited by plants as endozoochorous seed dispeserers, even prior to the evolution of the MRCA of extant birds.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, we agree and revised this part to be ââ¦the early and most likely repeated origin of frugivory in birdsâ¦â now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 342-343. Can you provide a citation linking dispersal mode to diversification rate? Eriksson and Bremer (1992) in the journal 'Evolution' found no relationship between dispersal mode and diversification rate in angiosperms, although Carlo and Morales (2015) in the journal 'Ecology' showed evidence that frugivorous birds increase plant Î± diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the suggestion! We added Muller-Landau and Hardesty (2005), Dennis et al. (2007), Jordano (2014), Carlo et al. (2022), to support the mutualisms of frugivory and seed dispersal by animals here, which is one of the most studied mutualisms about biodiversity. We may also want to clarify here that our work supports the hypothesis that âbird-plant interactions played a role in the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolutionâ, but we are not testing if it has a more important role than other factors e.g. insect pollination â we are far from reaching enough fossil information from either the bird or the insect side to test this at this moment. The mutualisms of frugivory and seed dispersal by animals among extant taxa are enough to confirm the benefit of the appearance of a new mutualistic mechanism like frugivory of birds in early KTR stage.</p><p>The study in Eriksson and Bremer (1992) about the extant dispersal mode to diversification rate are actually about comparisons of the influence of dispersal mode to other factors like insect pollination. In Eriksson and Bremer (1992), they were mostly claiming that (1) pollination systems and (2) life forms are more important factors than (3) animal dispersal. In addition, they emphasized that these three hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and âseveral mechanisms in concert determine variation in diversification rate in plantâ. They also emphasized that this evaluation was restricted for explaining present-day angiosperm diversification. We think the comparisons of influence of mostly insect involved biotic interactions and birds/mammals for present plants cannot be directly applied to the transitional, early KTR stage. Eriksson and Bremer (1992) also agreed that for the deeper evolutionary history, âa positive influence on diversification by animal dispersal, may have been important during Early Tertiary, but is nevertheless not detectable in a data set based on extant number of species.â.</p><p>We also added Carlo and Morales (2016) here as you mentioned (we think this is the paper you were talking about), since comparatively, the work in Carlo and Morales (2016) focusing on the speed and diversity of early successional forests resembled more to the early stage of KTR, while the angiosperms are also of much lesser abundance at that period.</p><p>Carlo TA, Morales JM (2016).
