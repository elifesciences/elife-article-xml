The first is long ‘22-kHz’ vocalizations (&gt;300 ms, &lt;32-kHz) with constant frequency, signaling aversive states, and the second is short ‘50-kHz’ calls (&lt;150 ms, &gt;32 kHz), often frequency-modulated, in appetitive situations. Here, we describe aversive vocalizations emitted at a higher pitch by male Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in an intensified aversive state – prolonged fear conditioning. These calls, which we named ‘44-kHz’ vocalizations, are long (&gt;150 ms), generally at a constant frequency (usually within 35–50-kHz range) and have an overall spectrographic image similar to 22-kHz calls. Some 44-kHz vocalizations are comprised of both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like elements. Furthermore, two separate clustering methods confirmed that these 44-kHz calls can be separated from other vocalizations. We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming uniform groups of vocalizations (bouts). We also show that some of rats’ responses to the playback of 44-kHz calls were more akin to that of aversive calls, for example, heart rate changes, whereas other responses were at an intermediate level between aversive and appetitive calls. Our results suggest that rats have a wider vocal repertoire than previously believed, and current definitions of major call types may require reevaluation. We hope that future investigations of 44-kHz calls in rat models of human diseases will contribute to expanding our understanding and therapeutic strategies related to human psychiatric conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>hyperreactivity</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>emotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004442</institution-id><institution>National Science Centre, Poland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015/19/B/NZ4/03393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Filipkowski</surname><given-names>Robert Kuba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FBW-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Filipkowski</surname><given-names>Robert Kuba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004895</institution-id><institution>European Social Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>POWR.03.02.00-00-I028/17-00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polowy</surname><given-names>Rafał</given-names></name><name><surname>Wardak</surname><given-names>Agnieszka Diana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When exposed to prolonged stressful stimulation, rats start to emit long, frequency-unmodulated 44-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, usually within the 35–50 kHz range, along with, previously described, long and unmodulated 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Charles Darwin wrote: “That the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states of feeling is tolerably clear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darwin, 1872</xref>).

The former are ‘22-kHz’ vocalizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), with 18–32 kHz frequency range, monotonous and long, usually &gt;300 ms, and are uttered in distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brudzynski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brudzynski, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simola and Granon, 2019</xref>).

Therefore, these two types of calls communicate the animal’s emotional state to their social group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>). Low-pitch (&lt;32 kHz), short (&lt;300 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) calls, assumed to also express a negative aversive state, have been described but their role is not clearly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>). Notably, high-pitch (&gt;32 kHz), long and monotonous ultrasonic vocalizations have not yet been described. Here, we show these unmodulated rat vocalizations with peak frequency (i.e., peak frequency of a given vocalization is defined here as the highest power peak in the averaged spectrum of the entire element) at about 44 kHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), emitted in aversive experimental situations, especially in prolonged fear conditioning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of vocalizations emitted by Wistar rats during fear conditioning training with 10 aversive foot-shocks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>/Exp. 1–3/#2,4,8,13; n = 46).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Some rats produced aversive 22-kHz vocalizations with typical features, that is, constant-frequency of &lt;32 kHz, &gt;300 ms duration – both values marked as dotted lines); example emission from one rat.

The frequency shifts toward both higher and lower levels, that is, alterations were observed during both positive (appetitive) and negative (agonistic/aversive) situations; however, as a general rule, frequency usually increases with an increase in arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briefer et al., 2012</xref>). We would like to propose a hypothesis that our prolonged fear conditioning increased the arousal of the rats with no change in the valence of the aversive stimuli.</p><p>It could also be speculated that several other factors, apart from increased arousal, contributed to the emergence of 44-kHz vocalizations in our fear-conditioned rats, for example, heightened fear, stress/anxiety, annoyance/anger, disgust/boredom, grief/sadness, despair/helplessness, and weariness/fatigue. It is not possible, at this stage, to definitively determine which factors played a decisive role. Please note that the potential contribution of these factors is not mutually exclusive.</p><p>However, several arguments support the idea that 44-kHz vocalizations communicate an increased negative emotional state. First, in general, ultrasonic vocalizations serve as a means of communicating rats’ emotional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brudzynski, 2013</xref>). Second, the changing of <italic>the pitch of the voice bears some relation to certain states of feeling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darwin, 1872</xref>). Third, 44-kHz calls were notably more frequent during prolonged aversive stimulation, that is, the 5th–10th trials of fear conditioning training. Fourth, they were linked to freezing. Fifth, they appeared as partial replacements of, established as aversive, 22-kHz calls – in the presence of the same painful stimulus. Sixth, numerous instances of vocalizations featured both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like call elements.</p><p>Also, several observations contradict the potential contribution of fatigue. The sound mean power of 44-kHz vocalizations was comparable to, or possibly even higher than, that of 22-kHz calls, despite the higher energy costs associated with producing higher-pitched calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonninen and Hurme, 1998</xref>), that is, the rats emitting 44-kHz calls invested additional energy to communicate their emotional state; both in vivo measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riede, 2013</xref>) and computer modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Håkansson et al., 2022</xref>) demonstrated that producing calls of higher frequency, such as 50-kHz vs. 22-kHz, requires increased activity of various muscles. Additionally, the mean power of 44-kHz vocalizations remained strong and stable for several trials – in contrast to 22-kHz vocalizations. Finally, when 44-kHz calls started to appear in significant numbers, that is, after the 4th–5th trials of fear conditioning training, they were as long as 22-kHz vocalizations.</p><p>Concerning the latter, we observed a significant decrease in the mean power of 22-kHz vocalizations during the fear conditioning training session. Such reduction could potentially be attributed to fatigue (as observed in humans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitch and Oates, 1994</xref>), despair (e.g., as a reaction to the lack of effects from repeated emissions of 22-kHz calls), or both. The reduction in the amplitude of 22-kHz calls during the 10-trial fear conditioning training was also recently observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez-Palomares et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, it has been demonstrated multiple times that training rats with several electric foot-shocks (i.e., 5–10 shocks) produces a qualitatively different kind of fear memory compared to training with only 1–2 shocks. Training with more numerous shocks has been shown to result in augmented freezing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanselow and Bolles, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haubrich and Nader, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), which reflects a more intense fear memory that is resistant to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haubrich and Nader, 2023</xref>), resistant to reconsolidation blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haubrich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finnie and Nader, 2020</xref>), associated with downregulation of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunits as well as elevated amyloid-beta concentrations in the lateral and basal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finnie and Nader, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

The rats subjected to 6- and 10-trial fear conditioning training, whose results are reported herein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>/Exp. 2/#7,8,11,12; n = 73), also demonstrated higher freezing than rats subjected to 1-trial conditioning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>/Exp. 2/#6,10; n = 33), which is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olszyński et al., 2021</xref>, Fig. S1C–E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olszyński et al., 2023</xref>, Fig. S1D–G). Therefore, we postulate that emission of 44-kHz calls is associated with increased stress and the training regime forming robust memories.</p><p>Amounting research points to the utility of rat ultrasonic vocalizations to alter emotional states, evidenced by behavioral changes, in tested rats via playback of affectively valenced calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonauto et al., 2023</xref>). We have exposed rats to 44-kHz playback along with 22-kHz and 50-kHz playback. The experimental design (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) allowed us to compare rats’ responses to 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz playbacks, especially with 50-kHz playback used as a form of control or baseline. In general, the rats responded similarly to hearing 44-kHz calls as they did to hearing aversive 22-kHz calls, especially regarding heart rate change, despite the 44-kHz calls occupying the frequency band of appetitive 50-kHz vocalizations. This is contrary to some observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saito et al., 2019</xref>), which suggested that frequency band plays the main role in rat ultrasound perception. Please factor in potential carry-over effects (resulting from hearing playbacks of the same valence in a row) in the differences between responses to 50-kHz vs. 22/44-kHz playbacks, especially those observed before the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Other responses to 44-kHz calls were intermediate, they fell between response levels to appetitive vs. aversive playback, which might signify some behavioral specificity and importance (or possibly confusion). These latter effects were similar in both playback experiments despite an array of methodological differences between them. Overall, these initial results raise further questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret the variation in hearing 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz calls and integrate this interpretation in their responses.</p><p>The question also is, why have the 44-kHz vocalizations been overlooked until now? On one hand, long (or not that long as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bialy et al., 2019</xref>), frequency-stable high-pitch vocalizations have been reported before (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sales, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimoju et al., 2020</xref>), notably as caused by intense cholinergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brudzynski and Bihari, 1990</xref>) or higher shock-dose fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wöhr et al., 2005</xref>). However, they have not been systematically defined, described, fully shown, or demonstrated to be a separate type of vocalization. On the other hand, 44-kHz calls were likely omitted as the analyses were restricted to canonical groups, that is, flat 22-kHz and short 50-kHz calls, with a sharp dividing frequency border between the two (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalamari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Potasiewicz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner et al., 2019</xref>) or even a frequency ‘safety gap’ between 22-kHz and 50-kHz vocalizations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silkstone and Brudzynski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, many older bat detectors had limited frequency-range detection (e.g., up to 40-kHz in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sales, 1991</xref>) when stress-evoked types of ultrasonic calls were being established. Finally, 44-kHz vocalizations are emitted much fewer than 22-kHz calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present introductory evidence that 44-kHz vocalizations are a separate and behaviorally relevant group of rat ultrasonic calls. These results require further confirmations and additional experiments, also in form of replication, including research on female rat subjects. However, our results bring to awareness that rats employ these previously unrecognized, long, high-pitched and flat aversive calls in their vocal repertoire. Researchers investigating rat ultrasonic vocalizations should be aware of their potential presence and to not rely fully on automated detection of high- vs. low-pitch calls.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Wistar rat, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wistar rat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Center for Experimental Medicine of the Medical University of Białystok</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CMDB:WI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7 weeks old upon arrival at our lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (SHR, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SHR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mossakowski Medical Research Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SHR/NHsd/Cmd</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7 weeks old upon arrival at our lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Sprague–Dawley Rat, <italic>R. norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SD rat</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mossakowski Medical Research Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tac:Cmd:SD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7 weeks old upon arrival at our lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SASLab Pro</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Avisoft Bioacoustics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014438">SCR_014438</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">version 5.2.xx</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Avisoft Recorder</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Avisoft Bioacoustics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014436">SCR_014436</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">version 4.2.28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Deep Squeak</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DrCoffey/DeepSqueak">https://github.com/DrCoffey/DeepSqueak</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coffey and Marx, 2022</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_021524">SCR_021524</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">version 3.0.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sklearn</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24600388/">24600388</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002577">SCR_002577</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other, hardware</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ultrasonic Microphone</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Avisoft Bioacoustics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CM16/CMPA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other, hardware</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radiotelemetric transmitters</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Data Sciences International</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HD-S10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wistar rats (n = 167) were obtained from The Center for Experimental Medicine of the Medical University of Białystok, Poland; SHR (n = 80) and Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 16) were from Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poland.

Typically, negative 22-kHz calls and positive 50-kHz calls are distinguished in rats, commonly by using a frequency threshold of 30 or 32 kHz. Olszyński et al. now observed so-called &quot;44-kHz&quot; calls in a substantial number of subjects exposed to 10 tone-shock pairings, yet call emission rate was low (according to Fig. 1G around 15%, according to the result text around 7.5%). They also performed playback experiments and concluded that &quot;the responses to 44-kHz aversive calls presented from the speaker were either similar to 22-kHz vocalizations or in-between responses to 22-kHz and 50-kHz playbacks&quot;.</p><p>Strengths: Detailed spectrographic analysis of a substantial data set of ultrasonic vocalizations recorded during prolonged fear conditioning, combined with playback experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88810.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Olszyński</surname><given-names>Krzysztof Hubert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Behavior and Metabolism Research Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Polowy</surname><given-names>Rafał</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Behavior and Metabolism Research Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wardak</surname><given-names>Agnieszka Diana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Behavior and Metabolism Research Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Łaska</surname><given-names>Izabela Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Behavior and Metabolism Research Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grymanowska</surname><given-names>Aneta Wiktoria</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Behavior and Metabolism Research Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Puławski</surname><given-names>Wojciech</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Bioinformatics Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gawryś</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Renal and Body Fluid Physiology, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Koliński</surname><given-names>Michał</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Bioinformatics Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Filipkowski</surname><given-names>Robert Kuba</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Behavior and Metabolism Research Laboratory, Mossakowski Medical Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warsaw</named-content></addr-line><country>Poland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The exclusive use of males is a major concern lacking adequate justification and should be disclosed in the title and abstract to ensure readers are aware of this limitation. With several reported sex differences in rat vocal behaviors this means caution should be exercised when generalizing from these findings. The occurrence of an estrus cycle in typical female rats is not justification for their exclusion. Note also that male rodents experience great variability in hormonal states as well, distinguishing between individuals and within individuals across time. The study of endocrinological influences on behavior can be separated from the study of said behavior itself, across all sexes. Similarly, concerns about needing to increase the number of animals when including all sexes are usually unwarranted (see Shansky [2019] and Phillips et al. [2023]).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we have disclosed the use of males in the title and the abstract. Also, we have added the statement that research on female rat subjects is required: “Here we are showing introductory evidence that 44-kHz vocalizations are a separate and behaviorally-relevant group of rat ultrasonic calls. These results require further confirmations and additional experiments, also in form of repetition, including research on female rat subjects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the analysis where calls were sorted using DBSCAN based on peak frequency and duration, my comment on the originally reviewed version stands. It seems that the calls are sorted by an (unbiased) algorithm into categories based on their frequency and duration, and because 44kHz calls differ by definition on frequency and duration the fact that the algorithm sorts them as a distinct category is not evidence that they are &quot;new calls [that] form a separate, distinct group&quot;. I appreciate that the authors have softened their language regarding the novelty and distinctness of these calls, but the manuscript contains several instances where claims of novelty and specificity (e.g. the subtitle on line 193) is emphasized beyond what the data justifies.</p></disp-quote><p>We further softened our language regarding novelty and distinctness of 44-kHz vocalizations – including the aforementioned subtitle. However, in response, we would like to bring to the readers’ attention that all major groups of calls, i.e., long 22-kHz calls, short 22-kHz calls, and 50-kHz vocalization, are also defined in our manuscript and in the literature by their frequency and duration. However not one of these groups was identified separately by DBSCAN clustering excepting the 44kHz vocalizations. If they were not a distinct group, we would expect the 44-kHz and 50-kHz vocalizations to blend first (because of the similar frequencies) or 44-kHz and 22-kHz calls to merge first (because of the similar durations), but they do not in this unbiased examination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The behavioral response to call playback is intriguing, although again more in line with the hypothesis that these are not a distinct type of call but merely represent expected variation in vocalization parameters. Across the board animals respond rather similarly to hearing 22 kHz calls as they do to hearing 44 kHz calls, with occasional shifts of 44 kHz call responses to an intermediate between appetitive and aversive calls. This does raise interesting questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret such variation and integrate this interpretation in their responses. However, the categorical approach employed here does not address these questions fully.</p></disp-quote><p>This paragraph is exactly the same as in the previous review. There was no comment regarding our previous answer. Here is the previous answer:</p><p>“We are unsure of the Reviewer’s critique in this paragraph and will attempt to address it to the best of our understanding. Our finding of up to &gt;19% of long seemingly aversive, 44-kHz calls, at a frequency in the define appetitive ultrasonic range (usually &gt;32 kHz) is unexpected rather than “expected”. We would agree that aversive call variation is expected, but not in the appetitive frequency range.</p><p>Kindly note the findings by Saito et al. (2019), which claim that frequency band plays the main role in rat ultrasonic perception. It is possible that the higher peak frequency of 44-kHz calls may be a strong factor in their perception by rats, which is, however, modified by the longer duration and the lack of modulation.</p><p>Also, from our experience, it is quite challenging to demonstrate different behavioral responses of naïve rats to pre-recorded 22-kHz (aversive) vs. 50-kHz (appetitive) vocalizations. Therefore, to demonstrate a difference in response to two distinct, potentially aversive, calls, i.e., 22kHz vs. 44-kHz calls, to be even more difficult (as to our knowledge, a comparable experiment between short vs. long 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, has not been done before).</p><p>Therefore, we do not take lightly the surprising and interesting finding that “animals respond rather similarly to hearing 22 kHz calls as they do to hearing 44 kHz calls, with occasional shifts of 44 kHz call responses to an intermediate between appetitive and aversive calls”. We would rather put this description in analogous words: “the rats responded similarly to hearing 44-kHz calls as they did to hearing aversive 22-kHz calls, especially regarding heart-rate change, despite the 44-kHz calls occupying the frequency band of appetitive 50-kHz vocalizations” and “other responses to 44-kHz calls were intermediate, they fell between response levels to appetitive vs. aversive playback” – which we added to the Discussion.</p><p>Finally, we acknowledge that our findings do not present a finite and complete picture of the discussed aspects of behavioral responses to the presented ultrasonic stimuli (44-kHz vocalizations). Therefore, we have incorporated the Reviewer’s suggestion in the discussion. The added sentence reads: “Overall, these initial results raise further questions about how, ethologically, animals may interpret the variation in hearing 22-kHz vs. 44-kHz calls and integrate this interpretation in their responses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate the amendment in discussing the idea of arousal being the key determinant for the increased emission of 44kHz, and the addition of other factors. Some of the items in this list, such as annoyance/anger and disgust/boredom, don't really seem to fit the data. I'm not sure I find the idea that rats become annoyed or disgusted during fear conditioning to be a particularly compelling argument. As such the list appears to be a collection of emotion-related words, with unclear potential associations with the 44kHz calls.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that most of the factors listed are not supported by the data. These are hypotheses and speculations only – hence, an assumption / tentative statement, i.e., “It could also be argued that…”. We have changed it into “It could also be speculated that…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Later in the Discussion the authors argue that the 44kHz aversive calls signal an increased intensity of a negative valence emotional state. It is not clear how the presented arguments actually support this. For example, what does the elongation of fear conditioning to 10 trials have to do with increased negative emotionality? Is there data supporting this relationship between duration and emotion, outside anthropomorphism? Each of the 6 arguments presented seems quite distant from being able to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a description summarizing the literature that expounds the differences in employing one-two vs. five-ten foot-shocks during fear-conditioning training. It says:</p><p>“Importantly, it has been demonstrated multiple times that training rats with several electric foot-shocks (i.e., 5-10 shocks) produces a qualitatively different kind of fear-memory compared to training with only 1-2 shocks. Training with more numerous shocks has been shown to result in augmented freezing (e.g., Fanselow and Bolles, 1979, Haubrich et al., 2020, Haubrich and Nader, 2023, Poulos et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2009) which reflects a more intense fear-memory that is resistant to extinction (Haubrich et al., 2020, Haubrich and Nader, 2023), resistant to reconsolidation blockade (Haubrich et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2009, Finnie and Nader, 2020), associated with downregulation of NR2B NMDA-receptor subunits as well as elevated amyloid-beta concentrations in the lateral and basal amygdala (Finnie and Nader, 2020, Wang et al., 2009). Additionally, it involves activation of the noradrenaline-locus coeruleus system (Haubrich et al., 2020) and collective changes in connectivity across multiple brain regions within the neural network (Haubrich and Nader, 2023).</p><p>Notably, it has also been shown that higher freezing as a result of fear-conditioning training correlates with increased concentrations of stress hormone, corticosterone, in the blood (Dos Santos Correa et al., 2019). The rats subjected to 6- and 10-trial fear conditioning, whose results are reported herein (Tab. 1/Exp. 2/#7,8,11,12; n = 73), also demonstrated higher freezing than rats subjected to 1trial conditioning (Tab. 1/Exp. 2/#6,10; n = 33), which is reported elsewhere (Olszynski et al., 2021, Fig. S1C-E; Olszynski et al., 2022, Fig. S1D-G). Therefore, we postulate that emission of 44-kHz calls is associated with increased stress and the training regime forming robust memories.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, rather than describing the 44kHz long calls as a new call type, it may be more accurate to say that sometimes aversive calls can occur at frequencies above 22 kHz. Individual and situational variability in vocalization parameters seems to be expected, much more so than all members of a species strictly adhering to extremely non-variable behavioral outputs.</p></disp-quote><p>This paragraph is exactly the same as in the previous review. There was no comment regarding our previous answer. Here is the previous answer:</p><p>“The surprising fact that there are presumably aversive calls that are beyond the commonly applied thresholds, i.e., &gt;32 kHz, while sharing some characteristics with 22-kHz calls, is the main finding of the current publication. Whether they be finally assigned as a new type, subtype, i.e. a separate category or become a supergroup of aversive calls with 22-kHz vocalizations is of secondary importance to be discussed with other researchers of the field of study.</p><p>However, we would argue – by showing a comparison – that 22-kHz calls occur at durations of &lt;300 ms and also &gt;300 ms, and are, usually, referred to in literature as short and long 22-kHz vocalizations, respectively (not introduced with a description that “sometimes 22-kHz calls can occur at durations below 300 ms”). These are then regarded and investigated as separate groups or classes usually referred to as two different “types” (e.g., Barker et al., 2010) or “subtypes” (e.g., Brudzynski, 2015). Analogously, 44-kHz vocalizations can also be regarded as a separate type or a subtype of 22kHz calls. The problem with the latter is that 22-kHz vocalizations are traditionally and predominantly defined by 18–32 kHz frequency bandwidth (Araya et al., 2020; Barroso et al., 2019; Browning et al., 2011; Brudzynski et al., 1993; Hinchcliffe et al., 2022; Willey &amp; Spear, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Additional considerations:</p><p>Abstract: The 19.4% seems to be the percentage of 44 kHz calls observed during the 9th trial of the 10trial experiment, not the percentage of calls that were 44kHz during bouts of freezing.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the sentence. It now says:</p><p>“We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming groups of vocalizations (bouts).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract: &quot;We hope that future investigations of 44-kHz calls in rat models of human diseases will contribute to expanding our understanding and therapeutic strategies related to human psychiatric conditions.&quot; This sounds like a far too strong of an implication provided the link between these calls and models of human psychiatric conditions is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the link is not clear. Therefore we only express our hope. We hope “the link” is there. While other ultrasonic calls are already being investigated in such animal models, training regimes employing numerous electric shocks are used as models of PTSD, helplessness etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 101: Seems a strong assumption to state the authors of the other publication were inspired by this paper, unless there is personal communication corroborating this.</p></disp-quote><p>The wording of the sentence has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is still not clear why both Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were used, especially in situations where only one result seems to be referenced (for example on line 108-109).</p></disp-quote><p>We added the explanation within Methods: “In particular, the Friedman test was used to assess the presence of change within the sequence of several ITI, while the Wilcoxon test was used for the difference between the first and the last ITI analyzed.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
