A relatively non-standard form of synaptic plasticity driven by dendritic calcium spikes, or plateau potentials, has been reported to underlie place field formation in rodent hippocampal CA1 neurons. Here, we found that this behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) can also reshape existing place fields via bidirectional synaptic weight changes that depend on the temporal proximity of plateau potentials to pre-existing place fields. When evoked near an existing place field, plateau potentials induced less synaptic potentiation and more depression, suggesting BTSP might depend inversely on postsynaptic activation. However, manipulations of place cell membrane potential and computational modeling indicated that this anti-correlation actually results from a dependence on current synaptic weight such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. A network model implementing this bidirectional synaptic learning rule suggested that BTSP enables population activity, rather than pairwise neuronal correlations, to drive neural adaptations to experience.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A new housing development in a familiar neighborhood, a wrong turn that ends up lengthening a Sunday stroll: our internal representation of the world requires constant updating, and we need to be able to associate events separated by long intervals of time to finetune future outcome.

In the hippocampus, synaptic plasticity plays an important role in various forms of spatial and episodic learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nakazawa et al., 2004</xref>).

Here, we investigate the synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying such rapid changes in the spatial selectivity of hippocampal place cells.</p><p>Various forms of Hebbian synaptic plasticity have been considered for decades to be the main, or even only, synaptic plasticity mechanisms present within most brain regions of a number of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Magee and Grienberger, 2020</xref>). The core feature of such plasticity mechanisms is that they are autonomously driven by repeated synchronous activity between synaptically connected neurons, which results in either increases or decreases in synaptic strength depending on the exact temporal coincidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gerstner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shouval et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Song et al., 2000</xref>). This includes the so-called ‘three-factor’ plasticity rules that, in addition to pre- and postsynaptic activity, depend on a third factor that extends the time course over which plasticity can function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Magee and Grienberger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gerstner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yagishita et al., 2014</xref>). To implement these three-factor plasticity rules, it has been proposed that correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity drives the formation of a synaptic flag or eligibility trace (ET) that is then converted into changes in synaptic weights by the delayed third factor, usually a neuromodulatory signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gerstner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sajikumar and Frey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frey and Morris, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we reported a potent, rapid form of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons that enables a de novo place field to be generated in a single trial following a dendritic calcium spike (also called a plateau potential) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diamantaki et al., 2018</xref>). This form of synaptic plasticity, termed behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), rapidly modifies synaptic inputs active within a seconds-long time window around the plateau potential. This relatively long time course suggests that BTSP may be similar to the above-mentioned three-factor forms of plasticity, with synaptic activity generating local signals marking synapses as eligible for plasticity (ETs), and plateau potentials acting as the delayed factor that converts synaptic ETs into changes in synaptic strength. However, BTSP was shown to strengthen many synaptic inputs whose activation did not coincide with any postsynaptic spiking or even subthreshold depolarization detected at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that changes in synaptic weight might be independent of correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity, and that BTSP may be fundamentally different than all variants of Hebbian synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gerstner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shouval et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mehta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golding et al., 2002</xref>). Such a non-standard plasticity rule could enable learning to be guided by delayed behavioral outcomes, rather than by short timescale associations of pre- and postsynaptic activity.</p><p>In this study, we tested the effect of dendritic plateau potentials on the spatial selectivity of CA1 neurons that already express pre-existing place fields, and therefore exhibit substantial postsynaptic depolarization and spiking prior to plasticity induction. We found that dendritic plateau potentials rapidly translocate the place field position of hippocampal place cells, both by strengthening inputs active near the plateau position and weakening inputs active within the original place field. In order to determine if the increased postsynaptic activity in place cells is causally related to the synaptic depression observed within the initial place field, we performed a series of voltage perturbation experiments, which indicated that the direction of plasticity induced by plateau potentials is independent of postsynaptic depolarization and spiking. Next, we inferred from the data a computational model of the synaptic learning rule underlying this bidirectional form of plasticity, which suggested that it is instead the current weight of each synaptic input that controls the direction of plasticity such that weak inputs potentiate and strong inputs depress. Finally, we implemented this weight-dependent learning rule in a network model to explore the capabilities of bidirectional BTSP to adapt network-level population representations to changes in the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Plateau potentials translocate existing place fields</title><p>We first examined how plasticity induced by dendritic plateau potentials changes the intracellular membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) dynamics in neurons already exhibiting location-specific firing (i.e. place cells).

Therefore, we next analyzed the temporal relationship between plateau potentials and location-specific potentiation and depression.

This analysis showed that the positive and negative changes to <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> induced in place cells occurred over a timescale of multiple seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), with the positive changes appearing to be asymmetric with respect to the onset time of the plateaus (ratio of potentiation duration before/after plateau onset: 2.2; black circles and crossmarks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> mark the time points when Δ<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> crosses zero).

The negative changes (i.e. the hyperpolarizations indicative of synaptic depression) occurred within a time window between ±2 and ±6 s from the plateau in many neurons that expressed pre-existing place fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Notably, this hyperpolarization was greatly reduced, or even absent, in a set of place cells where the time delay between plateau onset and the initial place field <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ramp was greater than 4–5 s (red traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and E</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>), further indicating the time delimited aspect of the depression component.

However, each place cell had both spatial positions where it was depolarized within its place field, and positions where it was hyperpolarized out-of-field.

Does this anti-correlation reflect a causal relationship between postsynaptic depolarization and changes in synaptic weight induced by BTSP? This possibility would require that small depolarizations induce synaptic potentiation and large depolarizations induce synaptic depression, which is actually opposite to what has been observed in CA1 pyramidal cells with a variety of other plasticity protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shouval et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Graupner and Brunel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clopath et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clopath and Gerstner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jedlicka et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the increased <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> depolarization within a cell’s place field also reflects the activation of strongly weighted synaptic inputs, which have been potentiated by prior plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Thus, a causal dependency on either <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> or synaptic weight could explain the data so far.</p><p>To discriminate between these two possibilities, we next devised a set of voltage perturbation experiments. We reasoned that, if increased depolarization and spiking within a cell’s place field causes synaptic depression, then artificially increasing <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and inducing spiking in otherwise silent cells would cause plateau potentials to induce negative Δ<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>.

It is important to note that these somatic voltage manipulations are not expected to strictly control or even completely overwhelm <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> at the synaptic sites relevant to plasticity induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magee and Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koester and Sakmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Froemke et al., 2005</xref>) due to attenuation of current and voltage along the dendritic cable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Magee, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golding et al., 2005</xref>), and compartmentalization of synaptic voltage in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Harnett et al., 2012</xref>). However, by either increasing or decreasing the generation of somatic action potentials, this manipulation will unequivocally alter the number of action potentials that back-propagate into dendrites, which will in turn influence the activation of voltage-gated channels in dendrites and spines (e.g. Na<sup>+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and NMDA-Rs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Magee and Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>).

Instead, the results of these voltage perturbation experiments support the alternative hypothesis that it is the initial strength of each synapse that controls whether an input will be potentiated or depressed by BTSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). However, the magnitude of potentiation and depression was slightly affected by the voltage perturbations (e.g. potentiation was slightly but significantly increased in silent cells during artificial depolarization compared to control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with the previously reported finding that BTSP induction requires activation of voltage-dependent ion channels, including NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDA-Rs) and voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>), which would have predicted BTSP to depend on postsynaptic depolarization. To examine this further, we performed an additional set of experiments in which silent cells were strongly hyperpolarized by somatic current injection (~–50 mV for ~3 s just before plateau initiation) during plasticity induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This manipulation decreased synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with a requirement for activation of voltage-dependent NMDA-Rs. That such a large, non-physiological level of global <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> hyperpolarization was required to alter BTSP reinforces the finding that, operationally, the dependence is not on voltage signals associated with neuronal activation state (sustained somatodendritic <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and action potentials), but rather on those associated with synaptic input (transient local spine depolarization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu-Laroche and Harnett, 2018</xref>). Finally, these experiments do not support a role for synaptic depolarization in determining the <italic>direction</italic> of changes in synaptic strengths.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Weight-dependent model of bidirectional BTSP</title><p>The above voltage perturbation experiments suggested that the form of synaptic plasticity underlying BTSP does not depend on the activation state of the postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This contrasts with Hebbian plasticity rules that typically depend on either the firing rate or depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to determine the amplitude and direction of changes in synaptic weight. Another difference is that BTSP appears to be inherently stable, converting synaptic potentiation into depression when input strengths exceed a particular range, whereas most models of Hebbian learning require additional homeostatic mechanisms to counteract synaptic potentiation in highly active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Oja, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bienenstock et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Nelson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zenke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>). To better understand the synaptic learning rule underlying BTSP and its functional consequences, we next sought a mathematical description of BTSP to account for the following features of the in vivo recording data:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>BTSP induces bidirectional changes in synaptic weight at inputs activated up to ~6 s before or after a dendritic plateau potential.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The direction and magnitude of changes in synaptic weight depend on the initial state of each synapse such that weak inputs potentiate, and strong inputs depress.</p></list-item><list-item><p>BTSP modifies synaptic weights such that the temporal profile of <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> in place cells approaches a stable target shape that peaks close in time to the plateau location and decays with distance.</p></list-item></list><p>As mentioned previously, ‘three-factor’ plasticity models propose a mechanism for the strengths of activated synapses to be modified after a time delay – a biochemical intermediate signal downstream of synaptic activation marks each recently activated synapse as ‘eligible’ to undergo a plastic change in synaptic weight. This ‘ET’ decays over a longer timescale than synaptic activation, and while it does not induce plasticity by itself, it enables plasticity to be induced upon the arrival of an additional modulatory biochemical signal. While ‘three-factor’ models consider synaptic ETs to be generated by a coincidence of presynaptic spikes (factor 1) and postsynaptic spikes or sustained depolarization (factor 2), the results of the above voltage perturbation experiments suggest that if BTSP involves the generation of synaptic ETs, these signals depend only on a single factor – local synaptic activation. In the context of BTSP, the modulatory or ‘instructive signal’ (IS) could be instantiated by a dendritic plateau potential. To model this, we assumed that the large magnitude dendritic depolarization associated with a plateau potential (~60 mV) effectively propagates to all synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2012</xref>), activating an IS at each synapse and allowing a spatially and temporally local interaction between ET and IS to drive plasticity independently at each individual synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To account for plasticity that occurs at inputs activated up to multiple seconds <italic>after</italic> a plateau, this IS would have to decay slowly enough to overlap in time with ETs generated after the end of the plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Weight-dependent model of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) captures essential features of plateau-induced plasticity.</title><p>(<bold>A – B</bold>) Traces schematize a model of bidirectional BTSP that depends on (1) presynaptic spike timing, (2) plateau potential timing and duration, and (3) the current synaptic weight of an input before an evoked plateau.

This was unable to explain changes in synaptic weight at inputs activated at seconds-long time delays to a plateau.</p><p>Having demonstrated that this weight-dependent model of plasticity at single synapses captures the essential features of BTSP, we next tested if the model can account quantitatively for the in vivo place field translocation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). For this purpose, we assumed that the <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ramp depolarization measured in a CA1 pyramidal cell during locomotion on the circular treadmill reflects a weighted sum of presynaptic inputs that are themselves place cells with firing rates that vary with spatial position (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref> and Materials and methods). As a population, the place fields of these inputs uniformly tiled the track, and the firing rate of an individual input depended on the recorded run trajectory of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, first and second rows). In this case, presynaptic activity patterns were modeled as continuous firing rates rather than discrete spike times. For each cell in the experimental dataset (<italic>n</italic> = 26 inductions from 24 neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), the initial weight <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of each presynaptic input <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was inferred from the recorded initial <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, and the changes in weight <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> during plasticity induction laps containing evoked plateau potentials were computed as above (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). The relevant signals modeled for an example lap from a representative cell from the dataset are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Note that, at inputs activated before the onset time of the plateau, changes in synaptic weight (bottom row) do not begin until after plateau onset when the instructive signal <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf63"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the signal overlap <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf64"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are nonzero. The parameters of the model were optimized to predict the final synaptic weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and reproduce the final <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) after multiple plasticity induction laps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, Materials and methods).

We modeled this situation by simulating a virtual animal running on a circular treadmill for three separate phases of exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). At each time step (10 ms), instantaneous plateau probabilities were computed for each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), determining which neurons would initiate a dendritic plateau and undergo plasticity. During the first few laps of simulated exploration, CA1 pyramidal neurons rapidly acquired place fields that, as a population, uniformly tiled the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). As neurons increased their activity over time, feedback inhibition increased proportionally and prevented further plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>).

We found that BTSP is bidirectional, inducing both synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression in neurons expressing pre-existing place fields. The direction of plasticity is determined by the synaptic weight of each excitatory input prior to a plateau potential, and the time interval between synaptic activity and a plateau. The large magnitude of synaptic weight changes enables BTSP to rapidly reshape place field activity in a small number of trials. These results corroborate recent work showing that changes in place field firing in CA1 could be induced by juxtacellular current injection, which was correlated with the occurrence of long duration complex spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Diamantaki et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we used intracellular stimulation and recording to reliably evoke dendritic calcium spikes with precise timing and duration, and to monitor subthreshold changes in <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> dynamics, which enabled inference of the underlying synaptic learning rule.</p><p>The time and synaptic weight dependence of BTSP suggests that it is driven by an input-specific process rather than nonselective heterosynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lynch et al., 1977</xref>) or homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hengen et al., 2016</xref>), or modulation of cellular excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chandra and Barkai, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Titley et al., 2017</xref>). A significant role for changes in inhibitory synaptic weights is unlikely given that (1) inhibitory neurons in CA1 exhibit low levels of spatial selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grienberger et al., 2017</xref>), (2) homosynaptic potentiation of excitatory inputs by dendritic plateau potentials can be induced with GABAergic inhibition blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>), and (3) inhibitory input to CA1 neurons does not change following induction of synaptic potentiation by BTSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grienberger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The voltage perturbation experiments we performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) showed that BTSP does not depend on the activation state of the postsynaptic neuron.

Our voltage perturbation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) show that the direction of plasticity is not determined by either global depolarization or spiking.</p><p>This lack of dependence on the postsynaptic activity or output could enable plasticity to be robust to fluctuations in postsynaptic state due to noise or network oscillations (e.g. theta or gamma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>), and may allow the postsynaptic state to subserve other functions, such as temporal coding, without interfering with ongoing synaptic weight modifications. Furthermore, while in traditional Hebbian models of plasticity, short timescale synchrony between pre- and postsynaptic activity modifies weights to reinforce pre-existing correlations, BTSP instead provides a mechanism to either create new pairwise activity correlations ‘from scratch’, or remove pre-existing ones based on delayed outcomes. Our network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) highlights how this fundamental element of BTSP could shape spatial memory storage at the network level, allowing neuronal circuits to rapidly acquire population-level representations of previously unencountered environmental features, and to modify outdated representations.

However, during some experiments, large changes in the spatial <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ramp depolarization could be observed to develop after as few as one plateau (consistent with the observation that plasticity could be induced by a single spontaneously-occurring plateau), and so fewer induction laps were used. In other experiments, plateaus were induced on more than five consecutive laps if place field expression remained weak after the first five trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, left). The source of this variability across cells/animals is not yet clear, and requires future investigation. Overall, this procedure induced changes in spatial <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ramp depolarization in 100% of cells in which it was attempted by three investigators. In some cells, the initial place field was first induced by this procedure, and then the procedure was repeated a second or third time in the same cell with plateaus induced at different locations.

In this ‘weight-dependent’ model, the direction and magnitude of plasticity at excitatory synapses from spatially tuned CA3 place cell inputs onto a CA1 pyramidal cell are determined by (1) the timing of presynaptic spiking relative to postsynaptic plateau potentials and (2) the current weight of each synapse just prior to a plateau.

Under these baseline conditions, each model CA1 neuron <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> had a probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf150"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.0075</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> of emitting a single dendritic plateau potential in 1 s of running.

This stochasticity can be thought of as reflecting fluctuations in the synaptic input arriving to each cell from the long-range cortical input pathway that occasionally drives the neuron to cross a threshold for generation of a dendritic calcium spike. If a cell emitted a plateau, it persisted for a fixed duration of 300 ms and was followed by a 500 ms refractory period during which <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf152"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> was transiently set to zero.</p><p>After the first lap, CA1 neurons that had emitted at least one plateau and had induced synaptic potentiation produced nonzero ramp depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

demonstrate that Behavioural Time Scale Plasticity (BTSP) is bidirectional, and the amplitude and direction of this plasticity are dictated by the current weight of the inputs and not by the correlated activity of pairs of neurons. These findings challenge our current views on synaptic plasticity, which are primarily based on Hebb's concept. In addition, the network model used in this study demonstrates that this type of plasticity can rapidly reshape population activity to respond to environmental clues. This study will be of interest to the broad neuroscience audience and foster new ideas on biological and artificial learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73046.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Toth</surname><given-names>Katalin</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Epsztein</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>INSERM U1249; Aix-Marseille University</institution><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Naud</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.02.04.934182">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.04.934182v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jerome Epsztein (Reviewer #1); Richard Naud (Reviewer #2); Larry F Abbott (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers unanimously expressed their support for this manuscript. Their comments will help the authors to improve the clarity of the manuscript. The changes suggested by the reviewers do not require the authors to do additional experiments.</p><p>Reviewers' comments detail the points of improvement.</p><p>1.

Please address questions raised about W and W<sub>init</sub>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are two parts to this article. One experimental part and one computational modelling part. My opinion of the experimental part is that it is very carefully done with impressive, compelling (and difficult!) experiments. The results are at first glance extremely perplexing, but the interpretation and follow-up experiments are clarifying a lot. In this respect, the manuscript is much improved over the biorxiv version I had read a year ago. My only note on the experimental part is that the p-value threshold for Figure 4 C and F used for denoting might have a bit of a higher rate of false positive because every time point would be considered as a comparison. This would be correctable by Bonferroni factors, but honestly, I don't think it is entirely necessary since there is a bit of ambiguity as to what hypothesis is being tested.</p><p>The computational part is compelling for the success of reproducing the data with a model that is intrinsically stable. I think the writing could be improved without too much work, focusing on two points.</p><p>The theory section was going deep in the implementation details. A level of depth that is uncommon for the main results part of a broad audience paper. I would suggest keeping the learning rule and maybe one or two crucial equations, but relegating many of the equations to the methods. For instance the linear ODE for the traces are so common that defining trace as a linear ODE or mono-exponential decay would be sufficient (if the equation remains in methods). Similar for the integration of the dW/dt over a trial. I want to stress that this is a stylistic point that I believe will help communicate the message, not something required for accepting the paper. Another stylistic point is the use of two-letter variables along with two conventions for multiplications (the Asterix and nothing as when tau multiples d λ /dt). I was also confused by the use of W<sub>init</sub> in Equation 3, which in my view should be W (no init) all the time.</p><p>The results rely crucially less of the fact that q<sup>+</sup> and q<sup>-</sup> are nonlinear than on the fact that the nonlinearities are different. This should be clear from the fixed point analysis: consider Equation 8 with q<sup>+</sup>=q<sup>-</sup> and you find that the fixed point is independent of timing even for nonlinear relationships. This can also be revealed when looking at the parameter values: the LTP term has a sigmoid with a small sensitivity (β<sup>+</sup>), a large threshold (α<sup>+</sup>) and a large saturating point (k<sup>+</sup>). The converse is true for the LTD term. Thus plotting the sigmoidal for each term should explain the Mexican hat: for a strong W, when the coincidence is very small, you only may only have a weak q<sup>+</sup> effect (because the sensitivity difference). When the coincidence is medium, LTD dominates over LTP because q<sup>-</sup> sharp threshold has been met without having reached the saturation of q<sup>+</sup>. When coincidence is strong q<sup>+</sup> dominates because k<sup>+</sup> is larger than k<sup>-</sup> (and both sigmoids have saturated). All this depends on W of course. Personally, I would have liked to see q<sup>+</sup> and q<sup>-</sup> plotted, and how they combine to give the Mexican hat (or not). As in Figure 5B but showing q<sup>+</sup> and q<sup>-</sup> in addition. With respect to Figure 5B, the absence of potentiation at high coincidence IS*ET for the high W case is puzzling. Why is this not showing? W is not high enough? q<sup>+</sup> should dominate in that regime.</p><p>Other notes. These are more comments which may or may not help rather than points to be addressed.</p><p>I would like to point that the plasticity model fits partially well with the model used in the recent paper by Payeur et al. 2021. In that paper, the bursts caused a potentiation that depended on previous potentiation (dependency on W). But that model had a very limited timing dependence and bursts would only lead to net LTD if they were not numerous enough relative to the number of spikes. Overall, a comparison with this model suggests that the BTSP model provided by Milstein et al. could be consistent with a coordination of plasticity, as acknowledged by the authors at the end of the discussion.</p><p>The model is also partially related with the model of Graupner,.… Brunel. Recently used to capture STDP phenomena by Aljadeff… Debanne. There, two threshold are present, one for LTP and one for LTD. So similar to the α<sup>+</sup> and α<sup>-</sup> being different. But the dependence in that model is very limited.</p><p>I thought the description of how W was kept between 1 and W<sub>max</sub> was lacking. There are multiple ways of doing this. And the different types of implementation (hard threshold vs soft threshold) have been shown to lead to dramatically different functions in the STDP modelling literature.</p><p>I think there is a typo in the list of parameters given at the end as I don't find τ<sub>IS</sub> and τ<sub>ET</sub>, but only τ<sub>I</sub> and τ<sub>E</sub>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper is beautifully done and well written. I have just a few suggestions:</p><p>1) It seems a pity that after elegantly formulating a model of BTSP, the authors final formulation of the synaptic change in Equations 3 and 4 is ill-defined. This is because the relationship between W and W<sub>init</sub> is not specified. Wouldn't a proper formulation state that W<sub>init</sub> = W, equation 3 does not describe dW/dt but rather a factor that determines ΔW through Equation 4, and that this latter process only takes place after a delay?</p><p>Alternatively, could W<sub>init</sub> in the equation for dW/dt just be set to W? This would have the nice property of keeping W bounded between 0 and W<sub>max</sub>. Does this not work?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73046.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers unanimously expressed their support for this manuscript.

However, the hypothesis was that voltage-perturbations would change the sign of plasticity. Overall, hyperpolarization did not convert depression into potentiation, and depolarization did not convert potentiation into depression. Here we label temporal bins that showed a significant change in the amplitude (but not the direction) of plasticity. A high discovery rate is actually conservative in this case. We prefer to leave this analysis as such.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The computational part is compelling for the success of reproducing the data with a model that is intrinsically stable.

I want to stress that this is a stylistic point that I believe will help communicate the message, not something required for accepting the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The recommended changes have been made (P15 – P16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another stylistic point is the use of two-letter variables along with two conventions for multiplications (the Asterix and nothing as when tau multiples d λ /dt). I was also confused by the use of W<sub>init</sub> in Equation 3, which in my view should be W (no init) all the time.</p></disp-quote><p>The recommended changes have been made (P16, L392). Please also see our response to the comments of Reviewer #3 below regarding the use of W<sub>init</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results rely crucially less of the fact that q<sup>+</sup> and q<sup>-</sup> are nonlinear than on the fact that the nonlinearities are different. This should be clear from the fixed point analysis: consider Equation 8 with q<sup>+</sup>=q<sup>-</sup> and you find that the fixed point is independent of timing even for nonlinear relationships. This can also be revealed when looking at the parameter values: the LTP term has a sigmoid with a small sensitivity (β<sup>+</sup>), a large threshold (α<sup>+</sup>) and a large saturating point (k<sup>+</sup>). The converse is true for the LTD term. Thus plotting the sigmoidal for each term should explain the Mexican hat: for a strong W, when the coincidence is very small, you only may only have a weak q<sup>+</sup> effect (because the sensitivity difference). When the coincidence is medium, LTD dominates over LTP because q<sup>-</sup> sharp threshold has been met without having reached the saturation of q<sup>+</sup>. When coincidence is strong q<sup>+</sup> dominates because k<sup>+</sup> is larger than k<sup>-</sup> (and both sigmoids have saturated). All this depends on W of course. Personally, I would have liked to see q<sup>+</sup> and q<sup>-</sup> plotted, and how they combine to give the Mexican hat (or not).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now added to Figure 5B a third example of dW/dt for intermediate synaptic weights which shows a Mexican hat sensitivity to signal overlap. We have now also added the following text to the Results section:</p><p>P16, L405: “If the depression process q<sup>-</sup> has a lower threshold for activation than the potentiation process q<sup>+</sup> (<italic>61, 62</italic>), the resulting change in synaptic weight dW/dt is positive and increases monotonically when initial weights are low, but is negative and non-monotonic when initial weights are high (Figure 5B). […] This is consistent with the in vivo data, which showed that negative changes in place field ramp <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> were largest at intermediate delays from a plateau (Figures 3B and 3I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As in Figure 5B but showing q<sup>+</sup> and q<sup>-</sup> in addition. With respect to Figure 5B, the absence of potentiation at high coincidence IS*ET for the high W case is puzzling. Why is this not showing? W is not high enough? q<sup>+</sup> should dominate in that regime.</p></disp-quote><p>Consulting Equation 1 (P16, L392), when W is large and close to W<sub>max</sub>, the potentiation term vanishes, and there can be no potentiation, only depression, regardless of the amplitude of signal overlap. We now clarify this point with the following text:</p><p>P16, L394: “This formula can be obtained from a two-state model of finite synaptic resources (see Materials and methods). When the current synaptic weight W is near W<sub>max</sub>, the potentiation rate becomes zero, and when W is near zero, the depression rate becomes zero.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other notes. These are more comments which may or may not help rather than points to be addressed.</p><p>I would like to point that the plasticity model fits partially well with the model used in the recent paper by Payeur et al. 2021. In that paper, the bursts caused a potentiation that depended on previous potentiation (dependency on W). But that model had a very limited timing dependence and bursts would only lead to net LTD if they were not numerous enough relative to the number of spikes. Overall, a comparison with this model suggests that the BTSP model provided by Milstein et al. could be consistent with a coordination of plasticity, as acknowledged by the authors at the end of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We had cited Payeur et al., in the context of implications for artificial learning systems. We have now added a citation in the context of objective-based learning through mismatch of local circuit output and target information relayed by long-range feedback (P24, L634). We agree that comparing and contrasting these models in detail would be very interesting, but perhaps a more appropriate place for this would be in a follow-up review article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model is also partially related with the model of Graupner,.… Brunel.

I have just a few suggestions:</p><p>1) It seems a pity that after elegantly formulating a model of BTSP, the authors final formulation of the synaptic change in Equations 3 and 4 is ill-defined. This is because the relationship between W and W<sub>init</sub> is not specified. Wouldn't a proper formulation state that W<sub>init</sub> = W, Equation 3 does not describe dW/dt but rather a factor that determines ΔW through Equation 4, and that this latter process only takes place after a delay?</p><p>Alternatively, could W<sub>init</sub> in the equation for dW/dt just be set to W? This would have the nice property of keeping W bounded between 0 and W<sub>max</sub>. Does this not work?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in the two-state finite resource model that we had in mind, W is updated continuously in real-time, and is naturally bounded between 0 and W<sub>max</sub>. In practice, for simplicity and efficiency of computation during parameter optimization, we updated W only once per lap. We agree with the Reviewer that presenting the model in the context of this numerical approximation diluted the message. We have revised the Results section accordingly and have removed all instances of W<sub>init</sub>. Figure 5 has been updated to show results obtained by updating W continuously. No change in parameters were necessary. We also regenerated Figure 6, keeping parameter values the same, but updating W continuously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). They are equivalent to those results obtained with the approximate method in the original Figure 6, which validates the original approach. As such, we have chosen not to regenerate or replace Figures 6, 7, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2, or Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73046-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>We have also added the following text to the Materials and methods:P32, L862: “Changes in synaptic weight Wi were calculated by integrating the net rate of change of synaptic weight dWi/dt over the duration of plasticity induction.
