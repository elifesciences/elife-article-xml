In young adults, multiple overlapping spatial modes along its longitudinal and transverse axes describe the organization of its functional integration with neocortex, extending the traditional framework emphasizing functional differences between sharply segregated hippocampal subregions. Yet, it remains unknown whether these modes (i.e. gradients) persist across the adult human lifespan, and relate to memory and molecular markers associated with brain function and cognition. In two independent samples, we demonstrate that the principal anteroposterior and second-order, mid-to-anterior/posterior hippocampal modes of neocortical functional connectivity, representing distinct dimensions of macroscale cortical organization, manifest across the adult lifespan. Specifically, individual differences in topography of the second-order gradient predicted episodic memory and mirrored dopamine D1 receptor distribution, capturing shared functional and molecular organization. Older age was associated with less distinct transitions along gradients (i.e. increased functional homogeneity). Importantly, a youth-like gradient profile predicted preserved episodic memory – emphasizing age-related gradient dedifferentiation as a marker of cognitive decline. Our results underscore a critical role of mapping multidimensional hippocampal organization in understanding the neural circuits that support memory across the adult lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-01936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salami</surname><given-names>Alireza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004472</institution-id><institution>Riksbankens Jubileumsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20-0515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salami</surname><given-names>Alireza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellow grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salami</surname><given-names>Alireza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StratNeuro</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salami</surname><given-names>Alireza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nyberg</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multimodal imaging reveals overlapping gradients of hippocampal connectivity reflecting patterns of cortical function, dopamine receptor distribution, and individual differences in memory, with age-related dedifferentiation of gradient organization marking cognitive decline.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus plays a critical role in human behavior beyond its well-established involvement in memory and spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laurita and Spreng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moscovitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nadel and Peterson, 2013</xref>). Contemporary views hold that its broad involvement in cognition emerges through the combination of its intrinsic circuitry and its widespread neocortical connections – placing it at the interface of multiple behavioral systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moscovitch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>). Characterizing organizational principles of hippocampal integration with the larger neocortical landscape is therefore key to our understanding of its contribution to cognition and to the many diseases associated with its dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barnes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell and Macqueen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harrison, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xie et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral and Witter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Witter and Amaral, 2021</xref>), together with histological and functional descriptions in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amunts et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Libby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Plachti et al., 2019</xref>), emphasize the hippocampus transverse (mediolateral) and longitudinal (anteroposterior) axes in determining its functional organization, contribution to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grady, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poppenk et al., 2013</xref>), and vulnerability to neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lladó et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Small et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, functional analogues of the hippocampus canonical internal circuitry and its anatomical connections with neocortical areas have successfully been provided by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Libby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalton et al., 2019</xref>), at a coarse scale confirming the anteroposterior differentiation in connectivity observed in the animal literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral and Witter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strange et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the consistency by which this anteroposterior organizational dimension emerges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genon et al., 2021</xref>), significant questions however remain regarding its spatial distribution across cortex and its contribution to behavior across the adult human lifespan.</p><p>Lack of consensus is especially evident in terms of the hippocampus functional connectivity with the default-mode network (DMN), encompassing core areas of the brain’s system for memory-guided behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spreng et al., 2009</xref>). Several studies primarily attribute integration with the DMN to the posterior hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ranganath and Ritchey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Libby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poppenk and Moscovitch, 2011</xref>), consistent with its anatomical connections to midline posterior parietal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton, 2012</xref>). Other sources emphasize the anterior hippocampus as driving connectivity with the DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blessing et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chase et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>), on the basis of its anatomical connections with ventromedial prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggleton, 2012</xref>). These inconsistencies ultimately limit our understanding of hippocampal functional specialization, and the impact on cognition of the heterogeneous vulnerability to aging and disease observed along the hippocampus longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Small et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langnes et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that inconsistencies in part stem from overlooking multiple overlapping and complementary functional modes, not discernable through traditional parcellation-based approaches, which assume homogeneous function within distinct, pre-defined, portions of the hippocampus.</p><p>Accumulating evidence in young adults indicate that hippocampal neocortical connectivity is indeed fundamentally multidimensional – organized in several overlapping, but distinct, spatial modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vos de Wael et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas such gradient-based observations describe a principal anteroposterior mode of neocortical connectivity, they also identify orthogonal modes of long-axis and transverse variation in connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vos de Wael et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, these hippocampal gradients appear to reflect well-known gradients of macroscale brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>), which express functional differentiation across distinct cortical hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). The principal anteroposterior gradient has been linked to functional differentiation along a task-negative/task-positive cortical dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox et al., 2005</xref>), separating neural communities involved in the formation of representations from sensory input (e.g. visual, somatosensory, and DMN areas) and those involved in the modulation of these representations (e.g. frontoparietal areas of attention and control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel, a secondary, nonlinear, long-axis gradient is suggested to correspond to the principal unimodal-transmodal gradient of cortical function (oppositely anchored in associative DMN areas and in unimodal sensory and motor cortices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>]). However, the biological underpinnings of this secondary gradient remain still unknown, in contrast to the principal gradient, demonstrated also in microstructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adnan et al., 2016</xref>), gray matter covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Plachti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ge et al., 2019</xref>), and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vogel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Differences in the topography (i.e. the spatial layout) of the principal, anteroposterior, hippocampal gradient may predict episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>), but current findings are restricted to younger age – and to mainly the same sample (i.e. the Human Connectome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vos de Wael et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>]). Moreover, it remains unknown in which capacity the secondary long-axis gradient contributes to behavior. Yet, a comprehensive model of the spatial properties of hippocampal functional organization should consider that hippocampal functional alterations occur across the adult lifespan and manifest across the hippocampus in a heterogeneous manner. Specifically, aging has been linked to differential functional isolation of anterior and posterior hippocampal regions from prefrontal areas and large-scale brain networks including the DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Damoiseaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Salami et al., 2016</xref>).

Connectopic mapping was used to extract the dominant modes of functional cortical connectivity within the hippocampus based on nonlinear manifold learning (Laplacian eigenmaps) applied to a similarity matrix derived from connectivity fingerprints computed between each hippocampal voxel and each voxel within neocortex. This identified a set of orthogonal connectopic maps (i.e. eigenvectors) describing overlapping connectivity topographies (i.e. gradients) within the hippocampus. Gradients were computed at subject level and at group level across the sample, separately for the left and right hippocampus. We analyzed the first three gradients, together explaining 63% and 71% of the variance in left and right hemispheres, respectively.

This pattern was most pronounced in the anterior hippocampus. Inspecting G3 across sample-specific segmentations of cornu ammonis (CA1–3), dentate gyrus (DG/CA4), and subiculum subfields suggested that while CA1–3 expressed the full extent of the gradient, and DG/CA4 variation around its center, the subiculum expressed only the most inferior section of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Topographic gradients of hippocampal cortical connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The first three hippocampal connectopic maps (G1–G3), explaining 67% of the variance across left and right hemispheres.

Results are reported with p-values at an uncorrected statistical threshold and p-values after adjustment for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate (FDR).

Our findings reveal the presence of two distinct connectivity gradients distributed along the hippocampus longitudinal axis which contribute to episodic memory function across the lifespan. These observations underscore the importance of disentangling multiple dimensions of hippocampal functional organization in advancing our understanding of cortico-hippocampal systems for memory-related behavior. Moreover, we demonstrate in two independent samples that maintaining a youth-like gradient profile in older age – characterized by preserved distinctiveness of connectivity change along gradients – supports mnemonic functioning, and that increased homogeneity of gradient topography may precede gray matter atrophy.</p><p>Despite converging evidence in young adults indicating multiple overlapping modes of functional connectivity across the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vos de Wael et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tian et al., 2020</xref>), significant questions have remained regarding their spatial distribution across cortex and their role in behavior. Here, connectopic mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haak et al., 2018b</xref>) identified a principal anteroposterior gradient (G1); a second-order gradient of mid-to-anterior/posterior long-axis variation (G2); and a third-order gradient conveying variation across the hippocampus transverse axis (G3). Although we restrict our discussion of G3 given its low proportion of explained variance, we note that it mirrors patterns previously observed in both structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Plachti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Katsumi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thorp et al., 2022</xref>). Consistently, cortical patterns of G3 matched cortical connectivity profiles previously reported for hippocampal subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vos de Wael et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Flores et al., 2017</xref>). Our results confirm that functional data favors detection of anteroposterior hippocampal organization in contrast to that determined by its cytoarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genon et al., 2021</xref>), but indicate that higher-order connectivity modes may indeed carry coarse-scale information about subfield-determined organization. Greater anatomical specificity, with more precise characterization of connectivity in relation to subfield boundaries while minimizing effects of interindividual differences in hippocampal shape and folding, might be achieved by adopting techniques implementing a geodesic coordinate system to represent effects within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeKraker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paquola et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The general organization of neocortical connectivity within the hippocampus showed stability across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), although clear effects of age were evident in the fine-scale topography of connectivity modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Older age was associated with less distinct transitions in connectivity along G1 and G2, an effect that was exacerbated in a subgroup of older adults exhibiting an aged gradient profile – separated from older adults exhibiting youth-like gradient topography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This finding constitutes an important addition to evidence highlighting increased homogeneity in hippocampal function in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stark et al., 2021</xref>). Current theories view this loss of specificity as a consequence of its functional isolation from neocortical areas, possibly linked to tau-driven degeneration of the perforant pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hyman et al., 1984</xref>). Age-related deterioration of this entorhinal-hippocampal pathway has in turn been linked to impaired mnemonic functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yassa et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, older individuals exhibiting dedifferentiated gradient topography, but comparable hippocampal volumes, displayed less efficient episodic memory compared to older adults maintaining youth-like gradient topography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). This underscores the potential of gradient-based techniques to capture behaviorally relevant alterations in hippocampal function at a stage preceding structural decline.</p><p>Testing the correspondence across cortex of G1 and G2 to canonical gradients of cortical function provided support for G1 reflecting differentiation along a representation-modulation dimension (e.g. task-negative/task-positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox et al., 2005</xref>]; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>)), separating frontoparietal areas of attention and control from sensorimotor and DMN areas. Consistent with age-related loss of segregation between task-positive and task-negative poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grady et al., 2016</xref>), also evident in numerous diseases involving hippocampal dysfunction (e.g. depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mulders et al., 2015</xref>]), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2009</xref>, and AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weiler et al., 2017</xref>), we observed altered cortical organization of G1 in both older subgroups. A main difference between subgroups, however, included a unimodal-transmodal organization instead emerging in youth-like older adults, whereas not in the aged subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A meaningful role of this potential reorganization was indicated by an association between G1 topography and memory in the youth-like older adults only. In terms of G2, we provide support of its characterization as a local representation of the principal unimodal-transmodal cortical gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), widely demonstrated across functional, structural, and molecular modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hansen et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, our observations support a framework of cortico-hippocampal integration in which the DMN is positioned in different neural contexts: in one case at the opposite end from frontoparietal networks of attention and control, and in the other, opposite to sensorimotor and visual networks – indicating that an account of the hippocampus functional connectivity with the DMN is dependent on multiple neurofunctional hierarchies. The overlap of G1 and G2 may potentially reflect the superimposition of gradients and hubs of long-axis anatomical connections indicated in both the human and animal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strange et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalton et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the observation that macroscale relationships between distinct cortical systems are mapped out by G1 and G2 in this manner may reflect the hippocampus primordial position in the laminar development of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goulas et al., 2019</xref>), supporting the idea that hippocampal function stands, from a phylogenetic perspective, to inform general principles of brain organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genon et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We discovered that G2, specifically, manifested organizational principles shared among function, behavior, and neuromodulation. Meta-analytical decoding reproduced a unimodal-associative axis across G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and analyses in relation to the distribution of D1DRs – which vary across cortex along a unimodal-transmodal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Froudist-Walsh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pedersen et al., 2023a</xref>) – demonstrated topographic correspondence both at the level of individual differences and across the group. It should, however, be acknowledged that PET imaging in the hippocampus is associated with resolution-related limitations, although previous research indicates high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET to quantify D1DR availability in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaller et al., 2017</xref>). As such, mapping the distribution of hippocampal D1DRs at a fine spatial scale remains challenging, and replication of our results in terms of overlap with G2 is needed in independent samples. Here, we evaluated the observed spatial overlap between G2 topography and D1DRs across multiple TSM orders, showing correspondence between modalities from simple to more complex parameterizations of their spatial properties. Topographic correspondence was additionally observed between G2 and other DA markers from independent datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that G2 may constitute a mode reflecting a dopaminergic phenotype, which contributes to the currently limited understanding of its biological underpinnings.</p><p>Results linked both G1 and G2 to episodic memory, suggesting complimentary contributions of these two overlapping long-axis modes. Considered together, analyses in the main and replication datasets indicated a role of G2 topography in memory across the adult lifespan, independent of age. A similar association with G1 was only evident across the entire sample in the replication dataset, whereas results in the main sample seemed to emphasize a role of youth-like G1 topography in memory performance. In line with previous research, memory was successfully predicted by G1 topography in young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>) and similarly predicted by G1 in older adults exhibiting a youth-like functional profile.</p><p>It is noteworthy that meta-analytical decoding of G2 primarily linked the unimodal connectivity patterns of anterior and posterior subregions to terms of episodic memory, encoding, and navigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). G2’s role in memory might as such be considered in light of hippocampal integration with the visual system, by which it contributes to complex perceptual processes supporting memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turk-Browne, 2019</xref>). In humans, there is evidence of direct hippocampal connections to early visual areas, with recent tractography-based work demonstrating connectivity as primarily localized to the posterior hippocampus and to a smaller region in the anterior hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalton et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The verbal nature of our memory tasks likely contributed to the left-lateralization of effects, yet, predominant left-hemisphere vulnerability to aging and age-related pathology should not be ruled out as a meaningful contributor to these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Minkova et al., 2017</xref>). Average hippocampal D1DR availability did not differ between older subgroups, but a tendency toward youth-like and aged functional profiles being mirrored in D1DR topography was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, longitudinal data is ultimately required to inform the underlying mechanisms of individual differences in hippocampal gradient topography in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nyberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies should, furthermore, assess gradients’ modulation by behavioral conditions and extend these methods to clinical samples characterized by hippocampal dysfunction.</p><p>This study establishes behavioral relevance of two overlapping long-axis modes of hippocampal-neocortical functional connectivity, shedding light on their age-related dedifferentiation, and its impact on cognition.

On average, the relative RMS difference in motion across the sample was 0.090 (±0.063), and the mean FD was 0.164 (±0.104).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>DA D1 receptor availability</title><p>Preprocessing of PET data was performed in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>). BP relative to non-displaceable binding in a reference region (BP<sub>ND</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Innis et al., 2007</xref>) was used as an estimate of receptor availability (i.e. D1DR) in the hippocampus, for each participant defined using the FreeSurfer segmentation of their anatomical images. Cerebellum was used as reference region. PET images were corrected for head movement by using frame-to-frame image co-registration and co-registered with T1-weighted MRI images with re-slicing to T1 voxel size. The simplified reference-tissue model was used to model regional time-activity course (TAC) data. Regional TAC data were adjusted for partial volume effects by using the symmetric geometric transfer matrix method implemented in FreeSurfer and an estimated point spread function of 2.5 mm FWHM. We additionally used data from a publicly available database of group-averaged volumetric maps of molecular target distributions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/netneurolab/hansen_receptors">https://github.com/netneurolab/hansen_receptors</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen, 2022</xref>). Specifically, we downloaded previously published maps of DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dukart et al., 2018</xref>) and FDOPA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spmtemplates">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/spmtemplates</ext-link>) to investigate the spatial correspondence between functional gradients and dopaminergic target distributions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mapping gradients of functional connectivity</title><p>Connectopic mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haak et al., 2018b</xref>) was run through the ConGrads toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haak et al., 2018b</xref>) implemented in FSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). Mapping was conducted on both subject level and group level, for the left and right hippocampus separately, and involved two main steps. First, for every hippocampal voxel, connectivity fingerprints were computed as the Pearson correlation between the voxel-wise time series and a singular-value decomposition representation of all cortical voxels. In a second step, nonlinear manifold learning (Laplacian eigenmaps) was applied to a matrix expressing the degree of similarity between the voxel-wise fingerprints. This yields eigenvectors, so called connectopic maps, representing modes of functional connectivity (i.e. functional gradients). Each connectopic map is then projected onto cortex, for which each vertex is color coded according to the voxel in the hippocampus it correlates the most with. Since connectopic mapping at group level involves applying Laplacian eigenmaps to a group-average similarity matrix, group-level mapping across the sample was conducted using the hippocampal and cortical masks derived from the FreeSurfer segmentation of a sample-mean structural image. Mapping was specified to compute 20 gradients, and a subsequent scree plot over explained variance indicated meaningful contributions of the first three connectopic maps, together explaining 67% of the variance across hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Stability of functional gradients across levels of spatial smoothing</title><p>It has recently been suggested that the reliability of connectopic mapping to detect meaningful gradients of resting-state functional connectivity may be limited due to spatial smoothing implemented during preprocessing of fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watson and Andrews, 2023</xref>). To determine the stability of our hippocampal gradients, we conducted a series of control analyses across varying levels of smoothing, and in contrast to connectopic maps derived through connectopic mapping on random data. These analyses are presented in Appendix 1 and confirmed high stability of resting-state gradients and their ability to capture interindividual differences, whereas random data failed to produce meaningful gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Alignment of connectopic maps across participants</title><p>To ensure optimal alignment of identified connectopic maps across participants, we employed Procrustes alignment, based on voxel-wise correlations, to order subject-level connectopic maps according to their correspondence with a set of reference maps (i.e. gradients computed at group level across the full sample). Moreover, whereas the sign of connectopic maps is arbitrary, differences therein have an impact on the spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of gradients, derived through TSM in a later step. As such, the sign of subject-level connectopic maps showing negative correlations with the corresponding group-level reference map were inversed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Trend surface modeling</title><p>Using spatial statistics, the topography of a connectopic map can be represented by a small number of spatial model parameters. This parameterization enables analyses of interindividual differences and is achieved through TSM, implemented in a third step of the ConGrads analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haak et al., 2018b</xref>). In this step, the spatial pattern of each subject-level connectopic map is approximated by estimating a spatial statistical model. Model estimation involves fitting a set of polynomial basis functions along canonical axes of the connectopic map. In MNI space, this entails estimation along x, y, and z axes of the hippocampus. Thus, fitting a polynomial of degree 1 yields three TSM parameters (x, y, z), with any increase in model order corresponding to an increase in number of parameters (e.g. six parameters for the second model order: x, y, z, x<sup>2</sup>, y<sup>2</sup>, z<sup>2</sup>; nine parameters for the third model order, etc.). TSMs are fitted with an increasing polynomial degree using Bayesian linear regression, which provides likelihood estimates that can be used for subsequent model selection. Here, model selection was based on three information sources: (i) the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) across subjects for models estimated at orders 1–10; (ii) the % explained variance in connectopic maps by each model; and (iii) visual inspection of group-level gradients reconstructed from TSM parameters at different model orders. The purpose of using multiple information sources, as opposed to simply BIC, was to find a trade-off between high-quality reconstructions of gradients by TSMs, while keeping the number of model parameters sufficiently low for multivariate statistical analyses. A model order of 3 (=9 TSM parameters) was selected for G1, whereas a model order of 4 (=12 TSM parameters) was selected for G2 and G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Each gradient’s set of TSM parameters were then used as either dependent or independent variables in multivariate GLMs investigating links between gradient topography and variables such as age, episodic memory performance, and D1DR distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Transitions in connectivity as a function of the hippocampal longitudinal axis</title><p>To visualize the orthogonal patterns of change in connectivity conveyed by each gradient and to aid in the interpretation of age effects, we divided each subject-level connectopic map into 23 bins of ~2 mm along the hippocampus anterior-posterior axis and estimated the average gradient value (ranging from 0 to 1) for each bin. Plotting the values of each bin against their distance in mm from the most anterior voxel in the hippocampus as such demonstrates the pattern of change in connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Przeździk et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Cortical projections and correlations with gradients of cortical function</title><p>In ConGrads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haak et al., 2018b</xref>), cortical mapping is computed independently for each gradient based on the regression equation: pmap = <bold>B</bold><sup><bold>T</bold></sup>.(<bold>X</bold><sup><bold>T</bold>–1</sup>.<bold>A</bold><sup><bold>T</bold></sup>)<sup>T</sup>, where A corresponds to data inside (i.e. hippocampus) and B to data outside (i.e. cortical) the ROI, and X-1 is the pseudo-inverse of the corresponding eigenvector (stacked with a row of ones). For each hippocampal gradient, the volumetric MNI-registered group-level cortical projection map was resampled to the Human Connectome Project 32k_LR midthickness surface mesh, using the volume-to-surface algorithm with enclosing mapping available in Connectome Workbench v.1.5.0. Spearman correlations were computed between the cortical projection of each hippocampal gradient and the three gradients previously established as the main axes of cortical functional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). To reduce the degree of freedom, each surface projection was resampled by 1000-cortical parcels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). Statistical significance of correlations was assessed by spin-test permutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018</xref>), randomly rotating a spherical projection of the cortical maps 1000 times, with two-tailed statistical significance determined at a 95% confidence level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Mapping behavioral transitions along gradients using Neurosynth</title><p>Transitions in behavioral domains were mapped onto G1 and G2 using meta-analytical decoding in Neurosynth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). We assessed two sets of behavioral terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the first was a selection of terms commonly linked to anteroposterior hippocampal functional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Plachti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grady, 2020</xref>), and the second a selection of terms based on a previous report demonstrating behavioral transitions along a unimodal-transmodal cortical axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). For correspondence with meta-analytical maps, we created region of interest masks by projecting the cortical surface of each gradient to the 2 mm volumetric MNI152 standard space. These volumetric images were then divided into five 25 percentile bins and binarized. The resulting images were used as input to the Neurosynth decoder, yielding an r statistic associated with each behavioral term per section of each gradient.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was approved by the Regional Ethical board and the local Radiation Safety Committee in Umeå, Sweden (approval number 2017/248-31).

Benefits of smoothing include enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and reducing effects of anatomical variability between subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Molloy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, smoothing is associated with greater spatial autocorrelation. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watson and Andrews, 2023</xref>, suggested that spatial autocorrelation induced by smoothing during preprocessing is sufficient for detecting functional gradients through connectopic mapping, even in artificially generated random fMRI time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watson and Andrews, 2023</xref>). To determine the stability of our hippocampal gradients, in light of smoothing as a potential confound, we ran connectopic mapping on both true and random data at varying levels of spatial smoothing (i.e. no smoothing, 0.5 mm and 6.0 mm).</p><p>Random fMRI data were generated according to the methods specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Watson and Andrews, 2023</xref>. Briefly, we synthesized Gaussian white noise matched in mean and variance to the real fMRI data in native space. The random time series therefore approximate the signal amplitude and variation of the true data, without a coherent spatial or temporal correlation structure. The random fMRI data were then normalized to MNI space with varying levels of smoothing. Normalization for both true and random data was performed using DARTEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashburner, 2007</xref>) implemented in SPM12. This method projects the location of voxels to a template, effectively preserving the tissue count, but is known to introduce aliasing artifacts if the original data is at a similar or lower resolution than the deformation fields. The effects of aliasing artifacts are typically minimized by smoothing the data during the normalization procedure. For non-smoothed data, missing voxels along the X and Y dimensions were replaced by interpolating neighboring voxels along the Z dimension. This effectively removes aliasing artifacts by resampling a single voxel along the projected dimension, avoiding spurious autocorrelations otherwise produced by smoothing.</p><p>Our results support the detection of expected hippocampal gradients in true data independent of smoothing degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4A and B</xref>). Age-related variance was captured in both left and right G1 at all levels of smoothing, whereas additionally visible across G2 and G3 from a minimum level of 0.5 mm smoothing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, cmaps derived from random data showed poor consistency with expected gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4B</xref>) and could not capture individual differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4C</xref>). In sum, the hippocampal gradients in our work are highly stable in their spatial layout, and in their ability to capture interindividual differences, across levels of spatial smoothing. Observations in random data indicate that spatial smoothing is not sufficient to produce meaningful gradients of functional variance in the hippocampus.</p><fig id="app1fig4" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 4.</label><caption><title>Connectopic mapping on true and random data at varying levels of spatial smoothing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) G1 (left panel) and G2 (right panel) connectopic maps derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data after different degrees of spatial smoothing.

We address each of the Reviewer’s comments below, and outline the revisions we have made to the manuscript based on the Reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The reported D1 associations appear a bit post-hoc in the current work and I was unclear why the authors specifically focussed on dopamine here, as other transmitter systems are similar present at the level of the hippocampus and implicated in aging.</p></disp-quote><p>Other neurotransmitter systems may indeed be relevant in the context of hippocampal function in aging. In this study, however, we included a specific research question about the DA D1 receptor (D1DR) based on previous research (1) emphasizing the role of DA neuromodulation in maintaining functional network segregation in aging to support cognition (Pedersen et al., 2023), (2) reporting heterogeneous distribution of DA markers across the hippocampus, supporting efficient modulation of distinct behaviors (Dubovyk &amp; ManahanVaughan, 2019; Edelmann &amp; Lessmann, 2018; Gasbarri et al., 1994; Kempadoo et al., 2016), and (3) demonstrating the spatial distribution of D1DRs as varying across neocortex along a unimodal-transmodal gradient (Pedersen et al., 2024). To which degree this variation might be reflected in cortico-hippocampal connectivity, however, remained to be investigated. As such, one of the study’s specific aims was to evaluate the spatial distribution of D1DRs as a molecular correlate of the hippocampus’ functional organization. Importantly, we were interested in mapping associations between individual differences in the organization of connectivity and D1DRs. This was uniquely enabled by utilizing the DyNAMiC sample, as it includes structural and functional MRI data in combination with D1DR PET in the same individuals across the adult lifespan (n=180). However, after observing significant spatial correspondence between functional organization and D1DR expressed by the second hippocampal gradient (G2), we did indeed perform complimentary analyses with group-averaged data of additional dopamine markers (D2DR from a subsample of our participants, as well as DAT and FDOPA from open sources) to test the generalizability of the original finding. Taken together, the original analyses based on subject-level data and complimentary group-level analyses provided support for the interpretation of G2 as a dopaminergic mode.</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to clarify the focus on the D1 receptor and the contribution of including additional DA markers.</p><p>Updated paragraph in the Introduction, pages 5-6:</p><p>“Dopamine (DA) is one of the most important modulators of hippocampus-dependent function(47,48), and influences the brain’s functional architecture through enhancing specificity of neuronal signaling(49). Consistently, there is a DA-dependent aspect of maintained functional network segregation in aging which supports cognition(50). Animal models suggest heterogeneous patterns of DA innervation(51,52) and postsynaptic DA receptors(53), across both transverse and longitudinal hippocampal axes, likely allowing for separation between DA modulation of distinct hippocampus-dependent behaviors(47). Moreover, the human hippocampus has been linked to distinct DA circuits on the basis of long-axis variation in functional connectivity with midbrain and striatal regions(54,55). Taken together with recent findings revealing a unimodal-transmodal organization of the most abundantly expressed DA receptor subtype, D1 (D1DR), across cortex(56), we tested the hypothesis that the organization of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity partly reflects the underlying distribution of hippocampal DA receptors, predicting predominant spatial correspondence for any hippocampal gradient conveying a unimodal-transmodal pattern across cortex.”</p><p>Updated sections in the Results, page 13-14:</p><p>“Our next aim was to investigate to which extent the distribution of hippocampal DA D1 receptors (D1DRs), measured by [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET in the DyNAMiC(58) sample, may serve as a molecular correlate of the hippocampus’ functional organization.”</p><p>“Complimentary analyses were then conducted to further evaluate G2 as a dopaminergic hippocampal mode by utilizing additional DA markers at group-level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the authors may be aware that multiple PET tracers are somewhat challenged in the mesiotemporal region. Is this the case for the D1 receptor as well? The hippocampus is a small and complex structure, and PET more of a low res technique so one would want to highlight and discuss the limitations of the correlations with PET maps here and/or evaluate whether the analysis adds necessary findings to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. The lower resolution of PET is indeed a relevant aspect to consider when quantifying D1DR availability in the hippocampus, even though previous research indicate high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET measurement in this region (Kaller et al., 2017). We have now elaborated on PET limitations in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In our study, we made efforts to reduce potential partial volume effects (PVE) by correcting our PET data, and tested spatial associations between our functional gradients and D1DR maps using trend-surface modelling (TSM), rather than through voxel-wise comparisons. This allowed us to evaluate the spatial correspondence between functional connectivity and D1DRs at a level of spatial trends, estimated using TSM models computed at increasing levels of complexity. The results showed consistent spatial overlap between G2 and D1DRs across these models, that is, across spatial trends described at coarser-to-finer scales. Furthermore, this was replicated across several DA markers with PET and SPECT data from independent samples.</p><p>Taken together, we agree with the Reviewer that the spatial correspondence observed between G2 and hippocampal D1DRs should be interpreted in the context of resolution-related limitations inherent to PET imaging. However, we strongly believe that our DA analyses offer valuable insight to the molecular underpinnings of hippocampal functional organization.</p><p>Updated paragraph in the Discussion, pages 25-26:</p><p>“We discovered that G2, specifically, manifested organizational principles shared among function, behavior, and neuromodulation. Meta-analytical decoding reproduced a unimodalassociative axis across G2 (Figure 3B), and analyses in relation to the distribution of D1DRs – which vary across cortex along a unimodal-transmodal axis(76,77) – demonstrated topographic correspondence both at the level of individual differences and across the group. It should, however, be acknowledged that PET imaging in the hippocampus is associated with resolutionrelated limitations, although previous research indicate high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET to quantify D1DR availability in this region(78). As such, mapping the distribution of hippocampal D1DRs at a fine spatial scale remains challenging, and replication of our results in terms of overlap with G2 is needed in independent samples. Here, we evaluated the observed spatial overlap between G2 topography and D1DRs across multiple TSM model orders, showing correspondence between modalities from simple to more complex parameterizations of their spatial properties. Topographic correspondence was additionally observed between G2 and other DA markers from independent datasets (Figure 3B), suggesting that G2 may constitute a mode reflecting a dopaminergic phenotype, which contributes to the currently limited understanding of its biological underpinnings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From my (perhaps somewhat biased) perspective, it might be valuable to instead or in addition look at measures of hippocampal microstructure and how these relate to the functional aging effects. This could be done, if available, using data from the same subjects (eg based on quantitative MRI contrasts and/or structural MRI) and/or using contextualization findings as implemented in eg hippomaps.readthedocs.io</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. We performed additional analyses investigating the spatial overlap between our connectivity gradients and estimates of hippocampal microstructure, computed as the ratio of T1- over T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) images (Glasser &amp; Von Essen, 2011; vos de Wael et al., 2018). Analyses of spatial correspondence then followed the TSM-based method used to test the spatial overlap between functional connectivity gradients and D1DR distribution. Applying TSM to the T1w/T2w image computed for each participant yielded subject-level model parameters describing microstructure topography, which were then entered as predictors of connectivity topography in multivariate GLMs (separate models for each gradient and hemisphere, 6 models in total).</p><p>Analyses revealed that microstructure of the right hippocampus significantly predicted gradient topography of right-hemisphere G1 (F = 1.325, <italic>p</italic> = 0.034), while no other links between connectivity gradients and microstructure emerged as significant (F 0.930-1.184, <italic>ps</italic> 0.7060.079).</p><p>These results, suggesting an association along the anteroposterior axis, deviate from previous findings linking hippocampal microstructure to G3-like, medial-lateral, connectivity organization (vos de Wael et al., 2018). As we believe that comprehensive analyses of our gradients in relation to microstructure across the lifespan would be best addressed in future work, we have not included these analyses of microstructure in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Can the authors clarify why they did not replicate based on cohorts that are more widely used in the community and open access, such as CamCAN and/or HCP-Aging? It might connect their results with other studies if an attempt was made to also show that findings persist in either of these repositories.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that replication in samples such as CamCAN and/or HCP-Aging would provide valuable opportunities to connect our findings with those of other studies using those datasets. Here, we included the Betula dataset (Nilsson et al., 2004) as our replication sample, as it was immediately available to us, included a large sample of adults in a comparable age, and a word recall episodic memory task closely aligned with the one included in DyNAMiC. Importantly, leveraging the Betula dataset as our replication sample allows us to link our findings to a wide range of previous studies central to the understanding of neurocognitive aging in general, and hippocampal aging in particular (Nyberg, 2017; Nyberg et al., 2020). Betula is a large longitudinal project that has been tracking individuals since 1988, and is part of the National E-infrastructure for Aging Research (NEAR: www.near-aging.se), through which data from several Swedish studies are made available to both national and international researchers. While we acknowledge the value of extending replication efforts to datasets like CamCAN and HCP-Aging, we emphasize the significant contribution of having replicated our connectivity gradients in the Betula dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors applied TSM and related these parameters to topographic changes in the gradients. I was wondering whether and how such an approach controls for autocorrelation present in both the PET map and gradients. Could the authors clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer raises an important topic in spatial autocorrelation. The TSM approach used to parameterize the topography of the functional gradients and D1DR distribution, and to test the spatial correspondence between modalities, did not include any specific method to control for autocorrelation. Here, we highlight two aspects of our study in relation to this point. First, we demonstrated in the Supplementary information (S. Figure 4) that autocorrelation induced by spatial smoothing likely has limited effects on overall gradient topography and the ability of TSM parameters to capture meaningful inter-individual differences in terms of age. Second, in the case of spatial overlap effects being significantly impacted by autocorrelation, we would expect the association between right-hemisphere G2 and D1DR topography to similarly emerge for G2 in the left hemisphere. The absence of such an association may speak to a limited effect of spatial autocorrelation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The TSM approach quantifies the gradients in terms of x/y/z direction in a cartesian coordinate system. Wouldn't a shape intrinsic coordinate system in the hippocampus also be interesting, and perhaps even be more efficient to look at here (see eg DeKraker 2022 eLife or Paquola et al 2020 eLife)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very relevant question and we appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion. We recognize that there may be several benefits associated with adopting a shape-intrinsic coordinate system when characterizing effects in the hippocampus, given its curved/folded anatomy. Approaches like the ones adopted in DeKraker et al., 2022 and Paquola et al., 2020, utilizes geodesic coordinate frameworks to represent the hippocampus in surface space, enabling mapping of connectivity onto the hippocampal surface while respecting its inherent curvature and topology. We anticipate that quantifying gradients within such a framework would especially benefit identification of connectivity change across the hippocampal surface relative to reference points such as subfield boundaries, while minimizing effects of interindividual differences in hippocampal shape and folding. In our study, hippocampal gradients and their associated cortical patterns were computed in volumetric space, with TSM subsequently used to parameterize the change in connectivity along these gradients. This indeed yields a description of connectivity change within a coordinate system less specific to hippocampal anatomy, but may favor generalizability and integration with previous gradient findings within and beyond the hippocampus (e.g., Przeździk et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020; Katsumi et al., 2023; Navarro-Schröder et al., 2015), as well as connections with broader neuroimaging frameworks through techniques such as meta-analytical decoding. In our view, the different coordinate frameworks offer complimentary insight to hippocampal organization, and while we have opted to not undertake novel analyses to explore our gradients within a geodesic coordinate system for the purposes of this paper, we recognize the importance of such evaluation of our gradients in future analyses. We have made updates to the Discussion in the revised manuscript on this topic (pages 23-24):</p><p>“Greater anatomical specificity, with more precise characterization of connectivity in relation to subfield boundaries while minimizing effects of inter-individual differences in hippocampal shape and folding, might be achieved by adopting techniques implementing a geodesic coordinate system to represent effects within the hippocampus(68,69).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper derives the first three functional gradients in the left and right hippocampus across two datasets.

They investigated how individual variations in the detailed connectivity patterns within the hippocampus relate to behavioral and molecular traits. The findings confirm three overlapping hippocampal gradients and reveal that each is linked to established functional patterns in the cortex, the arrangement of dopamine receptors within the hippocampus, and differences in memory abilities among individuals. By employing multivariate data analysis techniques, they identified older adults who display a hippocampal gradient pattern resembling that of younger individuals and exhibit better memory performance compared to their age-matched peers. This underscores the behavioral importance of maintaining a specific functional organization within the hippocampus as people age.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The evidence supporting the conclusions is overall compelling, based on a unique dataset, rich set of carefully unpacked results, and an in-depth data analysis. Possible confounds are carefully considered and ruled out.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No major weaknesses. The transparency of the statistical analyses could be improved by explicitly (1) stating what tests and corrections (if any) were performed, and (2) justifying the elected statistical approaches. Further, some of the findings related to the DA markers are borderline statistically significant and therefore perhaps less compelling but they line up nicely with results obtained using experimental animals and I expect the small effect sizes to be largely related to the quality and specificity of the PET data rather than the derived functional connectivity gradients.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the thoughtful summary and positive assessment of our work. To increase transparency of the statistical analyses, we have in the revised manuscript added information regarding statistical tests and corrections for multiple comparisons. In the Results, p-values were reported at an uncorrected statistical threshold, and we have in the revised manuscript included the corresponding p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Finally, in the revised manuscript, we have now elaborated on the potential limitations of our PET analyses and we include the updated paragraph below.</p><p>Addition made to the Results section, page 13:</p><p>“Individual maps of D1DR binding potential (BP) were also submitted to TSM, yielding a set of spatial model parameters describing the topographic characteristics of hippocampal D1DR distribution for each participant.

Meta-analytical decoding reproduced a unimodalassociative axis across G2 (Figure 3B), and analyses in relation to the distribution of D1DRs – which vary across cortex along a unimodal-transmodal axis(76,77) – demonstrated topographic correspondence both at the level of individual differences and across the group. It should, however, be acknowledged that PET imaging in the hippocampus is associated with resolutionrelated limitations, although previous research indicate high test-retest reliability of [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 PET to quantify D1DR availability in this region(78). As such, mapping the distribution of hippocampal D1DRs at a fine spatial scale remains challenging, and replication of our results in terms of overlap with G2 is needed in independent samples. Here, we evaluated the observed spatial overlap between G2 topography and D1DRs across multiple TSM model orders, showing correspondence between modalities from simple to more complex parameterizations of their spatial properties. Topographic correspondence was additionally observed between G2 and other DA markers from independent datasets (Figure 3B), suggesting that G2 may constitute a mode reflecting a dopaminergic phenotype, which contributes to the currently limited understanding of its biological underpinnings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Please see the comments in the public review.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their comments and recommendations, and have addressed them in the “Public review” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) All statistical analyses are based on linear regressions using trend surface modeling (TSM) parameters that parameterize gradients at the subject level.

Although the overall group-level gradients were very stable between the two datasets, it is not clear whether the age findings replicated and the memory subgroup findings only replicated at trend level for memory and only partially replicated at the TSM parameter level.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting the inclusion of a replication dataset as a strength of our study, and we appreciate the recommendation to clarify to which extent results replicated. We provide a response to the Reviewer’s points below, and specify the revisions made to the manuscript in relation to this topic.</p><p>The main aim of our study was to characterize the topographic organization of functional hippocampal-neocortical connectivity within the hippocampus across the adult lifespan, as previous studies have limited their focus to younger adults. Given the lack of previous studies for comparison, together with our identification of a novel secondary long-axis connectivity gradient (G2) taking precedence over the previously established medial-lateral G3, we included the Betula sample (Nilsson et al., 2004) for the purpose of replication. There was a high level of consistency between our main dataset and our replication dataset, with gradients 1-3 in left and right hemispheres identified in both samples.</p><p>Further use of the replication dataset, beyond the identification of the connectivity gradients, was originally not planned. As such, not all subsequent analyses in the main dataset were conducted in the replication dataset. However, we found it critical to evaluate the observation that older individuals who maintained a youth-like gradient topography also exhibited higher levels of memory performance in an independent sample. This was possible given that the replication dataset included a comparable number of participants in similar ages and a word recall episodic memory task corresponding well to the one used in DyNAMiC. Overall, we conclude that these analyses replicated well across samples. Firstly, topography of lefthemisphere G1 informed the classification of older adults into youth-like and aged subgroups in both samples. Furthermore, in both samples, we observed that the older subgroups identified based on G1 topography also exhibited the youth-like vs. aged pattern in G2 topography. This pattern was, however, evident also in G3 only in the main sample, possibly suggesting a limited contribution of G3 topography in determining overall functional profiles in older age. In terms of the behavioral relevance of maintaining youth-like gradient topography in older age, we observed effects on word recall performance in both samples; although the Reviewer correctly points out that, the difference between subgroups was significant at trend-level (<italic>p</italic> = 0.058) in the replication dataset. While this indeed underscores the importance of replication efforts in additional samples, we argue that the pattern observed in our replication dataset is overall consistent with, and conveys effects in the expected direction based on, the original observations in our main dataset.</p><p>In revising the manuscript, we have performed additional analyses for replication purposes in terms of memory. Originally, we observed a significant association between G2 topography and episodic memory across the main sample. However, this effect did not remain significant after FDR adjustment for multiple comparisons. To evaluate this association further, we conducted a corresponding hierarchical multiple regression analysis in the replication dataset, which supported a role of G2 in memory (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.368, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, F = 1.992, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028). Together, these analyses suggest that inter-individual differences in episodic memory performance may in part be explained by the spatial characteristics of G2 across the adult lifespan, although increased statistical power in relation to the large number of TSM parameters included in the hierarchical regression models may be needed to explore this association in smaller, age-stratified, groups. Relatedly, it is worth mentioning that higher levels of memory performance in older age were linked to the maintenance of youth-like G2 topography in both our main and replication datasets.</p><p>In parallel, topographic parameters of G1 predicted memory performance in the younger adults, which successfully replicates TSM-based results previously reported in Przeździk et al., 2019. Although similar associations were not evident within the other age groups, a link between G1 topography and memory was demonstrated in older age based on (a) the identification of individuals maintaining a youth-like G1 profile and higher levels of memory, within which (b) memory performance was, as in young adults, significantly predicted by G1 topography.</p><p>The spatial correspondence between G2 topography and distribution of hippocampal D1DRs was lateralized to the right, and as the Reviewer points out, as such did not replicate across hemispheres. To which extent replication across hemispheres should be expected in this case is, however, difficult to determine. Lateralization and/or hemispheric asymmetry is commonly observed in numerous hippocampal features, from the molecular level to its functional involvement in behavior (Nematis et al., 2023; Persson &amp; Söderlund, 2015), including various dopaminergic markers tested in the animal literature (Afonso et al., 1993; Sadeghi et al., 2017). Yet, potential differences between hemispheres in D1DR availability and the spatial distribution of receptors along hippocampal axes remain less studied in humans. More data is therefore needed to determine the nature of this right-hemisphere lateralization.</p><p>In sum, we argue that our results show a good level of replication across independent datasets and across analyses in our main dataset. Whereas this study did not attempt replication of all analyses conducted in the main dataset, it has through replication across independent samples provided support for its main findings – the organization of hippocampal-neocortical connectivity along three main hippocampal gradients across the adult lifespan, and the gradient topography-based identification of older individuals maintaining a youth-like hippocampal organization in older age.</p><p>The revised manuscript includes edits made to incorporate the new analyses and clarifications of observations in relation to memory.</p><p>In the Results, page 17:</p><p>“Observing that the association between G2 and memory did not remain significant after FDR adjustment, we performed the same analysis in our replication dataset, which also included episodic memory testing. Consistent with the observation in our main dataset, G2 significantly predicted memory performance (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.368, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, F = 1.992, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028) over and above covariates and topography of G1. Here, the analysis also showed that G1 topography predicted performance across the sample (Adj. R<sup>2</sup> = 0.325, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = 0.112, F = 3.431, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).”</p><p>In the Discussion, page 26:</p><p>“Results linked both G1 and G2 to episodic memory, suggesting complimentary contributions of these two overlapping long-axis modes. Considered together, analyses in the main and replication datasets indicated a role of G2 topography in memory across the adult lifespan, independent of age. A similar association with G1 was only evident across the entire sample in the replication dataset, whereas results in the main sample seemed to emphasize a role of youthlike G1 topography in memory performance. In line with previous research, memory was successfully predicted by G1 topography in young adults(30), and similarly predicted by G1 in older adults exhibiting a youth-like functional profile.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please share the data and code and add a description of data and code availability in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now made our code available, and added a statement on data and code availability in the revised manuscript.</p><p>On page 37: “Data from the DyNAMiC study are not publicly available.
