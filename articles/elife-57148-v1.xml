The ventromedial hypothalamus controls both social aggression and avoidance, suggesting that it may encode a general internal state of threat modulated by space and experience. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse ventromedial hypothalamus are activated both by the presence of a social threat as well as by a chamber where social defeat previously occurred. Moreover, under conditions where the animal could move freely between a home and defeat chamber, firing activity emerged that predicted the animal’s position, demonstrating the dynamic encoding of spatial context in the hypothalamus. Finally, we found that social defeat induced a functional reorganization of neural activity as optogenetic activation could elicit avoidance after, but not before social defeat. These findings reveal how the hypothalamus dynamically encodes spatial and sensory cues to drive social behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>threat</kwd><kwd>territory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AdG COREFEAR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krzywkowski</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name><name><surname>Gross</surname><given-names>Cornelius T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Threat and context-responsive neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus are reshaped by experience to drive social avoidance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Comparative molecular and functional studies across animal species demonstrate that the hypothalamus contains evolutionarily conserved brain networks for controlling survival behaviors and maintaining physiological homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Swanson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tosches and Arendt, 2013</xref>). Work in laboratory rodents has shown that the medial hypothalamus, in particular, harbors distinct neural systems essential for defense and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canteras, 2002</xref>). The best understood of the medial hypothalamic nuclei is the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) whose dorsal medial (VMHdm) and ventrolateral (VMHvl) divisions are key nodes in the defensive and reproductive systems, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Canteras et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canteras, 2002</xref>). VMHdm is required for defensive responses to predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Viskaitis et al., 2017</xref>), while VMHvl is necessary for mounting and territorial aggression, key reproductive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). However, loss-of-function studies demonstrate that defensive responses to social threats do not depend on VMHdm, but rather require VMHvl, suggesting that the reproductive system plays a more general role in controlling both aggression and defense to social stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Silva et al., 2016a</xref>). Consistent with a general role in social threat responding, electrical, pharmacogenetic, or optogenetic stimulation of VMHvl is able to elicit or increase the probability of social aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Olivier, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kruk et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hashikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, these responses are often unreliable and have been shown to be influenced by the social and hormonal status of both the subject and the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting a role for past experience or other environmental factors in dictating the behavioral output of VMHvl.</p><p>Neurons in VMHvl show firing patterns that correlate with social investigation and attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Falkner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Remedios et al., 2017</xref>) and cFos and bulk calcium imaging approaches identified partially overlapping recruitment of neural activity during social aggression and defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Motta et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sakurai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, single unit recordings have not been reported during social defeat or avoidance and it remains unclear what aspects of these behaviors are encoded in VMHvl and whether the overlap between aggression and defense reflects a common behavioral or internal state component. VMHvl receives major afferents from the medial amygdala that encodes information about conspecific identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Canteras et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Swanson and Petrovich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, VMH also receives inputs from lateral septum and subiculum that could convey contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Risold and Swanson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Silva et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lo et al., 2019</xref>) and both of these input pathways are able to modulate aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leroy et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting that VMHvl is in a position to integrate sensory and spatial information to guide social behavior. Finally, ensemble neural activity elicited in VMHvl during social investigation can be reshaped by sexual experience, demonstrating a capacity for experience-dependent changes in VMHvl inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Remedios et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the functional encoding of defense and aggression by VMHvl using single unit neural activity recording and optogenetic manipulation during male-male social encounters in laboratory mice. A majority of neurons in VMHvl were active in a way that was consistent with the encoding of a generalized internal state of threat, responding during a variety of social threat situations. Unexpectedly, following social defeat sets of neurons emerged that were activated by the context where the social threat had occurred or by the home cage where the animal resided, demonstrating the experience-dependent encoding of spatial context. Moreover, social defeat reshaped the neuron ensemble activity elicited during social interaction and optogenetic stimulation could elicit robust escape behavior in defeated animals, but not in undefeated controls. These findings demonstrate that VMHvl dynamically encodes social threat and spatial context states in a manner that can guide defensive behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Encoding of social threat</title><p>In order to better understand what aspects of defense are encoded in VMHvl neuron firing, we used in vivo microendoscopic calcium imaging to measure neuronal response properties in mice subjected to social defeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–e</xref>). Mice were habituated to a home chamber from which they were given access to a corridor and far chamber for a brief period each day. On the social defeat day, mice were closed into the far chamber and an aggressive mouse was introduced. Following social defeat, the far chamber door was opened to allow the mouse to escape and exhibit approach-avoidance behavior toward the aggressor who remained restricted to the far chamber. Many neurons (100/246, 40%, Social+) showed a tonic increase in activity during the social defeat phase that returned to baseline levels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>VMHvl encodes social threat.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Microendoscopy was used to image single unit calcium activity in VMHvl neurons of awake behaving mice expressing GCaMP6s.

The mice repeatedly advanced in a cautious manner toward the aggressor, exhibiting frequent risk assessment behaviors in which they stretched their body in the direction of the far chamber (stretch-attend or stretch-approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blanchard et al., 2011</xref>). Once close to the far chamber mice often turned and fled back to the home chamber (flight, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Calcium imaging identified many cells that were robustly activated during risk assessment either close to or far away from the far chamber (160/326, 49%, Assessment+). Smaller sets of cells were either deactivated during risk assessment (63/326, 19%, Assessment-) or activated or deactivated during flight (30/198, 15%, Flight+; 60/198, 30%, Flight-; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l–q</xref>). Notably, Assessment+ cells were activated during risk assessment events that occurred at a distance from the far chamber, particularly at the junction of the home cage and corridor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). A comparison of neuronal response properties revealed that a majority of Assessment+ cells (81/152, 53% vs chance 17%, p=4.23×10<sup>−11</sup>) overlapped with Defeat+ cells, suggesting that they may encode a generalized internal state associated with both direct threat as well as the assessment of threat even when this does not involve close social contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1r</xref>). Moreover, many Assessment+ cells (37/100, 37% vs chance 14%, p=0.00031) were also Flight- cells, showing activation as the mouse approached the far chamber and then turning off abruptly when the animal fled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1s</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). A similar firing response pattern has been reported for neurons in VMHdm during approach toward a predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masferrer et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, Defeat+, Assessment+, Flight- cells showed a high degree of overlap (26% vs chance 5%, p=2.0×10<sup>−6</sup>) and made up the largest fraction of responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1t</xref>). These findings suggest that VMHvl neurons may encode a generalized social threat state rather than particular behaviors associated with threat response.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57148-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Assessment+ cell far from stimulus.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamic encoding of spatial context</title><p>Our observation that a large fraction of neurons in VMHvl were activated during risk assessment both close and far from the social stimulus could be explained by the multi-sensory inputs that VMHvl receives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Canteras et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Garfield et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wong et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, our earlier observation that VMHdm is required for the expression of defensive behaviors in a context previously associated with a predator suggested that the medial hypothalamus can be recruited by stimulus-associated cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Silva et al., 2016a</xref>) and is consistent with evidence for activation of VMHvl during nose poke in anticipation of aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Falkner et al., 2016</xref>). To test for the recruitment of VMHvl by purely contextual cues, we performed in vivo calcium endoscopy in animals who experienced social defeat and were re-exposed 24 hr later to the defeat context in the absence of the aggressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Analysis of neuronal response properties revealed a large fraction of neurons with robust activation in the defeat chamber (93/343, 27%, Far chamber+, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). Unexpectedly, a second group of neurons showed marked activation in the home chamber (78/343, 23%, Home+, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–g</xref>). Notably, Home+ and Far chamber+ cells abruptly turned off when the animal passed from the chamber to the corridor, suggesting that they specifically responded to the far and home chamber contexts, rather than to a gradient of social threat cues, for example. A comparison of neuronal response properties between the context, approach-avoidance, and defeat phases of the test showed that Far chamber+ neurons strongly overlapped with Social+ neurons (45/67, 67% vs chance 11%, p=9.597×10<sup>−11</sup>) and Home+ neurons with Social- neurons (37/60, 62% vs chance 7%, p=1.065×10<sup>−10</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i,j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and that Far chamber+ neurons also overlapped with Defeat+ neurons (35/84, 42% vs chance 10%, p=2.0×10<sup>−6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>) and, in a three-way comparison, a larger fraction of Far chamber+ than Home+ neurons were Assessment+ or Defeat+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l,o</xref>). These data suggest that VMHvl encodes a generalized state of social threat that can be reactivated by contextual cues (Social+, Defeat+, Far chamber+) as well as features of social territory (Home+).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dynamic encoding of spatial context in VMHvl.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In vivo calcium endoscopy was carried out in mice subjected to (left, middle) social defeat and then exposed again to (right) the defeat context one day later.

Animals were exposed to repeated social defeat experiences in the far chamber of a dual chamber apparatus as described earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The experimental animals showed similar frequencies of behaviors across the two days of social defeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, to minimize any confounding effect of potential changes in behavior across experimental sessions, we restricted our ensemble analysis to data extracted from bouts of close social encounter (defeat, upright, orientating, sniffing, following, see Materials and methods). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to track and quantify shifts in neuron ensemble encoding across sessions. Neuron ensemble activity elicited during the first and second social defeat experiences were significantly non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4ab</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

Our findings open up the possibility that contextual and social cues are integrated in a dynamic manner in VMHvl to drive and modulate a wide variety of behaviors aimed at territorial defense.</p><p>Our neuron ensemble analysis shows that social defeat reshaped both spatial context as well as social cue encoding. Ensemble neuron activity elicited during close social investigation became transformed following a social defeat experience, but not following a social aggression experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>). The latter observation is consistent with a previous recording study in which resident-intruder aggression failed to induce changes in VMHvl ensemble activity, while sex did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Remedios et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, our gain-of-function experiment demonstrates that the social defeat-induced transformation of encoding involves functional plasticity in or downstream of VMHvl Esr1+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d</xref>). We note that in our hands optogenetic stimulation of VMHvl Esr1+ neurons was unable to elicit reliable aggression behavior against intact male intruders under baseline conditions, a finding that is consistent with previous studies where such stimulation only elicited reliably aggression against females or castrated males and in which a significant fraction of animals showed brief avoidance behavior upon initial optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). We interpret these findings to indicate that VMHvl is primed to promote either defensive avoidance or defensive aggression under baseline conditions in a manner that depends on past social experience. This interpretation is supported by a study showing that pharmacogenetic activation of progesterone receptor expressing neurons in VMHvl can increase the reliability of attack in the resident-intruder assay if the animal was previously singly housed, but not if it was group housed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our observations reveal the encoding and control of instinctive motivational states by VMHvl neurons, showing that these encode an experience-dependent map of spatial context and that they exhibit functional plasticity in response to past social experience that guides the selection of instinctive behavioral outputs. These data argue for a reevaluation of the role of the hypothalamus in behavior. Rather than being viewed as a hardwired, innate behavioral response region, it should be seen as an integrator of present and past sensory and contextual information that adapts survival behaviors to a changing environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

accordance with EU Directive 2010/63/EU and under approval of the EMBL Animal Use Committee and Italian Ministry of Health License 541/2015-PR to C.G. Animals were maintained in a temperature and humidity controlled environment with food and water provided ad libitum and 12 hr/12 hr light-dark cycle with lights on at 7:00. Experimental male C57BL/6J wild type (Charles River) and <italic>Esr1</italic>::Cre (Stock No. 017913, Jackson Laboratory) mice were switched to reverse dark-light cycle (lights off at 9:00) and singly housed in the home cage of the behavioral apparatus at least 1 week before initiating the experimental procedures and tested during the dark period under red lighting (two 1W LED lights). The custom Plexiglas behavioral apparatus consisted of three detachable parts: 1) home cage with dimensions 25 × 25×25 cm with a Y-shaped slit, 4 cm wide at the bottom serving as an entrance closed by sliding doors, 2) stimulus chamber identical to home cage, and 3) a corridor 46 × 12×30 cm connecting home cage and stimulus chamber (modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silva et al., 2013</xref>). Aggressor mice were CD-1 adult retired breeders (Charles River) screened for robust aggression and singly housed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Franklin et al., 2017</xref>). Subordinate mice were 9–15 week old BALB/c males bred at EMBL. Mice cages were changed weekly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Mice were anesthetised before surgery with 3% isoflurane (Provet) in oxygen and placed in stereotaxic frame (Kopf). Anesthesia was maintained with continuous 1–2% isoflurane administration in breathing air enriched with oxygen. Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad. During surgery the skull was exposed, aligned, and cleaned with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide solution. For optogenetic activation experiments, 0.1–0.2 µl of AAV5-<italic>Ef1a</italic>::DIO-hChR2(E123T/T159C)-EYFP or AAV5-<italic>Ef1a</italic>::DIO-EYFP virus (UNC Vector Core) was infused bilaterally into VMHvl (from Bregma L:+ / - 0.67, A/P: −0.98, D/V: −5,75). After 5–10 min, the glass capillary was retracted and custom-made optic fibre connectors were implanted (0.66 NA, 200 µm core fibre and ceramic ferule with 230 µm/1250 µm internal/external diameter; from Bregma L: + / - 0.67, A/P: −0.98, D/V: −5.55 and L: + / - 1.14, A/P: −0.98, D/V: −5.6, at 5° angle). For in vivo calcium endoscopy 0.2–0.3 µl of AAV5-<italic>hSyn</italic>::GCaMP6s or AAV5-<italic>CAG</italic>::Flex-GCaMP6s (Penn Vector Core) virus was injected unilaterally into VMHvl and the endoscope lens (Snap-imaging cannula model L type E, Doric Lenses) was implanted at a very slow rate (from Bregma L: + / - 0.67, A/P: −0.98, D/V: −5.7). All implants were secured to the skull using miniature screws (RWD) and dental cement (Duralay). The wound was cleaned and skin was stitched around the implant. After the surgery mice received intra-peritoneal injection of 0.4 ml saline and were placed into heated cages with drinking water containing paracetamol for ~1 week. Mice were maintained in isolation for ~4 weeks before experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Social defeat test</title><p>On the social defeat day, the mouse was allowed to explore the apparatus freely for 5 min, after which the animal was closed in the stimulus chamber and an aggressor was introduced for 10 min. In a few cases, the animal was allowed to escape earlier to avoid excessive defeat. The mouse was released from the stimulus chamber and the door closed to confine the aggressor to the stimulus chamber. After social defeat the mouse was allowed to explore the apparatus freely for at least 5 min. The memory test was conducted on the day following after social defeat, during which the mouse could explore the apparatus freely. The apparatus was washed with detergent and 50% alcohol between mice to avoid any remaining smell that could influence behavior of the test subject. CD-1 aggressors were screened for aggression for 3 days. Every day an intruder was placed in the aggressor’s cage for 3 min. Only mice that attacked the intruder on every occasion were selected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Aggression test</title><p>On the aggression day a BALB/c intruder was introduced for 10 min after which the intruder was removed. BALB/c intruders used for this test were 9–15 weeks old and housed 3–5 mice per cage. For cFos experiments, animal were allowed to explore the entire apparatus for 5 min before and after introduction of the intruder in order to match exploration in the social defeat test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral data acquisition and annotation</title><p>Behavior was recorded at 40–50 Hz from above with up to two cameras (acA1300-60gmHIR, Basler) with GigE connections using Pylon software. Frame-by-frame behavioral annotation was carried out manually using Observer XT11 (Noldus) and Solomon Coder software. The experimenter was blind to genotype or calcium trace of recorded neurons when scoring behavior. The following behaviors were scored: defeat – biting attack toward the experimental animal in which the animal exhibited avoidance behavior (whole body movement away from intruder); <italic>assessment</italic> – stretch attend or stretch approach behavior in which the animal extended its body in the direction of the threat or threat chamber from an immobile or slowly moving position; <italic>flight</italic> – rapid movement away from the threat or threat chamber; attack – biting attack or vigorous anogenital sniffing toward the intruder animal; <italic>sniffing</italic> – close contact of the nose of the experimental animal with the intruder; upright – animal rises on back paws with head up, keeping front paws stretch out; put down – keeping other animal down usually with two front paws and staying on top of it; follow – experimental animal closely follows intruder; cornering – staying in the corner of the apparatus (animal has body contact with two walls); locomotion – free movement and exploration of experimental apparatus; freeze – no body movement; head/body orientation – turning head or whole body towards another conspecific. Any animals with misplaced viral infections or optic fiber implants were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology</title><p>All animals were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS (Invitrogen) followed by 4% PFA (Sigma) in 0.1M PB solution and then post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 24 hr and cut using a vibratome (Leica VT 1000 s) in PBS (80 µm) for injection or implant location check, or staining (50 µm) procedure. If not used immediately, sections were stored in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide. For anti-cFos staining (SC-52G, Lot FO215, Santa Cruz) sections were washed three times in PBS for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton-X in PBS for at least 1 hr, and incubated with primary antibody (1:500) containing 5% normal donkey serum, 0.2% Triton-X overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed three times in PBS, incubated with secondary antibody solution (1:1000) containing 10% normal donkey serum for 2 hr at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and stained with DAPI for 15 min, before washing twice with PBS and mounting on SuperFrost Plus slides (ThermoFischer) with Moviol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>cFos mapping</title><p>Double heterozygous <italic>cFos</italic>::CreERT2;<italic>RC</italic>::LSL-tdTomato mice (Stock No. 021882 and 007914, Jackson Laboratory) were isolated for 7 days and subjected to 3 days of habituation to the apparatus before social defeat. A single dose (50 mg/kg) of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, 70% z-isomer, Sigma) was injected intra-peritoneally &lt;2 min after social defeat to induce fluorophore expression in neurons recruited by defeat. One week later, mice were again habituated for 3 days to the apparatus and subjected to social aggression, and 1.5 hr later trans-cardially perfused and processed for cFos immunofluorescence. In a second group, the order of social defeat and social aggression were swapped to produce five experimental groups: defense-defense (same), aggression-aggression (same), defense-aggression (different), aggression-defense (different), defense-control (control). Control indicates mice exposed only to context prior to labelling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Optogenetic experiments</title><p>Heterozygous <italic>Esr1</italic>::Cre mice were injected with virus and allowed to recover for 2–3 weeks, housed under reverse light-cycle for 2 weeks, and then handled and habituated to the optical cables for at least 2 days prior to testing. Initially, after a 2-min free exploration period, each animal was stimulated with light (30 s, 20 Hz) every 1–2 min with increasing power (0.5, 1, 3, 6, 10 mW) to identify the optimal intensity to elicit a behavioral response (immobility or locomotion) and this was subsequently used for further stimulation (3 mW for most animals, with some responding at 1 mW and 6 mW). Control animals received 6 mW stimulation. For stimulation in the presence of a subordinate intruder-free exploration was allowed for ~3 min during which a single light stimulus was delivered (30 s, 20 Hz) after which a BALB/c intruder was introduced and the animal was further stimulated (3–5 times, 30 s, 20 Hz) during periods of social interaction. Mice were then subjected to 2 days of social defeat (5 min) by a CD-1intruder in a novel plexiglas cage following 1 min free exploration. Several hours later, stimulation in the presence of a subordinate intruder was repeated as above. To control for possible repeated optogenetic activation effects a subset of animals from the ChR2 group (N = 3) was not stimulated before defeat episodes. Optical stimulation of ChR2 was achieved using a 465 nm LED (Plexbright, Plexon) attached to a manual rotatory joint with 1 m patch cables (Plexbright High Performance, Plexon). Power at the end of the patch cables was measured before each experiment with a portable optical power meter (Thor Labs) and stimulation trains were generated using V2.2 Radiant software (Plexon). Animals with mistargeted viral injections or optic fibers were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Calcium endoscopy</title><p>Following GCaMP6 virus infection, GRIN lens imaging canulae (Model L, Doric Lenses) were stereotaxically implanted over the VMHvl and mice allowed to recover for 2–3 weeks followed by 2 weeks isolation under reverse light-cycle and at least 3 days habituation to the microscope plugging and unplugging procedure. Mice were then habituated to the behavioral apparatus for 3 days, and for the second and third days the microscope body was attached. The following week mice (N = 4) were subjected to two consecutive social defeats tests (day 1: social defeat, day 2: memory) over 4 days, and 2–3 days later, three consecutive aggression tests over 3 days. In a second group of mice (N = 3), the testing order as reversed. Esr1 mice (N = 3) were subjected to two consecutive social defeats tests (day 1: social defeat, day 2: memory) over 4 days. Recordings were done with 15–25% LED intensity using 50 ms or 100 ms exposure times. Calcium imaging data was successfully collected from 19/32 animals that underwent surgery. Animals with mistargeted endoscope placements, very few (&lt;15) recorded neurons, recordings exhibiting excessive movement artifacts, or who showed insufficient instances of relevant behaviors were excluded from the analysis (9/19).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calcium imaging analysis</title><p>Image processing was done using Fiji software. Briefly, videos were first loaded as a stack of images in. tiff format. The stack was duplicated and for each frame a background frame was generated using a band pass filter (lower band: 100, higher band: 10,000). Next, each frame of the recording was divided by the corresponding background frame and the resulting background-filtered stack was aligned using TurboReg via the translation batch algorithm. Neuronal ROIs were manually selected from the maximum intensity projection image, with detection aided by inspecting recordings at increased speed to discern dim neurons with slow dynamics. Finally, the mean intensity ROI traces were extracted and ΔF/F was calculated where F is the mean intensity over the entire recording period. To track ROIs over different recordings and days, an ROI mask was projected onto each new recording and translated if necessary to account for possible field of view movement between recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). ROIs that could not be assigned to the mask were treated as new ROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For the analysis of neuronal response properties, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated using custom Python scripts (scikit-learn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Krzywkowski and Penna, 2020</xref>). Briefly, all frames in a selected calcium imaging recording were scored as either positive of negative for a particular behavior and a ROC curve was generated for each neuron by plotting the true positive and false positive rates across the distribution. The area under the ROC curve (auROC) was calculated for each recording and averaged across days to give a measure of the responsiveness of a neuron to a given behavior. Neurons with auROC values greater than 0.65 or less than 0.35 were considered to respond to the behavior. Significance of neuronal response auROC values was estimated by calculating the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the distribution of auROC values obtained by shuffling true and false positive labels 1000 times. Neuronal response auROC values ≥ 3 SD away from the mean were considered significant. Neuron needed to fulfill both of the above criteria to be classified as positive or negative responding during any given behavior (e.g. Assessment+, Defeat-). For the analysis of auROC values for flight behavior 2 s before and after the initiation of each flight were labeled as true negative and true positive, respectively. Only recordings with at least two instances of relevant behavior were selected for auROC analysis. For example, during pre-defeat context recordings only four animals out of seven transitioned between all the compartments of the apparatus two or more times and the remaining three animals were excluded from analysis. Heat maps were generated by extracting calcium imaging data (meaned z-score over all trials) for individual neurons from before and after the onset or offset of a given behavior. Significant change across behavioral onset or offset was estimated for each neuron by performing a Wilcoxon signed rank-sum test (Python, scikit-learn) on the distribution of values that resulted from averaging the z-scores of frames from the before and after periods for each trial. For linear discriminant analysis (LDA algorithm, Python, scikit-learn), data was normalized within days by calculating z-scores for each recording separately. Each frame was then expressed as a vector containing calcium values for all neurons. The distance between clusters was quantified by calculating the average distance between data points of a given cluster and all other data points from other clusters. For Venn diagrams, we included only neurons responding to the behaviors (e.g. Defeat+) that were recorded across all relevant behaviors, resulting in different numbers of neurons across Venn analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Probability of chance overlap was computed by multiplying the probabilities of responsive neurons. Significance was assessed using Fisher’s test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Prism Graphpad five software or custom scripts in Python were used to generate graphs and perform statistical analysis. For calcium imaging Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Python, scikit-learn package) was performed. For cFos experiments, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test was used. For optogenetic experiments repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test was used. For assessing significance of overlap between different populations of neurons Fisher’s test was used. For assessing significance differences in LDA representations the one-way ANOVA and T test were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>Custom code written for this study is made available on GitHub platform <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/GrossLab/VMHvl-Calcium-Imaging-and-Visualisation">https://github.com/GrossLab/VMHvl-Calcium-Imaging-and-Visualisation</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/VMHvl-Calcium-Imaging-and-Visualisation">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/VMHvl-Calcium-Imaging-and-Visualisation</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional analyses and data are required before a final decision can be reached, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, using newly designed behavioral paradigms and microendoscopic calcium imaging of deep brain area, Krzywkowski et al. reported that past social experience reshaped activity patterns of social threat and spatial context neurons in the VMHvl. They first designed a new behavioral paradigm for performing rodent social defeat in far chamber, resident-intruder test in home chamber, and approach-avoidance behaviors without manual interference. Next, they applied in vivo microendoscopy to image calcium response of VMHvl neurons at single-cell level in free-moving mice subjected to social defeat. Using these approaches the authors revealed that neurons in the ventrolateral subregion of the VMH (VMHvl) are activated by social threat as well as the context in which that social threat occurred. Furthermore, using the resident-intruder test in home chamber, the authors found that the VMHvl neurons showed an overlapping encoding of social defense and aggression. Moreover, the authors found that social defeat experience altered neurons in the VMHvl such that subsequent optogenetic activation of VMHvl could elicit avoidance of the defeat context. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel, dynamic role for the VMHvl in mediating both social threat and the contextual factors which control these threats.</p><p>Overall, this interesting set of data represents a conceptual advance in understanding the role of the VMHvl in aggressive behavior and contextual coding and the reviewers are generally enthusiastic about the work. However, there are a number of important analytic concerns and key behavioral measures are missing. In addition, tracking single cells across days during calcium imaging experiments is not trivial and the authors need a more rigorous assessment of this. Though no new experiments are required, the addition of new analyses, existing data and textual revisions is therefore necessary before a decision can be reached.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors wrote that &quot;Many neurons (100/246, 40%, Social+) showed an increase in activity during close social interaction that returned to baseline levels during the subsequent approach-avoidance phase&quot;. It is unclear whether &quot;close social interaction&quot; means the whole period in the far chamber or every social interaction epoch with the aggressor. Please clarify. In Figure 1F, G, H, the authors only showed overall calcium activities in and out of the far chamber. It should be possible to align the signal to every social interaction epoch as shown in Figure 1I, J, K, which will provide more information on the timing of Ca signals. In addition, since the VMHvl also responded to contexts as shown in Figure 2, a control experiment should be performed for Figure 1L, with no aggressor in the far chamber to exclude the context-coding neurons from Social+/- neurons.</p><p>2) The definition of Flight- neurons and calculation of their auROC are confusing. An auROC value smaller than 0.5 means that the neuron has a higher tendency to fire not during the event. However, in the bottom trace of Figure 1O, the activity of the example Flight- neuron is elevated right before the flight behavior and declined during the flight, but still above the baseline. According to this pattern, its auROC value should be bigger than 0.5, contradicting to its definition (auROC &lt; 0.35) as indicated in Figure 1Q.</p><p>3) The authors concluded that &quot;defeat has a unique capacity to alter the encoding of social cues in VMHvl. Notably, this change was found only when defeats preceded, but not when they followed aggression experiences&quot;. Interesting result, but it is not clear whether this difference in VMHvl neural coding is a consequence or a cause of different behavioral performance owing to different sequential order of defeat and aggression. The authors seem to implicate the behaviors are the same with the statement that &quot;The experimental animals showed similar frequencies of behaviors across the two days of social defeat (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A)&quot;. However, they mixed behavioral results of all mice tested with different sequential orders. Please separate the two groups with defeat before or after aggression and quantify the behaviors again.</p><p>4) For Figure 1, no behavioral data is shown or described at all in the main text or supplement in relation to Figure 1. Do all the mice experience defeat? Is the degree to which a mouse is &quot;defeated&quot; (i.e. number of attacks, etc.), related at all to neuronal activity patterns? How much time on average do mice spend avoiding or approaching the defeater? The authors should display and describe their behavior data for this initial Results section.</p><p>5) In the subsection “Encoding of social threat”, Social- neurons are described as showing either no change during defeat/social investigation and an increase in activity during the approach/avoidance phase or a reduction during the defeat phase coupled with an increase in the approach/avoidance phase. However, the data for these two options is pooled under the &quot;Social-&quot; category, where really, they should be pooled under an Avoidance+ category. This pooling seems to ignore the potential differences between the 3 types of neurons the authors identify: 1) Social+/Avoidance- cells, 2) Social no change/Avoidance+ cells, and 3) Social-/Avoidance+ cells. The reviewer understands that separating the data further would increase the complexity of these data and introduce additional factors to consider, however, perhaps a supplementary figure breaking down these groups could be included, or at the least, a revision to the text explaining why neuron classes 2 and 3 are being merged.</p><p>6) The authors say that they use a cutoff of &gt;0.65 and &lt;0.35 to classify cells as being responsive to a given behavior, but also say they use a shuffling procedure and a significance cutoff of &gt;/= 3SD from the mean. It is not clear when these different criteria were used. For example, this leads to some confusion when examining Figure 1. For Figure 1H, K, N and Q frequency histograms, there are colored portions of lines below 0.65 and above 0.35. Are the cells counted here assessed using the 3 SD criterion? Relatedly, for cell counts in the Venn diagram in Figure 1T, which criterion was used to classify them? This same confusion applies to all imaging figures.</p><p>7) Similar to point 4, the authors show no behavioral data for Figure 2. How much time do mice spend in each of the chambers during the test phase? Is it related to the degree to which they were defeated the prior day? These should be data that the authors already have and can put figures together for without running any extra experiments.</p><p>8) Figure 3A-D. There is usually a small percentage of resident animals in a resident intruder assay that fail to exhibit any fighting (as seen in papers cited by the authors throughout the text). Did the authors see aggression in all of their residents? This is important as it speaks to the degree of overlap observed in this experiment (for instance, perhaps the degree of overlap seen is due to the animal(s) that didn't fight?).</p><p>9) The authors wrote &quot;Defeat+ and Assessment+ cells showed a high degree of overlap (32% vs. chance 20%, P &gt; 0.1)&quot;. How can the conclusion of overlap be made based on a non-significant p value?</p><p>10) The cluster distance statistical measure/comparison used for the contextual coding and effects of repeated defeat on population activity should also be used for the analysis of the effects of repeated defeat on ESR1+ cells (related to data in Figure 4K-L).</p><p>11) The authors concluded that &quot;VMHvl neurons promote aggression and defense&quot; based on data from Figure 5. Yet only defensive behavior, no aggression, was analyzed in Figure 5.</p><p>12) Is the &quot;social interaction&quot; behavior in Figure 5 the same as &quot;close social interaction&quot; defined in Figure 1? If yes, please explain the discrepancy between optogenetic manipulation (activation of VMHvl Esr1+ neurons decreased social interaction, Figure 5) and endoscope recording (more Social+ neurons than Social- neurons found in VMHvl, Figure 1).</p><p>13) Are the mice used for the data presented in Figure 5E the same as 5D or are these separate cohorts of mice? If the former, could the repeated optogenetic activation explain some of the effects observed? Please explain/clarify in text.</p><p>14) Given that the endoscopic imaging lasted for ~1 week (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C) and several comparisons were conducted across days, it is critically important to verify the stability of imaging across different recording days. Please show maps of spatial filters of all cells from each day of imaging and the overlaid filters (see Extended Data Figure 7 in Remedios et al.'s paper (Remedios et al., 2017) for reference). In addition, the authors should think about using a more quantitative measure of ROI stability potentially using an existing algorithm for aligning ROIs across days (such as Sheintuch, L….Ziv, Y. Cell Reports 21(4) pg. 1102, 2017).</p><p>15) In the optogenetic experiments the authors say they use a YFP alone control (subsection “Functional remodeling of Esr1+ neurons by social defeat”), but don't show the data. This data should be shown.</p><p>16) Please ensure you include full statistical reporting including F, t statistic, degrees of freedom, exact p value, etc.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57148.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors wrote that &quot;Many neurons (100/246, 40%, Social+) showed an increase in activity during close social interaction that returned to baseline levels during the subsequent approach-avoidance phase&quot;.

We agree that this may have been confusing and have now replaced the term “close social interaction” in this context with “during the social defeat phase”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1F, G, H, the authors only showed overall calcium activities in and out of the far chamber. It should be possible to align the signal to every social interaction epoch as shown in Figure 1I, J, K, which will provide more information on the timing of Ca signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to designate these neurons Social+ precisely because they show robust tonic activity while the animal is in the defeat chamber. We note that this activity is very similar to the activity observed in previous studies during social interaction (Remedios et al., 2017). The reviewer is right to point out that there is an additional phasic component to the Social+ activity. We have pulled out the strongest of these components that correlated with the epochs in which the animal was chased and bitten by the aggressor, and called these Defeat+ neurons. Notice that Defeat+ and Social+ neurons strongly overlapped (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), demonstrating a simultaneous tonic and phasic modulation of some neurons in VMHvl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, since the VMHvl also responded to contexts as shown in Figure 2, a control experiment should be performed for Figure 1L, with no aggressor in the far chamber to exclude the context-coding neurons from Social+/- neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested control experiment is shown in (Figure 2M, N, R, T) in which we recorded neural activity during exploration of the apparatus prior to social interaction/defeat and found only very weak encoding of the far chamber. These data suggest that Social+ neurons were not responding to the context, but rather to the presence of the conspecific. We note that there was a significant overlap between Social+ and Far chamber+ neurons (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), showing that neurons that later responded when the animal was in the defeat chamber with the aggressor (Social+) were not yet active when in the far chamber before exposure to the aggressor, but only thereafter (Far chamber+).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The definition of Flight- neurons and calculation of their auROC are confusing. An auROC value smaller than 0.5 means that the neuron has a higher tendency to fire not during the event. However, in the bottom trace of Figure 1O, the activity of the example Flight- neuron is elevated right before the flight behavior and declined during the flight, but still above the baseline. According to this pattern, its auROC value should be bigger than 0.5, contradicting to its definition (auROC &lt; 0.35) as indicated in Figure 1Q.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in the Materials and methods section, due to the short duration of flights we calculated auROCs for flight using 2 seconds before and 2 seconds after its initiation. Thus, Flight+ and Flight- describe the response of the neurons at the decision point of flight, separating those neurons whose activity went down from those that went up. We note that Flight- cells highly overlap with Assessment+ cells suggesting that there may be just two major classes of responses to flight, one going up and the other going down. Other studies in VMH have found cells with similar flight response patterns (Masferrer et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors concluded that &quot;defeat has a unique capacity to alter the encoding of social cues in VMHvl. Notably, this change was found only when defeats preceded, but not when they followed aggression experiences&quot;. Interesting result, but it is not clear whether this difference in VMHvl neural coding is a consequence or a cause of different behavioral performance owing to different sequential order of defeat and aggression. The authors seem to implicate the behaviors are the same with the statement that &quot;The experimental animals showed similar frequencies of behaviors across the two days of social defeat (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A)&quot;. However, they mixed behavioral results of all mice tested with different sequential orders. Please separate the two groups with defeat before or after aggression and quantify the behaviors again.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that differences in behaviour between the forward and reverse groups could have influenced our ensemble findings and have now analysed the data separately (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D). Both forward and reverse groups were repeatedly attacked and show clear defensive responses (defence, upright, assessment) during defeat. However, there was a trend for the reverse group (agg-agg-agg-def-def) to show fewer defensive responses and this reached significance for upright postures. Such a difference is consistent with animals that have experienced aggression being somewhat less susceptible to defeat and leaves open the possibility that some of the difference in the impact of defeat on ensemble coding in the forward and reversed groups depend on differences in behavioral performance. However, the significant difference in ensemble encoding between defeat day 1 and defeat day 2 seen in the forward, but not reversed group was not associated with a difference in defensive behavior (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D). This lack of correlation suggests that ensemble encoding differences do not depend on differences in behaviour. We have now expanded the text to reflect this argument.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For Figure 1, no behavioral data is shown or described at all in the main text or supplement in relation to Figure 1. Do all the mice experience defeat? Is the degree to which a mouse is &quot;defeated&quot; (i.e. number of attacks, etc.), related at all to neuronal activity patterns? How much time on average do mice spend avoiding or approaching the defeater? The authors should display and describe their behavior data for this initial Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes – all mice experienced defeat. Figure 4—figure supplement 1 presents a quantification of defeat and upright behavior for each mouse used in Figure 1 across defeat days. To extend the analysis we have now added quantifications of assessment behavior during the post-defeat approach-avoidance phase (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). No patterns emerged between defense or upright behaviors and assessment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), although we acknowledge that this analysis was highly underpowered due to the relatively small number of animals used in the imaging studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the subsection “Encoding of social threat”, Social- neurons are described as showing either no change during defeat/social investigation and an increase in activity during the approach/avoidance phase or a reduction during the defeat phase coupled with an increase in the approach/avoidance phase. However, the data for these two options is pooled under the &quot;Social-&quot; category, where really, they should be pooled under an Avoidance+ category. This pooling seems to ignore the potential differences between the 3 types of neurons the authors identify: 1) Social+/Avoidance- cells, 2) Social no change/Avoidance+ cells, and 3) Social-/Avoidance+ cells. The reviewer understands that separating the data further would increase the complexity of these data and introduce additional factors to consider, however, perhaps a supplementary figure breaking down these groups could be included, or at the least, a revision to the text explaining why neuron classes 2 and 3 are being merged.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a distinction could potentially be made between cells that show either no change or a decrease from baseline during the defeat/social phase. However, several technical issues made it difficult for us to definitively segregate these cell types. First, for some animals video recording was started only shortly before the intruder was placed into the chamber and we could not be sure we had properly captured baseline activity. The relatively short baseline periods made it difficult to obtain the significant auROC values needed to distinguish these cells. Second, because confident identification of Social cells involved assessment across 2 days and baseline activity on day 2 could be influenced by day 1, we did not feel confident in drawing any conclusions about a separate identity of these cell types and combined them. New experiments would have to be carried out, potentially with in vivo electrophysiology, aimed at explicitly testing this hypothesis, although we note that Social+ like cells have been reported in the past (Remedios et al., 2017). We have now added a short statement to the text to indicate why the two putative classes were combined: “Although it appeared that Social- neurons might represent two distinct populations, one that decreased and another that remained unchanged during the social defeat phase, it was not possible to statistically distinguish them.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors say that they use a cutoff of &gt;0.65 and &lt;0.35 to classify cells as being responsive to a given behavior, but also say they use a shuffling procedure and a significance cutoff of &gt;/= 3SD from the mean. It is not clear when these different criteria were used. For example, this leads to some confusion when examining Figure 1. For Figure 1H, K, N and Q frequency histograms, there are colored portions of lines below 0.65 and above 0.35. Are the cells counted here assessed using the 3 SD criterion? Relatedly, for cell counts in the Venn diagram in Figure 1T, which criterion was used to classify them? This same confusion applies to all imaging figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for inadvertently failing to mention that each neuron had to fulfil both criteria (cutoff &gt;0.65/&lt;0.35 and 3SD from mean) to be classified as +/-. As a result, the coloured section of the histogram (Figure 1H, K, N, Q), between 0.35 and 0.65 was not counted as +/- neurons for any of the analyses, including the Venn diagrams. We have now added a clarifying statement in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Similar to point 4, the authors show no behavioral data for Figure 2. How much time do mice spend in each of the chambers during the test phase? Is it related to the degree to which they were defeated the prior day? These should be data that the authors already have and can put figures together for without running any extra experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data showing time spent in the far, corridor and home chambers for each day and group (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-C). No correlation between time spent in any chamber and defeat duration was found (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3A-D. There is usually a small percentage of resident animals in a resident intruder assay that fail to exhibit any fighting (as seen in papers cited by the authors throughout the text). Did the authors see aggression in all of their residents? This is important as it speaks to the degree of overlap observed in this experiment (for instance, perhaps the degree of overlap seen is due to the animal(s) that didn't fight?).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, two animals failed to exhibit attacks in the resident-intruder test (see Supplementary file 1). However, our overlap calculations were restricted to neurons that were recorded during all relevant behaviors. For example, no neurons were included in the analysis for Attack+ neurons from animals showing no attacks. This is stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors wrote &quot;Defeat+ and Assessment+ cells showed a high degree of overlap (32% vs. chance 20%, P &gt; 0.1)&quot;. How can the conclusion of overlap be made based on a non-significant p value?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if we implied that the overlap was significant. The two cell types showed a 32% overlap, which however, did not reach significance when compared to chance. We have now changed the phrase “…high…” to “…moderate, but not significant…” to explicitly indicate that the overlap did not reach significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The cluster distance statistical measure/comparison used for the contextual coding and effects of repeated defeat on population activity should also be used for the analysis of the effects of repeated defeat on ESR1+ cells (related to data in Figure 4K-L).</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, for technical reasons we don’t have the data for contextual exploration from before the defeat for this group of animals. However, we have now added the mean cluster distance after defeat for contextual coding for Esr1+ cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D) which show a similar pattern to that derived from the non-cell-type specific recordings (Figure 2Q). For the analysis of Esr1+ cells ensemble changes following repeated defeat we cannot repeat exactly the same analysis as we have only a single inter-cluster distance between defeat 1 and 2 and cannot compare it to any other inter-cluster distances like we did for the non-cell-type specific recordings where each animal underwent 3 aggression experiences in addition to the defeats. As a result, we performed direct statistical comparison of the defeats (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P = 0.0001 for each mouse) as well as a machine learning based comparison of predictive accuracy using Esr1+ and non-cell-type specific data (Figure 4—figure supplement 3D). We also compared inner-cluster distance (distance between all pairs of points within a cluster) for defeat 1 and defeat 2 with inter-cluster distance (distance between all pairs of points between clusters) of defeat 1 and 2 Figure 4—figure supplement 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors concluded that &quot;VMHvl neurons promote aggression and defense&quot; based on data from Figure 5. Yet only defensive behavior, no aggression, was analyzed in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We were referring to our data on defense and those published by others showing that ChR2 stimulation of Esr1+ cells can elicit attacks against certain opponents (e.g.</p><p>castrated males, females). However, to avoid confusion we have now removed the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Is the &quot;social interaction&quot; behavior in Figure 5 the same as &quot;close social interaction&quot; defined in Figure 1? If yes, please explain the discrepancy between optogenetic manipulation (activation of VMHvl Esr1+ neurons decreased social interaction, Figure 5) and endoscope recording (more Social+ neurons than Social- neurons found in VMHvl, Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our nomenclature here was confusing. “social interaction” (e.g. Figure 5) occurred when the mice were performing defeat, upright, orientating, sniffing, or following behaviors (see Materials and methods), while “close social interaction” (e.g. Figure 1) refers to the entire time when the mice where in the defeat chamber. We have now clarified this distinction by making changes to the text to explicitly define these terms and use them consistently across the manuscript: “Close social interaction” is now referred to as “social defeat phase”, and “social interaction” has been retained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Are the mice used for the data presented in Figure 5E the same as 5D or are these separate cohorts of mice? If the former, could the repeated optogenetic activation explain some of the effects observed? Please explain/clarify in text.</p></disp-quote><p>These are the same groups of mice with the addition of three mice that served as controls for repeated optogenetic activation and were not stimulated before defeat. Accordingly, in Figure 5E there are four blue traces while in Figure 5D there are seven that include the three control animals. Comparison of these mice shows that there was no apparent impact of prior stimulation. We now explicitly mention this in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Given that the endoscopic imaging lasted for ~1 week (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C) and several comparisons were conducted across days, it is critically important to verify the stability of imaging across different recording days. Please show maps of spatial filters of all cells from each day of imaging and the overlaid filters (see Extended Data Figure 7 in Remedios et al.'s paper (Remedios et al., 2017) for reference). In addition, the authors should think about using a more quantitative measure of ROI stability potentially using an existing algorithm for aligning ROIs across days (such as Sheintuch, L….Ziv, Y. Cell Reports 21(4) pg. 1102, 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added spatial filter maps for each animal and day including a day-by-day comparison series for a representative animal (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We appreciate that algorithms measuring ROI stability, such as in Sheintuch et al., 2017, can be useful for studies depending on automatic unit identification to image hundreds to thousands of neurons at once. However, the relatively small number of units in our study (30-60 neurons per animal) could be assessed reliably using manual identification following previously published methods (e.g. Evans et al., Nature, 2018). In addition, it is difficult in our opinion to evaluate which method is better as we are not aware of any study comparing manual approaches to such algorithms (centroid distance, spatial correlation). We also note that studies using single photon widefield miniscopes for single unit GCaMP imaging in deep brain nuclei always seem to use semi-automated methods where units are manually inspected and selected, possibly due to the poor performance of automated algorithms on the low contrast signal-to-noise images involved (Jennings et al., Cell, 2015; Remedios et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) In the optogenetic experiments the authors say they use a YFP alone control (subsection “Functional remodeling of Esr1+ neurons by social defeat”), but don't show the data. This data should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the figure legend was not clear. Data from the YFP control mice is present as grey lines (Figure 5D, E). We have now adjusted the figure legend to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Please ensure you include full statistical reporting including F, t statistic, degrees of freedom, exact p value, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added full statistical reporting for all figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
