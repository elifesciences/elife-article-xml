complexes is important for human cardiac action potential repolarization. During exercise or fright, <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> is up-regulated by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated Q1 phosphorylation to maintain heart rhythm and optimum cardiac performance. Sympathetic up-regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> requires recruitment of PKA holoenzyme (two regulatory – RI or RII – and two catalytic Cα subunits) to Q1 C-terminus by an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP9). Mutations in Q1 or AKAP9 that abolish their functional interaction result in long QT syndrome type 1 and 11, respectively, which increases the risk of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Here, we investigated the utility of a targeted protein phosphorylation (TPP) approach to reconstitute PKA regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> in the absence of AKAP9. Targeted recruitment of endogenous Cα to E1-YFP using a GFP/YFP nanobody (nano) fused to RIIα enabled acute cAMP-mediated enhancement of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, reconstituting physiological regulation of the channel complex. By contrast, nano-mediated tethering of RIIα or Cα to Q1-YFP constitutively inhibited <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> by retaining the channel intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Proteomic analysis revealed that distinct phosphorylation sites are modified by Cα targeted to Q1-YFP compared to free Cα. Thus, functional outcomes of synthetically recruited PKA on <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> regulation is critically dependent on the site of recruitment within the channel complex. The results reveal insights into divergent regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> by phosphorylation across different spatial and time scales, and suggest a TPP approach to develop new drugs to prevent exercise-induced sudden cardiac death.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KCNQ1</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>long QT syndrome</kwd><kwd>ion channel regulation</kwd><kwd>ion channel trafficking</kwd><kwd>induced proximity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL142111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL122421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM109763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kass</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 HL121253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeted recruitment of protein kinase A subunits enables distinctive regulation of the functional expression of a potassium channel depending on whether the enzyme is targeted to a pore-forming or auxiliary subunit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulating protein functional expression by targeted induced proximity of enzymes (TIPE) is a burgeoning field with great promise for developing therapeutics to conventionally undruggable targets. The leading edge of this broad concept has been targeted protein degradation (TPD) with small-molecule proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) which work by recruiting endogenous E3 ubiquitin ligases to chosen proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schneekloth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nalawansha and Crews, 2020</xref>). Recent promising phase I and II clinical trials of targeted proteins degraders represent a realization of the potential of the overall TIPE approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Békés et al., 2022</xref>). Beyond TPD, there have been nascent efforts to expand the TIPE concept to other physiologically important enzyme classes, including targeted protein stabilization (TPS) via recruitment of deubiquitinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henning et al., 2022</xref>), targeted dephosphorylation using induced proximity of a phosphatase (PhosTACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), lysosome-targeting chimeras that enable degradation of extracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banik et al., 2020</xref>), and targeted protein acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Posttranslational regulation of proteins by phosphorylation is a prominent mechanism for regulating cell biology and physiology that is timely for adaptation to the TIPE idea and has been broached with the development of PhosTACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) and phosphorylation inducing chimeric small molecules (PHICS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siriwardena et al., 2020</xref>). The human genome contains ~500 kinases most of which phosphorylate hydroxyl groups on either serine/threonine or tyrosine residues in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fabbro et al., 2015</xref>). Site-specific phosphorylation of proteins can lead to diverse outcomes including multidimensional regulation of functional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 2000</xref>), protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pennington et al., 2018</xref>), protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2009</xref>), and subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Amri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, individual proteins typically have multiple residues that may be phosphorylated raising the possibility of actuating distinctive functional outcomes depending on the particular complement of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues modified under different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 2000</xref>). Induced recruitment of a kinase to a target may potentially be used to either reconstitute physiologically cognate responses or to realize de novo synthetic regulation of protein activity. Overall, by comparison to TPD or stabilization, regulating proteins by targeted protein phosphorylation (TPP) is a potentially more complex prospect, requiring deeper insights into the rules required to achieve specific desired outcomes.</p><p>Here, we explore these dimensions of TPP by focusing on a cardiac ion channel comprised of pore-forming Q1 and auxiliary E1 subunits. In human heart, Q1/E1 channels give rise to the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current, <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, which is essential for normal cardiac action potential repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>). During sympathetic activation of the heart that occurs during exercise or the fight-or-flight response, β-adrenergic up-regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> occurs via protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of Q1 on N-terminus serine residues (Ser27 and Ser92) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurokawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundby et al., 2013</xref>). This effect is crucial to counterbalance the increase in L-type calcium current, that also occurs during sympathetic activation of the heart, to maintain the action potential duration (APD) in an appropriate range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banyasz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volders et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadsby, 1983</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 cause long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1) due to an increase in the APD that is exacerbated in exercise, thereby elevating the risk of ventricular tachycardias (torsade de pointes) and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>). β-Adrenergic regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> is critically dependent on the A kinase anchoring protein, AKAP9 (yotiao), which binds to the C-terminus of Q1 and acts as a scaffold to recruit PKA holoenzyme (comprised of two regulatory RI or RII and two catalytic Cα subunits) to the channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx et al., 2002</xref>). Several LQT1 mutations in Q1 C-terminus occur along the binding interface with AKAP9 and may disrupt this crucial protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aromolaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tester et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howard et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, mutations in AKAP9 that diminish the interaction with Q1 act as genetic modifiers of LQT1 and cause LQT11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that we could exploit TIPE to reconstitute PKA-mediated regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> in the absence of AKAP9. If successful, this could pave the way to development of PHICS as therapeutics for LQTS. We utilized an anti-GFP nanobody (nano) to direct PKA RIIα or Cα subunits to YFP-tagged Q1/E1 channel complexes. Targeted recruitment of endogenous Cα to E1-YFP using nanoRIIα fusion protein enabled acute PKA-mediated enhancement of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, reconstituting the physiological regulation of the channel complex. Simply overexpressing free Cα constitutively recapitulated PKA phosphorylation of Q1 and functional regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> which were not further enhanced by targeting nanoCα to E1-YFP. In sharp contrast, nano-mediated tethering of either RIIα or Cα to Q1-YFP eliminated <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> by retaining Q1 intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments. Thus, functional outcomes of synthetically recruited PKA on <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> regulation is critically dependent on the site of recruitment within the Q1/E1 channel complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting RIIα to E1 reconstitutes acute PKA modulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, whereas anchoring it to Q1 inhibits basal current</title><p>We reconstituted <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> by co-expressing Q1+E1 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.

Normalization of the fraction of phosphorylated peptide suggested three residues of potential interest – (S468, S484, and T624) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We tested the impact of mutating these three residues to either alanines (3S/A) or phosphomimetic aspartates (3S/D) on baseline trafficking of Q1-YFP and on nanoCα-mediated decrease in channel surface density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). In WT BBS-Q1-YFP, nanoCα produced a 40% decrease in channel surface density (mean<sub>BTX-647</sub>=1408.25 ± 40.57 a.u., <italic>N</italic>=4 for WT BBS-Q1-YFP+nano; and mean<sub>BTX-647</sub>=849 ± 49.57 a.u., <italic>N</italic>=4 for WT BBS-Q1-YFP+nanoCα; p=0.0003, unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Compared to WT Q1-YFP, 3S-A showed a 27% decrease in the baseline channel surface expression and a substantially reduced response to nanoCα (mean<sub>BTX-647</sub>=1023.5 ± 10.99 a.u., <italic>N</italic>=4 for BBS-Q1[3S/A]-YFP+nano; and mean<sub>BTX-647</sub>=880 ± 44.15 a.u., <italic>N</italic>=4 for BBS-Q1[3S/A]-YFP+nanoCα; p=0.063, unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The diminished effect of nanoCα on S3-A suggests that increased phosphorylation of at least one of the three residues plays a significant role in the impact of nanoCα on WT Q1 surface density. However, the unexpected decreased baseline surface expression of 3S-A suggests a potential positive effect of phosphorylation of at least one of these residues on basal surface density. Consistent with this interpretation, 3S-D showed an intermediate effect with a 19% decrease in baseline surface density compared to WT, and a diminished response to nanoCα (mean<sub>BTX-647</sub>=1023.5 ± 10.99 a.u., <italic>N</italic>=4 for BBS-Q1[3S/D]-YFP+nano; and mean<sub>BTX-647</sub>=880 ± 44.15 a.u., <italic>N</italic>=4 for BBS-Q1[3S/D]-YFP+nanoCα; p=0.063, unpaired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Overall, we conclude that phosphorylation of multiple Ser/Thr residues underlie the large impact of nanoCα targeted to the Q1 C-terminus on channel surface density. Moreover, our results suggest that phosphorylation of distinct Ser/Thr residues may have either a positive or negative impact on channel trafficking, and channel surface density will be determined by a combinatorial contribution of these negative and positive influences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>PKA is known to phosphorylate over 100 distinct substrates in cells, altering protein function to powerfully regulate physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shabb, 2001</xref>). In the heart, β-adrenergic agonist activation of PKA results in the increase in contractility and heart rate that underlies the fight-or-flight response. PKA activation increases cardiac L-type currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub>) by phosphorylating the small G-protein Rad which constitutively inhibits a sub-population of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finlin et al., 2003</xref>). Phosphorylation of residues in the Rad C-terminus causes it to disengage from the channel, resulting in augmented <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> that is critical for the positive inotropic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papa et al., 2022</xref>). If unopposed, the PKA-mediated elevated inward <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca,L</sub> would result in a prolongation of the APD during exercise or fright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volders et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadsby, 1983</xref>). This would have two adverse consequences. First, a diminished diastolic period would result in inadequate filling of the heart during diastole, particularly in light of the increased heart rate. Second, the prolonged APD would increase the propensity for lethal cardiac arrhythmias. These injurious sequelae are normally prevented because PKA also increases the amplitude and slows deactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, providing a countercurrent that serves to maintain a physiologically optimum APD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banyasz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Volders et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadsby, 1983</xref>). PKA regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> critically depends on the scaffold protein AKAP9 which binds KCNQ1 and anchors the PKA holoenzyme in proximity to the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx et al., 2002</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in KCNQ1 cause LQT1, characterized by a prolonged APD and increased susceptibility to exertion triggered lethal cardiac arrhythmias. Some LQT1 mutations occur on the binding interface with AKAP9, and thus render the channel unable to be regulated in response to β-adrenergic receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx et al., 2002</xref>). Further, human mutations in AKAP9 that inhibit the interaction with KCNQ1 have been proposed to cause LQT11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). We show here that the scaffolding function of AKAP9 that enables acute PKA regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> can be supplanted by a nanobody fused to RIIa and targeted to E1 in the channel complex. This result suggests a novel approach to develop treatments for LQTS cases arising from disruption of Q1/AKAP9 molecular and/or functional interaction – bivalent small molecules that induce proximity of RIIα/RIIβ (or RI) to E1. This approach would require the generation of a nanobody or other antibody-mimetic that binds to the intracellular domain of E1. Beyond <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, diverse AKAPs play an essential role in the proper organization and restriction of PKA signaling to distinct proteins and organelles, and disruption of this capacity leads to serious pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kjällquist et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gold et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest a bioengineering approach to rectify such aberrant PKA signaling even in the case of a malfunctioning AKAP.</p><p>We surprisingly found that nanoRIIα and nanoCα targeted to the C-terminus of Q1 yielded a qualitatively different outcome compared to when they were recruited to E1 C-terminus. The contrasting results illustrate both the challenges and opportunities likely to be encountered in adapting targeted induced proximity of kinases. By contrast with the binary outcomes achieved with the more established TPD with PROTACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Békés et al., 2022</xref>), and more recently TPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henning et al., 2022</xref>), PHICS are likely to yield more diverse and nuanced outcomes, in part because the complement of residues modified may depend on the targeting site. The nanobody-based method we have outlined here offers a way to establish the rules that enable a more rational approach to the design and development of PHICS with predicted outcomes. The finding that nanoRIIα directed to Q1 C-terminus constitutively inhibited channel trafficking indicates that Cα is recruited to the channel complex but not absolutely held in an inactive state under basal conditions. This is most likely due to basal levels of cAMP in the cells being sufficient to bind to nanoRIIα tethered to Q1 C-terminus and thereby partially activate PKA to an extent where it can chronically affect channel trafficking. In this configuration, the Cα need not dissociate from nanoRIIα in order to phosphorylate Q1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Is the dramatic decrease in channel trafficking and <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> induced by nanoCα targeted to Q1 a de novo functional property, or is it an amplified version of a naturally occurring phosphate-switch mechanism that controls Q1 surface density? To this point, proteomics analyses indicated that several Ser/Thr residues are basally phosphorylated and that this modification is selectively potentiated by nanoCα targeted to Q1, in contrast to free Cα expression. Interestingly, examination of the subcellular localization of Q1-YFP indicates expression of the channel in the ER, Golgi, and the plasma membrane. Distinctive regulation of Q1 surface density by kinases has been reported in several previous studies. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate decreased <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> density by &gt;60% within 30 min in transfected CHO cells due to Q1/E1 internalization that was dependent on E1 residue S102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanda et al., 2011</xref>). Stimulation of α<sub>1</sub> adrenergic receptors produces an acute inhibition of Q1-alone currents (60% reduction in 30 min) mediated by an internalization of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurakami et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanism was proposed to involve α1 adrenergic receptor activation of AMPK which subsequently stimulates Nedd4-2 to increase Q1 ubiquitination and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurakami et al., 2019</xref>). By comparison with these previously reported forms of kinase-mediated inhibition of Q1 surface density, the mechanism described here is clearly distinct, having a slower time course, and being independent of either E1 expression or Nedd4-2 involvement. The characteristics of the targeted nanoCα/nanoRIIα-mediated inhibition of Q1 trafficking are most akin to a reported chronic down-regulation of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> attributed to a PKCε-induced reduction in Q1 forward trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gou et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that the chronic targeting of PKA to Q1 C-terminus amplifies a physiological phosphorylation-controlled forward trafficking gate that is normally regulated by another kinase(s) such as, potentially, PKCε.</p><p>It is worth noting that there are aspects of AKAP function on <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> that we would not expect to be reconstituted with the current configuration of nanoRIIα. Beyond acting as a mere scaffold, binding of AKAP9 to Q1 itself has been shown to modulate channel gating downstream of PKA phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurokawa et al., 2004</xref>). Further, in addition to anchoring PKA, AKAPs typically serve as hubs that tether other enzymes including phosphatases and phosphodiesterases that influence spatiotemporal aspects of kinase action on substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong and Scott, 2004</xref>). AKAP9 binds to the Q1 C-terminus and would thus tether the PKA holoenzyme to this site in the channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, Q1/E1/AKAP9 complexes are not absolutely retained intracellularly, unlike what we observe for nanoCα, and to a lesser extent for nanoRIIα, targeted to Q1-YFP. One possibility to account for the apparent discrepancy is that a phosphatase anchored near Q1 by AKAP9 rapidly dephosphorylates residues that when phosphorylated result in channel retention. Alternatively, the relatively large size of AKAP9 (453 kDa) could position the PKA holoenzyme in a geometrically unfavorable configuration to phosphorylate residues involved in the channel intracellular retention response.</p><p>Overall, our findings advance the notion of targeted phosphorylation by recruitment of kinases as a versatile mechanism to control protein function as potent research tools or potential therapeutics. Exploring the numerous potential applications of this iteration of TIPE technology is an interesting prospect for future experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Rabbit anti-Q1 antibody (1:1000, Alomone labs, Israel) and rabbit anti-actin antibody (1:2000, Abcam, USA) were used to detect total Q1 channels or actin protein in the lysate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Cells were plated in 3.5 cm culture dishes on the stage of an inverted microscope (OLYMPUS BH2-HLSH, Precision Micro Inc, Massapequa, NY, USA). Currents were recorded at room temperature (RT) using the whole-cell patch clamp technique by an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA, USA). Patch clamp protocols have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terrenoire et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, after 500 ms of holding potential at –70 mV, the voltage was stepped to +60 mV for 2 s and then followed by 2 s repolarizing pulses to –40 mV during which <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> tail current was measured (stimulation frequency was 0.06 Hz). External solution contained the following: 132 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and 5 mM glucose (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Internal solution contained the following: 110 mM KCl, 5 mM ATP-K<sub>2</sub>, 11 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH was adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). Pipette series resistance was typically 1.5–3 MΩ when filled with internal solution. Currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Traces were acquired at a repetition interval of 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry assay</title><p>Cell surface and total ion channel pools were assayed by flow cytometry in live, transfected HEK293 cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aromolaran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanner et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, 48 hr post-transfection, cells cultured in 12-well plates were gently washed with ice-cold PBS containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (in mM: 0.9 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.49 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4), and then incubated for 30 min in blocking medium (DMEM with 3% BSA) at 4°C. The cells were then incubated with 1 μM Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (BTX-647; Life Technologies) in DMEM/3% BSA on a rocker at 4°C for 1 hr, followed by washing three times with PBS (containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Cells were gently harvested in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PBS, and assayed by flow cytometry using a BD LSRII Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins were excited at 407 and 488 nm, respectively, and Alexa Fluor 647 was excited at 633 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>HEK293 cells transfected with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged KCNQ1 and subcellular marker proteins for ER or Golgi (mCherry-tagged) with either nano, nanoCα, or nanoRIIα with CFP marker were analyzed 24–48 hr after transfection using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a ×100 objective (Plan Apo VC ×100 Oil DIC N2, Nikon). Images were acquired and analyzed with NIS Elements AR 4 software (Nikon).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot and proteomics sample preparation</title><p>HEK293/CHO cells were washed once with PBS without Ca<sup>2+</sup>, harvested, and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer containing (in mM) Tris (20, pH 7.4), EDTA (1), NaCl (150), 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (10 μL/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), PMSF (1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and Phosstop phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Lysates were prepared by incubation at 4°C for 1 hr, with occasional vortex, and cleared by centrifugation (10,000×<italic>g</italic>, 10 min, 4°C). Supernatants were transferred to new tubes, with aliquots removed for quantification of total protein concentration determined by the bis-cinchonic acid protein estimation kit (Pierce Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA).</p><p>For immunoprecipitation, lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with 20 µL Protein A/G Sepharose beads (Rockland) bound to anti-Rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 3 hr at 4°C. Equivalent total protein amounts were added to spin-columns containing 75 µL Protein A/G Sepharose beads incubated with 4 µg anti-Q1 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel), tumbling overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three to five times with RIPA buffer, spun down at 500×<italic>g</italic>, eluted with 40 µL of warmed sample buffer (50 mM Tris, 10% [vol/vol] glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mM DTT, and 0.2 mg/mL bromophenol blue), and boiled (55°C, 15 min). Proteins were resolved on a 4–12% Bis·Tris gradient precast gel (Life Technologies) in MOPS-SDS running buffer (Life Technologies) at 200 V constant for ~1 hr. We loaded 10 μL of the PageRuler Plus Prestained Protein Ladder (10–250 kDa, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) alongside the samples.</p><p>For proteomic analysis, the gels were stained with SimplyBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Q1 monomer and dimer bands were excised. In-gel digestion was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>) with minor modifications. Gel slices were washed with 1:1 acetonitrile and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min then dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile for 10 min until shrunk. The excess acetonitrile was removed, gel slices were dried in speed-vacuum at RT for 10 min and then reduced with 5 mM DTT for 30 min at 56°C in an air thermostat, cooled down to RT, and alkylated with 11 mM IAA for 30 min with no light. Gel slices were then washed with 100 mM of ammonium bicarbonate and 100% acetonitrile for 10 min each. Excess acetonitrile was removed and dried in a speed-vacuum for 10 min at RT and the gel slices were re-hydrated in a solution of 25 ng/μL trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min on ice and digested overnight at 37°C in an air thermostat. Digested peptides were collected and further extracted from gel slices in extraction buffer (1:2 ratio by volume of 5% formic acid:acetonitrile) at high speed, shaking in an air thermostat. The supernatants from both extractions were combined and dried in a speed-vacuum. Peptides were dissolved in 3% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid.</p><p>For western blotting, protein bands were transferred from the gel by tank transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane (3.5 hr, 4°C, 30 V constant) in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 15% [vol/vol] methanol, and 0.1% SDS). The membranes were blocked with a solution of 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (TBS-T) (25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hr at RT and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (rabbit anti-phospho-KCNQ1) at 1:250 dilution in blocking solution. The blots were washed with TBS-T three times for 10 min each and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 hr at RT. After washing in TBS-T, the blots were developed with a chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce Technologies) and then visualized on a gel imager. Membranes were then stripped with harsh stripping buffer (2% SDS, 62 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.8% β-mercaptoethanol) at 50°C for 30 min, rinsed under running water for 2 min, and washed with TBST (3×, 10 min). Membranes were pre-treated with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and re-blotted with rabbit anti-KCNQ1 antibody (1:1000, Alomone labs, Israel) and rabbit anti-actin antibody (1:2000, Abcam, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry</title><p>Desalted peptides were injected in an EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC C18 50 cm × 75 cm ID column (Thermo Scientific) connected to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (Thermo Scientific). Peptides elution and separation were achieved at a non-linear flow rate of 250 nL/min using a gradient of 5–30% of buffer B (0.1% [vol/vol] formic acid, 100% acetonitrile) for 110 min with a temperature of the column maintained at 50°C during the entire experiment. The Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer was used for peptide tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). Survey scans of peptide precursors are performed from 350 to 1500 m/z at 120 K full width at half maximum resolution (at 200 m/z) with a 2×105 ion count target and a maximum injection time of 60 ms. The instrument was set to run in top speed mode with 3 s cycles for the survey and the MS/MS scans. After a survey scan, MS/MS was performed on the most abundant precursors, that is, those exhibiting a charge state from 2 to 6 of greater than 5×103 intensity, by isolating them in the quadrupole at 1.6 Th. We used higher-energy C-trap dissociation with 30% collision energy and detected the resulting fragments with the rapid scan rate in the ion trap. The automatic gain control target for MS/MS was set to 5×104 and the maximum injection time was limited to 30 ms. The dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s with a 10 ppm mass tolerance around the precursor and its isotopes. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>LC-MS/MS data analysis</title><p>Raw mass spectrometric data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 to perform database search and LFQ quantification at default settings. PD2.4 was set up to search with the reference human proteome database downloaded from UniProt and performed the search trypsin digestion with up to two missed cleavages. Peptide and protein false discovery rates were all set to 1%. The following modifications were used for protein identification and LFQ quantification: carbamidomethyl(C) was set as fixed modification and variable modifications of oxidation (M) and acetyl (protein N-term), DiGly (K), and deamination for asparagine or glutamine (NQ). Results obtained from PD2.4 were further used to quantify relative phosphorylated peptide abundances under the different conditions and identifying sites modified on KCNQ1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Patch clamp data, shown as mean ± SEM, were acquired using pCLAMP 8.0 (Axon Instruments) and analyzed with Origin 7.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) and Clampfit 8.2 (Axon Instruments). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.8 software. Statistical data analysis was assessed with Student’s t-test for comparison between two groups and one-way ANOVA for comparisons among more than two groups, followed by pairwise comparisons using Tukey HSD post hoc test. In the figures, data are shown as mean ± SEM, and statistically significant differences to control values are indicated by symbols and described in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Material availability statement</title><p>Plasmid constructs for non-commercial purposes can be obtained by request from the corresponding author after publication of the manuscript.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83466-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript, figures and associated source data files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Ming Chen for technical support.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jon Sack as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rigor and reproducibility need to be more thoroughly addressed as noted in reviewer comments, especially concerning modest effects.</p><p>2) Please increase the rigor of testing for intracellular localization of channels or temper claims and reduce the tone in the discussion/conclusion. Discuss the relevance of mechanisms involving decreased forward trafficking to the plasma membrane versus increased internalization.</p><p>3) Please provide more controls and analysis related to the KCNE1 targeting of PKA domains, or temper claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The evidence that targeting PKA domains to the C-terminus of KCNQ1 leads to distinct phosphorylation and function seems compelling and multifaceted and could be the centerpiece of this study to an even greater extent. The controls for KCNQ1 targeting and related function are mostly outstanding. T198A and rapamycin are especially keen controls.</p><p>The context of the authors' surprise that targeted recruitment to the C-terminus of Q1 yielded a qualitatively different outcome deserves its own section of the introduction and discussion to help readers calibrate the importance of these findings. What precedent is there for a kinase creating distinct phosphorylation patterns on a single protein depending on the submolecular location of recruitment?</p><p>A major recommendation for this manuscript is to provide more controls and analysis related to the KCNE1 targeting of PKA domains, or temper claims of KCNE1 targeting. First, the effect sizes related to KCNE1 targeting seem to be within the cell-to-cell variation, and further elaboration on methods and statistical analyses could help assess the validity of interpretations. Second, controls seem to be missing that could test whether the effects of KCNE1 targeting of PKA subunits specifically result from the nanobody domains binding YFP. Specific instances are noted below.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 Expression of nano-RIIalpha and untagged Q1/E1 seems to be an important (missing) control for the claim of E1 targeting.</p><p>Figure 1 F While SEMs are clearly different, the effect is small. Providing further statistics and elaborating on details of how controls were measured for comparison (interleaved, blinded, etc.) could allay skepticism.</p><p>Page 5 &quot;Targeting PKA-Cα to … E1 with a nanobody&quot; Not clear that PKA-Cα is functionally targeted to E1. Suggest elaborating on evidence for this claim.</p><p>Figure 2B, C, D Clarify whether yotaio was in B, C, D, or just D.</p><p>Figure 2B, F Seeming n=1 western blots provide only weak support for phosphorylation of S27. Evidence could be bolstered by repeats and densitometry.</p><p>Figure 2D Given the overlap of individual tail decay taus, suggest using a statistic for comparison.</p><p>Page 5 &quot;… a small augmentation of basal current amplitude (Figure 2H). These effects were similar to those observed with simple over-expression of free Cα.&quot; Basal current amplitude with simple over-expression of free Cα was not compared.</p><p>Page 5 &quot;…a small augmentation of basal current amplitude (Figure 2H) … did not impact whole-cell current density compared to control (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1).&quot; Unclear why Figure 2H is considered augmentation and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 is no impact.</p><p>Figure 3 Differences between E1 {plus minus} YFP seem minor (especially compared to panel I). Suggest quantitating meanBTX-647 results with E1-YFP in a similar fashion as was done without. Clarifying # of repeats of flow cytometry runs, and run-to-run variability could help.</p><p>Figure 4 – the images from an n=1 cell under each condition are consistent with the narrative, but not compelling, and on their own provide only very weak support for the claim of ER and Golgi localization. To test the claim of colocalization with ER or Golgi markers, quantitation (e.g. colocalization statistics) and evidence of reproducibility across multiple cells/transfections would be helpful.</p><p>Page 6 &quot;Similar results were obtained with other configurations of FKBP and FRB fusion proteins. &quot; Clarify what similar results and other configurations are alluded to.</p><p>Figure 5D Explain more clearly how this data was normalized.</p><p>Page 8 &quot;PHICS are likely to yield more diverse and nuanced outcomes, in part because the complement of residues modified may depend on the targeting site.&quot; Is this claim based solely on the interpretation of results here, or is there another precedent?</p><p>Page 11 &quot;Pipette series resistance was typically 1.5 – 3 MΩ when filled with an internal solution.&quot; Please state what pipette series resistances were in whole cell mode and what range of series-resistance-induced voltage errors cells were tolerated in the analyzed data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a few suggestions that would further strengthen the report.</p><p>1. The main concern of this study is its rigor (or the clarity of statistics throughout). In the methods section, there is a short explanation of the statistics used in this work, but it is not clear for all Figures what (and how) analyses were used. It should be clearly shown what set of data supports each claim with appropriate statistics. The authors state increase/decrease of current amplitude, I/V shifts, 'dramatic' decrease in fluorescence, etc showing only exemplar data but not summaries of data in some cases and/or summaries of data (e.g. kinetics) but not current examples (specific points described below). For instance, one major claim of the study is that targeted phosphorylation of E1, but not Q1, enhances IKs channel complex activity. However, the claim of enhanced IKs activity upon either free Cα or Cα targeted to E1-YFP approaches is very modest (at least what Figures 2C and G show). Part of this concern might be solved by showing appropriate statistical analysis throughout.</p><p>2. Along this line, is the cAMP-mediated enhancement of IKs activity at physiological voltages in the heart?</p><p>3. Another problem is the artificial nature of these systems and reproducibility (or use) in native conditions are concerning.</p><p>4. Furthermore, it is not clear if the reduced cell surface levels of IKs it is either by decreasing its forward trafficking to the plasma membrane or by increasing its internalization. This is important as the authors claim that their approach will have therapeutic relevance to rescue abnormal PKA signaling for some disease-associated AKAP mutations.</p><p>5. To me, speeding up the kinetics of IKs channel might be more physiologically relevant than increasing current amplitude (triggered by sympathetic activation of IKs in the heart during exercise or the fight-or-flight response) and Figure 1E, right does not show changes in IKs kinetics after cAMP/OA whatsoever. Moreover, in Figure 1E, right: the increase of IKs current amplitude upon cAMP/OA application is very modest: is the red trace significantly different from the black one in E-F?</p><p>6. Western blotting and electrophysiology showing Q1 phosphorylation and cAMP-mediated IKs activity upon either free Cα or Cα targeted to E1-YFP, respectively, is very modest (at least what Figure 2C and G shows). Readers would benefit from relative quantification ratios from blots shown in Figure 2B/F. Furthermore, authors should show appropriate statistical analysis supporting the claim of &quot;enhanced IKs channel complex activity&quot;, which concomitantly will strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>7. Page 4, 3rd paragraph: exemplar IKs did not show an increase in current amplitude after breakthrough to the whole-cell configuration if the pipette solution lacked cAMP/OA (Figure 1E, left). In sharp contrast, when cAMP/OA was present in the patch pipette, exemplar IKs displayed a significant increase in current after three minutes of dialysis with intracellular solution (Figure 1E, right). Where do authors show statistical analysis backing up this claim? The only place showing statistics in this figure is in panel (i).</p><p>8. On Page 5, 2nd paragraph: &quot;…we compared key gaiting parameters of currents…&quot;. I agree gating parameters (e.g. kinetics, see point 1) should be thoroughly analyzed. While Figure 2D showed Taudeact for tail currents, there are no original current traces supporting this summarized data. This should be shown. Likewise, original traces supporting data in panels E-H should be added.</p><p>9. Along this line, on Page 5, 2nd paragraph: &quot;Compared to control cells expressing Q1 + E1-YFP + nano, channels co-expressed with nanoCα displayed an increased phosphorylation of Q1 (Figure 2F)&quot; no statistics backing this (see point above). And next &quot;…, a leftward shift in the voltage-dependence of activation (V0.5,act = 34.1 {plus minus} 4.4 mV, n = 10 for Q1 + E1-YFP + nano and V0.5,act = 25.2 {plus minus} 3.4, n = 10 for Q1 + E1-YFP + nano Cα, p = 0.049) (Figure 2G), and a small augmentation of basal current.</p><p>10. Amplitude (Figure 2H).&quot; but Figure legend does not show statistics and Figure 2H does not show what test was used.</p><p>11. Page 6, 1st paragraph: &quot;…a dramatic decrease in BTX-647 fluorescence compared to nano control…&quot;. I don't see a reason for this &quot;dramatic&quot; change when no statistical analysis where done/shown in Figure 3H-I.</p><p>12. Page 6. 1st paragraph at the end: &quot;(Figure 3, H and I), indicating that recruiting these PKA subunits to Q1 C-terminus suppresses channel surface trafficking, and rationalizing the inhibitory impact on IKs&quot;.</p><p>13. Why not the enhancement of channel retrieval from the membrane?</p><p>14. The authors should explain better the section &quot;Inducible recruitment of nanoCα to Q1 reveals slow temporal regulation of channel trafficking&quot; on page 6. To me, the narrative of this part of the paper is insufficiently and/or convolutely described and it is hard to follow. Please define what is FKBP and FRB etc.</p><p>15. Overall, it is not clear if the reduced cell surface levels of IKs it is either by decreasing its forward trafficking to the plasma membrane or by increasing its internalization.</p><p>16. Would these findings be mirrored in cardiomyocytes? It has been shown that the heart, besides expressing KCNQ1 and KCNE1 subunits, also expresses the KCNQ1-modulatory auxiliary subunits KCNE2 and KCNE3 (PMID: 15698834). Functional consequences of IKs activity upon phosphorylation of residue S27 in KCNQ1 vary depending on the presence of KCNE1 and KCNE3 in the channel complexes. Furthermore, on its own, KCNE1 modulates KCNQ1 internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis of KCNQ1 (PMID: 19202166). How these facts affect the conclusion should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83466.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rigor and reproducibility need to be more thoroughly addressed as noted in reviewer comments, especially concerning modest effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have responded to the reviewer comments on rigor and reproducibility by performing additional experiments and analyses.

The main concern of this study is its rigor (or the clarity of statistics throughout). In the methods section, there is a short explanation of the statistics used in this work, but it is not clear for all Figures what (and how) analyses were used. It should be clearly shown what set of data supports each claim with appropriate statistics. The authors state increase/decrease of current amplitude, I/V shifts, 'dramatic' decrease in fluorescence, etc showing only exemplar data but not summaries of data in some cases and/or summaries of data (e.g. kinetics) but not current examples (specific points described below). For instance, one major claim of the study is that targeted phosphorylation of E1, but not Q1, enhances IKs channel complex activity. However, the claim of enhanced IKs activity upon either free Cα or Cα targeted to E1-YFP approaches is very modest (at least what Figures 2C and G show). Part of this concern might be solved by showing appropriate statistical analysis throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback, we have now included statistical information for all the figures individually as suggested to improve clarity. Changes made in the text are indicated for specific questions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Along this line, is the cAMP-mediated enhancement of IKs activity at physiological voltages in the heart?</p></disp-quote><p>The cAMP-mediated enhancement of IKs serves to limit the increase in action potential duration that would otherwise occur due to increased L-type calcium current. So, yes, this regulation occurs at physiological voltages in the heart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another problem is the artificial nature of these systems and reproducibility (or use) in native conditions are concerning.</p></disp-quote><p>This study was conceived to design and test a novel approach to reconstitute I<sub>Ks</sub> modulation using PHICS. While it is true that the experiments were done in heterologous systems, the findings serve as proof-of-concept to potentially develop these tools as therapeutics. We have added a sentence noting this limitation and the importance of future studies in native conditions (p8/9):</p><p>“This approach would require the generation of a nanobody or other antibody-mimetic that binds to the intracellular domain of E1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Furthermore, it is not clear if the reduced cell surface levels of IKs it is either by decreasing its forward trafficking to the plasma membrane or by increasing its internalization. This is important as the authors claim that their approach will have therapeutic relevance to rescue abnormal PKA signaling for some disease-associated AKAP mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Because nanoCα and nanoRIIα substantially decrease the steady-state surface density of Q1-YFP, it is challenging to experimentally determine whether the effect is due to decreased forward trafficking or increased endocytosis (or both) due to unfavorable signal to noise. We speculate that the reduced surface density by targeting C<italic>α</italic> to KCNQ1 results in decreased forward trafficking due to the increase in its colocalization with ER and Golgi markers (Figure 4) and the length of time it takes for the decrease in surface density to become evident using the rapamycin-mediated induced recruitment approach (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. To me, speeding up the kinetics of IKs channel might be more physiologically relevant than increasing current amplitude (triggered by sympathetic activation of IKs in the heart during exercise or the fight-or-flight response) and Figure 1E, right does not show changes in IKs kinetics after cAMP/OA whatsoever. Moreover, in Figure 1E, right: the increase of IKs current amplitude upon cAMP/OA application is very modest: is the red trace significantly different from the black one in E-F?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statistical analyses to support the claim of a significant difference to the data in Figure 1F.
