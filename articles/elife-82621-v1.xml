Here, we study the organization of Piezo1 in red blood cells using a combination of super-resolution microscopy techniques and electron microscopy. Piezo1 adopts a non-uniform distribution on the red blood cell surface, with a bias toward the biconcave ‘dimple’. Trajectories of diffusing Piezo1 molecules, which exhibit confined Brownian diffusion on short timescales and hopping on long timescales, also reflect a bias toward the dimple. This bias can be explained by ‘curvature coupling’ between the intrinsic curvature of the Piezo dome and the curvature of the red blood cell membrane. Piezo1 does not form clusters with itself, nor does it colocalize with F-actin, Spectrin, or the Gardos channel. Thus, Piezo1 exhibits the properties of a force-through-membrane sensor of curvature and lateral tension in the red blood cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>piezo</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd><kwd>red blood cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10RR031855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Priyam</given-names></name><name><surname>North</surname><given-names>Alison J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-2051681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haselwandter</surname><given-names>Christoph A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1554716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haselwandter</surname><given-names>Christoph A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM043949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Super-resolution microscopy and single particle tracking analysis of Piezo1 in red blood cells demonstrate its ability to sense membrane curvature, consistent with a force-through-membrane mechanism of channel mechanosensation in these cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Red blood cells (RBCs) experience significant mechanical forces in their lifetime as they traverse the mammalian circulatory system, squeezing through capillaries of smaller diameters than themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chien, 1987</xref>). Central to the ability of RBCs to deform in response to shear stress is their biconcave disk shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lister, 1827</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mohandas and Evans, 1994</xref>). RBCs lack organelles and a transcytosolic network and their biconcave shape is instead imparted by the plasma membrane and the membrane skeleton, a 2D quasihexagonal network of actin filament (F-actin) nodes connected by (α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-spectrin tetramers bound to transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fowler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gratzer, 1981</xref>). In response to shear stress a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is activated in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Larsen et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dyrda et al., 2010</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into RBCs modulates junctional protein interactions in the membrane skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nunomura, 2006</xref>) in addition to activating the Gardos channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gardos, 1958</xref>), a K<sup>+</sup> channel, leading to K<sup>+</sup> efflux and subsequent cell volume decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danielczok et al., 2017</xref>), which together facilitate flexibility of the cell membrane.</p><p>Piezo1 was first suggested as the mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in RBCs after identification of gain-of-function mutations in patients with dehydrated xerocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andolfo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent studies using a hematopoietic PIEZO1 knockout mouse confirmed that the channel is responsible for stretch-induced calcium influx in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>). How Piezo1 is organized in the RBC membrane, however, is not known. The unique biconcave shape of the RBC poses interesting questions about how membrane curvature, which locally is known to be important for Piezo1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haselwandter and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>), might globally impact Piezo1 distribution and function. It has been proposed that due to its intrinsic curvature, Piezo1 might tend to concentrate in the dimple region of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Svetina et al., 2019</xref>), but direct experimental evidence is lacking. More broadly, how Piezo channels are organized in cell membranes is poorly understood. Based on electrophysiological recordings in overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>) or fluorescence microscopy of a stable cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ridone et al., 2020</xref>), some authors have reported clustering of Piezo1, but channel densities in both cases are likely non-physiological. Extensive patch-clamp studies and simulation of Piezo1 densities in neuro2Acells, which express Piezo1 natively, led others to the conclusion that Piezo1 channels are homogenously expressed across cell membranes and function as independent mechanotransducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lewis and Grandl, 2021</xref>). Additionally, it is unclear what role the actin cytoskeleton plays in organizing and gating the Piezo1 channel in cells. Piezo1 can be pressure activated in membrane blebs lacking cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 2016</xref>) and exhibits spontaneous openings in asymmetric lipid droplet bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with a ‘force-from-lipids’ model of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martinac et al., 1990</xref>). Others claim that Piezo1 is tethered to the actin cytoskeleton and is gated by a ‘force-from-filament’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set out to image and analyze the organization of Piezo1 channels in RBC membranes. The small size of RBCs and their inherent autofluorescence makes them refractory to conventional fluorescence microscopy, so we employed more sensitive super-resolution microscopic methods. Fluorescent Piezo1 spots can be resolved into single Piezo1 channels which, along with electron microscopy studies, confirm that they do not cluster in RBC membranes. Although not clustering, we find a non-uniform distribution of Piezo1 in the RBC membrane with enrichment at the dimple, which can be rationalized through the energetic coupling of the intrinsic curvature of Piezo1 to the curvature of the surrounding membrane. Single particle tracking (SPT) studies of Piezo1 demonstrate its lateral mobility in the plasma membrane. This is consistent with co-immunostaining analysis, suggesting that Piezo1 is not tethered to the membrane skeleton. Mobility of Piezo1 in the RBC membrane permits Piezo1 to explore the curvature landscape of the RBC surface and may allow Piezo1 to respond to local and global changes in membrane curvature as well as membrane tension.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and localization of Piezo1 in red blood cells</title><p>To detect Piezo1 in RBCs a <italic>Piezo1<sup>HA</sup></italic> mouse line was generated (Jackson Laboratories) in which an HA epitope tag was inserted into an extracellular loop of the PIEZO1 gene. The HA-tagged Piezo1 channel functions similar to the WT channel in electrophysiological recordings of HEK cells and could be specifically detected by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, only RBCs from the <italic>Piezo1<sup>HA</sup></italic> mice and not wildtype mice showed fluorescent signal when immunostained with an anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), confirming clear expression of Piezo1 in RBCs.

These spots are distributed on the RBC membrane, here contoured by phalloidin staining of actin, which forms part of the actin–spectrin network bound to the cytosolic face of the RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ballas and Krasnow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). 3D reconstructions from z-stacks reveal ~80 Piezo1 puncta per RBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting a relatively low copy number of channels per RBC, similar to estimations of Gardos channel number per RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lew et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brugnara et al., 1993</xref>) and in contrast to very abundant RBC membrane proteins such as Band3, which is estimated to have a copy number of 1 million per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fairbanks et al., 1971</xref>).

In 3D-SIM images of labeled intact RBCs, fluorescent Piezo1 spots are relatively uniform in size and do not appear to cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, our SIM data are diffraction limited by an <italic>XY</italic> resolution of ~120 nm at best and thus each individual spot could feasibly contain a few Piezo1 channels (~23 nm diameter) tightly packed together. To address whether fluorescent spots represent single or multiple Piezo1 channels we therefore employed stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</xref>), which can achieve resolutions below 50 nm and down to for example 22 nm after deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schoonderwoert et al., 2013</xref>), depending on the selected dyes. Owing to the absorption of high-power lasers by heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schloetel et al., 2019</xref>), it was not possible to image intact RBCs by STED. Instead, RBCs adhered to poly-lysine coated coverslips were unroofed by a stream of isotonic buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swihart et al., 2001</xref>), washing away hemoglobin and leaving patches of RBC membrane still bound to the actin–spectrin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The approximate flat dimensionality of unroofed RBCs also enabled us to use facilitated image acquisition 2D STED mode to achieve maximal <italic>XY</italic> resolutions of ~40 nm by full width half maximum (FWHM) in single images, closer to the size of a Piezo1 channel. Approximately 26 ± 7 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 cells) spots were observed per unroofed RBC, which equates to ~0.6 puncta/μm<sup>2</sup>, consistent with the Piezo1 abundance observed in SIM images of intact RBCs. Piezo1 spots in 3D-SIM images of intact RBCs show a range of nearest neighbor distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) with an average nearest spot distance of 540 ± 37 nm (<italic>n =</italic> 19 cells). This is similar to the observed distribution of Piezo1 spots in 2D STED images of unroofed RBC membranes, where the nearest spot distance is 544 ± 106 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 12 cells) and is consistent with fluorescent Piezo1 spots not clustering in the RBC membrane. Further cluster analysis of Piezo1 spots in 2D STED images by 2D spatial analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrey et al., 2010</xref>) shows no statistical difference between the observed spot distribution and a simulation of randomly distributed spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Piezo1 does not cluster in red blood cells (RBCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative 2D stimulated emission depletion (STED) image of an unroofed RBC immunostained with an anti-HA tag antibody for Piezo1 (green) and labeled with phalloidin STAR 580 for F-actin (magenta).

Post-deconvolution, we observed that a significant number of fluorescent spots resolved into triplets of bright spots, consistent with labeling each arm of the trimeric structure of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In a single field of view, we can often observe multiple triple-labeled Piezo1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Line-scan analysis of the intensity between resolved bright pixels after deconvolution yields a pixel size-limited distance of ~25 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This distance is consistent across analysis of all bright puncta that resolve into triplets, which we would not expect if these puncta represented multiple channels clustering. Further, Piezo1 puncta never resolve beyond triplets, consistent with single Piezo1 channels where all three antibody-binding sites are occupied, and not multiple trimeric Piezo1 channels clustered tightly together. The occurrence of triple-labeled Piezo1 in our STED data suggests we are toward the upper limit of labeling. An important corollary to this conclusion is that, at least if the probability of observing a given number of antibodies bound to each Piezo1 channel is non-cooperative, we should expect only a small fraction of Piezo1 channels to be unlabeled, giving us confidence in our estimation of Piezo1 channel number per RBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We further analyzed Piezo1 distribution in unroofed red blood cells by negative stain electron microscopy using an 18-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Gold particles were distributed over the unroofed RBC membrane without apparent clustering, comparable to the distribution of fluorescent spots in STED images. Gold particles were not observed in RBCs from control mice. By negative stain electron microscopy, we were also able to observe triplets of gold particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) with an inter-particle distance of ~25 nm, consistent with our 2D STED imaging of labeled trimeric Piezo1 channels. Thus, using multiple imaging approaches, we do not observe Piezo1 clustering in the RBC membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Piezo1 is enriched at the dimple region of RBC membranes</title><p>We were curious whether Piezo1 is evenly distributed throughout the RBC membrane or tends to localize to specific regions of the RBC biconcave disk. Because of its intrinsic curvature, it has been hypothesized that Piezo1 concentrates in the curved dimple of the RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Svetina et al., 2019</xref>). Other force-related proteins such as myosin IIA exhibit a non-uniform membrane density and are enriched at the dimple region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alimohamadi et al., 2020</xref>). Using 2D slices from 3D-SIM images of intact RBCs we segmented the cells into the dimple and rim regions based on F-actin staining of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and quantified the number of Piezo1 puncta per μm<sup>2</sup> surface area of each region using the cell imaging software Imaris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The dimple accounts for about 17% of the total RBC surface area. We find that the whole RBC and rim have similar Piezo1 puncta densities (0.50 ± 0.16 and 0.46 ± 0.17 μm<sup>–2</sup>, respectively) while at the dimple region the density is higher (0.80 ± 0.31 μm<sup>–2</sup>). Thus, there is approximately a twofold enrichment of Piezo1 at the dimple region of RBC membranes compared to the rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This enrichment of Piezo1 at the dimple region of the RBC membrane is not due to enzymatic deglycosylation of RBCs, which we used to increase antibody binding to HA-tagged Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To strengthen the hypothesis that it is the intrinsic curvature of Piezo1 that biases it toward the curved dimple region of the RBC we also analyzed the dimple versus rim ratio of two other RBC membrane proteins that are not intrinsically curved: the Gardos channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>) and Band3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vallese et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arakawa et al., 2015</xref>).

The degree of biconcavity was parameterized as the ratio of the maximum to minimum heights of RBCs at a central <italic>XZ</italic> slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Indeed, with increasing RBC biconcavity, we observe a greater enrichment of Piezo1 at the dimple (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). If the distribution of Piezo1 in the RBC membrane is determined by the coupling of the channels’ intrinsic curvature to the global curvature of the membrane we would expect an unfavorable distribution of Piezo1 into membrane protrusions where the membrane curvature is opposing to that of Piezo1’s. Treatment of RBCs with NaSalicyate, which preferentially binds into the outer membrane leaflet, generates echinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 1999</xref>), RBCs that are characterized by ‘thorny’ membrane protrusions. 3D-SIM imaging of labeled echinocytes qualitatively shows a depletion of Piezo1 channels from such membrane protrusions relative to regions of negative membrane curvature, further supporting a mechanism of curvature coupling between the intrinsic curvature of Piezo1 and the surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The relative abundance of Piezo1 in the dimple and positive correlation with the degree of biconcavity indicates that RBC membrane curvature might be the primary determinant of the Piezo1 distribution. The intrinsic curvature of Piezo1 suggests a possible mechanism, based on ‘curvature coupling’, for bias toward the dimple. To examine the plausibility of this mechanism, we developed a simple physical model of Piezo1 curvature coupling in which Piezo1 is represented as a spherical cap with area 450 nm<sup>2</sup> and approximate radius of curvature 42 nm, the estimated asymptotic value in a planar membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haselwandter et al., 2022a</xref>). To describe the RBC shape, we used the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beck, 1978</xref> and calculated the mean curvature at each point on the surface (<italic>Methods</italic>). Then, using the Helfrich functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Helfrich, 1973</xref>), we calculated the minimum shape energy of the membrane surrounding Piezo1 in a vesicle that, if spherical, would have a radius of curvature equal to the reciprocal of the mean curvature at that point on the RBC surface. This procedure associates each point on the RBC surface with a membrane curvature energy which, when applied to the Boltzmann distribution equation, yields a probability distribution for the density of Piezo1 on the membrane surface. Further details of this calculation are outlined in <italic>Methods</italic>. The surface distribution of Piezo1 calculated according to this method is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The curvature coupling model predicts an approximately two-fold increase in the density of Piezo1 in the dimple relative to the rim, close to the experimentally observed ratio of densities. In the Beck model of RBC shape, the mean curvature at any point on the RBC surface ranges from 0.24 μm<sup>−1</sup> (favorable to Piezo1 in the dimple) to about −0.52 μm<sup>−1</sup> (unfavorable to Piezo1 in the rim). Because these mean curvatures for the RBC membrane are very small (compare these values to the approximate intrinsic curvature of Piezo1, 1/42 nm ≈24 μm<sup>−1</sup>), it was not immediately clear to us whether Piezo1 would be sensitive to surface curvature in the RBC. The correspondence between experiment and theory suggests that Piezo1 is indeed sensitive to RBC shape and adopts an equilibrium distribution by a mechanism of curvature coupling. If one thinks about this result, the sensitivity of Piezo1 distribution to the global curvature of the RBC membrane implies that the membrane must be relatively smooth. Indeed, this implication is consistent with electron microscopic images of healthy RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marikovsky and Danon, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lewis et al., 1968</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Piezo1 is mobile within the red blood cell plasma membrane</title><p>The above distribution of Piezo1 according to the curvature coupling model suggests that Piezo1 ought to be laterally mobile so that it can explore the curvature landscape of the RBC membrane. However, the quasihexagonal actin–spectrin meshwork and large junctional protein complexes that make up the RBC membrane layer are known to corral and confine membrane protein diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sheetz, 1983</xref>). Additionally, at least some membrane proteins, including roughly one third of Band3, are essentially immobilized by direct binding to actin–spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tomishige et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsuji et al., 1988</xref>). We studied Piezo1 mobility in the RBC membrane with SPT using 40-nm gold nanoparticles conjugated to a secondary antibody under differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). The fast time resolution and ability to record over minutes without photobleaching has advantages for studying confined membrane protein diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tomishige et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daumas et al., 2003</xref>). Gold particles could be unambiguously identified on RBC membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We imaged at 100 Hz for 2 min. In recordings lasting 2 min we observed a range of Piezo1 diffusion trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Most trajectories exhibited confined diffusion, although sometimes Piezo1 appeared to be freely diffusing. Occasionally, we observed both types of diffusion in a single recording. In all cases, Piezo1 was more mobile than in control cells chemically fixed with paraformaldehyde, when analyzed by a mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For confined trajectories, we find that the confinement diameter is in the range of 200–600 nm. Although limited by the spatial resolution of our recordings, this range is largely consistent with the organization of the actin–spectrin meshwork we observe by 2D STED imaging of unroofed RBCs stained for actin or spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to smaller corrals of intact actin–spectrin, we find voids deficient in actin or spectrin staining, approximately 200–500 nm in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such voids in the actin–spectrin skeleton have also been observed by Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) studies on RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Plotting the average MSD of the first 5 s of Piezo1 tracks yielded an apparent macroscopic diffusion coefficient of 0.0075 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which is similar to that of the mobile population of Band3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tomishige et al., 1998</xref>) and likely reflects occasional localized periods of confinement within actin–spectrin corrals over time. Microscopic diffusion was also analyzed by plotting the average MSD of the first 50 ms of Piezo1 tracks before the channel will tend to become localized within confinement zones. This analysis yielded an apparent diffusion coefficient of 0.037 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, consistent with measurements of freely diffusing Piezo1 in mouse neural stem progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>).

It is possible that a 40-nm gold particle may somewhat slow diffusion of membrane-embedded Piezo1, leading to an underestimation of its diffusion coefficient by our calculations.

We approximated the dimple as a circle with radius 1.13 μm, comparable to our segmentation based on F-actin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and calculated the frequency at which gold-labeled Piezo1 is within 1.13 μm of an origin defined as the center of the RBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We find that Piezo1 is observed within the dimple 81% of the time during this 1 hr recording, consistent with a preference of Piezo1 for the dimple over the rim. This observed preference for the RBC dimple was not due to slower diffusion here: analysis of tracks that could easily be segmented as at the dimple or the rim yielded macroscopic diffusion coefficients of 0.0086 and 0.0074 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which were not statistically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As the diffusion coefficient is not smaller, we can understand the observed bias toward the dimple as resulting from curvature coupling between Piezo1’s shape and the membrane’s curvature.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82621-video2.mp4" id="video2"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Example video recording of a RBCfrom a <italic>Piezo1<sup>HA</sup></italic> mouse immunolabeled with a 40-nm gold particle and imaged under differential interference contrast (DIC).</title><p>The recording was made at 1 Hz frequency and lasted 1 hr.

Proteins including ankyrin and protein 4.1 bind both to components of the meshwork and to proteins in the membrane, most commonly Band3 proteins, organizing the RBC membrane into functional microdomains composed of channels and transporters tethered to the actin–spectrin skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lux, 2016</xref>). Using co-immunostaining of unroofed RBC membranes, we asked whether Piezo1 is associated with these well-known complexes. Because of the small size of RBCs and the density of actin–spectrin at the membrane, super-resolution microscopy was necessary to address this question. Indeed, others have claimed that Piezo1 does colocalize with spectrin in red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumitru et al., 2021</xref>), but this study used diffraction-limited confocal microscopy, whereby every red blood cell membrane protein would be expected to show some degree of colocalization with spectrin. We employed 2D STED to image unroofed RBCs. To analyze spatial proximity of two fluorescent signals in our STED datasets we utilized optimal transport colocalization (OTC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tameling et al., 2021</xref>) analysis, which is more appropriate for STED microscopy than traditional pixel-based methods. First, we validated our experimental approach by co-immunostaining proteins of known complexes at the RBC membrane. There are three distinct known populations of Band3: one linked to spectrin via ankyrin, another bound to actin via protein 4.1 and other bridging proteins, and finally proteins that remain untethered to the actin–spectrin meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lux, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kodippili et al., 2009</xref>). A significant fraction of Band3 fluorescent puncta are observed as overlapping or directly adjacent to both F-actin and spectrin puncta by STED microscopy, indicating close spatial proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, we do not observe a significant spatial proximity of Band3 and Piezo1, suggesting that if Piezo1 is tethered to actin–spectrin it is not as part of the Band3 complex. This is quantified by OTC analysis, where we plot the fraction of pixel intensities that is matched (colocalized) at distances less than the defined threshold distance. Following Nyquist sampling, the pixel size of 12.5 nm served as the lower limit of this threshold and the upper limit was set to 300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At a threshold of 100 nm, for example, 0.6 or 60% of signals from Band3 complexes are considered proximal enough to specify as colocalized with both actin and spectrin, consistent with the two aforementioned well-known populations of Band3 complexes. By contrast, only 0.15 or 15% of Piezo1 signals are considered proximal enough to specify as colocalized with Band3. We also co-immunostained Piezo1 with F-actin or spectrin to ask whether it is tethered to the RBC membrane skeleton. We do not observe significant spatial proximity between Piezo1 to either F-actin or spectrin by STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). At a threshold of 100 nm we observe an OTC score of only 0.1 for Piezo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, our data show that unlike Band3, Piezo does not tend to exhibit close spatial proximity to actin or spectrin and is unlikely to bind to the membrane skeleton, consistent with its observed mobility in tracking experiments.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Piezo1 does not appear to interact with the membrane skeleton.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exemplary STED microscopy images assessing interactions of Band3 (upper panels) and Piezo1 (lower panels) with known members of the RBC membrane skeleton as well as with each other and with KCNN4.

How Piezo1 is organized in different cell types and how this might pertain to the sensing of different types of physiological force is currently not well understood. Here we studied Piezo1 organization in RBCs, both because of the clear importance of Piezo1 in RBC physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>) and because of the unique cellular structure of RBCs, particularly their biconcave disk shape.</p><p>At the smallest level of Piezo1 organization, that is with itself, we find that Piezo1 does not cluster in the RBC membrane. By 3D-SIM microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) we observe diffraction-limited fluorescent spots that could technically represent multiple, closely located, Piezo1 channels. To distinguish these spots as individual channels, we needed to employ 2D STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As the power of the depletion laser was increased to improve resolution, the size of each spot decreased correspondingly, but never resolved into multiple spots, even when the achieved resolution was near the size of the Piezo1 channel. Further, after Huygens deconvolution post-processing of our 2D STED data we could resolve triple-antibody-labeled Piezo1 channels, with an inter-subunit diameter consistent with the channel size. Thus, we conclude that each fluorescent spot, whether viewed by 3D-SIM or 2D STED, corresponds to a single Piezo1 channel. The average distance between Piezo1 channels is approximately 550 nm, although occasionally we observe two to three channels within 100-nm distances. This is in good agreement with studies of neuro2A cells, which natively express Piezo1, that also found that Piezo1 channels do not tend to cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lewis and Grandl, 2021</xref>). While clustering could affect Piezo1 gating through Piezo’s membrane footprint, the precise coupling of Piezo1 gating to clustering would depend on the specific scenario considered, and clustering does not necessarily facilitate gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haselwandter and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>). A relatively homogenous membrane distribution of Piezo1 might be well suited to RBCs that are tumbling through solution, experiencing shear forces from all angles, and may contribute to the remarkable plasticity of RBC shapes under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupire et al., 2012</xref>). Of course, our data on RBCs do not rule out the possibility of Piezo1 clustering in other cell types.</p><p>Because of the intrinsic curvature of Piezo1 we were curious about its distribution as a function of the curvature of the RBC membrane. Experimentally we were able to ask this question through 3D-SIM microscopy, which yielded sufficiently high-resolution spatial information on Piezo1 channels while enabling easy assignment of the RBC dimple and rim membrane regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Per μm<sup>2</sup> area of membrane we find an almost twofold enrichment of Piezo1 in the dimple relative to the rim. Our experimental data can be rationalized by a physical model of curvature coupling between the intrinsic curvature of the Piezo1 dome and the surrounding membrane curvature of the RBC along its biconcave surface (see <italic>Methods</italic>). Whilst the curved biconcave shape of RBCs is unique, the good agreement between our experimental data and theoretical prediction based on energetic curvature coupling would suggest an inherent relationship between Piezo’s intrinsic curvature and the surrounding membrane that is broadly relevant to other cell types. This is because the curvature coupling theory, which was developed with experiments on lipid bilayer vesicles, depends only on the bending elasticity of membranes and the intrinsic curvature of Piezo1, not on the unique shape of RBCs. It will be interesting to explore whether Piezo1, for example, is enriched in membrane invaginations or other curvature-matched membrane regions in different cell types. Recently, a study analyzing overexpressed Piezo1 in HeLa cells showed depletion of the channel from membrane filopodia, consistent with a mechanism of curvature coupling whereby the channel unfavorably distributes into membrane regions of high opposing curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Curvature sensing of membrane proteins by curvature matching has been well documented for other intrinsically curved proteins such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simunovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsai et al., 2021</xref>) proteins. More recently, it has been shown that glycosylation can determine the membrane curvature sensing properties of some proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lu et al., 2022</xref>). It is unclear from our current data whether the enrichment of Piezo1 in the RBC dimple is simply a corollary of the curved structure of Piezo1, which determines the channel’s tension sensitivity as described by the membrane dome model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haselwandter and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>), or whether it also has some important consequences for physiological force sensation of RBCs. In this context, it is noteworthy that the force-generating protein myosin IIA also shows an enrichment in the RBC dimple relative to the RBC rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alimohamadi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with its ability to equilibrate along the RBC surface as a function of membrane curvature, we find that Piezo1 exhibits lateral mobility within the RBC plasma membrane. We used gold nanoparticle tracking under DIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) so we could record for minutes to an hour without being limited by photobleaching and at fast time resolution (100 Hz). This enabled us to record both the confined (&lt;500 nm) diffusion of Piezo1 as well as Piezo1’s ‘hopping’ into more freely diffusing behavior. The spatial scales associated with the confined diffusion regime most likely reflect the compartment sizes of the actin–spectrin meshwork we observe by 2D STED. Such a model of confined diffusion set by actin–spectrin is well documented in RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsuji et al., 1988</xref>) and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujiwara et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to observations by others using STORM microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pan et al., 2018</xref>), we observe ~200–500 nm voids that are deficient in actin or spectrin signal by 2D STED. Similar nanoscale ‘defects’ in the actin–spectrin meshwork have also been observed by atomic force microscopy imaging of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nowakowski et al., 2001</xref>) and may serve as weak points in the meshwork that facilitate fast RBC remodeling during shear stress. Such defects may also permit faster diffusion of transmembrane proteins such as Piezo1.</p><p>Our double labeling experiments suggest that Piezo1 does not form a complex with actin or spectrin, which is consistent with Piezo1’s confined diffusion within the actin–spectrin meshwork compartments, and should be contrasted with the near-immobilization observed for proteins such as CFTR and Band3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kodippili et al., 2009</xref>, 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haggie et al., 2006</xref>), which both form complexes with actin. Additionally, our data are not consistent with Piezo1 being tethered to the underlying actin and activated by a ‘force-from-filament’ mechanism as has been traditionally described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Of course, the actin–spectrin meshwork organizes the RBC membrane into compartments whose boundary conditions could impact how changes in local curvature and lateral tension of the membrane gate Piezo1. This could also explain how chemical agents that disrupt the actin cytoskeleton affect Piezo1 currents in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), that is through changes in organization of the membrane rather than disruption of a direct tether to the channel itself.</p><p>Additionally, we asked whether Piezo1 might be colocalized with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (Gardos) channel. Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux into the RBC through Piezo1 and subsequent activation of the Gardos channel is thought to be the initial step in mechanically activated RBC volume regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danielczok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>). We do not, however, observe significant spatial proximity between Piezo1 and Gardos channels. Given the small size of RBCs, approximately 1 μm thick in the dimple and 2–3 μm thick in the rim, and the Piezo1 density of around 0.5 per μm<sup>2</sup>, it seems that colocalization is probably not necessary for rapid opening of the Gardos channel following Piezo activation. For diffusion in three dimensions, the mean dispersion time can be approximated by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> , <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> the mean distance and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> the diffusion coefficient. The apparent diffusion coefficient for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is in the range 13–65 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakatani et al., 2002</xref>), meaning that Ca<sup>2+</sup> should equilibrate within tens of ms within a RBC. In larger cell types, colocalization of Piezo1 with other channels might be necessary to elicit a functional coupling of ion fluxes. In rat ventricular myocytes, for example, Piezo1 has recently been shown, by diffraction-limited confocal microscopy, to colocalize with transient receptor melastatin (TRPM4) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The experimentally determined values of the intrinsic curvature and the bending stiffness of Piezo1 in lipid bilayers enable us to estimate changes in Piezo1 curvature at the dimple versus the rim of a RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haselwandter et al., 2022a</xref>). We estimate a radius of curvature of 41.4 nm at the dimple and 42.7 nm at the rim and thus the curvature differences across the unperturbed RBC membrane are, alone, insufficient to substantially change the shape of Piezo1, and thus are not expected to open its pore. However, that Piezo1 distributes on the surface of RBCs by sensing the membrane curvature, by corollary, means that it must have the capacity to sense lateral membrane tension by a force-through-membrane mechanism. To see this, consider that Piezo1 has been shown to flex, that is, change its curvature, as a function of local membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haselwandter et al., 2022b</xref>). Consider also that membrane tension changes membrane curvature by flattening it. In this manner, curvature sensing and lateral membrane tension sensing are inextricably linked. This linkage lies at the heart of the membrane dome model of Piezo gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haselwandter and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haselwandter et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haselwandter et al., 2022a</xref>). When RBCs squeeze through small capillaries, the membrane shape as well as the transmembrane pressure change transiently. The resulting changes in membrane curvature and lateral membrane tension can both, according to the membrane dome model of Piezo gating, open Piezo1’s pore to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>HA-tag knock in mice</title><p>C57BL/6 background mice heterozygous for an HA tag knocked into the coding sequence after amino acid position 893 of <italic>Piezo1</italic>, generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.

The following calculation was carried out to assign a (relative) membrane energy, and associated probability density, to Piezo1 at each position <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> on the RBC surface. The aim of this calculation is not to provide a detailed description of RBC membrane shape but, rather, to test whether Piezo1 localization can couple to curvatures on the RBC surface that are 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than the Piezo dome curvature. In particular, Piezo1, modeled as a spherical cap (dome) with area 450 nm<sup>2</sup> and radius of curvature 42 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haselwandter et al., 2022a</xref>), was placed into a vesicle whose radius of curvature, if it were spherical, equals <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>. We note that the above conditions specify the area of the vesicle, which equals the free membrane area plus 450 nm<sup>2</sup>. For positions on the RBC surface at which the orientation (sign) of the RBC curvature matches the orientation of the Piezo1 intrinsic curvature (concave side facing outside the cell) Piezo1 was placed into the vesicle with an inside-out orientation, that is, matching the orientation of the vesicle curvature. Otherwise, Piezo1 was placed into the vesicle with an outside-out orientation. The energy of the vesicle free membrane (outside the perimeter of the Piezo dome) was calculated through minimization of the Helfrich membrane bending energy<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where the lipid bilayer bending modulus <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>20</mml:mn><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the integral is carried out over the entire vesiclefree membrane, subject to the boundary conditions at the Piezo dome-free membrane interface mandated by the shape of the Piezo dome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Helfrich, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haselwandter et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haselwandter et al., 2022a</xref>). The resulting energy as a function of RBC curvature (and, thus, as a function of the position <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> on the RBC surface) was applied to the Boltzmann distribution equation to calculate the probability per unit area of observing Piezo1 across the RBC surface. This probability density is graphed on the surface of the Beck RBC model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Three major assumptions underlie our calculation of the curvature coupling energy. First, Piezo1 is treated as a spherical cap. Second, for each position on the RBC surface the two principal curvatures, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , are used to define a radius of curvature equal to the reciprocal of the mean curvature. Both the first and second assumption simplify the problem by imposing radial symmetry on the system of the Piezo dome and its surrounding membrane. The third assumption is that Piezo1 is sensing the curvature associated with the overall shape of the RBC, rather than the curvature of a locally specified surface (small membrane compartment) with nearby fixed boundaries.</p><p>We also carried out a joint energy minimization of the free membrane as described above while simultaneously permitting Piezo1 to flex, that is, to change its radius of curvature, as part of the energy minimization. This calculation was made possible through our recently determined bending modulus of the Piezo dome itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haselwandter et al., 2022a</xref>). This calculation leads to the conclusion that Piezo1 in an unperturbed RBC should change its mean dome radius of curvature by less than approximately 2 nm as a function of position on the RBC surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Single particle tracking and diffusion analysis</title><p>Washed RBCs were adhered to poly-lysine coated 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTeK) and blocked in blocking buffer before incubation with 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-HA primary (3725; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hr at room temperature.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Zheng Shi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers all agree this is a strong, interesting, and technically innovative study. They have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Note that there are several places where new data, analyses, and discussion are requested to help clarify and strengthen to work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please analyze diffusion in rim vs dimple from the data collected already and only need to analyze (see comments from reviewer #1 for detail).</p><p>2. Measuring the mesh size would provide essential information. This could be accomplished by segmenting the existing actin super-resolution data to see if the &quot;holes&quot; in the cortex are different along the edges, flat areas, or dimples. The 3D data should be sufficient to see if there are &quot;gross&quot; changes in the actin cytoskeleton in different parts of the cell (see comments from reviewer #1 for detail).</p><p>3. The echinocyte data needs to be quantified. (All reviewers raised this as essential)</p><p>4. Please discuss these physiological effects/functions in the discussion more to spur the future.</p><p>5. More detailed methods for the modeling need to be provided.</p><p>6. If possible, please measure membrane density (see reviewer #2 for details).</p><p>7. In Figure 2, the claim that &quot;we can often observe multiple triple labels Piezo1 channels&quot; and that &quot;fluorescent spots do not represent multiple Piezo1 channels&quot; needs to be supported by statistical data (see reviewer #3 comments for details).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several suggestions/comments that might improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. If the preference of piezo1 to the dimple of the RBC is solely based on an energetic cost to being located in positivity curved membranes, then there should be an &quot;apparent&quot; driving force directing the channel to negatively curved membranes. Thus, I would expect the diffusion coefficient to be different in the dimple vs the edge regions. Did the authors detect different diffusion coefficients in different regions of the cell? This could explain the confinement in these areas.</p><p>2. Similar to the above comment, does the size of the actin/spectrin mesh vary in different areas of the cell? Specifically, if the size of the mesh is smaller in the dimple, confinement that is not directly dependent on membrane curvature per se could result. Can the authors show that the mesh size is consistent across the cell's differently-curved sections? Could modeling be used to test these ideas?</p><p>3. It would be helpful to quantitate the echinocyte membrane supplemental data and not just show example images. I would also suggest moving this to a main figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My main suggestions are:</p><p>1. The Method section describes the use of the Helfrich bending energy of the membrane to understand the distribution of Piezo1 on the RBC surface. However, it is unclear how the modeling was carried out to compare with the experimental observations, potentially due to the referenced PNAS submission. Particularly, it will be helpful to have a reference state (e.g. Piezo1 on a flat membrane) when discussing the curvature-dependent distribution of Piezo1. This is important for the finding to be of general relevance, as most mammalian cells do not take on the special shape of RBCs.</p><p>According to the numbers provided in the manuscript, it appears intuitive to think that the ~2-fold difference in Piezo1 density between the dimple and rim of RBCs is due to a depletion effect from the rim rather than an enrichment effect on the dimple.</p><p>2. The authors took advantage of the natural bi-concave shape of RBCs to investigate the curvature-mediated distribution of Piezo1. This is quite clever, however, a missing control experiment would be to see if the curvature preference of Piezo1 diminishes upon osmotically swelling the RBCs.</p><p>3. Cell membranes often have folds that are below optical resolution. Thus, it is important to compare the density of Piezo1 to that of a lipid membrane marker, to make sure that the observed enrichment of Piezo1 on dimples is not due to higher projected membrane density in these regions.</p><p>4. Many membrane proteins (such as integrin) are glycosylated. Are Piezo1 glycosylated? If so, how would the enzymatic deglycosylation treatments affect the interpretation of the lack of clusters?</p><p>5. The authors used co-immunostaining to show that 'Piezo1 is not bound to the actin-spectrin meshwork'. However, as Piezo1 is tagged with HA, a more direct experiment seems to be co-immunoprecipitation analysis with Piezo1.</p><p>6. A recent publication by Dumitru et al. (Nano Letter 2021) investigated the distribution of Piezo1 in RBCs and Piezo1's interaction with the cytoskeleton. Some of the results are in apparent contradiction with the current manuscript. It will be important to discuss the findings of Dumitru et al.</p><p>7. I'd like to draw the authors' attention to a recent preprint (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.22.497259) that quantitatively studies the role of membrane curvature in regulating the distribution of Piezo1 in mammalian cells.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Regarding 2D STED images (Figure 2) the authors claim that &quot;we can often observe multiple triple labels Piezo1 channels&quot; and that &quot;fluorescent spots do not represent multiple Piezo1 channels&quot;, but none of these claims is supported by statistical data. The authors should calculate fluorescence intensity histograms of ROIs surrounding fluorescent spots. This is absolutely necessary to conclude that (a) labeling is near saturation, and that (b) most spots are one single independent channel.</p><p>2. Similarly, data related to the localization of Piezo1 channels in echinocytes (Supplementary Figure 6) are not analyzed, but the authors claim &quot;exclusion of Piezo1 channels from protrusions&quot;. The authors should quantify the mean curvature of the membrane embedding each Piezo1 channel, then calculate the distribution of channels as a function of curvature (in a histogram), and statistically test if this distribution is biased. This is absolutely necessary to support the claim that Piezo1 does not localize in regions of mismatched, positive membrane curvature.</p><p>3. The measurements of nearest neighbor distances in unroofed cells may be skewed by edge effects: Piezo1 channels near the edges have fewer neighbors thus artificially increasing the next neighbor stances. The authors should consider correcting for this effect, perhaps by excluding spots near the edges, or mentioning and discussing this potential artifact.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Piezo1 as a force-through-membrane sensor in red blood cells.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers are largely satisfied with your responses to their comments but have asked for a few clarifications to be added to the final publication. Specifically, they ask if you would please better explain how &quot;a comparable diffusion coefficient&quot; was reached, to please add statistical analysis/error bars to the new analyses and to please mention these new data in the main manuscript. They also ask you to provide the reference for the statement that membrane is &quot;smooth&quot; in red blood cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the majority of my concerns in this revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the additional diffusion analysis, it's unclear how &quot;a comparable diffusion coefficient&quot; was reached, please add proper statistical analysis or error bars. Also, why not mention this new analysis in the manuscript?</p><p>2. Response to the analysis of echinocyte membrane is not fully satisfactory. Can the authors at least segment out regions of obvious protrusion and show that the density of Piezo1 is significantly lower in these regions?</p><p>3. Response to the request regarding modeling. The reviewer will need significantly more time to digest the newly published PNAS papers, therefore cannot comment on the completeness of the response in a timely manner.</p><p>4. Response to controlling for membrane density. Please provide reference to support the claim that membrane is &quot;smooth&quot; in red blood cells.</p><p>Membrane folds and fluctuations below resolution limit will lead to a difference between the real membrane area and the projected membrane area. The analysis and comparison of Piezo1 density could be affect, especially if the rim and the dimple of RBC have different amount of such membrane fluctuations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>All my concerns have been addressed. This is now a very nice manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82621.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please analyze diffusion in rim vs dimple from the data collected already and only need to analyze (see comments from reviewer #1 for detail).</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the diffusion coefficient, as we show in author response image 1, the diffusion coefficient is not different in the dimple versus the rim. We wish to emphasize that on theoretical grounds one should not necessarily expect a difference. If binding sites for Piezo existed in one region and not another, then diffusion would be slowed and Piezo would be concentrated in that region. If on the other hand barriers to diffusion existed in one region, this would slow diffusion without concentrating Piezo. According to the curvature coupling model, Piezo is more stable in the dimple and thus is attracted there, but the diffusion coefficient is determined by very shortrange (compared to the size of the dimple), short timescale (compared to the time spent in the dimple) interactions. Thus, we view this process more like one modelled by diffusion of a particle in potential energy field with a constant diffusion coefficient.</p><p>For completeness, we analyzed our gold-tracking images picking 3 second durations where the gold could be easily identified as in the dimple or the rim of the RBC membrane. Mean squared displacement analysis of n=6 (dimple) and n=8 (rim) tracks shows a comparable diffusion coefficient, consistent with the average calculated in Figure 4 E of ~0.0075 µm<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (black is averaged MSD and red is the straight line fit with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.98 for dimple measurements and 0.94 for rim measurements).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82621-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Then, using Imaris Spot detector we estimated the relative surface density of actin signal at these two regions. We find no statistical enrichment of actin signal at the dimple, indicating that the actin-spectrin meshwork is unlikely to be denser at the dimple. We have appended this data to Figure 3C. This result is consistent with not finding a significant enrichment of other membrane proteins, Band3 and KCNN4, which bind to the cytoskeleton, at the dimple.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The echinocyte data needs to be quantified. (All reviewers raised this as essential)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We attempted to analyze Piezo1 distribution as a function of curvature along echinocyte membranes but were not successful in doing so rigorously enough. The major problem is that the protrusions, on the order of 100-500nm are below or around the axial resolution limit in our 3D-SIM analysis and so determining the radius of curvature is inaccurate here and varies depending on how you contour the actin surface signal in Imaris. Any estimation of Piezo1 distribution as a function of membrane curvature from these analyses would thus be inappropriate. Instead, we are leaving Figure 3-figure suppelement 3 as a qualitative demonstration that fluorescent Piezo1 spots appear depleted from membrane protrusions in echinocytes and we state this clearly in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please discuss these physiological effects/functions in the discussion more to spur the future.</p></disp-quote><p>– On the non-clustered distribution of Piezo1 in the context of red blood cell force sensation: “A relatively homogenous membrane distribution of Piezo1 might be well suited to RBCs that are tumbling through solution, experiencing shear forces from all angles, and may contribute to the remarkable plasticity of RBC shapes under stress (Dupire, Socol, and Viallat 2012).”</p><p>– On curvature coupling of Piezo1 extending beyond red blood cells: “Whilst the curved biconcave shape of RBCs is unique, the good agreement between our experimental data and theoretical prediction based on energetic curvature coupling would suggest an inherent relationship between Piezo’s intrinsic curvature and the surrounding membrane that is broadly relevant to other cell types. This is because the curvature coupling theory, which was developed with experiments on lipid bilayer vesicles, depends only on the bending elasticity of membranes and the intrinsic curvature of</p><p>Piezo1, not on the unique shape of RBCs. It will be interesting to explore whether Piezo1, for example, is enriched in membrane invaginations or other curvature-matched membrane regions in different cell types.”</p><p>– On the functional relationship between Piezo1 and Gardos channel activity not requiring close spatial proximity in red blood cells: “Additionally, we asked whether Piezo1 might be co-localized with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (Gardos) channel. Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux into the RBC through Piezo1 and subsequent activation of the Gardos channel is thought to be the initial step in mechanically activated RBC volume regulation (Danielczok et al. 2017; Cahalan et al. 2015). We do not, however, observe significant spatial proximity between Piezo1 and Gardos channels. Given the small size of RBCs, approximately 1 µm thick in the dimple and 2 – 3 µm thick in the rim, and the Piezo1 density of around 0.5 per µm<sup>2</sup>, it seems that co-localization is probably not necessary for rapid opening of the Gardos channel following Piezo activation. For diffusion in 3 dimensions, the mean dispersion time can be approximated by <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> the mean distance and <italic>D</italic> the diffusion coefficient. The apparent diffusion coefficient for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is in the range 13 – 65 µm<sup>2</sup><italic>/s</italic> (Nakatani, Chen, and Koutalos 2002), meaning that Ca<sup>2+</sup> should equilibrate within tens of ms within a RBC”</p><p>– On Piezo1 mechanosensation in red blood cells: “However, that Piezo1 distributes on the surface of RBCs by sensing the membrane curvature, by corollary, means that it must have the capacity to sense lateral membrane tension by a force-throughmembrane mechanism. To see this, consider that Piezo1 has been shown to flex, i.e., change its curvature, as a function of local membrane curvature (Haselwandter et al., 2022). Consider also that membrane tension changes membrane curvature by flattening it. In this manner, curvature sensing and lateral membrane tension sensing are inextricably linked. This linkage lies at the heart of the membrane dome model of Piezo gating (Guo and MacKinnon 2017; Haselwandter and MacKinnon 2018; Haselwandter et al., 2022). When RBCs squeeze through small capillaries, the membrane shape as well as the transmembrane pressure change transiently. The resulting changes in membrane curvature and lateral membrane tension can both, according to the membrane dome model of Piezo gating, open Piezo1’s pore to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry”</p><p>We believe we have discussed our observed experimental data about Piezo1 distribution and diffusion properties in red blood cells in broader contexts of both Piezo1 force sensation in physiology as well as red blood cell mechanosensation. Any additional discussion would be pure speculation and outside the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. More detailed methods for the modeling need to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We understand why the methods seemed incomplete because they referred to papers that were not yet published. Now the methods are discussed in detail in two recently published papers (now referenced in the paper): Haselwandter, C. A., Guo, Y. R., Fu, Z., and MacKinnon, R. (2022). Quantitative prediction and measurement of Piezo's membrane footprint. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 119(40), e2208027119, https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2208027119; Haselwandter, C. A., Guo, Y. R., Fu, Z., and MacKinnon, R. (2022). Elastic properties and shape of the Piezo dome underlying its mechanosensory function. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 119(40), e2208034119, https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208034119. We feel that repeating the detailed methods here would potentially confuse the reader. Instead, we focus on how this previous work connects to the current manuscript, and discuss in detail all the parameter values needed to apply this model to the experiments described here. We have updated the citations of these two previous papers to their final form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. If possible, please measure membrane density (see reviewer #2 for details).</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with Reviewer #2 comment 3. There is an abundance of scanning electron microscopy of red blood cells that show, unlike most other types of cells, that the membrane is relatively smooth across the cell and does not show local “folds” or calveolae. If there are nanoscale folds, they are beyond detection limits by our system and a membrane fluorescent dye would not change this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 2, the claim that &quot;we can often observe multiple triple labels Piezo1 channels&quot; and that &quot;fluorescent spots do not represent multiple Piezo1 channels&quot; needs to be supported by statistical data (see reviewer #3 comments for details).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion of statistical analysis of the frequency of observing triple-labelled Piezo1 channels in our images. We were hesitant to do this initially since some fluorescent puncta do not resolve after deconvolution into anything beyond a blurred spot. This is common in STED and is likely due to photobleaching of antibody-conjugated dyes during the image scanning. These unresolved spots could represent single, double, or triple-labelled Piezo1 but since we can’t resolve them, we can’t count them. Still, we did the following semiquantiative analysis: first we thresholded fluorescent Piezo1 spots on their intensity, analyzing only those spots with an intensity above 20,000 units, as measured by line-scan analysis in ImageJ. We then counted how many bright pixels could be resolved after deconvolution to determine if the Piezo1 is single, double or triple labelled. A frequency distribution of these measurements is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, with the x axis labelled as “putative no. of antibodies bound”. Assuming a simple binomial distribution of antibody binding with no cooperative behavior, our data indicate we are at ~60% antibody binding. We could of course be biasing against choosing single-labelled Piezo1 channels which may be more likely to represent the dim fluorescent piezo1 spots but it is worth noting that, assuming a binomial distribution, for us to be underestimating Piezo1 channel number by an order of magnitude, with ~10% antibody binding, we would expect to see approximately zero triple-labelled Piezo1 channels, which is not the case. Even if triplets only made up around 6% of our Piezo1 fluorescent spots we would expect to still have only have ~20% channels unlabelled, thus not markedly changing our channel number per red blood cell estimation.</p><p>With regards to our claim that fluorescent spots do not represent multiple Piezo1 channels we have first clarified some points in the text. We never see bright spots resolve into anything more than a triplet, consistent with these spots not representing multiple Piezo1 channels. We make this clearer in the text. Additionally, we edited figure 2 to show line-scanning analysis of adjacent bright pixels (putative antibody binding sites). We find a consistent 25nm measurement in this analysis which we write in the text. This distance is consistent with our gold particle labelling electron microscopy studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several suggestions/comments that might improve the manuscript.</p><p>1.

Co-IP experiments can frequently lead to false positives especially when pulling down on a low abundant protein (Piezo1) and looking for interaction/non-interaction with a massively more abundant (and sticky) protein like spectrin/actin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. A recent publication by Dumitru et al. (Nano Letter 2021) investigated the distribution of Piezo1 in RBCs and Piezo1's interaction with the cytoskeleton. Some of the results are in apparent contradiction with the current manuscript. It will be important to discuss the findings of Dumitru et al.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have included reference to this paper in our discussion however we are hesitant to talk about these findings too much since the authors use a commercial anti-Piezo1 polyclonal antibody and show its specificity by western blot analysis, rather than eg immunostaining of Piezo1 KO red blood cells versus wildtype red blood cells. Analysis of Piezo1 clusters uses diffraction-limited confocal microscopy where indeed the “cluster size” of ~275nm is approximately equal to diffraction-limited xy resolution. Additionally, colocalization with spectrin is assessed by confocal microscopy where resolution is limited. Because of the abundance of spectrin in red blood cells and the small size of these cells overall, we would expect every membrane protein in red blood cells to show significant colocalization with spectrin using this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I'd like to draw the authors' attention to a recent preprint (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.22.497259) that quantitatively studies the role of membrane curvature in regulating the distribution of Piezo1 in mammalian cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this preprint. We have referenced this study in our discussion as orthogonal evidence for curvature coupling of Piezo1 in cellular membranes. However, we would want to discuss the quantitative modelling of Piezo1’s “nano-geometry” with the authors since we have some serious disagreements with their calculations but do not think our paper is the appropriate forum for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Regarding 2D STED images (Figure 2) the authors claim that &quot;we can often observe multiple triple labels Piezo1 channels&quot; and that &quot;fluorescent spots do not represent multiple Piezo1 channels&quot;, but none of these claims is supported by statistical data. The authors should calculate fluorescence intensity histograms of ROIs surrounding fluorescent spots. This is absolutely necessary to conclude that (a) labeling is near saturation, and that (b) most spots are one single independent channel.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to essential revision 7</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similarly, data related to the localization of Piezo1 channels in echinocytes (Supplementary Figure 6) are not analyzed, but the authors claim &quot;exclusion of Piezo1 channels from protrusions&quot;. The authors should quantify the mean curvature of the membrane embedding each Piezo1 channel, then calculate the distribution of channels as a function of curvature (in a histogram), and statistically test if this distribution is biased. This is absolutely necessary to support the claim that Piezo1 does not localize in regions of mismatched, positive membrane curvature.</p></disp-quote><p>See our response to essential revision 2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The measurements of nearest neighbor distances in unroofed cells may be skewed by edge effects: Piezo1 channels near the edges have fewer neighbors thus artificially increasing the next neighbor stances. The authors should consider correcting for this effect, perhaps by excluding spots near the edges, or mentioning and discussing this potential artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. We have repeated our Piezo1 spot-spot distance on 2D STED images of unroofed membranes, this time masking out spots that lie on the edges of the membranes. Doing so does not change the mean spot-spot distance significantly, nor alter our interpretation of this data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are largely satisfied with your responses to their comments but have asked for a few clarifications to be added to the final publication. Specifically, they ask if you would please better explain how &quot;a comparable diffusion coefficient&quot; was reached, to please add statistical analysis/error bars to the new analyses and to please mention these new data in the main manuscript. They also ask you to provide the reference for the statement that membrane is &quot;smooth&quot; in red blood cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the diffusion analysis of the rim versus the dimple in a new figure, figure 4—figure supplement 2. In addition to showing the mean MSD trajectories we have calculated diffusion coefficients from the same n=6 (dimple) and n=8 (rim) individual trajectories and plot these on a scatter plot with the mean and SEM. There is no statistically significant difference between the dimple and rim as analyzed by an upaired t test. This additional analysis is referenced on page 13 of the resubmitted manuscript.</p><p>We have included references to two studies analyzing RBCs by electron microscopy on page 11 of the resubmitted manuscript where we make the point that our modeling of curvature coupling between Piezo1 and the membrane curvature of RBCs implies a smooth RBC surface, which is consistent with EM analysis of healthy RBCs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
