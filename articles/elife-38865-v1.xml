However, there is no pre-clinical model that allows long-term assessment of cognition, and there is no treatment which ameliorates cognitive deficits in patients. Here, we report a novel glioma mouse model that offers manageable tumor growth and reliable assessment of cognitive functions in a post-treatment manner. Using this model, we found that fractionated whole-brain irradiation (fWBI), but not tumor growth, results in memory deficits. Transient inhibition of CSF-1R during fWBI prolongs survival of glioma-bearing mice and fully prevents fWBI-induced memory deficits. This result suggests that CSF-1R inhibition during radiotherapy can be explored as an approach to improve both survival and cognitive outcomes in patients who will receive fWBI. Taken together, the current study provides a proof of concept of a powerful tool to study radiation-induced cognitive deficits in glioma-bearing animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>recognition memory</kwd><kwd>whole-brain irradiation</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>colony stimulating factor 1 receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA213441</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosi</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001794</institution-id><institution>Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBTC_InstituteAward</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Nalin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole-brain radiotherapy, but not glioma growth in distal region from the hippocampus, results in impaired recognition memory, which can be prevented by CSF-1R inhibitor-mediated microglia depletion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cranial radiotherapy for brain tumor patients is usually fractionated into a series of lower doses in order to reduce radiation-induced normal tissue injury. However, cognitive deficits are still seen in more than half of the patients who received fractionated whole brain irradiation (fWBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Meyers and Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Greene-Schloesser and Robbins, 2012</xref>). Despite an overall poor longterm outcome, each year approximately 100,000 brain tumor patients survive long enough to experience radiation-induced cognitive deficits in the US alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Greene-Schloesser and Robbins, 2012</xref>). The quality of life of these long-term survivors is severely affected by the impairments in cognitive function. Unfortunately, there is no treatment to ameliorate these adverse effects.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the loss of cognitive function after fWBI are not well understood. Previous studies have shown that single fraction of WBI induces a number of deleterious effects, including changes in neurogenesis and neuronal structures, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and accumulation of peripheral immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Monje et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mizumatsu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Monje and Palmer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Monje et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Monje, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fike et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morganti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that fWBI, simulating a clinical treatment schedule, recapitulates the findings observed with a single fraction of radiation. From a mechanistic perspective, there is considerable evidence that the activation of inflammatory pathways is a critical factor in the initiation of radiation-induced brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morganti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Moravan et al., 2016</xref>). The Colony-Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF-1) is a cytokine involved in the recruitment/activation of myeloid cell precursors to areas of injury. We have shown that using a CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor during fWBI resulted in a transient depletion of microglia, a lower number of activated microglia, and lower numbers of inflammatory monocyte accumulating in the CNS. More importantly, use of a CSF-1R inhibitor fully prevented radiation-induced long term cognitive impairments in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). However, since activated microglia and peripherally-derived monocytes are often recruited secondary to initiation and growth of brain tumors (gliomas in particular), it is not clear whether radiation-induced cognitive changes are modified or attenuated in tumor-bearing animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pyonteck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stafford et al., 2016</xref>). Demonstrating a rescue of cognitive function following radiation in the setting of brain tumors would have significant translational impact.</p><p>Cognitive studies in glioma animal models following radiation treatment have not been previously reported. The primary reason is the technical challenge of producing a glioma-bearing animal that survives sufficiently long enough for cognitive assessment. Low grade glioma models tend to have long, and unpredictable tumor onset with variable growth rates, while high grade glioma models tend to be aggressive with an insufficient time window to permit assays of cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Most models using human xenografted tumors require an immunodeficient host, which would severely limit the ability to study the role of the immune system in cognitive function. Finally, transgenic mouse models have an inherent inconsistency in tumor development and progression which would preclude the ability to perform cognitive testing at predictable times following radiation treatment. To avoid these limitations, we used a novel high-grade glioma model that allows manageable tumor growth, and feasible assessment of long-term cognitive outcomes. We tested the survival and recognition memory performance 1 month after fWBI and CSF-1R inhibitor treatments. We found that fWBI or CSF-1R treatment alone significantly prolonged the survival of animals after tumor implantation. However, strikingly, memory deficits were detected only in mice received fWBI but not in non-irradiated tumor bearing mice. Finally, we demonstrated that CSF-1R inhibitor treatment was able to prevent fWBI-induced memory loss in glioma bearing animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The GL261-DTR glioma model</title><p>To create a growth-manageable glioma model we stably transfected Diphtheria Toxin Receptor (DTR) into GL261-luc cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Survival was further improved when DT treatment was combined with fWBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This regimen (DT treatment and fWBI) resulted in a more dramatic decrease in BLI signals from tumor cells; and a new round of DT treatment (1 µg/mouse every other day) slowed tumor growth in four of the five mice with recurrent tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

This paradigm further extended the medium survival to 46 days, more than 4 weeks after the completion of fWBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), thus permitting assessment of cognitive function in these mice at a timepoint that matches our previously reported results using tumor-free models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belarbi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feng et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tumor growth in the frontal cortex does not affect recognition memory</title><p>We used the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test to measure recognition memory performance, which partially depends on hippocampal function, in another group of GL261-DTR bearing mice between day 13 and day 16 after tumor implantation. Strikingly, no recognition memory deficits were detected in these mice despite of tumors in their brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A previous report demonstrated hippocampal dysfunction in mice with subcutaneous sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In their study, Yang et al demonstrated that there is increased plasma and hippocampal IL-6 concentrations in sarcoma bearing mice compared to tumor-free animals, as well as elevated plasma corticosterone levels. These changes in immune and endocrine systems induced neuroinflammation and were responsible for the observed cognitive deficits. It has been reported that GBM growth can lead to increased plasma IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lamano et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is not known whether hippocampal IL-6 levels are also increased with GBM growing in the right frontal cortex. Due to the different strain, age and gender of mice used between the current study and the one reported by Yang et al, it is difficult to make an adequate comparison. It is worth noting that memory deficits are seen in brain tumor patients prior to treatments, but only when brain regions involved in memory functions are directly disrupted by glioma growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">van Kessel et al., 2017</xref>).

Next, we tested possible treatment interactions using single and combined treatments of DT, CSF-1R inhibitor and fWBI. Treatment with fWBI alone was able to improve survival after tumor implantation, but not to the extent of DT treatment alone, while combined DT and fWBI treatment resulted in better survival than either single treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In light of these results, we tested the effects of CSF-1R inhibition on cognition in GL261-DTR bearing mice after DT and fWBI treatments.

Combined DT, CSF-1R inhibitor and fWBI treatment did not improve survival time of tumor bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, black line). Most importantly, CSF-1R inhibitor treatment was able to prevent memory deficits induced by fWBI in tumor bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). There was no difference in velocity or time spent in the center of arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) during the test trials, suggesting that no motor dysfunction or increase of anxiety was caused by tumor growth or treatments at the time of Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test. These results demonstrate for the first time that tumor-bearing mice are susceptible to fWBI-induced memory deficits, and temporary inhibition of CSF-1R during fWBI is sufficient to prevent radiation-induced deficits. Similar to the tumor-only group, animals in the tumor +DT group also showed no recognition memory deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), further demonstrating that glioma growth does not affect recognition memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CSF-1R inhibition reduces microglia activation after fWBI</title><p>Increased CD11b expression level has been used as an indicator of microglia activation during CNS inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the activation status of microglia and their response to CSF-1R inhibitor treatment in the presence of brain tumors, we compared mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of microglial CD11b using flow cytometry analysis 22–24 days after tumor transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found no significant change in microglial CD11b MFI after irradiation compared to non-irradiated mice. Conversely, CSF-1R inhibitor treatment resulted in significant reduction of CD11b MFI compared to untreated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining for Iba1, a macrophage specific marker, revealed that no morphological changes of hippocampal microglia were induced by irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, there was a trend for an increase in the Iba1 stained area in the hippocampus, which was reveresed by CSF-1R inhibitor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Co-staining for microglia activation marker CD68 suggest that radiation induced a significant increase in activated microglia, which was significantly reduced in animals treated with CSF-1R inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with the CD11b results, the immunohistochemistry data suggest that treatment with CSF-1R inhibitor reduced microglial reactivity in the hippocampus. Previous reports have demonstrated that cranial irradiation induces morphological changes that correlate with microglia activation, including increased Iba1 +and CD68+cell numbers and staining coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chiang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together with the present results, this work confirmed that cranial irradiation induced microglia activation can be prevented by CSF-1R inhibitor mediated depletion in the presence of brain tumors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38865.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CSF-1R inhibitor treatment prevents fWBI-induced microglia activation in glioma bearing mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plots of the CD11b mean fluorescent intensity of microglia in the contralateral hemisphere of tumor bearing mice.

The GL261-DTR model allows manageable tumor growth, prolonged survival and feasible assessment of cognition in a post-treatment manner. Using this model, we confirmed findings previously reported in tumor-free models, including increased monocyte accumulation in the CNS and elevated microglia activation. However, strikingly, we found that glioma growth in the frontal cortex does not affect recognition memory. On the contrary, it was the fWBI that induced recognition memory deficits in these tumor-bearing mice. To our knowledge, this report provides the first evidence that CSF-1R inhibition is able to prevent fWBI-induced cognitive deficits in tumor-bearing animals.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the cell line used for the GL261 model is driven by KRAS and p53, a combination of mutation rarely seen in human glioma patients. These differences in genetic and molecular features may affect the inflammatory microenvironment of the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Mackay et al., 2018</xref>), and in turn influence cognitive outcomes measured in this study. Further studies using genetically modified mouse glioma models that faithfully recapitulate molecular features in glioma patients would help clarify this concern. In addition, given the existence of Cre-inducible DTR transgenic mouse strains and the fact that human cells intrinsically express DTR, our model could be adapted to other primary mouse brain tumor models as well as xenograft models. Therefore, the current study provides a proof of concept of a powerful tool to study radiation-induced cognitive deficits in glioma-bearing animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Mus musculus), <break/>C57BL/6J</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson <break/>Laboratory, <break/>cat# 000664</td><td>cat # 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(Mus musculus), <break/>C57BL/6</td><td>GL261</td><td>NCI-Frederick <break/>DCTD <break/>tumor/cell <break/>line repository</td><td>Glioma 261</td><td>Mycoplasma <break/>negative</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected <break/>construct</td><td>ATF5-DTR- <break/>GFP</td><td>PMID: 20495567</td><td>NA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>AF700- <break/>CD11b</td><td>BD <break/>Biosciences</td><td>cat# <break/>557960</td><td>Flow Cyt: <break/>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>BV711- <break/>CD45</td><td>BD <break/>Biosciences</td><td>cat# <break/>563709</td><td>Flow Cyt: <break/>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>CD68</td><td>Bio-Rad,</td><td>cat#: MCA1957</td><td>IF: 1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Iba1</td><td>Wako <break/>chemicals,</td><td>cat# 019–19741</td><td>IF: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td valign="bottom">Neural <break/>Tissue <break/>Dissociation <break/>kit (P)</td><td>Miltenyi <break/>Biotech</td><td>cat# 130-092-628</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td>CSF-1R inhibitor</td><td>Plexxikon Inc</td><td>PLX5622</td><td>300ppm <break/>in AIN-76A <break/>standard chow</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>AIN-76A <break/>standard <break/>chow</td><td>Research <break/>Diets Inc</td><td>cat#: D10001i</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td>Percoll</td><td>Sigma</td><td>cat# P1644-100ML</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td>Diphtheria <break/>toxin</td><td>Sigma</td><td>cat# D0564-1MG</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>Ethovision <break/>XT</td><td>Noldus <break/>Information <break/>Technology</td><td>Version 11.5</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), following the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for animal care. 11 weeks-old C57BL/6J male mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, and housed in UCSF animal facility for one week before tumor transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Treatments</title><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>CSF-1R inhibitor treatment</title><p>Control and PLX5622 (300 ppm formulated in AIN-76A standard chow, Research Diets, Inc.) chows were provided by Plexxikon Inc (Berkeley, CA).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rescue of cognitive function following fractionated brain irradiation in a novel preclinical glioma model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aim to investigate cognition in a glioma animal model following fractionated brain irradiation, a paradigm they claim previously difficult to assess due to variability in glioma burden and survival outcome. The authors find that microglial depletion during and after radiation ameliorates cognitive deficits associated with radiation of frontal lobe gliomas.</p><p>Studying the cognitive effects of radiation therapy in the context of a glioma is a needed advance in the field. Based on data generated from this model the authors claim that the CSF-1R inhibitor PLX5622 (PLX) enhances the radio response of GL261 orthotopic xenografts and protects against radiation-induced impairment of recognition memory. This study highlights a possible therapeutic strategy for addressing the known effects of microglial inflammation on cognitive function after cranial radiation.

My chief concern is the use of GL261 cells – a murine cell line from the 1990s driven by a KRAS mutation (a rare mutation in human gliomas). The molecular characteristics of the tumor can dramatically influence the inflammatory microenvironment of the glioma (see the recent report from the HERBY study, Mackay et al., 2018), and thus the potential influences of the tumor on cognition. Many well-documented xenograft and primary tumor mouse models exist that allow for assessment of cognition at 1 month post-radiation treatment and could be included in this paper to strengthen the claim that microglial depletion can rescue hippocampal-dependent (or hippocampal-independent) cognition following brain irradiation in the context of molecularly definable, faithful glioma models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>- Whereas the reduction in radiation-induced memory loss is apparent, data regarding tumor radio response are incomplete and detracts from the strength of this study.</p><p>The model uses diphtheria toxin receptor expressing mouse brain tumor cells and after orthotopic implantation diphtheria toxin to slow tumor growth.

However, the combination of PLX and radiation is then claimed to further prolong survival, which is not apparent from the survival curves (the individual curves are similar to the combination treatment) and the statistical analysis was not performed (i.e. radiation only vs. radiation+PLX or PLX only vs. rad+PLX). Moreover, if the effects of radiation only and PLX only on survival are independent, then the combination of radiation and PLX would be expected to result in an additive increase in survival. As presented, it appears that survival after the combination treatment is less than additive, which would suggest that PLX reduced the effectiveness of radiation or that radiation reduced the effects of PLX. The survival experiment shown in Figure 2B is not sufficiently long enough to accurately evaluate the claimed effectiveness of combination treatment and tumor response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38865.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This DT- Glioma model is useful as it allows for long term evaluation of cognitive deficits and provides proof of principle; however there are several caveats of the GL261 cell line raising questions regarding clinical relevance.

The primary objective of our study was to study the effect of CSF-1R inhibition (with PLX5622) on cognitive function in a rodent tumor model that simulated a clinical treatment scenario. From our perspective, a primary limitation of many human-derived tumor models is the requirement for immunodeficient animals. Therefore, we used a rodent glioma cell line (GL261) that is syngenic with C57BL/6J mice which we and others have studied extensively with respect to the cognitive effects of radiation. However, following implantation with GL261 cells, tumors grow rapidly and animals require euthanasia within 3 weeks. Radiation alone in the doses we used does not prolong survival long enough for cognitive assessment. More importantly, patients usually have a therapeutic intervention which reduces tumor burden prior to radiation, which is what we attempted to model with the modified GL261 cell line. Neither diphtheria toxin or PLX5622 were intended to be used as radiation sensitizers or as primary therapeutic tools. To address reviewer 3’s comment, we performed a survival experiment with four groups: tumor only, tumor with radiation, tumor with PLX, tumor with radiation and PLX, and added results and discussion to the revised manuscript (see response to reviewer #3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More in depth and quantitative analyses of microglia numbers using resident and peripheral markers in each of the four conditions in Figure 3.

Figure 3A shows the comparison of CD11b mean fluorescent intensity across groups, this is calculated from flow cytometry analysis. The MFI is a quantitative measure of CD11b expression and has been used as indicator of microglia/macrophage activation (reviewed by Hoogland, et al., 2015). While the original Figure 3B and C were quantification of Iba1 staining covered areas and representative images from immunostaining respectively. In response to the reviewers, to support our claim, we now added quantification of CD68 immunofluorescent staining as Figure 3C. CD68 serves as a lysosomal marker for activated state of microglia/macrophages. We compared areas of Iba1 and CD68 staining across all groups. The new data demonstrated that the CD68 covered area was significantly increased after irradiation, and significantly decreased after PLX treatment. We updated representative images as Figure 3D. In the resubmitted manuscript, we made the following changes to the Results and Discussion.</p><p>Updated reference: “Increased CD11b expression level has been used as an indicator of microglia activation during CNS inflammation (Hoogland et al., 2015)”.</p><p>Added: “Co-staining for microglia activation marker CD68 suggest that radiation induced a significant increase in activated microglia, which was significantly reduced in animals treated with CSF-1R inhibitor (Figure 3C).”</p><p>Added: “Previous reports have demonstrated that cranial irradiation induces morphological changes that correlate with microglia activation, including increased Iba1+ and CD68+ cell numbers and staining coverage (Chiang et al., 1993, Acharya et al., 2016). Taken together with the present results, our results confirmed that cranial irradiation induced microglia activation can be prevented by CSF-1R inhibitor mediated depletion in the presence of brain tumors.”</p><p>Materials and methods has been updated to reflect added CD68 staining:</p><p>“Samples were sliced into 20 µm coronal sections and stained with rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:100, Wako Pure Chemicals) and rat anti-CD68 (1:200, BioRad) followed by incubation with AF-568 goat anti-rabbit and AF-647 goat anti-rat secondary antibodies (1:500, Life Technologies). […] The area of Iba1+ and CD68+ signals were measured in ImageJ.”</p><p>The Figure 3 legend was rewritten to reflect the updated graphs and images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>- While the DT-mediated glioma growth control paradigm is novel, simply using a less aggressive – and more molecularly faithful – model of glioma would similarly allow for long term evaluation of cognition after radiation in the context of microglial depletion.

The specific purpose for developing this tumor model was to mimic what occurs in an actual clinical setting by having the following features: i) an immunocompetent host, ii) fractionated radiation, and iii) reproducible tumor growth allowing evaluation of cognitive function with consistent timing. Although xenograft models that use human glioma cells are effective, they rely upon an immunodeficient host, which will result in a markedly different brain and tumor microenvironment, and different responses to radiation and CSF-1R inhibitor treatment. Unfortunately, adding another primary tumor model to test the cognitive outcomes in a separate cohort of animals is beyond the scope of this particular study, but we recognize that future experiments will need to address this question. Transgenic mice that develop spontaneous tumors rarely do so in a predictable manner and achieving sufficient numbers at similar ages to allow measurement of cognitive function would be a logistic challenge. We recognize that additional model systems will be required to further extend these results.</p><p>We added a discussion to clearly state the caveats of the GL261-DTR model, and modified the discussion on the potential expansion of the application of our proof of concept study.</p><p>“It is important to acknowledge that the cell line used for the GL261 model is driven by KRAS and p53, a combination of mutation rarely seen in human glioma patients.

The fractionation scheme we used (3 x 3.3 Gy) reliably produces memory deficits in C57BL/6J strain (Feng et al., 2016), and is comparable to other published reports. Although the treatment paradigm used to treat humans is very different (25-30 fractions of ~2 Gy), individual fractions of radiation in rodents require separate anesthesia each time which may also affect outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, is there an interaction between diphtheria toxin and radiation in terms of tumor response or is it strictly additive?

To further address this point, we added the following treatment groups, tumor only, tumor + PLX, tumor + fWBI and tumor + PLX + fWBI, N=5 each group. The new data shows that radiation treatment alone significantly prolonged survival compared to the tumor only group (30 vs. 20 days of median survival, p&lt;0.01), but this was not long enough for us to conduct behavior assay on the animals. In the survival dataset from our original submission, DT treatment alone was able to extend median survival to 39 days, and that DT + fWBI has an undefined median survival, These results suggest that there is a synergistic effect of combined DT and fWBI in tumor response. Therefore, DT in our treatment paradigm acted as a radiosensitizer, although it was not intended to be used as one.</p><p>On the other hand, added PLX to radiation treatment prolonged survival compared to radiation alone (40 vs. 30 days, p = 0.087) group. This survival advantage (20 days longer than tumor alone) was longer than each single treatment group (4 and 10 days for PLX and fWBI groups, respectively). Therefore, tumor response to PLX + fWBI was more than additive than each single treatment. However, survival curves of fWBI and PLX + fWBI are not significantly different.</p><p>Given that treatment interaction is not the main focus of the current study, we added these new data and analyses as supplemental figures (updated in Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and added the following text to the manuscript.</p><p>“Next, we tested possible treatment interactions using single and combined treatments of DT, CSF-1R inhibitor and fWBI.
