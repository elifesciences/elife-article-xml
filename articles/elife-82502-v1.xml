But what are the natural statistics of <italic>odors</italic>, and how do olfactory systems exploit them? Dissecting an accurate machine learning model (Lee et al., 2022) for human odor perception, we find a computable representation for odor at the molecular level that can predict the odor-evoked receptor, neural, and behavioral responses of nearly all terrestrial organisms studied in olfactory neuroscience. Using this olfactory representation (principal odor map [POM]), we find that odorous compounds with similar POM representations are more likely to co-occur within a substance and be metabolically closely related; metabolic reaction sequences (Caspi et al., 2014) also follow smooth paths in POM despite large jumps in molecular structure. Just as the brain’s visual representations have evolved around the natural statistics of light and shapes, the natural statistics of metabolism appear to shape the brain’s representation of the olfactory world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>metabolome</kwd><kwd>psychophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006785</institution-id><institution>Google Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>Wesley W</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiltschko</surname><given-names>Alexander B</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerkin</surname><given-names>Richard C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Brian K</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez-Lengeling</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic activity across all living things represents an organizing principle for the sense of smell in humans and animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory neuroscience depends on quantitative maps of the sensory world. Color mixing principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Young, 1802</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Guild, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hering, 1892</xref>) and corresponding biological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wiesel and Hubel, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Valois et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Svaetichin, 1956</xref>) help explain the organization of color perception in the early visual system. Gabor filters describe the receptive fields of visual cortex (V1) simple cells in later stages of visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones and Palmer, 1987</xref>). They also account for the organization of acoustic energy from high- to low-frequency and explain the tonotopic representation of perceptual tuning in animal hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wever and Bray, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabor, 1947</xref>). Understanding these sensory representations is critical for the design and interpretation of experiments that probe the organization of our sensory world. However, a representation and organizational framework for odor has not yet been established. Even though structure-activity relationships in human olfaction have been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutiérrez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerkin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kowalewski and Ray, 2020</xref>), ‘activity cliffs’ – seemingly small changes in molecular structure that produce profound changes in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maggiora, 2006</xref>; such as odor) – have limited the generalizability of representations developed from structural motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerkin, 2021</xref>). Does such a representation for odor – common to species separated by evolutionary time – even exist?</p><p>Machine learning models, particularly neural networks, have identified common representations encoded in biological nervous systems for sensory modalities, including vision and audition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016</xref>). For instance, the first few layers of convolutional neural networks – trained on visual scenes drawn from natural statistics – learn to implement Gabor filters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>). More strikingly, learned representations at progressively deeper layers of neural networks predict the responses of neurons in progressively deeper structures in the ventral visual stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhuang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamins et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, neural networks trained to classify odors can also match olfactory system connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Representations of the sensory world learned by training predictive models thus often recapitulate nature (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaeffer et al., 2022</xref> for counterarguments that warn against overinterpretation). A key idea is that neural networks can build representations of objects that are flexible enough to support transfer learning to new tasks (as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). In that example, the representational transformation from ‘molecule structure’ to ‘odor label’ happens layer by layer; by the penultimate layer (which can be used for the so-called ‘embedding’ of the representation), most of this transformation has happened. The representation has become odor specific but not necessarily task specific. Thus, that layer can then be used to predict multiple different odor-related tasks.</p><p>Here, we perform a comprehensive meta analysis on 16 olfactory neuroscience datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacWilliam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Missbach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oliferenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dravnieks, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Del Mármol et al., 2021</xref>), spanning multiple species and levels of neural processing. We find that the embedding from a graph neural network (GNN) trained on human olfactory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2019</xref>), which we term the principal odor map (POM), is highly predictive of the olfactory responses in nearly all datasets, even for species separated by hundreds of millions of years in evolution. In addition, we find POM is specific to olfaction as it shows no advantage in enteric chemoreception tasks or the prediction of general physico-chemical properties. The existence and specificity of POM not only suggest a shared representation of odor across animals but also provide an accurate and computable framework to study the organization of odor space. We show that metabolic reactions that determine the states of all living things – and the odors they emit – explain the organization of POM, and that multi-step reaction paths are smooth trajectories in POM. Finally, we identify strong associations between POM and the natural co-occurrence of molecules in natural substances. Together, these results suggest that the natural statistics of biologically produced molecules shaped the convergent evolution of animal olfactory systems and representations despite significant differences in biological implementation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neural network embedding as a principal map for animal olfaction</title><p>GNNs show state-of-the-art ability to accurately predict human olfactory perceptual labels in both retrospective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2019</xref>) and prospective settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we use a GNN embedding – the neural network layer immediately preceding the task-specific architecture – as a representation of odor and evaluate its predictive power in a meta analysis across 16 datasets (Methods) in olfactory neuroscience spanning 9 common model species, including mosquito, fruit fly, and mouse, as well as different scales of biology, including olfactory receptor, glomerular response, cortical neuron response, and whole-animal behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We then constructed networks of metabolites for these species in which directed edges represent the direction of a reaction between one node (a reactant) and another (a product; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We then computed the discrete ‘metabolic distance’ between any two compounds by calculating the shortest paths through these networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). From those metabolic networks with enough metabolites (&gt;100), we repeatedly sampled 50 pairs of odorants (molecules that pass a validated rule set for odor probability; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayhew et al., 2022</xref>) for each metabolic distance ranging from 1 to 12 and asked how well the distance in POM correlates with these metabolic distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that there is a strong correlation between the metabolic distance and POM distance (<italic>r</italic>=0.93) and that common measures of structural similarity between these metabolites can only account for part of the relationship (<italic>r</italic>&lt;0.8). This is especially true for neighbor metabolites in metabolic networks where a biological reaction changes the molecular structure drastically; while such drastic changes produce large structural distances, only smaller changes in POM are observed – the reactant and product spanning this structural cliff frequently share a common odor profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Alternative structural distance metrics are also correlated with metabolic distance and with POM distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>); indeed, in the absence of alchemy, metabolic reactants and products must be at least somewhat structurally related. But POM (derived only from human perceptual data) outperforms all such metrics significantly, with a &gt;2× reduction in unexplained variance and a lower dispersion at any given metabolic distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways predict distance in the principal odor map (POM).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The contents of MetaCyc, a large database of experimentally elucidated metabolic reactions across multiple species, were used to construct directed graphs connecting metabolites, including those with odors (non-gray).

If a pathway of reactions proceeds in a consistent direction in a molecular representation, then that pathway can be identified with that direction (e.g. ‘toward fermentation’); alternatively, the pathway could simply be a random walk in space. Using principal components analysis, we visualized the metabolic pathway for both DIBOA-glucoside biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and gibberellin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) in 2D with both count-based fingerprints (cFPs) structure and POM. We find the organizations of POM show a smooth progression from starting metabolites to final product metabolites, even though the same pathways show irregular progressions when organized simply by molecular structure. To further quantify such effects, we examine the ‘smoothness’ of all triplets of three consecutive metabolites (pairs of consecutive reactions) in 37 unique metabolic pathways with only odorant molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Using POM as an accurate and computable proxy for odor representation, we then proposed a hypothesis for the organization of odor with three facets: (1) co-occurring molecules in nature are also nearby in the POM; (2) the underlying metabolic network dictating co-occurrence is highly correlated with the POM representation; and (3) directed metabolic reaction pathways trace smooth and consistent paths in the same representation.

Many of these share (in common with our approach) an attempt to embed molecules in a latent space defined by chemical features or odor labels, such that ‘nearby’ odorants are structurally similar, perceptually similar, or both. Our work extends this effort in at least three ways: our training dataset is ~10× larger than most of the others, we use a GNN approach that allows the resulting space to better capture structure/percept relationships, and we test the utility of the space out-of-sample on a multitude of distinct datasets spanning species, brain areas, and biological principles.</p><p>Our claim unlocks new directions for olfactory neuroscience, animal ethology, and metabolomics. First, we predict that olfactory neural representations in most animals should be well explained by POM or future representations based on similar principles. Theory suggests that tuning of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zwicker, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bak et al., 2018</xref>) and even plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oleszkiewicz et al., 2021</xref>) should reflect the natural statistics of odor; these statistics may be organized by metabolic activity and may have esoteric geometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Second, the homology between odor space and metabolic space suggests that animal olfactory behavior may be broadly organized around the detection and discrimination of metabolic markers and even holistic metabolic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGee, 2020</xref>): how ripe is this fruit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colantonio et al., 2022</xref>)? How healthy is this mate? How nutritious is this soil? Third, the discovery of novel metabolic reactions and pathways could be informed by results from olfaction itself; molecules which have a similar smell – for reasons otherwise unknown – may be neighbors in an ethologically relevant metabolic network. Mechanistically, olfaction mediated by the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borowsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liberles and Buck, 2006</xref>), which detect metabolically downstream products of essential nutrient amino acids, already shows the signature of a ‘metabolism detector.’ Our results suggest this may be a feature of olfactory chemosensation more broadly. Over both evolutionary time and individual learning and development, the structure of metabolomes could also provide a substrate enabling smooth, separable manifolds to develop in neural activity space, a likely requirement for invariant object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiCarlo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, Chee-Ruiter’s work in the Bower lab hypothesized this link over 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chee-Ruiter, 2000</xref>). They identified a metabolic organization to previously published descriptions of the odor qualities of hundreds of compounds and found simple metabolic explanations for several examples of concentration-dependent changes in odor character; for example: some fruity (good) compounds smell sulfurous (bad) at higher concentration, and these same compounds are linked to decay processes in organic matter. They also showed that humans exhibit perceptual cross-adaptation to compounds metabolically similar (but not otherwise structurally similar) to cis-jasmone, suggesting that the brain’s representation of odor similarity is rooted in metabolic similarity. Their work deserves a close read decades later, and this hypothesis is getting increasing attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>How universal can the POM be, given that outputs of sensory neurons and downstream behaviors are driven by both evolution and learning? Certainly, individual experiences can modify odor perception and act as an additional organizing force on any olfactory map. But environmental correlations are also learned through experience, and many of these are broadly shared across both individuals and species. For example, direct experience of the co-occurrence of citronellal and alpha-terpineol in an orange peel should reinforce, through olfactory plasticity in the brain (e.g. in cortex), those evolutionary changes in the periphery (e.g. receptors) driven by that same co-occurrence. Indeed, we found no clear pattern in relative predictive performance of the POM as a function of processing stage (from periphery to behavior). However, we do observe that the performance of POM improves non-asymptotically as a function of training data size and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2019</xref>); it is thus unclear where the ceiling lies for this approach.</p><p>In some networks, connected nodes are not only close in graph distance (e.g. one hop away) but also in physical distance (e.g. same household, same postal code, etc.) Similarly, we show that metabolic distance is closely related to odor distance. But there are surely exceptions; a single edge of a social network graph may span continents, and this exception to the general pattern may be important for explaining the macrostructure of the phenomenon. By analogy, such exceptions for odor, where a single metabolic step gives rise to a radically unrelated odor profile, could represent the boundaries between large, innate odor categories. Given the high correlation between metabolic distance and POM distance that we observe, these are indeed exceptions to a general rule. Future work, relying upon larger metabolic pathway datasets (especially including pathways that have yet to be elucidated), might find enough such exceptions to determine their meaning. Other future experiments could test the hypothesis that correlated odor environments give rise to common representations; for example, animals that are uniquely able to exploit particular food energy sources might also be uniquely adapted to smell metabolic signatures of such sources. In those animals, representations of the corresponding odors might be quite distinct from those found in human perception.</p><p>Ludwig Boltzmann and Erwin Schrödinger argued that the fundamental object of struggle for organisms is to identify and feed upon negative entropy (free energy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boltzmann and McGuinness, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrodinger, 1944</xref>). Each life form appears to be equipped with enzymatic and mechanical tools to access niches of free energy. Eleanor Gibson theorized that perception becomes refined during development to intuitively access this information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibson, 2000</xref>). Indeed, the sense of smell seems designed to identify quantities and accessibility classes of chemical-free energy, which are determined in turn by metabolic processes in living things. Odors thus tend to be more similar within specific pockets of the chemical ecosystem and the carbon cycle. Evolution may have thus ethologically tuned neural representations of chemical stimuli to the statistics and dynamics of this cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>POM from pre-trained GNNs</title><p>The POM corresponds to the activations of a 256-dimensional embedding layer within a neural network, pre-trained on human olfactory perceptual data (see model architecture and training details below).

Specifically, AUROC can be converted to the performance index with (AUROC − 0.5) * 100, and R<sup>2</sup> score can be converted to the performance index by multiplying by 100. Finally, performance indices are averaged across all the seeds and targets (in those cases where the dataset contains multiple targets).</p><p>Since the optimal hyper parameters for the model can be different for different representations and datasets, we perform a scan for important hyper parameters for random forest models including number of trees in the forest, different ways to assign weight for each class label, number of features to consider during a split, as well as the minimum number of samples required to split and internal node or construct a leaf node. For Morgan fingerprints (cFP and bFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morgan, 1965</xref>), we include an additional hyper parameter to select for the optimal dimension of the fingerprints. In the end, we report the performance index using the best hyper-parameter choices from the scan for each featurization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Performance index for mouse piriform cortical activity dataset</title><p>Following the original analysis for the dataset in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>, we used correlation distance as the basis for measuring both neural activity distances and molecular representation (e.g. POM or Dragon; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mauri et al., 2006</xref>) distances for each molecule pair, after centering the values per-neuron or per-feature dimension. Pearson correlations were then used to measure how well each representation captured the neural activity distances observed in different experimental conditions (representing various parts of the brain and different sets of probes). The performance index is then calculated by averaging and rescaling these latter correlations across each experimental condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Datasets used in figure 1</title><p>Each of the datasets below is indicated with a letter ([x]) corresponding to its position in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Datasets for human olfaction</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Dravnieks [c]</title><p>This dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dravnieks, 1982</xref>) contains 128 unique molecules with 146 odor descriptor targets, where each molecule has a perceptual rating for each odor descriptor, which we can use for regression labels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Keller et al.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers agreed that the framing of the problem is interesting, and the idea that odor perceptual distance relates to metabolic proximity is worth exploring. Can the authors cite a highly relevant PhD thesis that also discussed this many years ago: Chee-Ruiter (https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7595/)</p><p>2. A comparison of neural data for a range of presented molecules would greatly strengthen the current argument which is mostly based on human perceptual classification.</p><p>3.

Can the authors provide substantially more detail about the technical details of the GNN and how readers can access the data and run the calculations? The code should be open source.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Can the authors place their findings in context with numerous prior attempts to come up with an odorant perceptual space, typically using PCA and similar methods?

In much of the paper, it is claimed that models such as neural networks resemble brain representations (eg second paragraph of Intro: &quot;Representations of the sensory world learned by training predictive models thus often recapitulate nature.&quot;).

There are additional data sets that might be worth analyzing. Of course, the authors have plenty already, but I wonder why no mouse receptor or glomerular data were used (given that many groups have produced tons of data on this) – just this reviewer's curiosity.</p><p>3. For historical reasons, the authors may consider citing a PhD thesis on the relationship between metabolic similarity and perceptual similarity by Chee-Ruiter (https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7595/). I'm not sure if that work was ever published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Metabolic activity organizes olfactory representations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Andrew King (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Can the authors provide a more complete explanation of the analysis methods for Figure 4 supplement 1? There are very brief accounts in the methods section on pages 15 and 16. How does one go from ORN responses to regression targets and thence to neural distance?</p><p>2. The authors may wish to put some of the key points about Mordred vs POM measures from their responses to the reviews, into the text or discussion.</p><p>3. Some fixes needed in the text:</p><p>Page 12: &quot;…in Figure 4 we computed distance metrics upon it is the distance between two components of an essential oil.&quot;</p><p>4. Figure 4 supplement 1: Carey et al. plot seems to be missing bars for cFP – edit distance.</p><p>5. Figure 4 supplement 1: Chae et al. seem to have a much smaller rank shift. Is this correct? Is it just due to the number of odors in the sample, or does it relate to the difference in the scoring function as described (very briefly) in the text?</p><p>6. Figure 4 supplement 1: No stats to compare the bars?</p><p>7. Tanimoto distance should be spelled throughout with a capital T.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82502.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The authors mention some studies very briefly. It would be interesting to understand where the current approach diverges from the findings of earlier work.</p></disp-quote><p>There have indeed been numerous previous efforts to generate “perceptual space”, including the beautiful PhD thesis mentioned below by Reviewer #2. These include but are not limited to Stevens and O’Connell 1996, Mamlouk et al. 2003; Youngentob et al. 2006, Khan et al. 2007, Zarzo and Stanton 2005, Koulakov et al., 2011, Castro et al., 2013, Bushdid et al., 2014, Tran et al., 2019, Mayhew et al., 2022, most of which use dimensionality reduction methods, and which are summarized and categorized in a recent review (Gerkin, 2021, Chemical Senses). While the full context is best explicated in a review, we have raised a few of these in the discussion, noting key similarities and differences with our approach. The most important key difference is that previous spaces built from perception are typically limited to those molecules which have been perceived (i.e. a few thousand or fewer), and those built from structure so far don’t appear to have captured the structural differences that really matter for perception, differences which we argue may be closely related to the kinds of “edits” made by metabolic reactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The description of the methods is inadequate, especially since this is a general biology readership.

We have added more details about the architecture (adapted in part from our previous work) to the Methods section, and also provided more details about model training.</p><p>As for the data and reproduction materials, we did in the original submission provide a link to all of the datasets used to generate the figures and to Jupyter notebooks to reproduce them, given the model embeddings for each molecule, which we also provided. However, we had only provided these in the Data Availability Statement, which may have been opaque. We have since moved this information to the Methods section, and we refer the reviewer to that site again if they are interested in reproducing our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors explain some of the theoretical and ANN-field background of the approach to taking a subset of a GNN as an embedding that encapsulates the dataset referred to as POM in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a common approach for building representations of objects that are flexible enough to support transfer-learning to new tasks (as shown in Lee et al., 2022, “A Principal Odor Map Unifies Diverse Tasks in Human Olfactory Perception”, for example). The key idea is that the representational transformation from “molecule structure” to “odor label” happens layer by layer, and that by the penultimate layer (which we use for the embedding), most of this transformation has happened and the representation is odor-specific but not necessarily task-specific. That layer can then be used to predict multiple different odor-related tasks. See Zhuang et al., 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02685) for additional examples and background. We have revised the Introduction to introduce this idea to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors spend substantially more time explaining the features of the POM: Its size, number of parameters, and how it is interrogated in the various analyses carried out in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Methods to include this information more explicitly; some of this was included in the original version but perhaps in a form that was not clear to the reader. Briefly, it has 256 dimensions, i.e. each molecule is represented by a length-256 floating point array. The analyses carried out upon it are described per figure, but briefly: In Figure 1 it was used as the input for predicting datasets from olfactory neuroscience, i.e. it was the “X” in a series of regression of classification problems; in Figure 2 we computed distances in this space and compared them to distances in alternative spaces; in Figure 3 we computed distances and angles in this same space; and in Figure 4 we computed distance metrics upon it is the distance between two components of an essential oil.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make a very interesting link to metabolism by comparing the odor distances with the metabolic distances. Again, for reproducibility and further work it would be good to provide the database of these extracted metabolic distances.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous submission (in a URL in the data availability statement) we provided a notebook to reproduce this information from the source data, as part of the analysis steps for reproducing Figure 2. For the revision we have added an explicit table</p><p>(metabolite_analysis/data/metabolite_distance.csv) at the Github link (see Methods) containing the metabolic distances and descriptors distance for each pair of metabolites in different species’ metabolic network, which represents an intermediate step in that analysis, and added the GitHub URL to the Methods section to increase visibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

There are additional data sets that might be worth analyzing. Of course, the authors have plenty already, but I wonder why no mouse receptor or glomerular data were used (given that many groups have produced tons of data on this) – just this reviewer's curiosity.</p></disp-quote><p>Some datasets are underpowered to test the hypothesis, or collected in a way that makes it difficult. For example, Burton et al. 2022 reports the activity of glomeruli in response to odorants, but they choose concentrations to find the most sensitive glomerulus for each odorant, which is a very valuable activity but leaves us without a classification or regression problem to test. We instead added Chae et al., 2019, which reports glomerular activity more broadly for a range of odorants, and have included the result in the revised Figure 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> is a detailed performance breakdown across 100 random samplings, using that glomerular activity dataset. Compared to the best baseline descriptor (Mordred), POM still shows a statistically significant (p &lt; 5e-5) improvement.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82502-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For historical reasons, the authors may consider citing a PhD thesis on the relationship between metabolic similarity and perceptual similarity by Chee-Ruiter (https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/7595/). I'm not sure if that work was ever published in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fantastic find and we are very appreciative of the reviewer for pointing this out to us.

Can the authors provide a more complete explanation of the analysis methods for Figure 4 supplement 1? There are very brief accounts in the methods section on pages 15 and 16. How does one go from ORN responses to regression targets and thence to neural distance?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more detailed explanation to the legend for Figure 4-supplement 1, starting with the p-values through the end of the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors may wish to put some of the key points about Mordred vs POM measures from their responses to the reviews, into the text or discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these into the Results section starting with “Alternative structural distance metrics…” through the end of the paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Some fixes needed in the text:</p><p>Page 12: &quot;…in Figure 4 we computed distance metrics upon it is the distance between two components of an essential oil.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4 supplement 1: Carey et al. plot seems to be missing bars for cFP – edit distance.</p></disp-quote><p>The bars are there but are extremely small (close to zero). We have added the relevant values in the text above/below each bar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4 supplement 1: Chae et al. seem to have a much smaller rank shift. Is this correct? Is it just due to the number of odors in the sample, or does it relate to the difference in the scoring function as described (very briefly) in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>Chae et al. has only 15 pairs of molecules (including repeated single molecules across pairs) that are also in the essential oil dataset, limiting its interpretability, i.e. analysis of Chae et al. is underpowered and noisy. We included it alongside the other two for completeness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4 supplement 1: No stats to compare the bars?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added statistics to the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
