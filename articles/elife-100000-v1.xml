However, the evidence for this hypothesis and the neural mechanisms involved remain elusive. To this end, we conducted a study using both single-brain activation and multi-brain synchronization analyses to investigate how group identification influences collective problem-solving in a murder mystery case. Our results showed that groups with high levels of identification performed better individually compared to those with low identification, as supported by single-brain activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, high-identification groups also showed enhanced collective performance, supported by within-group neural synchronization in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The DLPFC–OFC connectivity played a crucial role in linking individual and collective performance. Overall, our study provides a two-in-one neural model to explain how group identification affects collective decision-making processes, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of group interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social interaction</kwd><kwd>group decision-making</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71942001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>STI 2030-Major Projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0200500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Specialist Projects of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZK2015B01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Programs Foundation of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201540114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xianchun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Group identification enhances collective performance through increased individual brain activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and neural synchronization in the orbitofrontal cortex, with connectivity between these regions linking individual and group decision-making processes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While group decision-making is commonly utilized and can yield positive outcomes, not all groups function effectively, and their performance can vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Wilde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kerr and Tindale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stasser and Abele, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023a</xref>). Even when two teams are equally skilled and exchange information, one team often outperforms the other. Interestingly, the winning team typically shows stronger cohesion, while the losing team appears to be more disorganized. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of group identification in determining how verbal information exchange affects collective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Bavel and Cunningham, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2023b</xref>). It appears that differences in group identification may play a role in the varying performance of different groups. Here we ask: How does group identification lead to differences in collective performance? What is the underlying mechanism behind this effect?</p><p>Social identity theory suggests that group identification is crucial in shaping collective behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicchieri, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gundlach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tajfel and Turner, 1979</xref>). This theory elucidates that group identification refers to a person’s attitudes toward a specific group and the emotional meaning associated with belonging to it. Research has consistently shown that stronger group identification is associated with better collective behavior, such as improved decision-making accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pärnamets et al., 2020</xref>), effectiveness in team-based interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinero et al., 2021</xref>), and overall group cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Bavel and Cunningham, 2012</xref>). This is likely due to the positive impact of increased communication, cooperation, and reduced conflict among group members. Additionally, individuals with a strong sense of group identification are more likely to align their goals with those of the group, leading to increased effort toward achieving objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dikker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prochazkova et al., 2022</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesize that higher group identification will lead to improved collective performance.</p><p>Social cognitive functions, associated with specific brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), may play a role in this process. When individuals make decisions within a group, the DLPFC is believed to be involved in coordinating and aligning individual choices with the collective goals and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goupil et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jankovic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). This brain region is responsible for cognitive regulation and is linked to individual decision-making processes like moral and economic decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stallen et al., 2018</xref>). In a group setting, the OFC is important for evaluating the potential outcomes and consequences of different decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bechara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallis, 2007</xref>). It is thought to regulate group decision-making processes by integrating information about social rewards and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon and Christoff, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallis, 2007</xref>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that group identification and its impact on collective performance may be tracked by the DLPFC and OFC.</p><p>To better comprehend the influence of group identification on collective performance, it is important to uncover the dynamic neural processes involved. Previous research has focused on either single- or multi-brain findings, but social interactions are complex and cannot be fully captured by either approach alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frith and Frith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023a</xref>). In the present study, we combined single- and multi-brain analyses to address this limitation. While recent research has identified both decreased single-brain activation and increased synchronization as drivers of social decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>), the interaction between single- and multi-brain activities in driving social decision-making is still not fully understood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2020</xref> found that increased brain activation connectivity facilitates the integration of social information into decision-making, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2023b</xref> suggested that this connectivity could link two processes (i.e., strategy switching and influence management). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ni et al., 2024</xref> indicated that neural synchronization was linked to the strength of social–emotional communication and connections between individuals. An increase in neural synchronization has also been shown to predict the coordination and cooperation abilities of group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that neural synchronization may be related to group performance. Based on the above, our goal was to explore the regulation of single-brain activation and multi-brain synchronization concerning brain activation connectivity, as well as to incorporate the temporal component to fully represent the dynamic nature of brain processes. By using this innovative approach, we can uncover the intricate interplay between individual and collective neural processes, providing insight into how the brain dynamically responds and adapts during social interactions.</p><p>Taken together, we examined the impact of group identification on collective performance in a collaborative problem-solving task. Additionally, we investigated the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Group identification leads to differences in collective performance</title><p>We examined the impact of manipulated group identification on increasing intergroup discrimination.

This descriptive model aims to illustrate the potential interrelationships among these indicators and establish a conceptual framework to inspire forthcoming research endeavors. In the first step, group identification influences individual performance, which is associated with significant single-brain activation in the DLPFC of each group member. In the second step, group identification influences collective performance, which is linked to significant within-GNS in the OFC. These two steps are linked by the DLPFC–OFC connectivity, which modulates the relationship between individual DLPFC activation and GNS in the OFC. In particular, people with a strong sense of group identification tend to have better individual performance, which is associated with increased single-brain activation in the DLPFC of each group member. This, in turn, leads to improved collective performance, which is linked to higher levels of within-GNS in the OFC. On the other hand, groups with a low sense of group identification tend to have poorer individual performance, which is associated with decreased activity in the DLPFC. This also results in poorer collective performance, which is correlated with lower levels of GNS in the OFC. The DLPFC–OFC connectivity modulates the relationship between the single-brain activation in the DLPFC and the corresponding group’s neural synchronizations in the OFC.

Building upon existing findings and theory, our study adds information about the neural mechanisms involved, both at the level of individual group members and at the level of the group. Specifically, we found that group identification influenced individual performance, supported by neural activity in the DLPFC. Moreover, we also found that high group identification enhanced collective performance, supported by neural synchronization in the OFC. We highlighted the link between individual performance and collective performance, which was associated with an increased correlation between the DLPFC and the OFC. Based on these results, we have developed a two-in-one neural model to illustrate the dynamic neural processes through which group identification influences collective performance.</p><p>Our findings converge with previous work which suggested that group identification is crucial in shaping collective behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Számadó et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solansky, 2011</xref>). Group identification plays a significant role in shaping collective decision-making by promoting cohesion and reducing conflicts within a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicchieri, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gundlach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tajfel and Turner, 1979</xref>). Members collaborate to address conflicts through positive interactions to uphold positive intergroup relations and achieve better collective behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brewer and Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Cremer and Van Vugt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dikker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prochazkova et al., 2022</xref>). Utilizing tools from neuroscience and video analysis, this study demonstrated the positive impact of increased communication and interaction among group members in groups with high group identification, leading to improved collective performance. These findings support existing research on the influential role of group identification in shaping collective behavior. Understanding how group identification operates can provide valuable insights into group decision-making processes and contribute to the development of strategies for effective group dynamics and decision-making.</p><p>Extending previous neuroimaging approaches, this work combined single- and multi-brain approaches to uncover how group identification influenced collective performance: through single-brain activation and multi-brain synchronization. Previous studies have shown that activation in the DLPFC is associated with controlled decision-making, such as moral and economic decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fecteau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gläscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings further support this by demonstrating the involvement of DLPFC activation in collective decision-making during social interactions. Additionally, previous research has suggested that increased neural synchronization in the prefrontal area, including the OFC, is linked to collective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023a</xref>). Our study expands on this by showing that neural synchrony in the OFC was correlated with collective performance. Interestingly, we found that the level of neural synchrony was higher in the high group identification group compared to the low group, underscoring the significance of group identification in influencing collective performance.</p><p>Our research suggests a new perspective on the connectivity between the DLPFC and OFC in the brain, showing its potential role in understanding brain functional integration and the relationship between individual brain activation and collective brain synchronization. While we did not directly determine the reason for this connectivity, it may indicate a form of ’social alignment' between the execution system (individual decision-making) and observation system (collective decision-making) in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schenk and Colloca, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Our study aims to uncover the neural mechanisms behind the impact of group identification on collective performance. We have developed a two-in-one neural model that proposes the connectivity between the DLPFC and OFC as a key mechanism for integrating individual and collective decision-making processes in the brain.</p><p>Our study also has demonstrated significant increases in single-brain activation, DLPFC–OFC functional connectivity, and GNS at 7, 12, and 17 min, respectively, following task initiation. The significant increase in these neural activities together constructs the two-in-one neural model that explains how group identification influences the collective performance we proposed. As previous studies have shown, the BOLD signal collected by fNIRS is slowly increasing compared to neuronal activity, which means that it has hysteresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turner et al., 1998</xref>). In social interactions such as group decision-making, the time of neural synchronization is delayed because people need to spend time increasing the number of dialogs to improve collaboration efficiency and form the same preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). For example, participants would exhibit significant neural alignment, but only after they had completed a period of dialog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sievers et al., 2024</xref>). In the task of cooperation, with the improvement of cooperation efficiency between two participants, there is a higher degree of neural synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the generation of neural synchronization depends on the interaction over a period of time, which can affect the estimation of collaboration time. Prior research has shown that when the teaching task with prior knowledge began 50–55 s, significant neural synchronization could be generated between teacher and students, which meant that students and teacher achieved the same goal of learning knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, a noteworthy increase in GNS was observed approximately 6 min into the group discussion period for better discussing and solving the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2023b</xref>). These findings are similar to ours. Therefore, the time points we found could reflect the dynamic time change of the neural process of team collaboration. Our study has raised several interesting issues for further investigation. First, our laboratory task was specifically created to assess collective performance. While we did observe significant differences in collective performance between groups with high and low levels of identification, future research needs to utilize a trial-by-trial problem-solving task rather than relying on subjective evaluations. This approach would allow for the examination of collective performance as a continuous variable, rather than being reliant on ratings provided by external raters. Second, to enhance the validity of our findings, we utilized fNIRS technology to track both individual and group brain activity simultaneously. Even though our primary focus was on the left temporal regions, specifically lTPJ, we acknowledged that other brain regions such as rTPJ, vmPFC, IFG, and right temporoparietal regions also played a role in Theory of Mind tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stolk et al., 2016</xref>) due to the constraints of fNIRS channels. Future studies should consider utilizing MEG technology, which offers better spatial and temporal resolutions, to further investigate the neural mechanisms underlying social cognition and collective behavior. Although our study has found a new perspective, the analysis method still refers to and uses the traditional fNIR-based hyperscanning analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pärnamets et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinero et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Számadó et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solansky, 2011</xref>), which is generally accepted by the majority of fNIR-based hyperscanning researchers. For example, we would first identify significant channels through a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test and then conduct further analyses, such as ANOVA or independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests. Selective analysis is a powerful tool and is perfectly justified whenever the results are statistically independent of the selection criterion under the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</xref>). However, it may lead to double dipping and missing information. In this study, the absence of statistically significant TPJ activation in the analyzed data led to the TPJ being ignored. In the future, it should be made explicit in the analysis, and the reliability of the results should be ensured by appropriate statistical methods (e.g., cross-validation, independent datasets, or techniques to control for selective bias). Next, our experimental design intentionally separated task phases (reading, sharing, discussing, and decision) to enhance procedural clarity, experimental control, and ecological validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023a</xref>), departing from the integrated approaches used in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Wilde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stasser and Stewart, 1992</xref>). However, the fixed (non-counterbalanced) phase sequence introduces an important limitation: observed effects could potentially reflect temporal factors rather than genuine task-related neural activity. While our analytical approach controlled for some of these temporal confounds, future studies would benefit from implementing counterbalanced phase sequences, jittered trial timing, or additional control tasks to more precisely isolate phase-specific neural correlates. Finally, future research should investigate additional variables, including sex differences and measures of attractiveness or hierarchy among participants, such as students versus teachers.</p><p>To summarize, the present study revealed and connected the individual and group brain processes involved in group identification that influenced collective performance and constructed a descriptive model to illustrate this process. This research not only enhances our understanding of the neurobiological aspects of group dynamics and collaboration but also offers a comprehensive framework that synthesizes previous research findings and provides a theoretical foundation for future investigations into the complexities of social interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>G* Power 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faul et al., 2007</xref>) indicates that for <italic>t</italic>-tests with a medium-to-large effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.70), an alpha level of 0.05, and a desired statistical power of 0.80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 1988</xref>), a sample size of at least 52 triads is needed.

We then examined the correlation between single-brain activation and individual performance and tested whether the relationship between an individual’s perceived group identification and individual performance was mediated by single-brain activation. (2) We sought to examine whether the group differences in collective performance were reflected in within-GNS. We first identified task-related GNS and compared GNS of different levels of group identification. We then examined the correlation between collective performance and GNS and tested whether the relationship between the group identification score of each triad and collective performance was mediated by GNS. (3) Examining brain activation connectivity, we sought to bridge single-brain activations and the corresponding GNS, thus unifying individual decision-making and collective performance. We first identified task-related brain activation connectivity and compared brain activation connectivity of different levels of group identification. We then examined the correlation between the similarity in individual-collective performance and brain activation connectivity and tested whether the relationship between the individual’s single-brain activations and the corresponding GNS was mediated by brain activation connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Pre-processing approach</title><p>We sought to explore the neural mechanisms that manipulated group identification and its effect on collective performance. Data were preprocessed using the Homer2 package in MATLAB 2020b (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). First, motion artifacts were detected and corrected using a discrete wavelet transformation filter procedure. After that, the raw intensity data were converted to optical density (OD) changes. Then, kurtosis-based wavelet filtering (Wav Kurt) was applied to remove motion artifacts with a kurtosis threshold of 3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiarelli et al., 2015</xref>). Based on a prior multi-brain study of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>), the output was bandpass filtered using a Butterworth filter with order 5 and cut-offs at 0.01 and 0.5 Hz to remove longitudinal signal drift and instrument noise. Finally, OD data were converted to HbO concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Single-brain activation</title><p>The detailed steps are as follows: (1) We analyzed the data using SPM-based software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ye et al., 2009</xref>), focusing on the time series from information reading to decision-making, and extracted the HbO signal for each participant and triad. The onsets and durations of these time series were used to generate the stimulus design, which was convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) using NIRS-SPM. (2) We then employed a general linear model (GLM) to fit the predicted signals to the actual data, obtaining beta estimates (regression coefficients) for each parameter in the single-subject design matrices. Within the GLM framework, contrast maps were generated to compare activation between the baseline (resting phase) and task sessions (encompassing information reading to decision-making) for each subject, based on the HbO signal. Next, the regression factor was convolved with the HRF, and regression analysis provided brain activation values representing decision-making activity for each participant across all task stages and channels. For group-level analysis, we conducted second-level, random-effects analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friston et al., 2007</xref>) by aggregating the <italic>β</italic> values across participants. A one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was performed for each channel to determine whether mean activation significantly exceeded zero (i.e., greater task-related activation than rest), with p-values corrected for FDR (p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). (3) Channels showing significant single-brain activations were identified as task-related and included in further analyses, and the results were visualized on a standard MNI brain template using summary statistics.</p><p>Subsequently, we conducted independent <italic>t</italic>-tests on single-brain activations in task-related brain regions, with group identification levels as the independent variable. The p-values were also adjusted to control for FDR (p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Then, we used Pearson’s correlation analyses to investigate the relationship between single-brain activation and individual performance (i.e., evaluated based on participants' accuracy in solving the case). Finally, we employed the PROCESS model 4 to construct a mediation model with 5000 bootstrap resamples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Preacher and Hayes, 2008</xref>) to examine the relationship between an individual’s perceived group identification and individual performance, which was mediated by single-brain activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Within-GNS</title><p>After pre-processing, GNS was used as the neural index (i.e., interpersonal brain activities that co-vary along the time course). Concerning GNS, and similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), the wavelet transform coherence (WTC) (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) was used to assess the cross-correlation between two oxy-Hb time series of pairs of participants.

Within each triad (taking one triad with subject IDs of 1, 2, and 3 as an example), WTC was applied to generate the brain-to-brain coupling of each pair in each triad (Coherence 1&amp;2, Coherence 1&amp;3, and Coherence 2&amp;3). Then, three coherence values from three pairs were averaged as the GNS for each triad, that is, GNS = (Coherence 1&amp;2 + Coherence 1&amp;3 + Coherence 2&amp;3)/3,<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><alternatives><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟨</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟨</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟨</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t2">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle WTC\left (t,s\right)=\frac{\left |\, \left \langle s^{-1}w^{ij}\left (t,s\right)\right \rangle \right |^{2}}{\left |\, \left \langle s^{-1}w^{i}\left (t,s\right)\right \rangle \right |^{2}\left |\, \left \langle s^{-1}w^{j}\left (t,s\right)\right \rangle \right |^{2'}}$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>Regarding the ﬁrst step, we estimated whether GNS was enhanced during the task compared to the baseline. Time-averaged GNS (also averaged across channels in each group) was compared between the baseline session (i.e., the resting phase) and the task session (from reading information to making decisions) using a series of one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests. Here, p-values were thresholded by controlling for FDR (p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). When determining the frequency band of interest, the time-averaged GNS was also averaged across channels. After that, we analyzed the time-averaged GNS of each channel. Then, channels showing significant GNS were regarded as regions of interest and included in subsequent analyses. An independent <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted on GNS, with group identification levels being the independent variable. Here, p-values were thresholded by controlling for FDR (p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). After that, the nonparametric permutation test was conducted on the observed interaction effects on GNS of the real group against the 1000 permutation samples. By pseudo-randomizing the data of all participants, a null distribution of 1000 pseudo-groups was generated (e.g., time series from member 1 in group 1 were grouped with member 2 in group 2 and member 3 in group 3). The GNS of 1000 reshuffled pseudo-groups was computed, and the GNS of the real groups was assessed by comparing it with the values generated by 1000 reshuffled pseudo-groups. To provide a complete picture of the underlying neural features, we also analyzed the GNS based on the HbR signal (see Supplementary Materials). Second, the Pearson’s correlation between GNS and collective performance (i.e., calculated by averaging the individual scores assigned by the three raters for each group) was performed. It is plausible that neural synchronization is closely associated with group identification and collective performance, suggesting that it serves as a promising mechanism to explore how group identification influences collective outcomes. Moreover, previous research has established that neural synchronization facilitates the emergence of group identification, and the degree to which neural synchronization occurs among group members may shape how individuals identify with the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reinero et al., 2021</xref>). Ultimately, PROCESS model 4 with 5000 bootstraps resamples was used to test how GNS mediated the relationship between group identification and collective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Preacher and Hayes, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>The brain activation connectivity</title><p>Studies in neuroimaging have indicated that brain activation connectivity could be useful in understanding brain functional integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montero-Hernandez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, an exploratory analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis that brain activation connectivity could support the connection between an individual’s single-brain activations and the corresponding group’s GNS, thereby linking individual decision-making and collective performance.</p><p>To explore this hypothesis, we first isolated HbO brain activity associated with individual and collective performance. Following that, we analyzed Pearson’s correlations between the original HbO data in the region related to individual and collective performance, denoted as brain activation connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). Subsequently, we carried out one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests on brain activation connectivity to ascertain if there was any connection to the task. Furthermore, independent <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted on brain activation connectivity with the group identification levels as the independent variable, accounting for the FDR (p &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Finally, we employed correlation and mediation analyses to assess if brain activation connectivity could explain the connection between individuals’ single-brain activation and the related group’s GNS. We examined the connection between the similarity in individual-collective performance and the correlation of brain activation, as well as whether the impact of each individual’s single-brain activation on the corresponding group’s GNS was regulated by their brain activation connectivity. We utilized the PROCESS tool in SPSS to investigate the proposed moderation effect. Specifically, we applied Model 1 with 5000 bootstrap resamples to examine the interaction between the independent variable (i.e., single-brain activation) and the moderator (i.e., brain activation connectivity) in predicting the dependent variable (i.e., GNS). It is noteworthy that prior to analysis, all variables in the moderation model were mean-centered to reduce multicollinearity and improve the interpretability of interaction terms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Dynamic analyses</title><p>Our goal was to gain a more thorough understanding of how group identification influences collective performance through neural processes, with a focus on dynamic perspectives and tracking.

To this end, we obtained more evidence through other methods. Previous studies have shown that the quality of information exchange, such as verbal interactions, eye contact, and smiling, is a reliable indicator of group behavior and is associated with collective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dikker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xie et al., 2023b</xref>). Therefore, three independent raters were asked to rate the quality of the information exchange of each group, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85. The raters were guided to consider verbal interactive frequency (e.g., ‘I agree with you’, ‘You’re right’, ‘I understand what you mean’) and nonverbal interactive frequency (e.g., eye contact and smiling) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xie et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The evaluation period consisted of group sharing and discussion, in which the raters evaluated the suggested items in 1-min increments. The scores of the 25 periods were then compiled. The final quality of the group’s information exchange was determined by taking the average of the scores of the three raters for each group.

We have made considerable revisions to our details of data analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reason that the reviews did not change is that there were really three central points that led to the &quot;incomplete&quot;. These were (1) the fact that there was potentially a selection bias due to double dipping, and (2) there was potentially a time-confound due to the lack of counterbalancing (3) There is confusion about how the modeling was done, but it seems like the modelling was of the complete block (rather than tied to specific events in that block).</p><p>(1) Double dipping</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to explain our robust safeguards against double-dipping and have provided detailed clarifications regarding the data analyses (pp.11-14).Our study ensures statistical independence between task-related region selection and hypothesis testing through three orthogonal mechanisms:</p><p>(1) Regressor Orthogonality:Statistical Independence Between Selection and Testing</p><p>The selection regressor (group mean activation) was mathematically independent from test regressors (group differences, behavioral scores). This was confirmed through our GLM implementation: First-level: Task vs. rest contrast (<italic>β</italic> values) for each participant; Second-level: One-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests (selection) vs. independent group/behavioral tests.</p><p>(2) Multimodal Validation: Complementary Neural and Behavioral Measures</p><p>We employed multiple distinct metrics to provide convergent yet independent validation of effects.</p><p>Neural Measures: Three orthogonal indices assessed different neural dimensions.</p><p>A. Single-brain activation examines neural activity patterns within individual decision-makers,</p><p>B. while within-group neural synchronization (GNS) quantifies the temporal alignment of neural activity across interacting group members during shared decision processes.</p><p>C. Functional connectivity (FC) analyses, by contrast, measure correlated activity between different brain regions within individual participants.</p><p>Behavioral Safeguards: Behavioral metrics were analyzed in independent regressions, avoiding circularity.</p><p>A. Individual performance was based on personal accuracy,</p><p>B. collective performance represented the group-level average accuracy across raters, and</p><p>C. their similarity was quantified as the Euclidean distance between individual and collective scores.</p><p>(3) Statistical Safeguards</p><p>We further ensured independence by applying strict FDR correction at both selection (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and testing stages (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Besides, permutation test was conducted, we tested 1,000 pseudo-group iterations for GNS null distributions.</p><p>Drawing on both classic and latest NIRS (e.g., Jiang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2023; Stolk et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2023) and NIRS hyperscanning studies (e.g., Liu et al., 2019; P’arnamets et al., 2020; Reinero et al., 2021; Számadó et al., 2021; Solansky, 2011), we performed the data analyses. Below, we provide the details of our data analysis:</p><p>Single-brain activation. To identify task-related brain regions (channels), we used a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test based on brain activation data from all participants during the task compared to the baseline (resting state).</p><p>(1) Data Collection: Each participant had brain activation data (HbO signals measured by fNIRS) during the task (the entire process of reading, sharing, discussing, and decision-making) and the resting state (baseline).</p><p>(2) Pre-processing: We sought to explore the neural mechanisms that manipulated group identification and its effect on collective performance. Data were preprocessed using the Homer2 package in MATLAB 2020b (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, USA). First, motion artifacts were detected and corrected using a discrete wavelet transformation filter procedure. After that, the raw intensity data were converted to optical density (OD) changes. Then, kurtosis-based wavelet filtering (Wav Kurt) was applied to remove motion artifacts with a kurtosis threshold of 3.3 (Chiarelli, Maclin, Fabiani, &amp; Gratton, 2015). Based on a prior multi-brain study of social interactions (Cheng et al., 2022), the output was bandpass filtered using a Butterworth filter with order 5 and cut-offs at 0.01 and 0.5 Hz to remove longitudinal signal drift and instrument noise. Finally, OD data were converted to HbO concentrations.</p><p>(3) Individual-Level Analysis: First, a GLM was used to compute the &quot;task vs. rest&quot; brain activation contrast for each participant [0,1], obtaining each individual's &quot;task effect&quot; value (<italic>β</italic> value, representing task activation strength).</p><p>(4) Group-Level Analysis: These &quot;task effect&quot; values from all participants were then aggregated, and a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was performed for each brain region (or channel) to determine whether the average activation in that region was significantly greater than 0 (i.e., significantly more active during the task compared to the resting state).</p><p>(5) Task-Related Regions: If the <italic>t</italic>-test result for a brain region was significant (p &lt; 0.05, FDR-corrected), we considered that region &quot;task-related&quot; and suitable for further analysis.</p><p>(6) Subsequent Tests:</p><p>- Group Comparisons: We examined differences in activation between groups (e.g., high vs. low group identification) using independent t-tests on the same task vs. baseline contrast.</p><p>- Behavioral Correlations: We analyzed relationships between task-related activation (<italic>β</italic> values) and behavioral scores (e.g., individual performance) using Pearson analyses.</p><p>- Mediation model: We examined the relationship between an individual's perceived group identification and individual performance, which was mediated by task-related activation (<italic>β</italic> values).</p><p>Within-Group Neural Synchronization (GNS).</p><p>(1) Data Collection and Pre-processing as above</p><p>(2) Calculation: WTC was applied to generate the brain-to-brain coupling of each pair in each triad (Coherence1&amp;2, Coherence 1&amp;3, and Coherence 2&amp;3). Then, three coherence values from three pairs were averaged as the GNS for each triad, that is, GNS = (Coherence 1&amp;2 + Coherence 1&amp;3 + Coherence 2&amp;3) / 3.</p><p>(3) Task-Related Regions: Time-averaged GNS (also averaged across channels in each group) was compared between the baseline session (i.e., the resting phase) and the task session (from reading information to making decisions) using a series of one-sample t-tests. When determining the frequency band of interest, the time-averaged GNS was also averaged across channels. After that, we analyzed the time-averaged GNS of each channel. Then, channels showing significant GNS were regarded as regions of interest and included in subsequent analyses.</p><p>(4) Permutation test: The nonparametric permutation test was conducted on the observed interaction effects on GNS of the real group against the 1,000 permutation samples.</p><p>(5) Subsequent Tests:</p><p>- Group Comparisons: We examined differences in activation between groups (e.g., high vs. low group identification) using independent <italic>t</italic>-tests on the same task vs. baseline contrast.</p><p>- Behavioral Correlations: The Pearson’s correlation between GNS and collective performance (i.e., calculated by averaging the individual scores assigned by the three raters for each group) was performed.</p><p>- Mediation model: We examined how GNS mediated the relationship between group identification and collective performance.</p><p>The brain activation connectivity.</p><p>(1) Data Collection and Pre-processing as above</p><p>(2) Calculation: Exploratory Pearson’s correlations between individual performance related HbO and collective performance-related HbO.</p><p>(3) Moderation analysis: Single-brain activation × connectivity → GNS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Counterbalancing.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate this valuable methodological insight. Building on prior group decision-making research (De Wilde et al., 2017; Stasser et al., 1992), we refined all stages to enhance experimental control and procedural clarity throughout the process (i.e., a. Reading information, b. Sharing private information, c. Discussing information, d. Decision) (Xie et al., 2023). Importantly, we maintained a fixed task sequence to preserve ecological validity, as this progression mirrors natural group decision-making dynamics.</p><p>While this design choice precludes sequential counterbalancing, several factors mitigate potential temporal confounds: (1) random assignment and uniform task timing across conditions minimize systematic between-group differences; (2) our whole-block GLM approach captures sustained decision-related neural activity rather than phase-specific effects; and (3) We fully acknowledge this limitation and will incorporate a detailed discussion of temporal considerations in the revised manuscript, while noting that our design provides unique advantages for studying naturalistic decision-making processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The modelling was of the complete block</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have explicitly stated that the analysis was performed at the block level rather than the event level, for the following reasons:</p><p>(1) The hidden profile task is inherently a “group decision-making process” that unfolds dynamically across multiple stages (reading, sharing, discussing, and deciding). Prior research in this paradigm (De Wilde et al., 2017; Stasser &amp; Titus, 1985; Xie et al., 2023) has consistently treated these phases as integrated blocks because the key cognitive and social processes (e.g., information integration, deliberation, and consensus formation) occur over extended interactions rather than discrete events.</p><p>(2) Methodologically, our fNIRS hyperscanning approach requires longer blocks to reliably capture the slow hemodynamic response and the gradual emergence of inter-brain neural synchronization during naturalistic social exchanges (Cui et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019). Event-related designs, while useful for transient stimuli, are less suited for studying prolonged, interactive decision-making where neural coupling develops over time. Thus, our block-based analysis aligns with both the cognitive demands of the task and the neuroimaging constraints, ensuring robust detection of group-level neural dynamics.</p></body></sub-article></article>
