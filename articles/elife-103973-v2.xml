Here, we performed a systemic analysis of social network behavior (SNB) that quantifies individual social distance (SD) in a group over time. The SNB assessment in 175 inbred strains from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetics Reference Panel showed a tight association of short SD with long developmental time, low food intake, and hypoactivity. The developmental inferiority in short-SD individuals was compensated by their group culturing. By contrast, developmental isolation silenced the beneficial effects of social interactions in adults and blunted the plasticity of SNB under physiological challenges. Transcriptome analyses revealed genetic diversity for SD traits, whereas social isolation reprogrammed select genetic pathways, regardless of SD phenotypes. In particular, social deprivation suppressed the expression of the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (<italic>Dsk</italic>) in three pairs of adult brain neurons. Male-specific DSK signaling to cholecystokinin-like receptor 17D1 mediated the SNB plasticity. In fact, transgenic manipulations of the DSK neuron activity were sufficient to imitate the state of social experience. Given the functional conservation of mammalian <italic>Dsk</italic> homologs, we propose that animals may have evolved a dedicated neural mechanism to encode early-life experience and transform group properties adaptively.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>social network behavior</kwd><kwd>early-life experience</kwd><kwd>social memory</kwd><kwd>Drosulfakinin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Suh Kyungbae Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUHF-17020101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Chunghun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2021M3A9G8022960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Chunghun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A5A1024261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Chunghun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2023R1A2C100627511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Taejoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2018R1A6A1A03025810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Taejoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social clustering behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are closely tied to compensatory mechanisms for developmental traits and adaptive behavior plasticity, requiring early-life social experiences and the memory-encoding neuropeptide signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals interact with other individuals in distinct social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clutton-Brock, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jezovit et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sokolowski, 2010</xref>). For instance, a pair of animals display aggression or mating behaviors, whereas a group of individuals may show collective behaviors through intricate networks of social interactions. Such social network behaviors (SNBs) are believed to enhance group fitness and are conserved across many species, underscoring their evolutionary significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sokolowski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blumstein et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, social interactions influence various physiological activities in individuals, including feeding, sleep/circadian rhythms, aggression, stress response, and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arzate-Mejía et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Sokolowski, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vora et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiong et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains elusive how group properties have evolved with other individual traits and how animals process social experiences to shape their behavior and physiology.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has long been considered a solitary species. Yet a group of flies can display distinct SNB under specific experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramdya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombrovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burg et al., 2013</xref>), serving as an ideal genetic model to address our questions above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jezovit et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have employed various biophysical parameters to quantify both individual and network behaviors in groups, establishing criteria for social interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jezovit et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramdya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentzur et al., 2021</xref>). While these measurements give a comprehensive view of group behaviors, our study focuses on the clustering property of social interactions within a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Social clustering is an intuitive measure that integrates diverse social interactions via multiple sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentzur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>), accompanying reductions in social distance (SD) among group members and their moving speed over time. We also reasoned that simple SD assessment could facilitate the alignment of large-scale datasets of group behaviors with physiological traits, differential gene expression, and neurogenetic manipulations.</p><p>These approaches lead to our demonstration that the group property for high social clustering (i.e., short SD) is closely associated with and compensates for inferior developmental traits in individuals. Moreover, <italic>Drosophila</italic> can adjust their social preferences according to physiological changes, indicating the adaptive plasticity of SNB. This social plasticity requires early-life social experiences that persist throughout development. We also define a specific neuropeptide signaling pathway that encodes social memory and supports SNB plasticity. Our findings thus provide new insights into the principles of SNB, offering a deeper understanding of the evolutionary and genetic bases of social behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and possibly other species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNB is a quantitative trait in a natural <italic>Drosophila</italic> population</title><p>We employed the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) to determine whether SNB has evolved with specific genetic factors and physiology. The DGRP consists of approximately 200 inbred wild-type strains and functions as a practical genetic library to explore the correlation between naturally occurring genetic variations and complex animal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mackay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mackay and Huang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardeux et al., 2024</xref>). We video-recorded a group of 16 male flies freely moving in an open arena for 10 min and quantitatively assessed their group properties over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These included SD between individual group members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), walking speed, and the centroid velocity of a given group. The DGRP lines displayed a range of distributions for the three parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and we found their significant correlations among 175 DGRP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; Spearman correlation analysis). For instance, short-SD lines gradually reduced SD and walking speed over time to stay in the cluster, thereby exhibiting short travel distances, slow walking speeds, and low centroid velocities on average (e.g., DGRP73, DGRP 563, and DGRP370) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). By contrast, long-SD lines persistently explored the arena during video recording and sustained ‘social distancing’ to display long travel distances, fast walking speeds, and high centroid velocities (e.g., DGRP360, DGRP707, and DGRP317) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), although their locomotion was modestly slowed down over time. The locomotion trajectories of individual flies confirmed these characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), and long-SD individuals traveled much longer distances than short-SD individuals across the DGRP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Short-SD flies did not significantly change their locomotor activity over time when we placed a single fly in the same arena and assessed its behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Thus, reduced activity in a group of short-SD flies is likely an effect of their clustering phenotypes but not necessarily the cause. Short- and long-SD flies retained their clustering properties even in a larger arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>; 8.5 cm in diameter), indicating active social preferences that persist in different environments. Both types of DGRP lines displayed no chaining behaviors in the open arena, excluding the possible implication of male-to-male courtship in their SD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). These results provide convincing evidence that SD is an inheritable group trait from natural <italic>Drosophila</italic> variants. Based on the average ranking of individual DGRP lines in the two group properties (i.e., SD and centroid velocity), we selected the top and bottom three DGRP lines representing short- and long-SD phenotypes, respectively, to elucidate the physiological significance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> SNB and its underlying mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Social network behavior (SNB) is a quantitative trait in a natural <italic>Drosophila</italic> population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The 10 min video recording of SNB in a group of 16 male flies.

These observations suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> express SNB traits from early development, and the sociality persists in adults. To better define the social-interaction effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> physiology, we obtained socially enriched or deprived larvae from fertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and then compared their developmental phenotypes among DGRP lines. Social isolation substantially impaired larval activity and development in both short- and long-SD lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). We further found that the short-SD trait is tightly associated with inferior phenotypes, particularly in isolated larvae. For instance, socially isolated larvae from the short-SD lines displayed poor digging activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), low food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), and long developmental time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) compared to those from the long-SD lines. Short-SD larvae also had lower eclosion success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) and a lower ratio of the adult male progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) than long-SD larvae, although isolated cultures reduced the eclosion success regardless of the SD trait. Grouping of short-SD larvae blunted or partially rescued these phenotypes (i.e., digging activity, developmental time, eclosion success, and male progeny ratio). Our group culture was not a competitive environment for limited resources to delay developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horváth and Kalinka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klepsatel et al., 2018</xref>), but it actually promoted food intake comparably in short- and long-SD larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The significant interaction effects of SD (i.e., short- vs. long-SD trait) and socialization (i.e., grouped vs. isolated cultures) on digging activity, developmental time, and male progeny ratio suggest that the clustering property of short-SD lines may have evolved as a compensation mechanism for the developmental inferiority in individuals. Considering that a low percentage of male likely limits mating choice, reproductive efficiency, and genetic diversity in a given group, social interactions may also contribute to the group fitness in short-SD lines across generations. We speculate that the feeding amount of isolated long-SD individuals is saturating for normal development (e.g., developmental time, male progeny ratio), possibly explaining the lack of interaction effects on food intake while displaying developmental inferiorities most evidently in isolated short-SD individuals.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Early-life social experience confers beneficial effects on <italic>Drosophila</italic> development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Larval clustering in short- (red) or long-social distance (SD) lines (blue). % clusters were calculated from 30 vials.

We hypothesized that superior traits in long-SD individuals led to their genetic selection toward the degeneration of social interaction effects. Alternatively, long-SD genomes may still encode genetic programs for social activity, but they only express social traits under physiologically challenging conditions. Given the positive correlation between locomotion activity and SD trait among DGRP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), we reasoned that modest injury could serve as a physiological cue to reduce locomotor activity in individuals, facilitate their interactions in a group, and induce SNB even in the long-SD flies. We indeed discovered that mechanical injury shortened SD in both sociality types of DGRP lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>;) while reducing walking speed and centroid velocity only in the long-SD lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

The two conditions, however, acted independently on the GCaMP signals in DSK neurons since their interaction effects were not significantly detected.

In particular, male brains expressing the CCKLR-17D1 knock-in transgene showed more signals for cell bodies and dendrites around MP1a axon projections than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).

We hypothesized that transgenic activation of DSK-CCKLR-17D1 signaling genetically mimics social experience in developmentally isolated flies.

Physiological challenges (e.g., mechanical injury) may adaptively modify the clustering property of a given group. However, the plasticity of group behaviors requires social experience during development. We propose that a subset of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain neurons expressing the neuropeptide DSK serves as a neural substrate for social memory, as supported by the intimate coupling of early-life social experience and SNB plasticity to DSK expression, DSK neuron activity, and postsynaptic signaling.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A working model for early-life social memory and the experience-dependent plasticity of social network behavior (SNB).</title><p>Social distancing is an inheritable trait in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Diverse genetic pathways contribute to active social preferences while the clustering property may have evolved to compensate for inferior traits in individuals and confer their group fitness. Nonetheless, <italic>Drosophila</italic> can tune their social distance depending on physiological states (e.g., mechanical injury) and this feature of SNB is defined as ‘social plasticity’. In fact, the social plasticity requires early-life social experience or ‘social memory’ during development. Group culturing elevates DSK expression and DSK neuron activity to reinforce its postsynaptic signals likely to the cognate receptor CCKLR-17D1. The activation of DSK-CCKLR-17D1 pathway thus encodes early-life social experience in developing brains to support social plasticity in adults.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103973-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Distinct social behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (i.e., aggression and mating) have been commonly mapped to specific pairs of DSK neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Presynaptic partners of DSK neurons are sexually dimorphic, while their postsynaptic effects are differentially mediated via the two DSK receptor pathways (i.e., CCKLR-17D1 for aggression and SNB plasticity; CCKLR-17D3 for sexual behaviors). Intriguingly, this neural architecture for balancing aggression and mating behaviors has been proposed to be analogously conserved between flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, DSK neuron activity correlates with social dominance (i.e., winner effects from aggression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) and group housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), but not with mating status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, the DSK-CCKLR-17D1 pathway meets the necessary criteria for male-specific SNB plasticity.</p><p>The phenotypic correlates of aggression and SNB in natural populations (i.e., DGRP lines) are consistent with their common neural locus. However, these findings do not necessarily imply that DSK neurons control the two social behaviors in a similar manner. For instance, DSK excitation promotes aggression in both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), whereas DSK signaling is unlikely to trigger grouping behaviors per se. What remains to be clarified is how DSK signaling gates SNB plasticity and why this process is missing in female flies. Considering that social hierarchy is established in male fights only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nilsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon and Heberlein, 2020</xref>), we speculate that male-specific DSK pathways may include extra circuit modalities for contextual processing of social environments and adaptive social structures. The development of neuroanatomical differences between male and female brains may coincide with the acquisition of gender-specified demands for innate behaviors and physiology during evolution (e.g., a reproductive advantage of male clustering under physiologically challenging conditions).</p><p>The mammalian DSK homolog CCK shows sexual dimorphism in brain expression and mating behavior response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloch et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloch et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micevych et al., 1988</xref>).

As you will see in our point-by-point responses below, the review was generally favorable, requiring additional data supplemental to our main conclusions, better clarification of method details, and statistical justifications.

Authors screened for a panel of inbred DGRP lines and compared the SD due to prior experience of group or single culturing when flies are recorded in a 55 mm diameter petri-dish. The screen uncovered 3 short Sd and three long-SD lines, and subsequent experiments showed differences in various behaviors such as recovery from injury, search for food and SD. Using RNA-seq from heads of flies they implicate Dsk signalling and show neuronal architecture and activity differences between grouped and isolated male flies. They implicate Dsk signalling in recovery from injury affecting SD but it was dispensable for grouped vs. isolated flies. I have suggestions to support the claims made, analysis and interpretation of the data and improve the clarity of writing. See my specific comments below.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. For recording social behaviour in flies, arenas with sloped walls have been extensively used called 'fly bowl' (Simon et al. 2010 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008793; Robie et al., 2017, doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.032), or 'flyworld' (Liu et al., 2018 doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006410). Such geometry ensures that flies don't walk on the side of the arena, and don't occlude each other. However, in the screen carried out in this manuscript, a petri-dish of 5.5 cm diameter filled with agar was used to record social network formation. Given the propensity of flies to walk on the walls of such circular arena, it will be difficult to know if the long and short SD behavior resulting from propensity to form clusters is an artefact of the assay condition used. It would be important to test the SNB and SD of at least the 6 selected short and long SD lines in arena with sloped walls to rule out this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>To minimize complications from side-wall walking or z-stacking of individual flies, the circular arena used in our study was filled with agar, making a space of 5.5 cm in diameter x ~0.15 cm in height (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In fact, the surface tension of the agar solution led to a rounded interface between the agar bed and the side wall that could prevent side-wall walking and partially mimic the sloped wall effects. We included representative video clips for SNB recording in the revised manuscript to further justify our experimental conditions (Video S1-S10). We also revised our method text accordingly and cited the relevant reference.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The circular arena for SNB recording.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103973-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Methods section would require additional details about the SNB assay for instance, the height of the agar bed and the effective height in which interactions was recorded is not mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our response to reviewer #1, major comment #1 above, we revised our method text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2C and 2D results in larvae seems to contradict previous studies that have shown that isolated flies eat more as adults (Li et al. Nature, 2021) and Dsk-RNAi increases feeding in larvae and adults (Soderberg et al., 2012). It might be due to unique characteristic of DGRP lines used and would be helpful to discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>We reason that high-digging activity in a group of individual larvae can increase the accessibility to “solid” food, thereby promoting their food intake over 12-h during development. However, food consumption rates and their regulation can vary depending on developmental stages or feeding conditions (e.g., larvae vs. adults; liquid vs. solid food; long-term vs. short-term) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30914005/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24937262/). It is thus not fair to align our results directly to those observed under very different biological/experimental contexts. For instance, Li et al. measured the amount of liquid food consumption in individually isolated adults from group culture vs. transient social isolation (i.e., 1-week isolation after eclosion). Soderberg et al. assessed the 15-minute feeding activities of larvae or adults on solid food but did not compare the feeding activity between grouped vs. isolated individuals. Therefore, it is not conclusive whether the DSK-depletion phenotypes are relevant to social experience or whether DSK signaling controls short-term feeding per se. Accordingly, we believe our observations do not necessarily contradict previous studies or indicate characteristics unique to the DGRP lines used in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Rutabaga mutants for Figure S3 are directly compared with CS flies in the maze assay and it appears from methods that these lines were not isogenized, this can significantly impact the results. Similarly for some of the subsequent Dsk experiments it appears that lines were not isogenized (see below). These experiments would either need to be repeated of this caveat needs to be explicitly mentioned to avoid misinterpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Since genetic backgrounds could substantially contribute to mutant phenotypes, we mentioned the caveat in our revised manuscript. As the reviewer suggested above, testing isogenized lines could be one option to confirm the genetic effects. Our study took an alternative approach where the observed phenotypes were validated by independent genetic models. For instance, the importance of DSK signaling in injury-induced SNB plasticity was validated by genomic deletions of DSK and DSK receptor genes, as well as by transgenic RNAi (Figure 7B and 7C). In the revised manuscript, we examined additional mutant alleles of <italic>rutabaga</italic> (Figure S6, rut[1] and rut[2080]), <italic>CCKLR-17D1</italic> (Figure S15, CCKLR-17D1[delta1] and CCKLR-17D1[delta2]), and <italic>CCKLR-17D3</italic> genes (Figure S15, CCKLR-17D3[delta1] and CCKLR-17D3[delta2]) to substantiate our original findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For Figure 3 describing RNA-seq data additional analysis would be helpful. Gene expression from isolated and grouped flies have been studied earlier by microarray and RNA-seq methods (Wang et al., PNAS 2008; Agrawal et al., JEB 2020; Li et al. Nature, 2021). Data from these studies should be compared with to see if there are common patterns of gene expression between long and short SD flies vs. group and isolated flies.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer's suggestion, we compared our DEG analysis with those reported in the previous studies. Genes upregulated in socially deprived flies overlapped substantially between our data and the published ones. However, the number of genes commonly upregulated in grouped cultures was very limited in the pairwise comparisons, and <italic>Dsk</italic> was the only gene upregulated across DEG analyses. Also, DEGs between the short vs. long SD lines barely overlapped with those between grouped vs. isolated flies across independent studies. We speculate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> has evolved a genetic reprogram where social isolation robustly induces the expression of select genes regardless of genetic backgrounds (i.e., DGRP lines in our study vs. Canton-S in the previous studies), whereas diverse genetic pathways shape the baseline SD traits. We revised our text accordingly and included these new analyses in the revised manuscript (Figure S10 and Dataset S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. GEO accession number and the analyzed list of DEGs should be provided as supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our original manuscript, we submitted our raw data to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA accession number PRJEB61423). Since ENA and GEO share their data, uploading our data redundantly onto the GEO should not be necessary. Our original manuscript also included all the DEG lists as supplementary tables (Dataset S1-S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3E &amp; F are not referred to in the main text, also there is no description of how the data was generated. Is this based on published data from Mackay lab about DGRP lines, if so, aggression experiments were not convincing in those studies and have been shown to not recapitulate 'real' aggression by other labs for several of the DGRP lines tested (Chowdhury et al., 2021, doi: 10.1038/s42003-020-01617-6).</p></disp-quote><p>The main text of our original manuscript actually referred to Figure 3E and 3F. We revised our figure legends to indicate the resources of raw DGRP data and clarified the method for the correlation comparisons. Since we employed the published aggression data from the Mackay lab study (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26100892), we experimentally validated that the long-SD lines indeed show more lunges (i.e., a well-established indicator of aggression behaviors) than the short-SD lines in our revised manuscript (Figure S11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Dsk was shown to be reduced in isolated flies by RNA-seq and play a role in aggression by an earlier study (Agrawal et al., 2020) and should be cited appropriately (line 180-181) and elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper was appropriately cited in our original/revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. For Figure 4A-B, source images for other two DGRP lines should be included at least in supplementary information, if not as main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative confocal images for the other DGRP lines were included in the revised manuscript (Figure 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. For Figure 5, what is the reason that uninjured flies don't show any SD phenotype? Are there any changes in their velocity? This is mentioned in passing on line 228-29 but should be properly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Genomic deletions or transgenic manipulations of the DSK-CCKLR-17D1 pathway gave consistent effects on the injury-induced clustering but not on baseline SD or walking speed. We reason that the DSK-CCKLR-17D1 pathway is dedicated to encoding early-life social experience by enforcing DSK neuron activity and their male-specific postsynaptic signaling. We clarified our text including the genetic background issue in the revised manuscript. Please also see our response to reviewer #1, major comment #4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Trans-Tango and UAS-Denmark, SytGFP experiments were performed previously by Wu et al., 2020 and Wang et al., 2021 for Dsk, these two studies observed that P1 neurons are presynaptic and Dsk neurons are post synaptic but in Figure 4 it's not clear what are the presynaptic and post synaptic neurons. Also these studies are not cited appropriately in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>The two studies expressed trans-Tango in P1 neurons (P1&gt;trans-Tango) to demonstrate that DSK-expressing neurons are postsynaptic to P1 neurons. They further visualized some overlaps between axon terminals of P1 neurons (P1&gt;sytGFP) and dendrites of DSK neurons (Dsk&gt;DenMark). On the other hand, we expressed the trans-Tango in DSK neurons (Dsk&gt;trans-Tango) to visualize their male-specific/social experience-dependent postsynaptic targets. We also visualized brain regions positive for both synaptic signals from Dsk&gt;sytGFP and the postsynaptic signals from Dsk&gt;trans-Tango. The two studies were cited in our original manuscript to discuss presynaptic partners of DSK neurons and their distinct roles in animal behaviors. We further cited the two studies in this result section of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1.

The manuscript asks interesting questions and authors have done extensive set of experiments but the progress appears incremental given the current state of the field, especially for the later part of the manuscript.

A systemic analysis revealed that short SD is associated with long developmental time, low food intake, and hypoactivity. Group culturing compensates for developmental inferiority in short social distance individuals. Social interactions during early development positively impact adult physiology and adaptive social plasticity. Transcriptome analyses show genetic diversity for SD traits. The neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) signaling mediates social network behavior plasticity via receptor CCKLR-17D1, particularly in males, suggesting a dedicated neural mechanism encoding early-life experiences to adaptively transform group properties. The research suggests that animals have developed neural mechanisms to encode early-life experiences. It offers insights into the genetic foundation and adaptability of social behavior in Drosophila, shedding light on the neural processes involved in social memory and the adaptive behaviors of groups. These findings have broader implications for understanding similar neural mechanisms governing social memory and group behaviors in other species.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Major 1. In Figure 2H, the latency to 75% arrival of short-SD isolated fruit flies (no matter with or without pioneers) is close to that of group fruit flies with pioneers while the latency to 75% arrival of long-SD isolated fruit flies (no matter with or without pioneers) is close to that of group fruit flies without pioneers; How to explain the difference in latency to 75% array between long-SD and short-SD isolated fruit flies? It seems that only in the long-SD fruit flies from the grouped experience, the absence of pioneers will increase the time it takes to reach the target food in the maze.</p></disp-quote><p>Social deprivation effects on pioneer-free group foraging somewhat varied across the long SD lines (Figure 4B and S5, blue). We reason that the hyperactivity of individual long-SD flies facilitates their food-seeking behaviors in the maze, weakening the pioneer effects or even overriding the group property. Nonetheless, our statistical analyses validated that (1) prior social experience did not significantly affect the group performance of 16 naive flies in the maze assay (the only exception was DGRP707, a long-SD line that showed longer latency in group-cultured naive flies than in socially isolated ones), (2) the presence of pioneers significantly shortened the latency in both short- and long-SD lines, and (3) the pioneer effects were evident only in group-cultured flies. We accordingly revised our result text to better elucidate our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major 2. In Figure 3C, there are two up-regulated genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> group that overlap in short-SD and long-SD strains. Apart from Dsk, what is the other gene? In addition, for isolated fruit flies, both short-SD and long-SD lines have more gene expression upregulated. How to explain this phenomenon? Can you briefly explore the reasons for their upregulation and instead of involvement in SNB plasticity, what kind of physiological functions may they have?</p></disp-quote><p>The other gene commonly upregulated in group-cultured DGRP flies was Arc1 (Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein), implicated in synaptic plasticity and fat metabolism (https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033926.htm). Arc1 downregulation upon social isolation could be relevant to the weak postsynaptic signaling of DSK neurons (Figure 6D and 6E) or be a part of the metabolic reprogramming (Figure 5D; also see below). Nonetheless, we focused on the neuropeptide DSK, given its unique expression in the brain and relevance to other social behaviors (e.g., mating, aggression). In fact, <italic>Dsk</italic> was the only overlapping gene that was downregulated upon social isolation across independent studies (Figure S10A).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, social isolation upregulated many genes, including those involved in metabolism. Our revised manuscript additionally showed that upregulated but not downregulated genes upon social isolation were substantially conserved across genetic backgrounds or independent DEG studies (Figure 5C and S10A). We speculate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> has evolved a genetic reprogram where social isolation elevates metabolic gene expression to adaptively induce a metabolic shift for energy storage and fitness. We revised our text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major 3. In lines 219-223, the genomic deletion by mutant or depletion by RNA interference emphasizes the role of neuropeptides DSK and its receptor CCKLR-17D1 in injury-induced clustering behaviors. How about the effect of neuropeptides overexpression? Do they confer injury-induced social interactions to isolated male flies. Meanwhile, in line 238, the transgenic excitation of CCKLR-17D1 neurons emphasizes the function of neuronal synaptic transmission in the pathway. Indeed, both neuropeptide expression and neuronal synaptic connections may be involved in the regulation of injury-induced clustering behaviors. It is recommended to separate the discussion of protein expression and the respective regulatory modes at the neuronal circuit level.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not test DSK overexpression effects on injury-induced clustering in socially isolated males since we failed to validate DSK overexpression from a relevant transgenic line (https://flybase.org/reports/FBal0184043.htm). Instead, we provided additional data in the revised manuscript that independent genomic deletions of the CCKLR-17D1 locus (Figure S15) or transgenic silencing of the synaptic transmission in CCKLR-17D1 neurons (Figure S16) suppressed the injury-induced clustering in group-cultured male flies. According to the reviewer's suggestion, we modified our text to better distinguish between the effects of gene/protein expression vs. relevant neuron activities on social behavior plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major 4. Since a significant portion of the work in the first half of this paper is focused on elucidating two types of social distance in SNB, is there any difference in the regulation of social network plasticity by Dsk signaling pathway in the short-SD and long-SD lines?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, it will be informative to determine if Dsk signaling for social behavior plasticity is differentially regulated in short- vs. long-SD lines. One technical issue is that genetic factors shaping their SD traits still need to be defined. So, we are limited to performing standard genetic/transgenic experiments using the DGRP lines while retaining their SD phenotypes. Accordingly, our current approach was to compare DSK expression in short- vs. long-SD lines under grouped- vs. isolated-culture conditions.

By transcriptome analyses and gene ontology (GO) analyses they revealed genes up or down regulation in the social experience. They have also narrowed down to the DSK signaling involved in the social experience encoding process. However, the study's limitation lies in the lack of clarity regarding the DSK signaling pathway. The mechanisms through which social experiences affect neuronal activity and synaptic connections remain unclear. Further research on upstream and downstream pathways could enhance understanding. Although the article proposes injury-induced clustering behaviors, the key sensory pathways involved in social network behavior plasticity during early social experiences are not well-defined. Conducting sensory deprivation experiments could elucidate sensory involvement. Overall, the study's strengths lie in its comprehensive approach, large sample size, and translational potential. To enhance future research, investigating the complexity of neural mechanisms and expanding the exploration of regulating pathways could be beneficial. Additionally, exploring the ecological relevance of the findings could deepen our understanding of social behavior in natural environments.</p></disp-quote><p>Our current work provides a neuroanatomical basis for early-life social memory and experience-dependent plasticity of social-interaction behaviors. We believe future studies will build up the mechanical details for social experience-dependent DSK expression, DSK neuron activity, and behavioral outputs. Regarding the key sensory pathways, we examined injury-induced SNB plasticity of distinct sensory mutants (e.g., olfactory, visual, auditory, etc.) and our revised manuscript provided additional data that norpA-dependent visual sensing might play a crucial role in this process (Figure S9), consistent with the previous finding that vision is required for larval clustering behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28918946/).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Advance:</p><p>Compared to previous studies such as Heiko Dankert et al.'s publication in 2009 in Nature Methods and Assa Bentzur et al.'s publication in 2020 in Current Biology, which also investigated the impact of early life experiences on male social behavior and examined various aspects of social network construction, this study employs a systematic analysis of social network behavior (SNB) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, integrating genetic, physiological, and behavioral assessments. The authors conducted detailed and systematic analyses through transcriptome and gene ontology (GO) analyses, including the visualization of gene expression heatmaps, volcano plots, and overlapping analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between grouped and isolated conditions.

Despite its ambitious scope, the manuscript lacks a clear rationale and cohesive flow among its sections. The numerous experiments do not merge into a unified narrative, leaving the reader questioning the reasoning and progression behind the experimental choices. The manuscript needs a clearer structure, well-defined hypotheses, and more detailed methodological descriptions. Greater emphasis on novelty and better integration with existing literature are also needed. The lack of control experiments and adequate statistical analysis weakens some conclusions.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. The authors show that flies in short SD lines reduce their activity over time, leading to the formation of social clusters (Figure 1B). This clustering could potentially be attributed to reduced activity rather than active social preferences. It would be informative to test whether these SD flies exhibit similar social behaviors when placed in a larger arena, to test if the clustering persists under varied environmental conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Short-SD flies did not reduce their moving speed over time when we placed a single fly in the original arena and assessed its locomotor behavior individually (Figure S2). Thus, it is likely that the reduced activity in a group of short-SD flies is an effect of clustering over time but not necessarily the cause. We also confirmed that short and long SD lines retain their clustering property even in a larger arena (8.5 cm in diameter) (Figure S3). We included these new data in our revised manuscript to better demonstrate active social preferences in the DGRP lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In lines 78-79, the authors claim that &quot;short-SD flies gradually reduced SD over time and stayed in the cluster.&quot; However, the study established SD clustering by only analyzing behavior during the last quarter of a 10-minute window, assigning a single data point to each fly and taking the average for group SD. Yet, a single value cannot demonstrate whether initially formed clusters remained stable-unchanged-over time. To strengthen this point, the authors could investigate dynamic changes in SD over a longer period to demonstrate stability, or alternatively, adjust the language to better convey the findings. Additionally, including a time scale in Figure 1B would enhance the clarity of these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We traced dynamic changes in SD and walking speed of representative DGRP lines over the 10-minute window (Figure 2A and 2B) and modified our text accordingly in the revised manuscript. We also included a time scale in Figure 1B and relevant figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The statistical analysis presented in Figure 2C-D raises concerns. It appears that feeding and digging efficiency in both SD type lines benefit from socialization, suggesting that the effects attributed to SD might stem from the overall digging and feeding activity of each line. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate both social distance (short vs. long) and socialization (grouped vs. isolated) into the analysis using methods that allow for the assessment of confounding effects (interaction), such as two-way ANOVA or regression, depending on the data. This would help authors to clarify whether isolation reduces feeding overall (both line types) and determine if this reduction is more pronounced in short-SD lines. Additionally, it is counterintuitive that lines with more larvae per cluster show worse digging efficiency when previous studies, such as Dombrovski et al. (2017), have shown that larger groups of larvae typically exhibit better digging efficiency. This discrepancy highlights the need for a thorough re-evaluation of the data and assumptions regarding group dynamics and their impact on resource access.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we employed ordinary or aligned ranks transformation 2-way ANOVA (depending on the normality and equal variance of a given dataset) to determine if social distance and socialization cooperatively contribute to developmental phenotypes. Our new analyses confirmed significant interaction effects of social distance and socialization on most developmental phenotypes tested (i.e., larval digging activity, developmental time, %male progeny, and %eclosion success). These results convincingly support that short-SD larvae benefit more from socialization than long-SD larvae to compensate for the inferior phenotypes in isolated individuals. We speculate that the feeding amount of isolated long-SD individuals may be saturating for normal development (i.e., developmental time, %male progeny), possibly explaining the lack of interaction effects on food intake while displaying developmental inferiorities only in isolated short-SD individuals. We reason that grouped long-SD flies should not necessarily display poorer digging activity than grouped short-SD flies since isolated long-SD individuals displayed much higher digging activity than isolated short-SD individuals. Consistent with the previous finding, both SD lines showed better digging efficiency when grouped than isolated. We included these new analyses in the revised manuscript and modified our text accordingly.

The choice to use the percentage of male progeny as a measure of developmental success is confusing, especially without an explanation for why it is favored over measures like overall progeny survival rates. As with digging and feeding, the statistical analysis should include an examination of potential interaction effects to fully assess how social conditions impact developmental outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>The percentage of male progeny was one of the most evident developmental phenotypes on which social distance and socialization showed significant interaction effects. In the revised manuscript, we further included the percentage of eclosed flies as a measure for the overall progeny survival rate (Figure 3F) and performed 2-way analyses to validate the significant interaction effects of social distance and socialization on various larval/developmental phenotypes. Please see our response to reviewer #3, major comment #3 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The rationale for using physical injury to induce SNB in the study is not clearly explained, raising concerns about the potential impact of injury on overall locomotion. Before employing such a method in sociality experiments, it is crucial to demonstrate that the injury does not affect locomotion. Additionally, the study's methodologies for transitioning between grouped and isolated cultures (present only in Figure 2I and not in the methods section), as well as the specific methods used to measure social distance (SD) in isolated flies, are not sufficiently detailed. This lack of clarity complicates the evaluation of the study's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine if the long-SD lines express their social behaviors selectively (e.g., upon physiological challenges), we introduced physical injury to the SNB analysis. There was a positive correlation between locomotion activity and SD trait among DGRP lines (i.e., DGRP lines with low walking speed and centroid velocity exhibited short-SD phenotypes in general) (Figure 1D). This observation thus prompted us to hypothesize that modest injury may reduce locomotor activity in individuals, facilitate their interactions in a group, and shorten the overall SD. The mechanical injury actually shortened SD in both the short- and long-SD lines (Figure 4D and S7A). Under the same experimental condition, mechanical injury reduced walking speed and centroid velocity only in the long-SD lines (Figure S8), whereas social isolation blunted the injury effects (Figure 4D, S7A, and S8). We reason that our injury condition does not severely impair general locomotion per se to abolish or overestimate SNB, but low activity in grouped long-SD flies is likely a consequence of their injury-induced clustering. We clarified our original text for the rationale and included the new data in the revised manuscript (Figure S8). We also revised the method text for the transitions between grouped and isolated cultures, as well as for measuring SD in isolated flies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lines 104-106 &quot;The clustering property of short-SD lines may have evolved as a compensation mechanism for their developmental inferiority in individuals&quot;. To support this claim, the authors should assess the significance of interactions terms as stated earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to the reviewer’s relevant comments above (reviewer #3, major comments #3 and #4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4, the authors conclude that Drosulfakinin (DSK) signaling encodes early-life experiences for SNB plasticity. It is crucial for the authors to differentiate whether changes in feeding behavior are directly due to DSK or if they are secondary effects resulting from altered social interactions mediated by DSK.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies demonstrated that DSK is a satiety-signaling molecule whose expression is elevated upon feeding to suppress food intake (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34398892/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32314736/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25187989/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22969751/). Under our experimental context, social isolation downregulated DSK expression and DSK neuron activity, whereas isolated larvae rather reduced their food intake. It is thus unlikely that changes in the feeding behavior of isolated larvae directly implicate DSK-dependent satiety signaling. We discussed this issue in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 4, the data show that DSK peptide is significantly increased in cell bodies in grouped long DS lines when compared with grouped short DS lines (Figure 4B). However, no changes are reported at the level of DSK projection levels when comparing these groups. Can the authors clarify this?</p></disp-quote><p>The SD-trait effects on DSK levels were evident in cell bodies but not in DSK neuron projections. We reason that axonal transport or processing of the neuropeptide was limiting under the group-culture condition. These observations might also be relevant to our conclusion that <italic>Dsk</italic> is not crucial for shaping the SD traits per se. We revised our text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Additionally, the data show that DSK activity is reduced by isolation in both types of SD. To clarify if this effect is driven by isolation only, and not type of line (short vs long SD line), the interaction term should be tested. Furthermore, it is not clear what lines are used in live imaging (e.g., Figure 4C-F).</p></disp-quote><p>We detected no significant interaction effects of SD type and social isolation on DSK expression (Figure 6B). Live-brain imaging of the GCaMP-expressing DSK neurons was performed using a transgenic line (i.e., Dsk-Gal4&gt;UAS-GCaMP) in a wild-type background. Since genetic factors shaping the SD traits were not defined in each DGRP line, we could not combine the transgenes with DGRP backgrounds while retaining their respective SD phenotypes (please also see our response to reviewer #2 major comment #4 above). Nonetheless, the GCaMP imaging demonstrates that (1) either injury or social isolation alone significantly affects DSK neuron activity, but (2) the two conditions act independently on the GCaMP signals (i.e., no significant interaction effects). We clarified it in our revised manuscript and displayed each genotype used in our imaging experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. In the 'Male-specific DSK-CCKLR-17D1 signalling mediates SNB plasticity' section (line 217), the analysis should include an interaction term to account for the possible confounding effects of isolation and injury on SD. This would aid in determining whether the impacts of social isolation and injury on DSK signalling and SNB plasticity are independent of each other or if they interact in significant ways, as stated by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout our revised manuscript, we performed 2-way analyses to validate the interaction effects of isolation and injury on SD and support our conclusion.

A better description of methods, especially behavioral approaches, could vastly help in understanding the results. Clarifying the methodologiy, particularly the behavioral approaches, would greatly enhance the understanding of the results. Also, the method for quantifying the total number of larvae per vial is unclear, particularly whether variations in larval density were considered. This is crucial, as different densities could affect the available sensory cues necessary for larval aggregation, such as vision (e.g. Dombrovski et al. Curr Biol. 2019). Better descriptions of the results and inclusion of exact statistical analyses used in support of the claims are also needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised our method text to better describe our experimental conditions.
