Previous work identified helical-cell-shape-promoting protein complexes containing a peptidoglycan-hydrolase (Csd1), a peptidoglycan precursor synthesis enzyme (MurF), a non-enzymatic homolog of Csd1 (Csd2), non-enzymatic transmembrane proteins (Csd5 and Csd7), and a bactofilin (CcmA). Bactofilins are highly conserved, spontaneously polymerizing cytoskeletal bacterial proteins. We sought to understand CcmA’s function in generating the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells. Using CcmA deletion analysis, in vitro polymerization, and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we identified that the bactofilin domain and N-terminal region of CcmA are required for helical cell shape and the bactofilin domain of CcmA is sufficient for polymerization and interactions with Csd5 and Csd7. We also found that CcmA’s N-terminal region inhibits interaction with Csd7. Deleting the N-terminal region of CcmA increases CcmA-Csd7 interactions and destabilizes the peptidoglycan-hydrolase Csd1. Using super-resolution microscopy, we found that Csd5 recruits CcmA to the cell envelope and promotes CcmA enrichment at the major helical axis. Thus, CcmA helps organize cell-shape-determining proteins and peptidoglycan synthesis machinery to coordinate cell wall modification and synthesis, promoting the curvature required to build a helical cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic></kwd><kwd>cell shape</kwd><kwd>bactofilin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AI152331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sichel</surname><given-names>Sophie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI136946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salama</surname><given-names>Nina R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM95421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sichel</surname><given-names>Sophie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>GO-MAP Graduate Opportunity Program Research Assistantship Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sichel</surname><given-names>Sophie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>VUMC Discovery Scholars in Health and Medicine Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Benjamin Bratton</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bratton</surname><given-names>Benjamin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salama</surname><given-names>Nina R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Audacious Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institute for Protein Design</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sichel</surname><given-names>Sophie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The helical cell shape of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> depends on the polymerizing cytoskeletal protein CcmA’s recruitment to the cell envelope by Csd5 and CcmA’s indirect stabilization of a periplasmic cell wall hydrolase via interactions with the transmembrane protein Csd7.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> is a helical-shaped, Gram-negative bacteria that infects more than half of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hooi et al., 2017</xref>).

Multiple proteins have been identified that are essential for the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells, most of which influence the shape and composition of the peptidoglycan (PG) sacculus directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sycuro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sycuro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several cell-shape-determining (Csd) proteins form membrane-spanning protein complexes. Csd5 is a transmembrane protein that binds directly to PG in the periplasm with its SH3 domain and binds to CcmA in the cytoplasm. Csd5 also interacts with ATP synthase and MurF, an essential PG precursor enzyme that catalyzes the final cytoplasmic PG biosynthesis step, independent of interactions with CcmA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hrast et al., 2013</xref>). Another complex is formed by Csd7, Csd1, and Csd2. Csd7 is a transmembrane protein that stabilizes the PG-hydrolase Csd1, and Csd2, a catalytically inactive homolog of Csd1. Weak interactions between Csd7 and CcmA have been detected by co-immunoprecipitation experiments that include cross-linking reagents followed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), but whether CcmA, Csd7, and Csd5 are all part of one protein complex was unclear. CcmA and probes that report on PG synthesis localize to the major helical axis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells (regions with a Gaussian curvature value of 5 ± 1 µm<sup>–2</sup> on a helical cell), indicating that CcmA is in the same region of the cell where increased levels of PG synthesis occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>CcmA is the only bactofilin encoded in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> genome.

But how a cytoplasmic bactofilin influences the PG cell wall in the periplasm is unclear. Bactofilins are identified by the presence of a bactofilin domain (DUF583), which forms a β-helix that is flanked by unstructured terminal regions. The function of the terminal regions and bactofilin domain of bactofilins are debated. It has been proposed that the terminal regions may be involved in modulating polymerization, binding to membranes and/or interacting with other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>). However, experimental evidence to identify the function of the bactofilin domain and terminal regions of CcmA and other bactofilins is lacking.</p><p>Here, we performed structure–function analysis to determine how the bactofilin domain and the terminal regions of CcmA contribute to generating the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells by evaluating cell morphology, CcmA polymerization and filament bundling, and interaction with known Csd protein interaction partners. Additionally, we identified how protein binding partners impact CcmA localization. We found that interactions between CcmA and other Csd proteins are responsible for CcmA’s ability to pattern the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells and identified that interactions between CcmA and its binding partners modulate CcmA localization and modulate protein stability of the PG-hydrolase Csd1. Together, these findings allow us to establish a new model for how <italic>H. pylori</italic>’s helical cell shape is generated. We clarify that CcmA participates in two separate helical-cell-shape-generating protein complexes. Additionally, these studies reveal that bactofilins can influence PG sacculus structure by modulating the protein stability of a PG hydrolase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CcmA is composed of a bactofilin domain and two short terminal regions</title><p>To facilitate structure–function analysis of CcmA’s biochemical and cell biologic functions, we aligned the amino acid sequence of CcmA with BacA, a well-studied bactofilin from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> involved in stalk morphogenesis<italic>,</italic> using SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>).

The bactofilin literature suggested that the terminal regions on either end of the bactofilin domain may be involved in binding to membranes, modulating protein–protein interactions, or modulating polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>), and we hypothesized deleting the terminal regions of <italic>ccmA</italic> would alter cell shape.

Although equal concentrations of each purified protein were loaded, the polyclonal ɑ-CcmA antibody poorly recognized versions of CcmA lacking the C-terminal region (<italic>∆CT</italic> and BD), suggesting that the <italic>∆CT</italic> and BD proteins are likely expressed in <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells at similar levels to other versions of CcmA but are not robustly recognized by the ɑ-CcmA polyclonal antibody.</p><p>Next, after confirming that all truncated versions of CcmA were expressed, we assessed the shapes of the cells and found that strains lacking the N-terminal region (<italic>∆NT</italic> and BD) were indistinguishable from <italic>∆ccmA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), while cells lacking the C-terminal region of <italic>ccmA</italic> resembled WT cells.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy can be used to identify the secondary structure and folding of proteins. Different structural elements have characteristic CD spectra, and proteins that consist of β-strands have negative peaks at 216 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greenfield, 2006</xref>). We recombinantly expressed and purified 6-his CcmA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and collected CD spectra from 200 to 260 nm at fixed temperatures to identify the secondary structure and measure its thermal stability.</p><p>CD spectra of WT CcmA and the truncation mutants <italic>∆NT</italic>, <italic>∆CT</italic>, and BD at 20°C all look very similar; they have the characteristic negative peak at 216 nm, indicating β-strand secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Together, these data, combined with the modeling by RoseTTAFold in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, suggest that CcmA’s bactofilin domain very likely forms a β-helix and confirms that neither terminal region is required for the bactofilin domain to fold properly. In contrast, we also ran CD scans on WT CcmA at 95°C and two CcmA point mutants we have previously shown were unable able to rescue the CcmA null cell shape defect, indicating that they were nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>) at 20°C. The CD spectra of both mutants (I55A and L110S) at 20°C resemble spectra of melted WT CcmA at 95°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that these proteins are not folded. Thus, while CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic>, BD, I55A, and L110S all have the same cell shape phenotype when expressed in <italic>H. pylori</italic> – loss of helical cell shape – the mechanism differs. In CcmA I55A and L110S, CcmA is not folded and nonfunctional, while in CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> and BD, the protein is folded, but loss of the N-terminus causes a loss of helical cell shape.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Circular dichroism spectra of purified 6-his CcmA suggests CcmA is composed of predominantly β-sheets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Circular dichroism spectra of WT and truncated versions of CcmA at room temperature (20°C), WT (black), <italic>∆NT</italic> (green), <italic>∆CT</italic> (pink), and BD (cyan).

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holtrup et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>), WT CcmA polymerizes into small filaments that measure on average 3.04 nm (SD = 0.79, n = 18) in width.

These data suggest that the bactofilin domain is sufficient for polymerization of CcmA while the N- and C-terminal regions of CcmA regulate interpolymer interactions that impact the width of bundles by modulating the number of filaments that form a bundle, and the ability of CcmA to form lattices. Taken together with our experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where we expressed the truncated versions of CcmA in <italic>H. pylori</italic>, these data suggest that the ability of CcmA to polymerize is not sufficient to pattern the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells and in vitro lattice formation does not correlate with helical cell shape.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The bactofilin domain of CcmA is sufficient for in vitro polymerization while the terminal regions promote lateral polymer interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of negative stained, purified CcmA, scale bars = 500 nm.

CcmA was previously shown to interact with two Csd proteins, Csd5 and Csd7, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Csd5-CcmA interactions were readily detected by co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. However, Csd7-CcmA interactions could only be detected when a cross-linking reagent was included in co-immunoprecipitation experiments and mass spectrometry was used to detect CcmA, suggesting that Csd7-CcmA interactions are weak or potentially transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).

To probe how each region of CcmA contributes to interactions with Csd5 and Csd7, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blotting on strains expressing truncated versions of CcmA. Strains were generated that expressed truncated versions of <italic>ccmA</italic> at the native <italic>ccmA</italic> locus, <italic>csd1</italic> at the <italic>rdxA</italic> locus as described earlier, and either <italic>csd5-2X-FLAG</italic> or <italic>csd7-3X-FLAG</italic> at their native loci. We immunoprecipitated either Csd5-FLAG or Csd7-FLAG with ɑ-FLAG agarose beads, then performed Western blotting and probed with the ɑ-CcmA polyclonal antibody to identify whether the truncated versions of CcmA could still co-purify. When we immunoprecipitated Csd5-FLAG, all mutant versions of CcmA were detected by Western blotting of the IP fractions, except for the <italic>∆CT</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), though it is likely that this mutant can still interact with Csd5-FLAG.

We used the fluorescent WGA channel that labels the PG cell wall to generate the cell surface. As we computationally shrink the cell surface (offset from surface decreases), we observe the relative concentration of WGA and CcmA-HaloTag signal with respect to the position of the cell surface. In both a WT and <italic>∆csd5</italic> cell, the WGA signal peaks at offset from surface = 0 nm where the PG cell wall is located within the periplasm. In WT cells, CcmA-HaloTag signal peaks near –50 nm from the PG cell wall and declines further to the inside of the cell. Based on cryo-electron tomography data, an approximate distance of 50 nm from the PG cell wall to the cytoplasm in <italic>H. pylori</italic> is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qin et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, in a <italic>∆csd5</italic> cell, the CcmA-HaloTag signal peaks near –100 nm from the cell surface and continues to be high even as the surface of interest approaches center of the cell (approximately –300 nm), indicating that more CcmA-HaloTag signal is found near the center of the cell in <italic>∆csd5</italic> cells than in WT cells. When we performed the same analysis on the entire populations of cells (292 WT and 326 <italic>∆csd5</italic>), we found that while the overall trends were the same as when we analyzed individual cells, there was a lot of variability in the WT cell population. The variability of the WT population arises because many WT cells have both a population of CcmA-HaloTag at the cell envelope (peak at –50 nm) and in the center of the cell that causes a broader left tail in the population-level data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Δcsd5</italic> population-level signal peak is broader and shifted towards the center of the cell (–80 nm). Thus, Csd5 is required for CcmA to localize to the cell envelope.</p><p>To identify where CcmA-HaloTag signal that is at the cell surface is in relation to cell curvature, we calculated the Gaussian curvature values of all cell surfaces represented in the populations. WT cells (which are helical) have a larger range of Gaussian curvature values on their cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>) compared to all other shape mutants. Interestingly, although all shape mutants are not helical, they do display different surface Gaussian curvature distributions and <italic>∆csd7</italic> and <italic>∆csd5/7</italic> populations look nearly identical, suggesting that <italic>∆csd5/7</italic> double mutants resemble the shape of a <italic>∆csd7</italic> mutant.</p><p>In WT cells, CcmA-HaloTag is enriched at the major helical axis (Gaussian curvature value of 5 ± 1 µm<sup>–2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>); enrichment peaks at +3.35 µm<sup>–2</sup> to +5.31 µm<sup>–2</sup> Gaussian curvature and is depleted at Gaussian curvature values lower than +0.97 µm<sup>–2</sup> and higher than +6.67 µm<sup>–2</sup>. These data are consistent with previous experiments where CcmA-FLAG was detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, in all other strains, CcmA-HaloTag is depleted at regions of Gaussian curvature where CcmA-HaloTag is enriched in WT cells (+3.35 µm<sup>–2</sup> to +5.31 µm<sup>–2</sup>), although those Gaussian curvature values are still present in all cell-shape-mutant populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C D</xref>). In <italic>∆csd6</italic> and <italic>∆csd7</italic> mutants, CcmA-HaloTag is enriched at negative Gaussian curvature values. In <italic>∆csd6</italic> mutants, enrichment peaks at and continues to be enriched at all values lower than +0.11 µm<sup>–2</sup> Gaussian curvature (to –4 µm<sup>–2</sup> Gaussian curvature). In <italic>∆csd7</italic> mutants, CcmA-HaloTag enrichment peaks at +0.15 µm<sup>–2</sup> and is enriched at all values below +0.15 µm<sup>–2</sup> (to –5.4 µm<sup>–2</sup> Gaussian curvature; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast to <italic>∆csd6</italic> and <italic>∆csd7</italic> mutants, in <italic>∆csd5</italic> mutants, CcmA-HaloTag is depleted at negative Gaussian curvature values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Interestingly, in a <italic>∆csd5/7</italic> double mutant, the CcmA-HaloTag enrichment pattern mirrors the <italic>∆csd5</italic> mutant enrichment pattern. In <italic>∆csd5</italic> mutants, CcmA-HaloTag is enriched at Gaussian curvature values from –1.18 µm<sup>–2</sup> to +2.5 µm<sup>–2</sup> and has a peak enrichment at +0.68 µm<sup>–2</sup>, CcmA-HaloTag is depleted at all other values of Gaussian curvature. In a <italic>∆csd5/7</italic> double mutant, CcmA-HaloTag is enriched at Gaussian curvatures of –0.99 µm<sup>–2</sup> to +3.46 µm<sup>–2</sup> and peaks at +0.85 µm<sup>–2</sup>, CcmA-HaloTag is depleted at all other values of Gaussian curvature. Taken together, these data suggest that Csd5 directs CcmA to the cell envelope; CcmA is unable to localize to the cell envelope without Csd5. When helical cell shape is disrupted but Csd5 is present (in a <italic>∆csd6</italic> or <italic>∆csd7</italic> strain), CcmA localizes to regions of negative Gaussian curvature instead of the major helical axis. The finding that in a <italic>∆csd5/∆csd7</italic> double mutant the CcmA-HaloTag localization resembles a <italic>∆csd5</italic> mutant indicates that Csd5, not Csd7, is the primary driver of CcmA localization in WT cells.</p><p>Given the requirement for Csd5 to localize CcmA to the cell envelope, we wondered what would happen in a <italic>∆csd5ccmA∆NT</italic> strain. We could envisioned two possibilities. (1) Without Csd5, CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> would not be able to localize to the inner membrane and be close enough to interact with Csd7, thus CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> and Csd7 would not interact at high levels. In this case, Csd1 should be stable and the shape phenotype would resemble <italic>∆csd5</italic> cells (straight rod). (2) Even though Csd5 is not present to direct CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> to the inner membrane, interactions between CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> and Csd7 are strong enough to direct CcmA to the inner membrane, thus CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> and Csd7 would still interact at high levels. In this case, we would expect diminished Csd1 protein levels and a cell shape phenotype similar to a <italic>∆csd5Δcsd1</italic> (curved rod; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sycuro et al., 2012</xref>) and similar to <italic>∆csd5Δcsd7</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, the <italic>∆csd5ccmA∆NT</italic> strain has a curved rod phenotype and low levels of Csd1 supporting the second possibility, further reinforcing our hypothesis that Csd5 and Csd7 are part of separate protein complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Multiple proteins have been identified that are required to generate the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells, several of which form protein complexes. However, the function of many of the individual proteins and complexes was unknown. Here, we sought to understand the function of the bactofilin CcmA in generating the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells. We identified the function of each of the regions/domains of CcmA in patterning the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells and clarified how the cell-shape-determining protein complexes in <italic>H. pylori</italic> function. This work provides mechanistic insight into how CcmA, and potentially other bactofilins, regulates cell shape and morphogenesis of bacteria.</p><p>In <italic>H. pylori</italic>, when the cytoplasmic bactofilin CcmA is lost, cells lose their helical shape and the PG muropeptide composition is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>). The PG sacculus is what ultimately controls the shape of bacterial cells, and it has been hypothesized that modification of PG cross-linking generates curvature and twist of the sacculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>), but how loss of the cytoplasmic bactofilin CcmA could change the PG sacculus (in the periplasm) was unknown. Previously, we showed that CcmA and Csd7 (which is required for Csd1 protein stability) interact weakly and that <italic>∆ccmA, ∆csd1</italic>, <italic>∆csd2</italic>, and <italic>∆csd7</italic> mutants all share the same curved rod cell shape phenotype and PG muropeptide composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that CcmA may indirectly regulate Csd1 activity and thus the PG cell wall, but a mechanism linking CcmA and Csd1 was unknown. In past work, we also identified that CcmA interacts with the transmembrane protein Csd5, which binds directly to PG, providing another potential link between CcmA and the PG sacculus. Additionally, we discovered that CcmA localizes to the major helical axis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells where rates of PG synthesis are also increased, suggesting that CcmA regulates PG synthesis in some fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we built upon our previous body of work and identified several new mechanisms that clarify how CcmA regulates the helical cell shape, and thus the PG sacculus, of <italic>H. pylori</italic> by modulating interactions with Csd5 and Csd7.</p><p>We began this study by identifying how the bactofilin domain and short terminal regions of CcmA contributed to CcmA’s ability to pattern helical cell shape in <italic>H. pylori</italic>. First, we identified that the N-terminal region of CcmA and the bactofilin domain are required for helical cell shape, but that the C-terminal region was not required. Next, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we found that the bactofilin domain of CcmA interacts with Csd5 and Csd7 and the N-terminal region inhibits the bactofilin domain from interacting with Csd7. When the N-terminal region of CcmA is removed, the bactofilin domain of CcmA binds to Csd7, which prevents Csd7 from stabilizing Csd1, causing Csd1 depletion. This provides the first potential mechanism by which CcmA regulates the PG hydrolase Csd1. Interestingly, when we modeled CcmA, in 4/5 models the N-terminal region of CcmA binds to the bactofilin domain of CcmA, potentially blocking one of the surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is possible that by binding to the bactofilin domain the N-terminal region prevents interactions between the bactofilin domain of CcmA and Csd7. Future experiments will be needed to further clarify this mechanism.</p><p>We found that when other cell-shape-determining genes are deleted, CcmA can no longer localize to the major helical axis of the cell (Gaussian curvature value of 5 ± 1 µm<sup>–2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that CcmA is directed to its preferred location by a binding partner and is not capable of localizing to or sensing cell envelope curvature on its own. Loss of Csd5 causes substantially less CcmA to localize to the cell envelope, instead CcmA accumulates in the center of cells. The CcmA signal that does colocalize with the cell envelope in <italic>∆csd5</italic> and <italic>∆csd5/7</italic> cells is enriched near zero Gaussian curvature, which is the most common sidewall curvature value in these cells, and is depleted at all other Gaussian curvature values. When <italic>csd6</italic> or <italic>csd7</italic> are deleted, CcmA localizes to regions of negative Gaussian curvature. These data suggest that Csd5 recruits CcmA to the cell envelope. If helical cell shape is disrupted (due to loss of another cell shape protein) while Csd5 is still present, Csd5 directs CcmA to regions of negative Gaussian curvature. Additionally, the finding that CcmA localization phenotypes are the same in a <italic>∆csd5</italic> mutant and a <italic>∆csd5/7</italic> double mutant suggest that Csd5, not Csd7, controls CcmA localization. These results also support the hypothesis that there are two helical-cell-shape-generating protein complexes, one containing Csd5 and one containing Csd7.</p><p>Using what we have learned in this study, we can build a new model of the protein complexes that pattern the helical shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In one protein complex, CcmA’s bactofilin domain interacts with the cytoplasmic N-terminal region of the transmembrane protein Csd5 directing CcmA to the cell envelope. Csd5 brings MurF and PG precursors to the same region of the cell envelope for new PG to be inserted into the cell wall. CcmA’s N-terminal region inhibits interaction of CcmA’s bactofilin domain, which allows Csd7 to stabilize Csd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). When the N-terminus of CcmA is removed, interactions between Csd7 and CcmA are stabilized and Csd1 is no longer detected in the Csd7 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Prior work had shown that Csd1 protein cannot be detected in a <italic>∆csd7</italic> mutant, suggesting that Csd7 binding to Csd1 stabilizes this PG hydrolase. Steady-state levels of Csd1 are depleted in the <italic>ccmA ΔNT</italic> mutant, suggesting that Csd7 cannot simultaneously interact with Csd1 and CcmA. This finding explains why the <italic>ccmA ∆NT</italic> cells are curved rods, like a <italic>∆csd1</italic> or <italic>∆csd7</italic> cell; loss of the N-terminus of CcmA results in lower levels of Csd1, generating curved-rod-shaped cells. Thus, CcmA regulates Csd1 activity (cleaving tetra-pentapeptide crosslinks) spatially or temporally in relation to Csd5 and MurF to organize PG modification and insertion. In WT cells, spatial regulation of Csd1 protein levels by CcmA may act as a mechanism to prevent a futile cycle of PG insertion and hydrolysis and thus allow the increased synthesis at the major helical axis necessary to produce a helical cell. Our work raises the question of how Csd5 localizes to the major helical axis; Csd5 may sense curvature. Alternatively, the C-terminal SH3 domain of Csd5 can bind to PG directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2018</xref>) and may sense a particular curvature or structure of the cell wall.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic depicting CcmA’s role in the helical cell shape complexes.</title><p>There are two protein complexes, one containing Csd5, MurF, and CcmA, and another containing Csd7, Csd1, and Csd2. (<bold>A</bold>) In WT cells, Csd5 recruits WT CcmA to the cell envelope via CcmA’s bactofilin domain.

Modeling combined with CD data show that the bactofilin domain is a β-helix and the two short terminal regions are largely unstructured. Deletion of the terminal regions of CcmA does not impact the ability of the bactofilin domain to fold. Additionally, we identified that two previously studied CcmA point mutants that cause loss of function are unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The I55 and L110 residues are homologous to residues mutated by Vasa and colleagues in BacA (V75 and F130 in BacA) and are predicted to reside in the interior of the hydrophobic core of the proteins and mutating these residues destabilizes the proteins likely through the hydrophobic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>). We also identified that the bactofilin domain is capable of polymerizing on its own, the N-terminal region promotes lateral interactions between filaments, and the N- and C-terminal regions are both necessary for lattice formation. These data correlate with what has been previously reported in the literature; in the bactofilin Ttbac from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> loss of the N-terminal region (residues 1–10 in Ttbac) generated smaller, more ordered bundles of filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), and it has been previously reported that purified <italic>∆CT</italic> CcmA from <italic>H. pylori</italic> does not form lattice structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holtrup et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, in the case of CcmA <italic>∆NT</italic> and BD, both purified proteins readily polymerize in vitro, yet are unable to pattern the helical cell shape of <italic>H. pylori</italic> when expressed in vivo, suggesting that CcmA has other functions besides being a purely structural element. For CcmA to function properly in the <italic>H. pylori</italic> cell-shape-determining protein complexes, it must polymerize, interact with Csd5, and inhibit interaction with Csd7. However, it is unclear what state CcmA is in when it interacts with Csd5 and inhibits interaction with Csd7; whether CcmA is polymerized or monomeric when it is in complex is unknown and will require further investigation .</p><p>In this study, we identified several putative functional motifs within CcmA. The N-terminal region (amino acids 1–17) is important for patterning helical cell shape and regulates interactions with Csd7, suggesting that the N-terminal region is a functional motif. Our data also suggest that amino acids 13–17 in the N-terminal region of CcmA promote lateral interactions between filaments in vitro and may be another functional motif. However, in CcmA, the putative membrane-binding motif (amino acids 3–12) suggested by Deng and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) did not show a clear function in any of the experiments we conducted. In <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the putative membrane-binding motif of CcmA likely does not direct the protein to the inner membrane. Instead, interaction with Csd5 is required for CcmA to localize to the inner membrane. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of CcmA is not required for cell shape or interactions with Csd5 or Csd7 interactions, but it does have a role in regulating polymerization properties of purified CcmA.</p><p>Bactofilins are commonly found as part of complexes in other bacteria and help spatially organize cells to regulate where certain functions occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sichel and Salama, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Surovtsev and Jacobs-Wagner, 2018</xref>). Our findings regarding how CcmA functions within a complex in <italic>H. pylori</italic> provide insight into how bactofilins operate within complexes in other bacterial species. Mechanisms similar to how CcmA functions in <italic>H. pylori</italic> have been reported in other systems; in <italic>A. biprostecum,</italic> a PG hydrolase, SpmX, directs the bactofilin BacA to the site of stalk synthesis, then BacA organizes the rest of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>) to control stalk morphogenesis. Here, we identified that CcmA is not capable of localizing to the cell envelope without Csd5. While Csd5 is unique to the <italic>Helicobacter</italic> genus, transmembrane proteins in other species may also be essential for localization of bactofilins. Interestingly, the genomic arrangement of <italic>csd1</italic> (an M23 metallopeptidase) and <italic>CcmA</italic> overlapping is conserved in several other curved and helical species of Campylobacterota and Pseudomonadota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caccamo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>), and has been reported in a spirochete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackson et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that bactofilins may regulate M23 metallopeptidases to promote PG remodeling at specific regions of the cell envelope to control cell shape and morphogenesis of other morphological features.

The width of bundles and filaments was measured using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments</title><p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2019</xref> with slight modifications. <italic>H. pylori</italic> expressing FLAG tags fused to either Csd5 or Csd7 were grown to mid-log phase in liquid culture and 15 OD<sub>600</sub> were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 min at 4°C. Cells pellets were resuspended in 1.8 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor [Pierce]). The cells were sonicated at 10% power for 10 s intervals with a microtip (Sonic Dismembrator Model 500, Branson) until visibly cleared, then centrifuged at 20,000 RCF for 30 min at 4°C. The soluble fraction was then incubated with 40 µl beads (ɑ-FLAG M2 agarose beads [Sigma]) or ɑ-VSV-G agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated in wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 2% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 90 min at 4°C. The beads were then washed four times in 10 ml cold wash buffer, and samples were centrifuged at 2000 RPM for 2 min between washes. Beads were then boiled in 45 µl 2× sample buffer without BME for 10 min and subjected to Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Labeling with fluorescent WGA and HaloTag ligands</title><p><italic>H. pylori</italic> expressing CcmA-HaloTag were grown to mid-log phase and fixed with 4% PFA for 45 min at room temperature. After fixing, bacteria were permeabilized for 1 hr at room temperature with PBS + 0.05% Triton X-100. Bacteria were then resuspended in PBS and centrifuged onto #1.5 coverslips. Next, coverslips were incubated on a droplet of PBS containing 30 µg/ml af488-conjugated WGA (Invitrogen) and 4 µM JF-549 (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed four times (10 min each) by placing on fresh droplets of PBS + 0.1% Tween-20, then mounted on glass slides with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>3D structured illumination microscopy</title><p>3D SIM was performed on a DeltaVision OMX SR equipped with PCO scientific CMOS cameras, 488 nm and 568 nm lasers, and an Olympus ×60/1.42 U PLAN APO oil objective with oil matched for the sample refractive index. The DeltaVision OMX SR has a resolution of approximately 100 nm in the X and Y directions and 300 nm in Z. 512 × 512 pixel Z-stack images were acquired with 125 nm spacing and 3 µm total thickness. Figures were generated by changing channel colors, adjusting brightness and contrast in Fiji, and brightness and contrast settings were maintained across the entire image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Figures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>3D reconstructions and curvature enrichment analysis</title><p>3D reconstructions were generated, and curvature CcmA enrichment analysis was performed exactly as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor et al., 2020</xref> using existing software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bratton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bratton et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, 3D SIM Z-stack images were used to generate a 3D triangular meshwork surface with roughly 30 nm precision from the WGA channel. After generating the 3D triangular meshwork, the Gaussian curvature was calculated at every location on the surface of the cell, and we performed curvature enrichment analysis to identify which GC values CcmA signal was associated with where uniform signal = 1. Because the absolute amount of CcmA signal can differ between cells and because the illumination throughout the field is nonuniform, we set the average CcmA signal on each cell as 1. Then we measured each cell’s curvature-dependent CcmA signal intensity relative to 1, normalized by the amount of the curvature present on that individual cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Analysis of intensity of CcmA-HaloTag signal at cell surface and within cells</title><p>A custom MATLAB script was used to compute the relative intensity of CcmA-HaloTag signal at the cell surface and at surfaces generated by shrinking the surface of interest toward the centerline of the cell (negative offsets) or increasing the surface away from the centerline (positive offsets). For each of these shells, or surface offsets, we calculated the average WGA signal and the average CcmA-HaloTag signal. To account for errors in spatial alignment between the two color channels, before calculating the intensity at each shell, we performed a rigid body alignment procedure to maximize the intensity of the signal contained within the nominal reconstructed surface (0 nm offset). Consistent with the fact that we utilized the WGA channel for shape reconstructions, this alignment algorithm returned offsets of less than one pixel (one pixel = 80 nm) for the WGA channel. The CcmA-HaloTag channel showed more variability in the offsets, sometimes requiring an offset of almost 200 nm along the focal direction, consistent with small, wavelength-dependent variations in focal position. After calculating the average intensity at each subshell, or resized surface, we normalized the highest concentration to 1 before averaging across all the cells in our sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80111-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file; Source Data files have been provided for Figures 2, 5, 6 and 7.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexandre W Bisson Filho (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript investigators key factors that influence cell shape in a helical organism, Helicobacter pylori, with a specific focus on peptidoglycan and the role of bactofilin proteins as modulators of peptidoglycan synthesis and degradation. Reviewers identified a few key experiments that would strengthen the experimental underpinnings of the conclusions and ways to align the manuscript text with the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers felt that the study addresses an important set of issues including the mechanisms governing cell shape in a helical organism, the factors modulating the balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and degradation, and the role of a bactofilin family member in both processes. At the same time, reviewers expressed concern that the experiments did not fully substantiate the conclusions and that the text is in need of significant revision. In particular:</p><p>1) The authors' model indicates that CcmA is a linchpin regulating the activity of Csd5 and Csd7. However, none of the experiments address the possibility that Csd5 and Csd7 might interact on their own with CcmA serving as an inhibitory factor. All assays were conducted in a CcmA+ strain and/or with CcmA in the reaction. It thus remains possible that Csd5 and Csd7 interact directly in the absence of CcmA, in which case CcmA would have a purely inhibitory role. The authors also overlook the observation that a CcmA N-terminal truncation mutant shares the cell shape characteristics of a camp deletion mutant (curved rod; Yang 2019) rather than that of a csd5 deletion mutant (straight rod). How the current CcmA as a linchpin model fits into this observation is unclear. See the response from Reviewer 2 for experimental suggestions to address this set of concerns.</p><p>2) More broadly, as written the manuscript is difficult to follow for the non-expert and some of the more striking results could be highlighted more effectively. For example, the finding that CcmA domains not involved in polymerization play an important role in mediating cell shape is new and has potential implications for the function of other bactofilins. This is an exciting result, and the text should be revised to clarify it as such with revisions to the introduction and conclusion. Additionally, revising the text to ensure that the relevant question/hypothesis is stated up front and delineating how each experiment fits into the big picture in the Results section would be very helpful for readers unfamiliar with previous work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In its current form, the paper comes across as focused primarily on characterization rather than hypothesis testing which makes it difficult for those outside the immediate field to appreciate. Clearly stating the question/hypothesis up front and delineating how each experiment fits into the big picture in the Results section would be very helpful for readers unfamiliar with previous work (e.g. Based on the presence of the bactofilin domain, we speculated that CcmA interacted with other members of the complex to coordinate peptidoglycan synthesis and remodeling. To test this we first…). Revising the paper with this in mind would improve both readability and impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really like the paper and I think there should not be much work to be done to get it ready for publication.</p><p>From my point of view, the major contribution of this paper is the suggestion that the extreme Nt segment inhibits recruitment of Csd7, favoring the Csd1-Csd7 interaction, and therefore stabilizing Csd1. This implies that the free bactofilin BD is prone to sequester Csd7 from Csd1. There are 2 experiments that could solidify this view:</p><p>Is the independent expression of the first 17aa of CcmA under the ΔNt-ccmA background sufficient to block the binding of Csd7 to CcmA-BD and rescue the Csd1-Csd7 interaction (and therefore Csd1 levels) and WT shape phenotype? Does the 17aa peptide pulldown with CcmA?</p><p>If Csd1 is really stabilized by the interaction with Csd7, then a Csd1-Csd7 translational fusion should protect Csd1 even under the ΔNt-ccmA background.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors need to directly address whether their co-IP experiments are the result of direct interactions between their FLAG-tagged proteins and CcmA, or whether the presence of CcmA is incidental and results from the pulldown of a larger complex containing all three proteins. Specifically, they should establish whether the interactions they are observing are actually between i) CcmA and Csd5/7 or ii) Csd5 and Csd7. The exclusion of direct Csd5-Csd7 interaction in the absence of CcmA is essential for the model they propose (Figure 8), and could be achieved via several different approaches:</p><p>– They could utilize a BATCH approach to demonstrate direct interactions between CcmA and 1) Csd5 and 2) Csd7 as well as the absence of direct interactions between Csd5-Csd7.</p><p>– They could conduct a co-IP for FLAG-tagged Csd5 and a HIS-tagged Csd7 to demonstrate whether these proteins co-precipitate in 1) wild-type H. pylori and 2) a ccmA deletion strain.</p><p>– They could conduct their ccmA localization study utilizing N-terminal truncation variants of ccmA (wild type and Halo-tagged) and observe whether they still observe no membrane localization in their csd5-deletion background.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80111.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers felt that the study addresses an important set of issues including the mechanisms governing cell shape in a helical organism, the factors modulating the balance between peptidoglycan synthesis and degradation, and the role of a bactofilin family member in both processes.

It turns out that Kris Blair, the graduate student who initially characterized the Csd5 complex using mass spectrometry (Blair <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018), did include in his now published thesis (Blair, 2018) an IP-mass spectrometry experiment pulling down Csd5-FLAG in a <italic>∆ccmA</italic> strain. He did not detect Csd7. However, Csd7 is a multipass transmembrane protein, and thus may not be detected well by mass spectrometry (Yang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). We thus probed our previous and a new Csd7-FLAG pull down experiment using the <italic>∆ccmA</italic> and <italic>∆NT ccmA</italic> strains with our polyclonal Csd5 antibody. We do not detect an interaction between Csd5 and Csd7 (Figure 5C). This further reinforces our conclusion that CcmA participates in two distinct complexes, one with Csd5 that directs CcmA to the cell envelope and a transient complex with Csd7 that in wild-type cells can only be detected by crosslinking and which is enhanced when the N-terminal region is removed from CcmA.</p><p>We realize that these results make one aspect of the model presented in the original Figure 8B likely incorrect. In that model we showed Csd7 being recruited by CcmA to the Csd5-MurF-CcmA complex. Our data instead supports a model where Csd7 can interact with Csd1 and Csd2 or it can interact with CcmA in a complex that does not include Csd5. Our immunoprecipitation experiment in <italic>H. pylori</italic> cells indicates that the two CcmA complexes are mutually exclusive. In further support of this model, we followed Reviewer’s 3 suggestion to examine the phenotype of a <italic>∆csd5ccmA∆NT</italic> strain, which displays curved rod morphology (Figure 7 supplement 2A,B) similar to a <italic>∆csd5∆csd1</italic> mutant (curved rod (Sycuro <italic>et al.,</italic> 2012)) and similar to <italic>∆csd5∆csd7</italic> (Figure 7). Though Csd5 is not present to direct CcmA ∆NT to the inner membrane CcmA ∆NT and Csd7 still interact at high levels causing diminished Csd1 protein levels (Figure 7 Supplement 2C) and a curved rod phenotype. To accommodate this new knowledge, we have added the reference to Kris’ thesis, added the Csd5 antibody detection and <italic>∆ccmA</italic> strain the IP experiment in Figure 5C, modified the model presented in Figure 8B, added the phenotype of the <italic>∆csd5ccmA∆NT</italic> strain as a new supplement to Figure 7 (Figure 7 Supplement 2) and addressed these data and the refined model with new text in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More broadly, as written the manuscript is difficult to follow for the non-expert and some of the more striking results could be highlighted more effectively.

The curved rod shape phenotype of the <italic>ccmA ∆NT</italic> strain was not rescued when we attempted to express the N-terminus in trans. However, we were unable to validate whether the first 17 amino acids were expressed in this strain by Western blotting. To fully address this suggestion, much more optimization is needed. It is likely that we would need to use a large protein tag fused to the N-terminus to stabilize this small peptide and resolve whether it is functional in trans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If Csd1 is really stabilized by the interaction with Csd7, then a Csd1-Csd7 translational fusion should protect Csd1 even under the ΔNt-ccmA background.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is an interesting idea, we do not know the topology of Csd7 and need Csd1 in the periplasm to be functional.

To accommodate this new knowledge, we have added the reference to Kris’ thesis, added the Csd5 antibody detection and <italic>∆ccmA</italic> strain the IP experiment in Figure 5C, modified the model presented in Figure 8B, added the phenotype of the <italic>∆csd5ccmA∆NT</italic> strain as a new supplement to Figure 7 (Figure 7 supplement 2) and addressed these data and the refined model with new text in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 61-64:</p><p>A minor point, but the probe used in this study (a modified D-alanine) is thought to incorporate peptidoglycan by D,D- and L,D- transpeptidases. As such, its incorporation is a readout of these processes, rather than 'increased levels of PG synthesis'. In order to more accurately measure new PG synthesis activity, D-ala dipeptide probes would be more accurate, as they are thought to be incorporated during the cytoplasmic stages of PG biosynthesis, specifically by the MurF enzyme (Liechti 2014,2016 and Kuru 2019). - Given this and the fact that MurF appears to be incorporated into the 'helical-cellshape-promoting protein complex' previously defined by the authors, it is curious that the authors did not make use of the dipeptide probes in this (and previous) studies.</p></disp-quote><p>In the study the reviewer is referring to (Taylor et al, 2020) both MurNAc-alk and D-Ala-alk were used to visualize new PG incorporation and both probes gave similar results. Similar to D-ala dipeptides probes, we showed that MurNAc-alk is incorporated into the PG sacculus exclusively during de novo PG synthesis. We agree that future studies that examine PG incorporation patterns in various mutational backgrounds would be useful to further dissect the mechanisms of helical cell shape generation in <italic>H. pylori.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 2:</p><p>The fact that side curvature is enhanced in the truncation mutant that lacks the authors' defined 'membrane spanning region' of CcmA should be discussed further. A localization study would also seem prudent (particularly as the authors have demonstrated the techniques required later in the manuscript) demonstrating that MM is necessary and sufficient for membrane association (GFP-fusion study) while amino acids 13-17 are not; alternatively, the absence of membrane association would effectively demonstrate that the N-terminal domain is not involved in membrane association.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 7, we showed that Csd5 is required for CcmA to localize to the inner membrane.

It turns out that Kris Blair, the graduate student who initially characterized the Csd5 complex using mass spectrometry (Blair et al., 2018), did include in his now published thesis (Blair, 2018) an IP-mass spectrometry experiment pulling down Csd5-FLAG in a ΔccmA strain. He did not detect Csd7. However, Csd7 is a multipass transmembrane protein, and thus may not be detected well by mass spectrometry (Yang et al., 2019). We thus probed our previous and a new Csd7-FLAG pull down experiment using the ΔccmA and ΔNT ccmA strains with our polyclonal Csd5 antibody. We do not detect an interaction between Csd5 and Csd7 (Figure 5C). This further reinforces our conclusion that CcmA participates in two distinct complexes, one with Csd5 that directs CcmA to the cell envelope and a transient complex with Csd7 that in wild-type cells can only be detected by crosslinking and which is enhanced when the N-terminal region is removed from CcmA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 7; Lines 352-354:</p><p>A major caveat to this experimentation is that functional studies will be of chimeric filaments likely composed of both wild-type and Halo-tagged CcmA.

However, we believe that CcmA-HaloTag can polymerize because cells expressing a single copy of CcmA-HaloTag (without WT CcmA co-expressed) are still helical and more have more curvature than ∆ccmA cells, which indicates that CcmA-HaloTag is functional (Figure 7 – supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is notable that no analysis was conducted on the number or average length/size of the puncta and filaments formed and whether they differ significantly between mutant strains</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, at present we do not know the relationship between the filaments, bundles and lattices observed by TEM and the puncta visualized by 3D SIM.

Although we do see that purified CcmA forms lattices in vitro, our experimental evidence suggests that lattice formation is not essential for CcmA’s function in vivo. For example, in Figure 4 we showed that purified CcmA ∆CT does not form lattices in vitro, but Figure 2 shows that H. pylori cells that express ccmA ∆CT are still helical. Together these results suggest that lattice formation in vitro is not required for CcmA to pattern helical cell shape in vivo. Given these results we do not feel comfortable including lattice formation in our current model of CcmA function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Panel C, what do the authors predict would occur if their NT truncated ccmA is present in the csd5 mutant background? The answer to this hypothetical (demonstrated experimentally) would provide strong proof of concept for the entire model.</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that there could be two possibilities of how CcmA ∆NT would function in a ∆csd5ccmA∆NT strain. (1) Without Csd5, CcmA ∆NT would not be able to localize to the inner membrane and be close enough to interact with Csd7, thus CcmA ∆NT and Csd7 would not interact at high levels. In this case Csd1 should be stable and the shape phenotype would resemble ∆csd5 (straight rod) (2) Even though Csd5 is not present to direct CcmA ∆NT to the inner membrane, interactions between CcmA ∆NT and Csd7 are strong enough to direct CcmA to the inner membrane, thus CcmA ∆NT and Csd7 would still interact at high levels. In this case we would expect diminished Csd1 protein levels and a phenotype similar to a ∆csd5Δcsd1 (curved rod (Sycuro et al, 2012)) and similar to ∆csd5Δcsd7 shown in Figure 7. We have now constructed a ∆csd5ccmA∆NT strain and find it has a curved rod phenotype and lower levels of Csd1 supporting the second possibility, further reinforcing our revised model of separate Csd5 and Csd7 complexes. This new data has been added as Figure 7 Supplement 2 and reinforces our revision to the model presented in Figure 8B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 863-870:</p><p>It would be helpful for the reader to note the resolution limits of the instrument in the x, y, and Z planes (in each imaging channel).</p></disp-quote><p>Resolution is approximately 100 nm in the X and Y directions and 300 nm in Z.
