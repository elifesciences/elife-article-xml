Deep-water animals accumulate TMAO to protect proteins, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), against hydrostatic pressure stress (HPS). We hypothesized that TMAO exerts beneficial effects on the circulatory system and protects cardiac LDH exposed to HPS produced by the contracting heart. Male, Sprague-Dawley and Spontaneously-Hypertensive-Heart-Failure (SHHF) rats were treated orally with either water (control) or TMAO. In vitro, LDH with or without TMAO was exposed to HPS and was evaluated using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. TMAO-treated rats showed higher diuresis and natriuresis, lower arterial pressure and plasma NT-proBNP. Survival in SHHF-control was 66% vs 100% in SHHF-TMAO. In vitro, exposure of LDH to HPS with or without TMAO did not affect protein structure. In conclusion, TMAO reduced mortality in SHHF, which was associated with diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive effects. HPS and TMAO did not affect LDH protein structure.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Heart failure is a common cause of death in industrialized countries with aging populations. Japan, however, has lower rates of heart failure and fewer deaths linked to this disease than the United States or Europe, despite having the highest proportion of elderly people in the world. Dietary differences between these regions may explain the lower rate of heart failure in Japan. The Japanese diet is rich in seafood, which contains nutrients that promote heart health, such as omega-3 fatty acids.</p><p>Seafood also contains other compounds, including trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). Fish that live in deep waters undergo high pressures, which can damage their proteins, but TMAO seems to protect the proteins from harm. In humans, eating seafood increases TMAO levels in the blood and urine, but it is unclear what effects this has on heart health. Increased levels of TMAO in the blood are associated with cardiovascular diseases, but scientists are not sure whether TMAO itself harms the heart. A toxic byproduct of gut bacteria called TMA is converted in TMAO in the body, so it is possible that TMA rather than TMAO is to blame.</p><p>To assess the effects of dietary TMAO on heart failure, Gawrys-Kopczynska et al. fed the compound to healthy rats and rats with heart failure for one year. TMAO had no effects on the healthy rats. Of the rats with heart failure that were fed TMAO, all of them survived the year, while one third of rats with heart failure that were not fed TMAO died. TMAO-treated rats with heart failure had lower blood pressure and urinated more than untreated rats with the condition.</p><p>The experiments suggest that dietary TMAO may mimic the effects of heart failure treatments, which remove excess water and salt and lower pressure on the heart. More studies are needed to confirm whether TMAO has this same effect on humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart failure</kwd><kwd>trimethylamine N-oxide</kwd><kwd>seafood</kwd><kwd>gut bacteria</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018/31/B/NZ5/00038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ufnal</surname><given-names>Marcin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Trimethylamine-oxide (TMAO), a molecule present in seafood, reduces mortality and exerts beneficial effects on the circulatory system in heart failure rats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some clinical studies have shown that increased levels of trimethylamine-oxide (TMAO) in the plasma are associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trøseid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). However, other studies have not confirmed this relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stubbs et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, basic research data regarding the effect of TMAO on the circulatory system are contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldana-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Organ et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Savi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the plasma, TMAO originates from the liver oxidation of trimethylamine (TMA), a product of gut bacteria metabolism of l-carnitine and choline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zeisel and Warrier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ufnal et al., 2015</xref>). However, another direct source of TMAO in humans is TMAO-rich seafood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yancey and Siebenaller, 2015</xref>). Therefore, populations whose diet are rich in seafood, such as the Japanese, have higher urine TMAO concentrations than those that do not, for example, Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dumas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Holmes et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, prevalence and mortality rates of heart failure (HF) are lower in Japan compared to the US or Europe, despite the fact that Japan has the highest proportion of elderly people in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nagai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ogawa et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Marine animals living in deep water, and thus exposed to hydrostatic pressure stress (HPS), accumulate TMAO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yancey and Siebenaller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yancey and Siebenaller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sarma and Paul, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). Data from biophysical experiments suggest a protective effect of TMAO on cell proteins exposed to HPS. For example, TMAO has been found to stabilize teleost and mammalian lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a complex tetramer protein that plays an essential role in cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yancey and Siebenaller, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Notably, in a heart exposed to catecholamine-induced stress or in a hypertensive heart, diastolic-systolic changes in pressure may exceed 220 mmHg. These fluctuations in pressure can happen in humans up to 200 times per minute. These numbers are even higher in small animals. These events may produce an environment in which the hydrostatic pressure changes approximately 100 000 times in 24 hr. However, the effect of HPS produced by the contracting heart on cardiac proteins is obscure.</p><p>Recently, we hypothesized that TMAO may benefit the circulatory system by protecting cardiac LDH exposed to HPS produced by diastole-systole-driven changes in the hydrostatic pressure of the contracting heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ufnal and Nowiński, 2019</xref>). Here, we investigated whether a continuous, 12-months-long oral administration of TMAO in healthy Sprague-Dawley rats (SD), in SD exposed to catecholamine stress, and in animal model of heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (SHHF) exerts beneficial effects on the circulatory system. Furthermore, we evaluated whether TMAO protects the protein structure of cardiac LDH exposed to HPS. To examine the effects of HPS in the context that mimics the environment produced by the contracting heart, we developed a novel experimental system using microfluidics chambers with piezoelectric valves and pressure controllers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Spontaneously Hypertensive Heart Failure (SHHF) and age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to either the control group (rats drinking tap water) or the TMAO group (rats drinking TMAO solution in tap water).

The addition of 1M TMAO produced a moderate stabilizing effect on LDH, shifting the threshold of observed protein morphology change towards higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Specifically, it seems that the gradual dissociation of tetramers to monomers occurred above 55°C, which was followed by the denaturation of the tertiary protein structure at higher temperatures. At a concentration of LDH &gt;3 nM, the aggregation of monomers prevailed. At a lower concentration, the aggregation progressed more slowly, if at all, while any aggregates that did form, were too sparse to influence the measurement results. Further work, including probing a broader matrix of LDH concentrations and temperatures, is needed to confirm these initial findings. Nevertheless, in all the experiments, presence of TMAO shifted the threshold of change in LDH morphology towards higher temperatures and diminished the magnitude of the change. This suggests a stabilizing effect of TMAO on the native structure of the protein.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study provides evidence that TMAO exerts a beneficial effect in heart failure rats. The beneficial effect of TMAO is associated with diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive actions rather than a stabilizing effect on cardiac LDH. Specifically, we found that HPS at the magnitude substantially greater than that generated by a contracting heart did not affect cardiac LDH protein structure with or without TMAO.</p><p>Plasma TMAO originates from trimethylamine (TMA), a product of gut bacteria, which is oxidized by the liver to form TMAO. It can also be obtained from dietary TMAO-rich seafood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zeisel and Warrier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ufnal et al., 2015</xref>). Several years ago, Tang and collaborators showed that increased plasma TMAO is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tang et al., 2013</xref>), which generated numerous clinical and experimental studies, suggesting negative effects of TMAO (for review, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zeisel and Warrier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Onyszkiewicz et al., 2020</xref>]). However, other clinical studies did not find an association between high plasma TMAO and increased cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stubbs et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our previous studies suggest that TMAO is only a surrogate marker and that the toxic cardiovascular effects are caused not by TMAO itself, but by a TMAO precursor, that is TMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jaworska et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jaworska et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jaworska et al., 2019c</xref>). Notably, the latter is a well-established toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pospischil et al., 2017</xref>). Since TMA is oxidized (likely, detoxified) by the liver to TMAO, the increased plasma TMAO is simply a proxy to the plasma levels of the toxic TMA. What is more, recent experimental studies provide evidence for a beneficial action of TMAO at low doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldana-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collins et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the effect of TMAO in (i) healthy SD rats, (ii) SHHF (SHHF/MccGmiCrl-<italic>Lepr<sup>cp</sup></italic>/Crl) which showed characteristics of heart failure with compromised systolic function and (iii) SD subjected to catecholamine stress (isoprenaline).</p><p>Our findings show that increased dietary TMAO, which elevates plasma TMAO level 3–5-fold, increased diuresis and natriuresis in SD and SHHF rats. This is associated with reduced mortality and favorable hemodynamic and biochemical changes in HF rats.</p><p>In this study, during a stress-free 52 week observation, the fatality rate of the SHHF animals treated with TMAO was 0% in comparison to 33% in the untreated group. This was associated with several beneficial hemodynamic and biochemical characteristics in the TMAO-treated SHHF rats, namely; a lower diastolic BP, higher diuresis and natriuresis, a lower expression of AT1R in the heart with concomitant increase in AT2R, and a trend towards lower cardiac fibrosis. Regarding the latter, the tissue angiotensin system contributes significantly to remodeling of the heart, and its inhibition is critical in the treatment of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some of the characteristic features of HF are inflammation and increased sympathetic activity. In this regard, the SHHF-TMAO group had a significantly increased plasma level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and a trend towards lower plasma TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory mediator. Significantly lower diastolic blood pressure together with mildly lower heart rate may also suggest lower sympathetic activity in the SHHF-TMAO group. However, to fully address this issue further studies evaluating concentration of catecholamines metabolites in urine are needed. It is worth stressing that due to the high mortality in the SHHF-control group, the final analysis of hemodynamic and biochemical parameters included only the survivors that is the healthiest rats. It is interesting to speculate, had all the SHHF-control rats survived to the experimental endpoints, whether the differences between the SHHF-TMAO and SHHF-control would have been even greater.</p><p>Finally, a key characteristic of HF is fluid retention. We think that the beneficial effects of TMAO described above were secondary to the TMAO-produced increase in diuresis and natriuresis, which is a cornerstones of HF treatment.</p><p>We assumed that the diuretic and natriuretic effects of TMAO resulted from osmotic diuresis. To evaluate the notion, we performed additional acute experiments in rats. We found that intravenous administration of TMAO, but not saline given at the same volume, significantly increased diuresis in anesthetized rats. Furthermore, in chronic studies, TMAO-treated rats showed increased expression of renin in the kidneys. This is a characteristic response to osmotic diuresis, associated with a decreased concentration of sodium in filtrate reaching distal convoluted tubule. Increased diuresis in TMAO-treated rats was present despite elevated plasma levels of vasopressin which allows the reabsorption of water from the filtrate in collecting ducts. The reabsorption is driven by the osmotic pressure gradient between the filtrate and the kidney medulla. In TMAO-treated rats, the osmotic gradient was likely decreased due to the high osmotic activity of TMAO and high TMAO levels in the filtrate. This could decrease the reabsorption of water from the filtrate despite the vasopressin-induced increase in the permeability of collecting ducts to water.</p><p>To evaluate diuretic effect of TMAO, we compared TMAO to urea, which was used as a diuretic treatment of advanced HF before being replaced by thiazide diuretics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shanoff, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crawford, 1925</xref>). Notably, both molecules are nitrogenous compounds, have a similar molecular weight, and play the role of an osmolyte in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yancey and Siebenaller, 2015</xref>). In our experiments, TMAO produced significant diuresis whereas urea did not. This was likely due the fact that we evaluated the same (equimolar) doses of urea and TMAO, whereas physiological concentrations of TMAO in the plasma is radically lower (micromoles/L) in comparison to urea (millimoles/L). Therefore, our findings suggest that TMAO exerts a significantly more potent diuretic effect than urea.</p><p>A number of biological and biophysical studies indicate that TMAO is not only an osmolyte but also a piezolyte, that is stabilizes structural proteins and enzymes, such as LDH, in conditions of increased hydrostatic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yancey and Siebenaller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sarma and Paul, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the accumulation of TMAO in the bodies of deep-water animals may protect cell proteins from HPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yancey and Siebenaller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yancey and Siebenaller, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The effect of HPS produced by the contracting heart on cardiac proteins is unclear. Based on studies showing that TMAO stabilizes teleost and mammalian lactate dehydrogenases against inactivation by hydrostatic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yancey and Siebenaller, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ayoubi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yancey et al., 2001</xref>), we hypothesized that TMAO may exert a protective effect on the circulatory system by stabilizing the protein structure of cardiac LDH, a complex enzyme that plays essential role in cardiac metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ufnal and Nowiński, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate this hypothesis, we built a unique experimental setup to mimic the changes in hydrostatic pressure that occur in the heart under conditions of catecholamine stress. These in vitro experiments showed that changes in hydrostatic pressure generated by the contracting heart, and even much higher pressures, do not disturb the protein structure of cardiac LDH. Finally, the addition of TMAO did not produce any effect, suggesting neither positive nor negative effect of TMAO on LDH exposed to HPS. Nevertheless, we showed that TMAO stabilized LDH exposed to other denaturant, that is high temperature, which is in line with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schummel et al., 2018</xref>). In general, changes in protein structure lead to perturbed (or even the loss of) activity of proteins. However, further studies are needed to evaluate if LDH activity would be affected by HPS, TMAO and temperature in a similar manner as LDH protein structure.</p><p>Altogether, our study shows that TMAO exerts beneficial effects in cardiovascular pathologies associated with fluid retention such as HF. The beneficial effects of TMAO appear to stem from its diuretic action rather than from the protein-stabilizing effect of TMAO on LDH, which was described for deep-sea animals, but was found not be involved here. It may be that the hydrostatic pressure generated by a contracting heart is far lower than the deep‐sea pressures and is kinetic (pulsing and moving) rather than static. In this regard, there is evidence that static pressure may have very different effects on cells and proteins than kinetic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaarniranta et al., 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, the stabilizing effect of TMAO on other, less stable, cardiac proteins exposed to HPS cannot be excluded.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of our study is that biochemical and hemodynamic measurements were performed only at the end of the treatment.

These benefits might be derived from the diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive properties of TMAO. The hydrostatic pressure stress generated by the contracting heart does not affect LDH protein structure. Further studies designed to evaluate TMAO-dependent diuretic and natriuretic effects are needed, as TMAO may serve as a naturally occurring diuretic agent in diseases associated with fluid retention e.g. heart failure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Rattus norvegicus, male)</td><td>SHHF/MccGmiCrl-<italic>Lepr<sup>cp</sup></italic>/Crl</td><td>Charles River Laboratories (USA)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2313221">RGD_2313221</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NT-proBNP</td><td>FineTest</td><td>cat. no.

The two microvalves were controlled by a multiplexer switch module (National Instruments, USA) interfaced via custom-made LabView software which is freely available from the Github repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nalin, 2020</xref>). Due to their electro-magneto-mechanical construction the microvalves had some response time: the delay between application of the current and opening of the valve was 24 ms, and the delay between stopping the current and shutting the valve was 8 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Churski et al., 2010</xref>). The time shifts were taken into consideration when calculating the required oscillatory pressure.</p><p>Operation protocol: The two valves were initially closed and the pressure inside the sample chamber was equal to the atmospheric pressure. Upon initiating the oscillatory system, the first valve opened for 50 ms. As the first valve closed, the second valve opened for 50 ms followed by a 50 ms pause when both valves were closed. With the response times included, one full cycle took 214 ms, generating an oscillation of ~280/minute between pressure p1 and p2, mimicking the heartbeat of a rat. This pressure-oscillatory system was used in each relevant experiment with the only difference being the pressure applied: p1 and p2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Microfluidic heart chip</title><p>In the first set of experiments a microfluidic device was constructed in polydimethylsiloxane (PMDS; Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, USA) in three steps; first, the channels and sample chamber (in the shape of a heart) were micro-milled in a polycarbonate plate (PC; Macrolon, Germay) using a CNC milling machine (MSG4025, Ergwind, Poland); second, we poured PDMS onto the PC chip, polymerized the PDMS at 75°C for 2 hr, activated the surface using a Laboratory Corona Treater (BD 20AC, Electro-Technic Products, USA) and silanized in the vapors of tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-trichlorosilane (United Chemical Technologies, USA) for 60 min under vacuum (10mbar); third, this negative mold was used to produce the final PDMS chip. Inlet and outlet holes were punched using a small diameter (ID = 0.8 mm) biopsy puncher prior to bonding the PDMS chip to 1mm-thick glass slides using oxygen plasma for 45 s.</p><p>Operation parameters. The inlets were connected to the heart-shaped sample chamber (height of 300 µm and total volume of ~220 µL) via microchannels from two sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12a</xref>). On one side, the microchannel ended in a single inlet through which the sample liquid was injected. Once the chamber was completely filled, the inlet was sealed air-tight. On the other side of the chamber, the microchannel branched into two channels, ending in 1–1 inlets. The two ducts were connected to two pressure sources (p1 and p2) of the oscillatory system by Teflon tubes (ID = 0.8 mm, OD = 1.6 mm; Bola, Germany). The valves were initially closed, and the atmospheric pressure acted on the sample.</p><p>In the first run, we applied p1 = 250 mmHg overpressure and p2 = 0 mmHg (i.e. atmospheric pressure) and oscillation frequency of ~280/minute as described above.</p><p>The inlet channel (from the side of the oscillatory system) was filled with the sample liquid only half-way. As the pressure was oscillating in the microfluidic device, rapid movement of the liquid meniscus could be observed according to the oscillation frequency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12b–d</xref>). The overpressure p1 pushed the liquid meniscus towards the chamber, while upon switch to the low pressure (p2) the meniscus pulled back. Unfortunately, since the liquid was in direct contact with the oscillating air some evaporation occurred. As a consequence, the sample liquid evaporated from the chamber within approximately 40 min of starting the experiment, leaving the microfluidic chamber dry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>PDMS sample chamber in the shape of a micro centrifuge-tube</title><p>To avoid evaporation, we constructed a different microfluidic device, where the sample liquids were not in direct contact with the oscillating air. Briefly, we removed the caps of four 0.5 mL conical bottom micro centrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, Germany) and glued them to a microscope glass slide (75 × 24×1 mm) in a line separated by ~3 mm from each other. On two other, larger glass plates (75 × 50×1 mm), we glued small blocks of polycarbonate (45 × 15×5 mm) and fixed them on two opposing sides of the micro-centrifuge tube array, so that the distance between the polycarbonate blocks and the tubes from both sides was ~1 mm. We put this construction into a small box, filled it with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS elastomer, Sylgard 184 mixed with curing agent at a ratio of 10:1 and degassed) and polymerized the PDMS at 75°C for 2 hr. After that, we removed it from the container, removed the glass plates, the polycarbonate blocks and micro centrifuge tubes from the cured PDMS. Next, we bonded the PDMS block from the two sides, where the removed polycarbonate blocks left a cuboid-shaped cavity to glass plates (75 × 50×1 mm) using oxygen plasma. We also inserted steel capillaries (OD = 0.8 mm) from two sides of each cavity to which we connected the oscillatory system by Teflon tubes (Bola, Germany). Next, we constructed a 4 mm thick PDMS plate to cover the top of the chamber array, which was left open after the Eppendorf tubes were removed from the PDMS. Prior to bonding with oxygen plasma, holes were punched in the PDMS cover to allow for sample injection. Once the microdevice was ready (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13d</xref>), we injected the sample liquids through the punched inlet holes into the sample chambers and sealed the inlet holes air-tight. The sample liquids filled the chamber completely. In a separate experiment we left small air bubbles in the Eppendorf-chambers for pressure estimation (see below).</p><p>Operation parameters. After the chambers were filled the oscillatory system was turned on using pressures p1 = 2.5 bar and p2 = 500 mbar (equivalent to 1875 and 375 mmHg, respectively). Pressure higher than 2.5 bar resulted in destruction of the PDMS membrane between the sample chambers and the pressurized cavity. As the high-pressure air filled the cuboidal-cavities, they expanded and pushed the 1 mm thick PDMS membrane towards the sample-filled chambers squeezing and deforming them (the glass on the other side of the cavity prevented the expansion) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13b–c</xref>). As the valve of the high-pressure source (p1) closed and the second valve opened, the pressure in the cavity dropped significantly and the deformed sample chambers returned to their original shape. The rapid oscillation of the air pressure (~280/min) in the cavities resulted in a corresponding squeeze-release pulsation of the chambers, mimicking a beating heart better than previous method. After 24 hr of operation, the system was turned off, the plugs were removed from the inlet holes and the samples were removed with a syringe and needle for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Pressure-bottle-pressure significantly exceeding the physiological range</title><p>We put four samples into four 0.5 mL micro-centrifuge tubes (Eppendorf tubes), removed the caps of the tubes and covered them with parafilm (Bemis, USA) instead. Small holes were made in the parafilm with a syringe needle (OD = 0.6 mm). We put the sample-loaded Eppendorf tubes inside a 250 mL laboratory glass bottle (Duran, Fischer Scientific, Germany) and closed it air-tight with a screw cap. Before closing, two small holes were drilled in the cap and steel capillaries (OD = 0.8 mm) were placed in and glued with an epoxy-based resin. The oscillatory system was connected to the steel capillaries with Teflon tubes.</p><p>Operation parameters. In this experiment, we decided to work well above the target pressure range, in order to increase the chance of protein denaturation. After a few pilot experiments, we set the high pressure p1 equal to 4.5 bar (3375 mmHg) and the lower pressure p2 equal to 0.5 bar (375 mmHg). However, due to the relatively large volume of the bottle, high compressibility of the air and the short opening times of the two valves, the pressures acting on the samples were not equal to the input pressures p1 and p2.</p><p>To measure the actual pressure range inside the laboratory bottle, which acted directly on the samples, we attached two manometers (model 82100, AZ Instruments, Taiwan) to the pressure outlet of the setup: one before the second valve to measure the pressure that build-up inside the laboratory bottle and another behind the second valve to measure the pressure after the release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).</p><p>In the laboratory bottle the pressure acting on our samples never dropped below 450 mbar (320 mmHg) and increased up to 1600 mbar (1200 mmHg). The frequency oscillation of the pressure was ~230/min with some ‘desynchronization’ events every 15–20 s when the pressure difference Δp=p1 p2 was only ~150 mbar (110 mmHg). Whereas during synchronized operation, the pressure difference was ~600 mbar (450 mmHg).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-5"><title>Proteins under hydrostatic pressure stress (HPS)</title><p>In all experiments, proteins at a concentration of around 1 μmol/L were incubated in the pressure oscillation system for 24 hr at room temperature.

As a control for each of the samples, the solutions were divided into portions, where one portion was placed in a chamber exposed to oscillatory pressure while the other portion was placed in the same chamber but exposed to a constant, atmospheric pressure.

Protein diffusion coefficients (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) are associated with the protein’s hydrodynamic radius (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) by Stokes-Einstein relation, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is Boltzmann constant, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the temperature and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the viscosity of medium).

The setup is equipped with a Pico Harp 300 system (PicoQuant, Germany). Measurements were performed in a climate chamber (Okolab, Italy) providing temperature control and required humidity at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mn>25.0</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mi>℃</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Labeled proteins were excited by a 485 nm laser, and fluorescence was detected through a 488/LP long-pass filter (Chroma, USA). Data acquisition and analysis was performed using SymPhoTime 64 software (PicoQuant, Germany). The experiments were preceded by establishing the dimension of the confocal volume using rhodamine 110 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Blinding was provided for each treatment (TMAO vs control). Unblinding was performed after statistical analysis. Any encountered outliers were included in the analysis. Diastolic arterial blood pressure (DBP), systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were calculated from the arterial blood pressure tracing. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximal slope of systolic pressure increment (+dP/dt) and diastolic pressure decrement (-dP/dt) were calculated from the left ventricle blood pressure tracing using AcqKnowledge Biopac software (Biopac Systems, Goleta, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test normality of the distribution. Differences between the TMAO and control groups were evaluated by an Independent-Samples t-test or by Mann-Whitney U test for data that were not normally distributed. In the acute experiments, the differences in the mean values between groups were first analyzed by the classic one-way ANOVA followed by a modified Student’s t-test for independent variables, using Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons. The log-rank test was used to test the survival differences between TMAO and control animals. A value of two-sided p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were conducted using Statistica, version 13.3 (Tibco, Palo Alto, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Replicates</title><p>Replicates were not used unless otherwise stated. The basic definitions of technical and biological replicates are as follows. Technical replicates: a test performed on the same sample multiple times. Biological replicates: a test performed on biologically distinct samples representing an identical time point or treatment dose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size was calculated at the start of the study, based on plasma levels of the investigated markers and hemodynamic parameters in rats, which were reported in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Savi et al., 2018</xref>). We have chosen between-group difference in plasma NT-proBNP, ejection fraction, stroke volume and ABP as primary end-points with the following parameters, respectively: the difference between the tested (groups) 30%, 15%, 30% and 13%; the average for the entire population of 30 pg/mL, 80%, 0.35 mL, 100 mmHg; a common standard deviation of 7 pg/mL, 9%, 0.08 mL, 10 mmHg; for an alpha error of 0.05, test power 0.8. Other biochemical parameters were used as secondary end points.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Tomasz Hutsch MDV, PhD, a veterinary pathologist, for consultations on histopathological analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Arduino A Mangoni as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a comprehensive study of TMAO effects on cardio-related effects in heart-failure rats. Much the work is interesting and useful, especially since TMAO from meat carnitine/microbiome was initially claimed to cause cardiovascular problems despite high TMAO in seafood, which may be cardioprotective. This study demonstrates possible protective effects.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Data:</p><p>– The authors found a beneficial effect of TMAO on SHHF, which is associated with diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive effects. The authors explored the possible mechanism underlying the beneficial effects and found that it may be related to decreased RAS activity in heart by TMAO. However, this may not cover all the underlying mechanism because it has been shown that the SHHF is related to many mechanisms, such as increased sympathetic activity, inflammation in the periphery and brain except activation of the RAS. Is there evidence that TMAO can regulate the sympathetic activity, inflammation or other factors to reduce mortality of the SHHF rats by the authors or other researcher? The authors may add more discussion to clarify it.</p><p>– The authors found that TMAO was neutral for cardiac LDH protein structure. Is there change in LDH protein function after HS or TMAO? In other words, does the unaltered protein structure stand for the normal function of this protein in this study? Are there methods to measure the LDH protein function?</p><p>– LDH effects: a) Subsection “Effect of TMAO on structure of LDH exposed to HPS and increased temperature”/Figure 14B: Figure 14B is very confusing. The legend says it is 3 different series / runs, yet some graph lines go up (diffusion faster) while others go down (diffusion slower). Why? This needs clarification or interpretation in the Discussion. b) &quot;In contrast, the protein stabilizing effect of TMAO is rather not involved in the protection of cardiac proteins against HPS produced by the contracting heart.&quot; While the data seem to support this conclusion for LDH in a limited way, there are hundreds of possible proteins that could be protected by TMAO in cycling pressures. Thus, this statement is far too sweeping and needs to be constrained.</p><p>– Pressure (HPS): Introduction paragraph four and elsewhere: The pressures used here such as 220 mmHg are nowhere near the levels in the deep sea where pressure significantly affects biological functions of deep-sea organisms. Moreover, pressure in the ocean is hydrostatic (from weight of unmoving column of water) while blood pressure is technically hydrokinetic (moving and pulsing) even though hydrostatic is commonly used. But this may matter since static and kinetic pressures could have very different effects on protein structure and adaptations. For example, in chondrocytes exposed to continuous high pressure, stress protein Hsp70 increased. However, cyclic pressure stress did not cause that (Kaarniranta et al., 1998). Thus, the analysis of TMAO on LDH under cycling pressures is not easily related to deep-sea TMAO/pressure studies for 2 reasons, namely i) mammalian pressures are far lower than deep-sea ones; and ii) mammalian pressures are kinetic, not static. I am not sure how to alter the paper for this, but some statement should be made.</p><p>– Diuresis: a) The primary benefits of TMAO here seem to be due to diuresis/natriuresis. What might the mechanism of this be, compared to other known diuretic agents? Discussion paragraph five suggests it is an <italic>osmotic</italic> effect, but this leads to:</p><p>b) Is this benefit specific to TMAO, or might <italic>any</italic> diuretic agent reduce blood pressure and thus have cardio benefits? This is not clear in this study – although urea did not cause diuresis (Figure 13), what about other diuretics? And since urea is known to cause diuresis, why did it not work here? – It is important to know if TMAO is very specific in cardioprotection or if many other agents would work as well.</p><p>c) Results subsection “SD rats”: TMAO rats had higher vasopressin, an anti-diuretic agent. Yet they also had higher diuresis. This seems to be apparent paradox – it should be interpreted in the Discussion, but I cannot find it.</p><p>2) Statistical analyses and date presentation:</p><p>– According to the authors only the (unpaired) t-test was used for statistical comparisons. Data have not been assessed for distribution normality (which would be required) and error bars in Figures 8, 9, 13 suggest non-normal distribution. All data need to be analyzed for normality of distribution, and accordingly parametric or non-parametric tests must be applied.</p><p>– Please indicate n number for each group in each figure panel or the corresponding figure legends.</p><p>– All P values in Tables 1, 2, and 3 need to be revised and amended, for example, a p&lt;0.23 is meaningless.</p><p>– Figure 11: X-axis says &quot;Time&quot; but give only single numbers. It is assumed that this is to represent weeks. Please modify.</p><p>3) Language:</p><p>There are concerns regarding language. Some statements make no sense and need rewording, for example &quot;TMAO reduces mortality in SHHF rats that is associated with diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive effects. HPS and TMAO are neutral for cardiac LDH.&quot;, &quot;Histopathological picture of SHHF heart corresponds&quot;, &quot;in SHHF, lungs showed signs of passive hyperemia, with thickening of the interalveolar septa and a weak focal parenchymal edema.&quot;, &quot;were euthanized or died spontaneously at the age of 52, 56 and 57-weeks due to hemiparalysis (ischemic stroke), dyspnoe (post-mortem lung edema) and spontaneous death (post-mortem lung edema), respectively.&quot; &quot;MAO treated group showed… &quot; &quot;TMAO-treated rats showed a significantly lower diastolic blood pressure and a trend towards lower systolic blood pressure (p=0.01)”, &quot;The general myocardium pattern&quot;… etc. The authors are encouraged to consult with a scientist colleague whose first language is English and, where necessary, improve content, grammar, and syntax.</p><p>[Editors'‌ ‌note:‌ ‌further‌ ‌revisions‌ ‌were‌ ‌suggested‌ ‌prior‌ ‌to‌ ‌acceptance,‌ ‌as‌ ‌described‌ ‌below.]‌</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TMAO, a seafood-derived molecule, produces diuresis and reduces mortality in heart failure rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Due to the multiple biochemical analyses which we have performed so far, we do not have sufficient samples left to fully address this issue. Nevertheless, we have managed to perform additional ELISA tests for IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine in plasma of SHHF-Water and SHHF-TMAO. In the TMAO group we found significantly higher plasma levels of IL-10 than in the Water group, there was also a trend towards higher level of TNF-α in the Water group (p=0.19). This has been added to the Table 2. To fully address the issue of sympathetic activity, further studies evaluating urine concentration of catecholamines metabolites are needed, but we are not able to perform these tests currently.

We assume that other positive effects of TMAO, such as hypotension and decreased RAAS activity in the heart, were secondary to the reduction of fluid retention in HF animals. TMAO is well-established osmolyte, therefore it is possible that TMAO treatment could also “correct” water distribution between body water compartments.</p><p>To fully answer the question of whether the effect of TMAO may be compared to other compounds producing osmotic diuresis (mannitol or gliflozins which increase osmotic diuresis by inhibiting glucose renal reabsorption) is beyond the scope of this study. Additional studies specifically designed to compare and contrast different diuretic agents, including TMAO, would be needed to answer this question.</p><p>Here, we compared TMAO to urea because of similarities between the two molecules (both are nitrogenous osmolytes and have a similar molecular weight). As pointed out by the reviewer, in our study TMAO produced significant diuresis whereas urea did not. This was likely due the fact that we evaluated the same (equimolar) doses of urea and TMAO, whereas physiological concentrations of TMAO in plasma is radically lower (micromoles/L) in comparison to urea (millimoles/L). Because of significant differences in plasma concentration of urea and TMAO, considerably higher doses of urea are needed to produce diuresis. Therefore, we think that our study does not contradict the diuretic effect of urea reported by others. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that TMAO exerts a significantly more potent diuretic effect than urea.</p><p>We have added discussion on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Results subsection “SD rats”: TMAO rats had higher vasopressin, an anti-diuretic agent.

In general, at the end of the experiment, the TMAO groups showed higher water intake (however, not significantly higher, p=0.17 for SHHF rats, p=0.9 for SD rats, and p=0.3 for SD-ISO). This seemed to result from a diuretic effect of TMAO, which was found in the present study. In fact, during the first 24-48 hours after the introduction of water containing TMAO, the rats tended to have a lower intake of fluids, likely due to decreased palatability of water containing TMAO. After this time, the intake of the fluid increased and remained stable for the entirety of the experiment (12 months).</p><p>Plasma and urine concentrations of TMAO were measured using a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph coupled with a Waters TQ-S triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) – positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode.
