Due to overlapping sequences with linear cognates, identifying internal sequences of circRNAs remains a challenge, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of circRNA functions and mechanisms. Here, based on rolling circular reverse transcription and nanopore sequencing, we developed circFL-seq, a full-length circRNA sequencing method, to profile circRNA at the isoform level. With a customized computational pipeline to directly identify full-length sequences from rolling circular reads, we reconstructed 77,606 high-quality circRNAs from seven human cell lines and two human tissues. circFL-seq benefits from rolling circles and long-read sequencing, and the results showed more than tenfold enrichment of circRNA reads and advantages for both detection and quantification at the isoform level compared to those for short-read RNA sequencing. The concordance of the RT-qPCR and circFL-seq results for the identification of differential alternative splicing suggested wide application prospects for functional studies of internal variants in circRNAs. Moreover, the detection of fusion circRNAs at the omics scale may further expand the application of circFL-seq. Taken together, the accurate identification and quantification of full-length circRNAs make circFL-seq a potential tool for large-scale screening of functional circRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circular RNA</kwd><kwd>nanopore sequencing</kwd><kwd>full-length sequencing</kwd><kwd>fusion circRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7212065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-NKX-XM-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z181100001518005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Accurate identification and quantification of various circRNA isoforms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of covalently closed RNA molecules formed via back-splicing (BS) or lariat precursors, are involved in various biological processes and pathogenesis by fine-tuning the eukaryotic gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kristensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen, 2020</xref>). CircRNAs directly or indirectly regulate target gene expression via diverse mechanisms, which are largely determined by circRNA sequence features. For example, circRNAs may complementarily bind to miRNAs as sponges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>); circRNAs may interact with proteins as scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2017</xref>) or structural components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2015</xref>) based on sequence motifs; and several circRNAs are also able to translate into peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2021</xref> ) through internal ribosome entry sites. Thus, full-length sequences of circRNAs have become the foundation for ascertaining their biological functions in transcriptional plasticity and complexity.</p><p>By detecting the back-splicing junctions (BSJs) of circRNAs with deep sequencing, short-read RNA sequencing discriminates circRNAs with low expression (as low as 1% polyadenylated RNA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salzman et al., 2013</xref>) from their linear cognates. The full-length sequences of short circRNAs (&lt;500 nt) can be inferred from a patchwork of BSJs and short fragments via bioinformatic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wu et al., 2019b</xref>). However, a full understanding of circRNA isoforms is impossible by using short reads. Single-molecule long-read sequencing has shown methodological advances in identifying circRNAs at the isoform level. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing has been applied to PCR products for target full-length circRNA sequences in a low-throughput and high-cost way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">You et al., 2015</xref>). Very recently, several Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)-based methods have also been employed in genome-wide full-length circRNA reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rahimi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xin et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Here, we developed a high-throughput circRNA sequencing method, termed circFL-seq, with rolling circular reverse transcription (RCRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boss and Arenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Das et al., 2019</xref>) and nanopore long-read sequencing for the identification of circRNA at the isoform level. With a customized computational pipeline, we identified 77,606 high-quality full-length circRNA isoforms from seven cell lines and two human tissues. We validated circFL-seq for full-length circRNA detection and quantification by comparison to annotated circRNAs, RNA-seq, isoCirc, CIRI-long, and RT-qPCR results. By providing full-length circRNA sequences, circFL-seq allowed the study of sequence features, alternative splicing (AS), and differential expression at the isoform level. In addition, circFL-seq showed the ability to detect fusion circRNAs (f-circRNAs), which were further experimentally validated. Taken together, circFL-seq benefits from RCRT and long-read sequencing and has shown advantages for identifying high-quality full-length circRNAs at a low cost.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequencing full-length circRNA with circFL-seq</title><p>We developed the circFL-seq approach that utilized RCRT with long-read sequencing for full-length circRNA profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, circRNA was enriched by rRNA depletion, poly(A) tailing (to increase the efficiency of RNase R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xiao and Wilusz, 2019</xref>), and RNase R treatment. Then, first-strand cDNA was synthesized with random primers (P1-N<sub>6</sub>) by RCRT for circRNA and regular reverse transcription (RT) for linear residuals. After tailing poly(A) of the first strand and synthesizing the second strand with an anchor primer (P2-T<sub>24</sub>), the double-strand cDNA was amplified with P1 and P2 to construct the final circFL-seq library. To benchmark full-length circRNA sequences of the circFL-seq library, eight known circRNAs were selected for PCR validation in the HEK293T library.

Then, reads were realigned to pseudo-references, generated by concatenating two sequences of potential BSJ regions, to accurately localize circRNA BSJs. In addition, full-length structures were adjusted with multiple alignments from rolling circular segments to improve the construction. To complement the RG mode for low-quality reads, the cRG mode identified consensus sequences (CS) from clean reads with two or more rolling circles, and triply duplicated CS were used as query sequences in RG mode to improve circRNA detection.

For high-quality circRNA isoforms (read counts≥5), the exonic type accounted for 73.2% of the identified circRNA species, while only 0.1% were from read-through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Most exonic types (99.8%) could be verified in at least one database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Glažar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which could be attributed to their higher expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).

A total of 95,371 circRNA BSJs were detected by CIRI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). BSJ reads accounted for 0.15–0.32% of all RNA-seq reads, an amount 10 times lower than that of full-length circRNA reads with circFL-seq (2.2–8.5%). Compared to known BSJs that have been annotated in the database, the proportion of overlapping BSJs identified by RNA-seq seemed to be larger than that identified by circFL-seq (76.7% vs. 40.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, when focusing on high-quality BSJs (read counts≥5), the proportion obtained with circFL-seq (78.9%) was similar to that obtained with RNA-seq, indicating that more reads are required to confidently identify circRNAs by ONT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected, the full-length construction by RNA-seq was highly dependent on circRNA length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Approximately 96.3% of full-length circRNAs reconstructed by RNA-seq were less than 500 nt in length, while 44.4% of circRNA isoforms detected by circFL-seq were more than 500 nt in length.</p><p>A recent method, isoCirc, identified full-length circRNAs by rolling circle amplification (RCA) followed by nanopore sequencing. With a single circFL-seq library of the HEK293 cell line sequenced by one MinION Flow Cell, we compared the features of the RCRT strategy and RCA strategy. circFL-seq produced more full-length circRNA reads per 10<sup>9</sup> raw bases than isoCirc (11,791 vs. 5820) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A-C</xref>) but identified fewer circRNA isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5D</xref>). However, 75.3% of circFL-seq-detected BSJs were annotated in the database, while the percentage of isoCirc was 43.8% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The difference might be caused by the higher read coverage for confident circRNAs of circFL-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5E</xref>) or by the higher sensitivity of circRNA detection of isoCirc. Although the ground truth of all BSJs was unknown, we found that circRNAs with higher read counts were more likely to be included in the database for both methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5F-I</xref>). Thus, we evaluated the precision of the two methods by top expressed circRNAs, which could eliminate the effect of the high noise of nanopore reads and the disturbance of low-expressed circRNAs without annotation in the database. All the top 100 expressed BSJs identified by circFL-seq and RNA-seq (collected from isoCirc study) were annotated in databases. In contrast, 22 of the top 100 BSJs identified by isoCirc were not supported in the databases or the RNA-seq and circFL-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5M</xref>). Specifically, two products among the 22 BSJs were from histone genes with linear RNAs resistant to RNase R degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xiao and Wilusz, 2019</xref>). We also failed to experimentally validate the two potential circular products with divergent primers. At the isoform level in the HEK293 cell line, 87.0% of the common BSJs (10,702/12,307) between circFL-seq and isoCirc identified at least one identical isoform. Inconsistent isoforms usually had lower read counts with both circFL-seq and isoCirc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5N,O</xref>), suggesting that accurate construction of full-length circRNA requires higher read coverage. In addition, circFL-seq identified more than two times ES, A3SS, and A5SS but similar numbers of IR events to isoCirc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), which may be due to the more full-length reads of circFL-seq.</p><p>We then compared circFL-seq to isoCirc in two normal human tissues (brain and testis) with high sequencing depth. isoCirc built multiple libraries for each sample and sequenced on multiple MinION Flow Cells to obtain a high sequencing depth, while circFL-seq built one library for each tissue and sequenced the two libraries on one PromethION Flow Cell to obtain a comparable sequencing depth. isoCirc and circFL-seq detected 79,312 and 34,046 known BSJs, respectively. Known BSJs detected by isoCirc were more likely (38,846 vs. 2511) to be expressed at low levels (read counts=1), indicating that more libraries were more sensitive for detecting circRNAs, overcoming bias and artifacts related to sampling, RNase R treatment, cDNA synthesis, and amplification.</p><p>Both circFL-seq and CIRI-long employed an RCRT strategy for library construction. Although the two methods were applied in different species (human vs. mouse), the computational pipelines were compatible and could be compared with each other. We employed the computational pipeline of circFL-seq and CIRI-long to analyze HEK293 cells library of circFL-seq and a mouse brain library of CIRI-long, respectively. circFL-seq detected 27,869 BSJs from HEK293 cells (75.3% known in the database) and 18,396 BSJs from the mouse brain (68.6% known in the database), while CIRI-long detected 15,242 BSJs from HEK293 cells (76.9% known in the database) and 9258 BSJs from the mouse brain (69.9% known in the database) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thus, the computational pipeline of circFL-seq was more sensitive with similar precision for BSJ detection. For AS events, circFL-seq identified more than 4.5 times the ES events, 12.4 times the A3SS events, 8.5 times the A5SS events, and 1.5 times the IR events, suggesting a better sensitivity of circFL-seq in AS event detection, although ground-truth circRNA isoforms were required for performance evaluation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Evaluation of quantification of full-length circRNAs</title><p>With the benefit of high read coverage, circFL-seq is able to quantify circRNA expression levels.

Compared to short-read sequencing, which is limited to reconstructing short circRNAs (&lt;500 nt), long-read sequencing with circFL-seq has shown advances in comprehensively identifying full-length circRNAs of all sizes (64–2334 nt in our data and more than 40% identified isoforms &gt;500 nt). Very recently, isoCirc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xin et al., 2021a</xref>) and CIRI-long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>) also employed nanopore sequencing to identify full-length circRNAs by utilizing rolling circles. circFL-seq and CIRI-long employ the RCRT strategy, while isoCirc employs the RCA strategy. Benefiting from RCA with a circular cDNA template from ligation of the RT product, isoCirc produces longer reads (up to 50 kb) containing more rolling circles than RCRT-based methods (ca. 1 kb) and thus has an advantage in error correction during CS identification. As a trade-off, the cost of each full-length read is much higher in isoCirc than in circFL-seq and CIRI-long. In addition, the unique ligation of cDNA in isoCirc may introduce false positives for circRNA detection by ligating cDNA from residual linear RNA or truncated cDNA of circRNA, which is hardly totally recognized and removed by computational analysis. In contrast to isoCirc, both the circFL-seq and CIRI-long-based methods employ RCRT to produce rolling circles during first-strand synthesis. However, circFL-seq synthesizes second-strand cDNA with an anchor primer, while CIRI-long uses template switching. Thus, these two methods are more resistant to the interference of residual linear RNA and generate shorter full-length reads of circRNA than isoCirc. Although decreasing the sequencing cost of nanopore, shorter full-length reads have to perform error correction among reads in addition to intra reads. Thus, RCRT-based methods are not as sensitive as isoCirc with the same number of full-length reads. The computational pipelines of circFL-seq and CIRI-long are compatible given their very similar experimental protocols. Both of these methods calculate CS from tandem repeats of reads to refine low-quality sequences, followed by localization of CS. However, CS may ignore reads that are less than two full circles. In contrast, the RG mode of circFL-seq identified 56% more full-length circRNAs with fewer than two circles in our data, which helps to improve the sensitivity of circRNA detection. In addition, circFL-seq leverages primer sequences to adjust the strand origin of circRNA, especially for BSJ with a non-canonical splicing motif. For details, we summarize the three methods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p><p>Previous short-read RNA sequencing was used to quantify circRNAs based on BSJ-spanning reads, while circFL-seq with full-length reads was employed to finely quantify circRNAs at the isoform level. Thus, circFL-seq is able to identify differential internal AS events, helping to unravel the function of sequence variants. In our comparisons, circFL-seq was more sensitive than isoCirc and CIRI-long for AS detection, although the performance required full evaluation by ground-truth circRNA isoforms. Another novel application of full-length circRNA sequencing is to identify f-circRNA, which has been found to play important roles in cancer pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guarnerio et al., 2016</xref>) and has become a promising biomarker for liquid biopsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tan et al., 2018a</xref>). Current methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guarnerio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tan et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wu et al., 2019a</xref>) validated the proposed f-circRNA by designing divergent primers on known gene fusion junctions and thus were inefficient and possibly ignored f-circRNA from unknown gene fusions. With cancer cell line data, circFL-seq showed its ability to high-throughput identify f-circRNA, which will promote our knowledge of f-circRNA.</p><p>Overall, circFL-seq is able to identify and quantify circRNAs at the isoform level and is more sensitive in circRNA AS event detection and f-circRNA detection. In addition, circFL-seq has been applied in a large-scale sequencer, PromethION, with pooling multiple libraries, which will further decrease the sequencing cost to twice that of RNA-seq. Thus, our developed circFL-seq process is an effective and affordable high-throughput full-length circRNA sequencing method for screening functional circRNAs at the omics scale.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jiadong Wang Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SKOV3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jiadong Wang Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0532">CVCL_0532</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jiadong Wang Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0031">CVCL_0031</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jiadong Wang Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SH-SY5Y</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jian Chen Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0019">CVCL_0019</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VCaP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iCell Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_2235">CVCL_2235</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iCell Bioscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total RNA of human brain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clontech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 636530</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total RNA of human testis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clontech</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 636533</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and RNA isolation</title><p>The human cell lines HeLa, SKOV3, MCF7, VCaP, SH-SY5Y, HEK293T, and HEK293 were used in this study.

We employed porechop (v0.2.4) to trim barcode and circFL-seq primers (P1 and P2) and split chimeric reads to obtain clean reads for each sample. Then, RG mode (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/yangence/circfull">https://github.com/yangence/circfull</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) was employed to detect circRNAs with clean reads. cRG mode was used to correct circFL-seq reads by de novo self-correction to calculate CS, and RG mode was rerun with a query sequence of three copies of CS. With primer sequences at both ends of sequenced reads, circFL-seq detected the strand origin of reads and adjusted circRNA results with strand information. Finally, we filtered out low-quality full-length circRNAs after integrating circRNA results.</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>RG mode</title><p>Clean reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) by minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li, 2018</xref>) (v2.12) with the parameters ‘-ax splice -p 0.5’ or ‘-ax splice -p 0.5 -uf’ for transcript-strand reads. Aligned reads with chiastic overlapping segments were recognized as candidate circRNA reads (CCRs). CCRs were classified into three types: normal, fusion on the same chromosome, and fusion on different chromosomes. The boundaries of the chiastic segment of the CCRs were detected as potential BSJs. FSJs were determined according to the skipped region from the reference. For each read, a pseudo reference sequence was generated by concatenating two sequences from 150 nt upstream to 150 nt downstream of the BSJ region. Then, CCRs were realigned against the pseudo references, and accurate sites of BSJs were determined by integrating multiple aligned BSJs, gene annotation (GENCODE v19), and canonical splicing motifs (GT/AG). FSJs of CCRs were also corrected based on the integration of multiple aligned FSJs, gene annotation, and FSJs from other CCRs with the same BSJ. Next, the full-length circRNA was constructed based on the FSJ(s) and BSJ(s).

The current claims and conclusions that circFL-seq is the superior method is not well supported by their data in this version of the manuscript.

In comparison to isoCirc, circFL-seq identified fewer circRNA isoforms with higher read coverage of the detected circRNAs, which may be a PCR artifact. The authors need to address this concern. In addition, in two published studies, isoCirc and CIRI-long have also used nanopore sequencing to characterize circRNA isoforms and alternative splicing events. However, both studies have reported a relatively higher percentage of retained introns (isoCirc: Figure 4b, CIRI-long: Supplementary Figure 13) compared to the number of 3.5% of intron retention events in line 139. The authors should clarify the reason behind this difference.</p><p>4. The authors found six f-circ derived from GBF1-MACROD2 fusion and validated their junctions using Sanger sequencing. Besides, the authors also used short-read RNA-seq to validate the linear fusion junctions. What's the ratio of linear and circular transcript derived from these gene fusion loci? Is there any possibility that these f-circRNAs are derived from trans-splicing events? Considering that short-read RNA-seq data cannot effectively distinguish circular and linear transcripts, the authors may try to search for nanopore reads spanning the fusion region, which can provide direct evidence for these gene fusion events.</p><p>5.

Also, in Figure 3e, it is not clear what the y-axis is. The authors state that it is read coverage, but how come the value is from 0 to 1? In Figure 3d, the authors state that it is the correlation between HeLa and SKOV3, but it was not clear what axis is HeLa and SKOV3, respectively. Again, what does the shaded area mean in these figures (figure 3c, 3d, 3f, and 3g)? The authors should check through the figure label more carefully and correct them accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a nice piece of work that can be published after revision. Below are my specific comments for the authors:</p><p>1. As noted in my public review, the authors should carry out a two-way comparison between circFL-seq and CIRI-long, as well as a three-way comparison between circFL-seq, CIRI-long, and isoCirc. Given that circFL-seq and CIRI-long are both based on RCRT while isoCirc is based on RCA, it would be interesting to see if circFL-seq and CIRI-long produce more concordant results in terms of the discovery and quantitation of full-length circular RNAs, given the similarity in their experimental strategies.</p><p>2. In both Introduction and Discussion, the authors noted that the use of ligation in isoCirc may lead to false discoveries of circular RNAs. While this statement is technically correct from an experimental standpoint, such false discoveries can be recognized and removed computationally – therefore this is not a fair critique of isoCirc. In fact, the isoCirc computational pipeline is designed to remove such artifacts, using stringent requirements for alignment quality and presence of canonical splice site motifs in all forward and back splice junctions within full-length circular RNA transcripts.</p><p>3. Line 65-67: &quot;Thus, an accurate but affordable method to detect full-length circRNA remains to be developed for wide application in screening functional circRNAs at the omics scale&quot;. This statement leaves the impression that such a method currently does not exist, which is not a fair representation of the current literature with the recent publications of isoCirc and CIRI-long.</p><p>4. The authors reported that compared to isoCirc, circFL-seq produced more full-length circular RNA reads at the same library depth but identified fewer circular RNA isoforms. The authors appeared to present this finding as a positive feature of circFL-seq. For example, in line 265-267, the authors stated that &quot;as a trade-off, isoCirc produced fewer reads with the same sequencing depth, which raised sequencing costs and weakened its ability to detect and accurately quantify high-quality circRNAs&quot;. There are multiple issues with this statement. In terms of the precision of circular RNA quantitation (e.g. as evaluated based on comparison among nanopore replicates as well as comparison to short-read RNA-seq data), the metrics presented for circFL-seq are in fact quite comparable to the metrics presented in the isoCirc paper, so there is no evidence that circFL-seq provides a better quantitation of circular RNAs. Moreover, given that the ground-truth is not known, an alternative interpretation to this observation is that circFL-seq may be biased towards highly expressed circular RNAs, and may lack the ability to discover moderately and lowly expressed circular RNAs. Overall, in comparing different methods, the authors should aim to provide an impartial discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods, and avoid over-interpreting the data in favor of their own method.</p><p>5. The discussion about CDR1as is interesting. Can CIRI-long detect this circular RNA?</p><p>6. The authors should also cite the BioRxiv preprint by Rahimi et al., (https://doi.org/10.1101/567164), which is another method for nanopore sequencing of circular RNAs.</p><p>7. Overall, the manuscript is easy to read and follow, but it could benefit from a thorough editing by a language editor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In comparison to isoCirc, circFL-seq identified fewer circRNA isoforms with higher read coverage of the detected circRNAs. This raises a concern that the outcome may result from that RCRT captures circRNA less efficiently than RCA, resulting in fewer circRNA molecules are captured in circFL-seq. The higher read coverage may simply come from sequencing the same circRNA molecule from the PCR amplification artifacts. This may also explain why circFL-seq cannot detect circRNAs with low read count or lowly expressed circRNAs. In this case, the authors cannot use back splice junction (BSJ) detection saturation as an indicator to compare the required read-depth between isoCirc and circFL-seq. Also, given the concern above, the &quot;high read coverage&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;high quality&quot; nor &quot;high accuracy&quot; as claimed by the authors. The authors should address this concern before claiming on the benefits of high read coverage.</p><p>2. The advantages of circFL-seq over other existing technologies are not well-supported. For example, the authors claim that RCRT has lower residual linear RNA contamination than RCA, but the authors do not provide any data or evidence supporting the claim. Also, the authors claim that the circFL-seq gives higher circRNA read coverage; hence it is beneficial for circRNA quantification. However, the real &quot;benefits&quot; over other technologies (RNA-seq and isoCirc) for circRNA quantification are not clear since the RNA-seq (and isoCirc) quantification is significantly correlated with circFL-seq as demonstrated by the authors.</p><p>3. In the manuscript, the results are often comparable with known database and existing technologies when the authors focus on the &quot;high quality&quot; circRNAs only (circFL-seq read counts &gt;= 5) which also have high expression level. The fact suggests that circFL-seq result is trust-worthy on &quot;high quality&quot; only. It also suggests that circFL-seq may fail to detect the lowly expressed circRNAs. The authors should note and discuss these limitations.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1. The Figures and Supplemental Figures were not labeled with figure numbers, making it extremely difficult to read (especially some figures span across more than one page). The authors should label the figure number more clearly.</p><p>2. Some figures are not clearly labeled. For example, in Figure 2j, what does each lane represent? Also, in Figure 3e, it is not clear what the y-axis is. The authors state that it is read coverage, but how come the value is from 0 to 1? In Figure 3d, the authors state that it is the correlation between HeLa and SKOV3, but it was not clear what axis is HeLa and SKOV3, respectively. Again, what does the shaded area mean in these figures (figure 3c, 3d, 3f, and 3g)? The authors should check through the figure label more carefully and correct them accordingly.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. In the Abstract section, the authors claim that &quot;… the detection of cancer-related fusion circRNAs…&quot;. However, the authors did not provide any data or literature suggesting that the fusion circRNAs they identified by circFL-seq are really &quot;cancer-related&quot; or biologically meaningful. The claim needs to be revised or proved.</p><p>2. In Figure2—figure supplement 1a, the full-length circRNA reads contribute very little percentage of the total clean reads (~2-5%). How come the RCRT method generate so little full-length circRNA reads? The authors should comment on this and discuss it.</p><p>3.In Figure 3—figure supplement 3, the author claim that more reads are required for ONT to confidently identify circRNAs. Doesn't this compromise the cost-efficient claim of circFL-seq made by the authors earlier? The authors should comment on this and discuss it.</p><p>4. In Figure 3—figure supplement 6a-d, how the saturation curves are calculated? It seems like isoCirc has much lower sequencing depth (~0.3 M) than circFL-seq. How do the authors compare the BSJ saturation in this case?</p><p>5. When comparing the validity of circFL-seq and isoCirc, why do the authors focus on top 100 expressed BSJ only? A better comparison should be the total BSJ in circFL-seq and isoCirc.</p><p>6. The authors should not use the same absolute circFL-seq BSJ read counts to define high-quality BSJs in isoCirc for the following reasons: (i) the read counts &gt;= 5 in circFL-seq is arbitrary, there is no evidence suggesting that the isoCirc should use the same read counts to define high-quality BSJs. (ii) Since isoCirc captures more circRNAs, a lower BSJ read counts per circRNA is expected given the same sequencing depth. In both cases, lower BSJ read counts in isoCirc does not necessarily mean the BSJ is not &quot;high-quality&quot;. Thus, the authors should not use absolute circFL-seq BSJ read counts as an indicator for the BSJ quality in isoCirc.</p><p>7. In the PLOD2 circFL-seq and RNA-seq example shown by the authors, the authors suggest that the circPLOD2 has lower exon skipping event than its parent linear RNA in HeLa cells. However, given that the BSJ is exactly the same between exon-skipped and non-exon-skipped circPLOD2, how does the back-splicing mechanism distinguish different parent linear RNA isoforms that selectively back-splices the non-exon-skipped linear RNA to generate specific circPLOD2 isoform in HeLa cells?</p><p>8. Are the f-circ detected by circFL-seq generated by RNA fusion or genomic fusion? Although the RNA-seq suggests a genomic fusion, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of a genomic fusion. A genomic PCR followed by Sanger sequencing should be performed to validate the fusion junction of the genome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Considering that there are two recently published circRNA reconstruction tools based on nanopore sequencing, the authors should comprehensively compare their method with these two tools, and carefully discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. In the Discussion section (line 260-262), the authors compared circFL-seq with the recently published CIRI-long method. Both circFL-seq and CIRI-long use a similar rolling circle reverse transcription strategy to amplify circRNAs. The authors may discuss the difference and (dis)advantages between their method and previous methods (isoCirc and CIRI-long).</p><p>2. In section &quot;Comparison with RNA-seq and isoCirc for circRNA detection&quot;, the authors compared circFL-seq with the isoCirc method and found that circFL-seq produced more circular reads but identified fewer circRNA isoforms, which is an interesting result. Does it mean that isoCirc has a better sensitivity or higher false discovery rate in detecting lowly expressed circRNAs? The authors should include more comparison (e.g. venn diagram between three sets under different BSJ thresholds) between circFL-seq, isoCirc, and public circRNA database (e.g. circAtlas [PMID: 32345360, PMID: 30893614]) to demonstrate the advantages of their method.</p><p>3. The authors found six f-circ derived from GBF1-MACROD2 fusion and validated their junctions using Sanger sequencing. Besides, the authors also used short-read RNA-seq to validate the linear fusion junctions. What's the ratio of linear and circular transcript derived from these gene fusion loci?

The authors should provide more data about this step.</p><p>6. In section &quot;Evaluation of quantification of full-length circRNAs&quot;, it would be nice if the authors could compare the quantification results between their method on nanopore reads and previous method (e.g. CIRIquant) on short-read RNA-seq data.</p><p>7. The authors used different names (circFL-seq, circfull) to denote their sequencing and data analysis methods. It would be better if they can unify the name, say, circFL-seq, which may avoid misunderstanding.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69457.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, circFL-seq and CIRI-long employed RCRT strategy, while isoCirc with RCA strategy. Benefiting from RCA with circular cDNA template from ligation of reverse transcription (RT) product, isoCirc produced longer reads (up to 50 kb) containing more rolling circles than RCRT based methods (ca. 1 kb), and thus had an advantage in error correction during consensus sequences identification. As a trade-off, the cost of each full-length read is much higher in isoCirc than circFL-seq and CIRI-long. In addition, the unique ligation of cDNA in isoCirc may introduce false positive for circRNA detection by ligating cDNA from residual linear RNA. In contrast to isoCirc, both of circFL-seq and CIRI-long based methods employed RCRT to produce rolling circles during first-strand synthesis. The difference was that circFL-seq synthesized second-strand cDNA with an anchor primer while CIRI-long used template switching. Thus, these two methods are more resistant to the interference of residual linear RNA and generate shorter full-length reads of circRNA than isoCirc. Although decreasing sequencing cost of nanopore, shorter full-length reads have to perform error correction among reads besides intra-reads. Thus, RCRT based methods are not as sensitive as isoCirc with the same amount of full-length reads.</p><p>Along with detection of circRNA full-length sequences, all the three methods were also able to detect alternative splicing events of circRNAs. Both circFL-seq and isoCirc detected AS events of circRNA in human samples. For HEK293 cell line sequenced by one MinION, circFL-seq could be more precise than isoCirc for BSJ detection (75.3% vs 43.8%) with known circRNAs annotated in databases for comparison, and identified more than two times of ES, A3SS, and A5SS but similar amount of IR events than isoCirc. (Supplementary file 4). Thus, benefiting from more full-length circRNA reads, circFL-seq is more sensitive for AS events. However, circFL-seq may fail to detect some IR events. We found that the reads of isoCirc-only IR showed high error rate in the intron region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) which could due to the strong second structure. The RT step and cDNA ligation of isoCirc could avoid or remedy the early stop of RT in the strong RNA structure of intron.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Alignment schematic of nanopore reads of isoCirc-only IR events.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69457-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although circFL-seq and CIRI-long were applied in different species (human vs. mouse), the computational pipeline was compatible and could be compared with each other for the very similar experimental protocols.

In comparison to isoCirc, circFL-seq identified fewer circRNA isoforms with higher read coverage of the detected circRNAs, which may be a PCR artifact. The authors need to address this concern. In addition, in two published studies, isoCirc and CIRI-long have also used nanopore sequencing to characterize circRNA isoforms and alternative splicing events. However, both studies have reported a relatively higher percentage of retained introns (isoCirc: Figure 4b, CIRI-long: Supplementary Figure 13) compared to the number of 3.5% of intron retention events in line 139.

Is there any possibility that these f-circRNAs are derived from trans-splicing events?

Below are my specific comments for the authors:</p><p>1. As noted in my public review, the authors should carry out a two-way comparison between circFL-seq and CIRI-long, as well as a three-way comparison between circFL-seq, CIRI-long, and isoCirc. Given that circFL-seq and CIRI-long are both based on RCRT while isoCirc is based on RCA, it would be interesting to see if circFL-seq and CIRI-long produce more concordant results in terms of the discovery and quantitation of full-length circular RNAs, given the similarity in their experimental strategies.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed the three-way comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In both Introduction and Discussion, the authors noted that the use of ligation in isoCirc may lead to false discoveries of circular RNAs. While this statement is technically correct from an experimental standpoint, such false discoveries can be recognized and removed computationally – therefore this is not a fair critique of isoCirc. In fact, the isoCirc computational pipeline is designed to remove such artifacts, using stringent requirements for alignment quality and presence of canonical splice site motifs in all forward and back splice junctions within full-length circular RNA transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that false discoveries can be recognized and removed computationally. However, not all of those false discoveries were identified by the computational pipeline of isoCirc. We focused on the false discoveries of top expressed circRNAs to eliminate the effect of high noise of nanopore reads and disturbance of low expressed circRNAs. As clarified in our manuscript, when focusing on the top 100 expressed circRNA BSJs identified by each method, BSJs from both circFL-seq and RNA-seq (collected from isoCirc study) were annotated in databases, while 22 of the top 100 BSJs identified by isoCirc lacked evidence support from the database, RNA-seq, or circFL-seq results. Specifically, two products were from histone genes whose linear RNAs are resistant to RNase R degradation. In addition, we also failed to experimentally validate the two potential circular products with divergent primers. Thus, there are abundant false discoveries which were not removed by the computational pipeline of isoCirc. We have made this description clearer in our manuscript (marked as Q1.2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 65-67: &quot;Thus, an accurate but affordable method to detect full-length circRNA remains to be developed for wide application in screening functional circRNAs at the omics scale&quot;. This statement leaves the impression that such a method currently does not exist, which is not a fair representation of the current literature with the recent publications of isoCirc and CIRI-long.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors reported that compared to isoCirc, circFL-seq produced more full-length circular RNA reads at the same library depth but identified fewer circular RNA isoforms. The authors appeared to present this finding as a positive feature of circFL-seq. For example, in line 265-267, the authors stated that &quot;as a trade-off, isoCirc produced fewer reads with the same sequencing depth, which raised sequencing costs and weakened its ability to detect and accurately quantify high-quality circRNAs&quot;. There are multiple issues with this statement. In terms of the precision of circular RNA quantitation (e.g. as evaluated based on comparison among nanopore replicates as well as comparison to short-read RNA-seq data), the metrics presented for circFL-seq are in fact quite comparable to the metrics presented in the isoCirc paper, so there is no evidence that circFL-seq provides a better quantitation of circular RNAs. Moreover, given that the ground-truth is not known, an alternative interpretation to this observation is that circFL-seq may be biased towards highly expressed circular RNAs, and may lack the ability to discover moderately and lowly expressed circular RNAs. Overall, in comparing different methods, the authors should aim to provide an impartial discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods, and avoid over-interpreting the data in favor of their own method.</p></disp-quote><p>Because circFL-seq is more sensitive and more precise for BSJ detection, circFL-seq could also provide better quantitation. However, due to the advantage of quantification performance is not obvious, we have removed the advantage descriptions of circFL-seq for circRNA quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The discussion about CDR1as is interesting. Can CIRI-long detect this circular RNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Because CIRI-long only published mouse brain data, we employed the computational pipeline of CIRI-long on our circFL-seq data of HEK293 cell line. CIRI-long also successfully identified <italic>CDR1as</italic>. We also employed the computational pipeline of circFL-seq on isoCirc data but failed to detect <italic>CDR1as</italic>. Thus, we speculated that isoCirc data lack the sequenced reads of <italic>CDR1as</italic>, the reason of which could due to the experimental protocol. Because some circRNAs, including <italic>CDR1as</italic>, are sensitivity to RNase R (<italic>Linda Szabo</italic>1 <italic>and Julia Salzman</italic>, 2016, Nature Reviews Genetics), we hypothesized that digestion of linear transcripts by RNase R might require to be optimized in the protocol of isoCirc. We have removed the discussions about <italic>CDR1as</italic> in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Overall, the manuscript is easy to read and follow, but it could benefit from a thorough editing by a language editor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a language editing by American Journal Experts (AJE).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1. In comparison to isoCirc, circFL-seq identified fewer circRNA isoforms with higher read coverage of the detected circRNAs. This raises a concern that the outcome may result from that RCRT captures circRNA less efficiently than RCA, resulting in fewer circRNA molecules are captured in circFL-seq. The higher read coverage may simply come from sequencing the same circRNA molecule from the PCR amplification artifacts. This may also explain why circFL-seq cannot detect circRNAs with low read count or lowly expressed circRNAs. In this case, the authors cannot use back splice junction (BSJ) detection saturation as an indicator to compare the required read-depth between isoCirc and circFL-seq. Also, given the concern above, the &quot;high read coverage&quot; does not necessarily mean &quot;high quality&quot; nor &quot;high accuracy&quot; as claimed by the authors. The authors should address this concern before claiming on the benefits of high read coverage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agreed that saturation curve was not appropriate and thus deleted related data from our revised manuscript (marked as Q2.1).</p><p>Comprehensive comparison between RCA and RCRT has been discussed above. And the worry about bias of high expressed circRNA has also been discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The advantages of circFL-seq over other existing technologies are not well-supported. For example, the authors claim that RCRT has lower residual linear RNA contamination than RCA, but the authors do not provide any data or evidence supporting the claim. Also, the authors claim that the circFL-seq gives higher circRNA read coverage; hence it is beneficial for circRNA quantification. However, the real &quot;benefits&quot; over other technologies (RNA-seq and isoCirc) for circRNA quantification are not clear since the RNA-seq (and isoCirc) quantification is significantly correlated with circFL-seq as demonstrated by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. We have performed the three-way comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the manuscript, the results are often comparable with known database and existing technologies when the authors focus on the &quot;high quality&quot; circRNAs only (circFL-seq read counts &gt;= 5) which also have high expression level. The fact suggests that circFL-seq result is trust-worthy on &quot;high quality&quot; only. It also suggests that circFL-seq may fail to detect the lowly expressed circRNAs. The authors should note and discuss these limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for confusing. The term “high quality” we used here was not equivalent to high expression level. With higher sequencing depth, lowly expressed circRNAs would become “high quality”.

In the Abstract section, the authors claim that &quot;… the detection of cancer-related fusion circRNAs…&quot;.

The claim needs to be revised or proved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the phrase “cancer-related” in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure2—figure supplement 1a, the full-length circRNA reads contribute very little percentage of the total clean reads (~2-5%). How come the RCRT method generate so little full-length circRNA reads? The authors should comment on this and discuss it.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we have shown the percentage of BSJs reads from RNA-seq is only 0.15%–0.32%, an amount ten times lower than that of full-length circRNA reads with circFL-seq. In addition, the percentage isoCirc ranged between 3.5% and 4.0%, which is comparable with circFL-seq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.In Figure 3—figure supplement 3, the author claim that more reads are required for ONT to confidently identify circRNAs. Doesn't this compromise the cost-efficient claim of circFL-seq made by the authors earlier? The authors should comment on this and discuss it.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. circFL-seq is developed for full-length circRNA sequencing. In the detection of BSJs, the cost of circFL-seq is much higher than RNA-seq. For the cost-efficient question in the full-length level, we want to compare circFL-seq to isoCirc. Due to the high noise of ONT reads, both circFL-seq and isoCirc have shown circRNAs with more read counts is more reliable. Because circFL-seq have the advantage to produce more reads. Thus, circFL-seq is a cost-efficient method for full-length circRNA sequencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The authors should not use the same absolute circFL-seq BSJ read counts to define high-quality BSJs in isoCirc for the following reasons: (i) the read counts &gt;= 5 in circFL-seq is arbitrary, there is no evidence suggesting that the isoCirc should use the same read counts to define high-quality BSJs. (ii) Since isoCirc captures more circRNAs, a lower BSJ read counts per circRNA is expected given the same sequencing depth. In both cases, lower BSJ read counts in isoCirc does not necessarily mean the BSJ is not &quot;high-quality&quot;. Thus, the authors should not use absolute circFL-seq BSJ read counts as an indicator for the BSJ quality in isoCirc.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for confusing.

In the PLOD2 circFL-seq and RNA-seq example shown by the authors, the authors suggest that the circPLOD2 has lower exon skipping event than its parent linear RNA in HeLa cells. However, given that the BSJ is exactly the same between exon-skipped and non-exon-skipped circPLOD2, how does the back-splicing mechanism distinguish different parent linear RNA isoforms that selectively back-splices the non-exon-skipped linear RNA to generate specific circPLOD2 isoform in HeLa cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. We actually compared the exon skipping between two circular isoforms instead of between circRNA and its linear cognate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Are the f-circ detected by circFL-seq generated by RNA fusion or genomic fusion? Although the RNA-seq suggests a genomic fusion, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of a genomic fusion. A genomic PCR followed by Sanger sequencing should be performed to validate the fusion junction of the genome.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Details was described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Considering that there are two recently published circRNA reconstruction tools based on nanopore sequencing, the authors should comprehensively compare their method with these two tools, and carefully discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these methods.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. In the Discussion section (line 260-262), the authors compared circFL-seq with the recently published CIRI-long method. Both circFL-seq and CIRI-long use a similar rolling circle reverse transcription strategy to amplify circRNAs. The authors may discuss the difference and (dis)advantages between their method and previous methods (isoCirc and CIRI-long).</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the differences of three methods and the limitation of circFL-seq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In section &quot;Comparison with RNA-seq and isoCirc for circRNA detection&quot;, the authors compared circFL-seq with the isoCirc method and found that circFL-seq produced more circular reads but identified fewer circRNA isoforms, which is an interesting result. Does it mean that isoCirc has a better sensitivity or higher false discovery rate in detecting lowly expressed circRNAs? The authors should include more comparison (e.g. venn diagram between three sets under different BSJ thresholds) between circFL-seq, isoCirc, and public circRNA database (e.g. circAtlas [PMID: 32345360, PMID: 30893614]) to demonstrate the advantages of their method.</p></disp-quote><p>A more detailed comparison was conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors found six f-circ derived from GBF1-MACROD2 fusion and validated their junctions using Sanger sequencing. Besides, the authors also used short-read RNA-seq to validate the linear fusion junctions. What's the ratio of linear and circular transcript derived from these gene fusion loci? Is there any possibility that these f-circRNAs are derived from trans-splicing events? Considering that short-read RNA-seq data cannot effectively distinguish circular and linear transcripts, the authors may try to search for nanopore reads spanning the fusion region, which can provide direct evidence for these gene fusion events.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the question in above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Because of the high error rate of nanopore sequencing, the authors should compare the error rate of CS sequence before and after cRG correction to elucidate the ability to correct sequencing errors with the cRG mode.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the question above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors trained a random forest classifier to predict the strand origin of circular reads. How many CCRs were used as the training set, and how's the performance of the random forest classifier? The authors should provide more data about this step.</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed the question above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In section &quot;Evaluation of quantification of full-length circRNAs&quot;, it would be nice if the authors could compare the quantification results between their method on nanopore reads and previous method (e.g. CIRIquant) on short-read RNA-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggestion. In the section, we have compared the quantification results between circFL-seq and RNA-seq (quantified by CIRI2), including Pearson correlation of expression level and DEC detection, which have shown comparable ability of BSJs quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors used different names (circFL-seq, circfull) to denote their sequencing and data analysis methods. It would be better if they can unify the name, say, circFL-seq, which may avoid misunderstanding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggestion. We have unified the name to circFL-seq in our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
