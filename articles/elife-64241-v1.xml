However, like any new technology, these tools have inherent limitations that could confound data interpretation.</p><p>The leading chemogenetic approach, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), acts through engineered G protein-coupled receptors, which are selectively activated by clozapine N-oxide (CNO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roth, 2016</xref>). However, DREADDs may disrupt signaling from endogenous G protein-coupled receptors when expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saloman et al., 2016</xref>), and CNO has been found to be metabolized peripherally to clozapine, which binds to many receptors in the brain, potentially resulting in off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manvich et al., 2018</xref>). A more recent chemogenetic approach, Pharmacologically Selective Actuator/Effector Module (PSAM/PSEM), acts through engineered ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by PSEM agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magnus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magnus et al., 2019</xref>). The inhibitory PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR is a chimeric protein of a modified α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand binding domain fused to the chloride-permeable glycine receptor ion pore domain (GlyR). After intracranial injection and expression of a virus encoding PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR, application of ultrapotent agonist (e.g., uPSEM<sup>792</sup>) activates PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR, which in principle selectively inhibits PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magnus et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to validate the inhibitory function of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in the ventral striatum. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of uPSEM<sup>792</sup> enhanced the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR-expressing D1-MSNs, indicative of in vivo activation rather than inhibition of these neurons. Using whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices, we found that activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR with uPSEM<sup>792</sup> decreased membrane resistance, induced an inward current in voltage-clamp, and depolarized the membrane potential in current-clamp, sometimes resulting in depolarization block. The majority of neurons maintained action potential firing to somatic current injection. Cell-attached recordings at subthreshold depolarized potentials also showed that activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR induced firing of action potentials in D1-MSNs. Further, we found that chloride influx via PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation shifted its reversal potential to more positive values further exacerbating the depolarizing effect and attenuated GABAergic inhibition of D1-MSNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective expression of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in D1-MSNs</title><p>To first validate the selective expression of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in ventral striatum D1-MSNs, prodynorphin-Cre mice were crossed with a Cre-reporter (Ai9) mouse line, resulting in labeling of neurons containing Cre-recombinase (i.e., D1-MSNs) with the fluorescent reporter tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hasani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krashes et al., 2014</xref>).

To avoid a potential floor effect, we treated mice with fentanyl since opioid exposure has been shown to increase the expression of c-fos and other immediate early genes in striatal neurons including D1-MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enoksson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lobo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 1994</xref>). Prodynorphin-Cre mice received bilateral injections of either AAV-syn-flex-PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR-IRES-eGFP (PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR) or AAV-EF1α-DIO-eYFP. Then, after 4–6 weeks, mice were injected with uPSEM<sup>792</sup> (i.p., 3 mg/kg) or saline, followed 30 min later by fentanyl (i.p., 0.2 mg/kg) or saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Transduced neurons were identified by expression of the fluorescent reporter (eGFP or eYFP, green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Contrary to expectation, activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR with i.p. uPSEM<sup>792</sup> increased c-fos expression in D1-MSNs expressing PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation on c-fos expression (F<sub>1, 34</sub> = 30.55, p&lt;0.0001).

These results support the rejection of the initial hypothesis that PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation reduces c-fos expression in D1-MSNs. There was no difference in c-fos expression in non-transduced cells (two-way ANOVA; PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation effect: F<sub>1, 34</sub> = 0.82, p=0.37; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In principle, relaxation of outward currents during voltage steps could reflect fewer available channels (e.g., channel desensitization, inactivation, or voltage-dependent block), which would be expected to result in smaller tail currents. Alternatively, the relaxation of outward currents could be a manifestation of reduced driving force of chloride influx through PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR channels due to the accumulation of intracellular chloride over the course of the voltage steps, which would be expected to result in larger tail currents. Indeed, many reports show that sustained activation of chloride conductances including GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huguenard and Alger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Staley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thompson and Gähwiler, 1989</xref>), glycine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karlsson et al., 2011</xref>), and Halorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raimondo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfonsa et al., 2015</xref>) can lead to chloride influx that overwhelms homeostatic mechanisms to pump chloride out, thereby elevating the intracellular chloride concentration. An increase in intracellular chloride manifests as a rightward shift of the chloride reversal potential, commensurate with our observation of a rightward shift of the PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR reversal potential from −61 mV to −44 mV. Further, the magnitude of the tail current increased substantially with preceding depolarizing steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>; RM two-way ANOVA, significant PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation effect: F<sub>1, 30</sub> = 18.05, p=0.0002; significant PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation × voltage step interaction: F<sub>9, 270</sub> = 9.55, p&lt;0.0001; Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test shows that tail currents from every preceding voltage step were significantly different from current at −88 mV without a preceding voltage step). These data reveal that the decline in outward current was not due to fewer available channels but was consistent with a change in the driving force and shift in the reversal potential during the depolarizing voltage steps. In addition, the magnitude of the shift in reversal potential was positively correlated with the conductance of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR, measured at V<sub>hold </sub>−88 mV (Pearson’s correlation, r = 0.57, p=0.0008, <italic>n</italic> = 21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The tail current analysis also suggested some intrinsic voltage-sensitivity of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR. The magnitude of tail currents decreased with preceding hyperpolarizing steps (e.g., −98, –108, or −118 mV) and increased with preceding depolarizing steps (e.g., −78 or −68 mV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), suggesting that hyperpolarization reduced the number of available channels, or that depolarization increased the number of available channels. Taken together, the results suggest that activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in D1-MSNs is largely depolarizing at sub- and peri-threshold membrane potentials likely due to two mechanisms: increased channel availability with depolarization due to intrinsic voltage-sensitive mechanisms, and more prominently, a rightward shift of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR reversal potential due to accumulation of intracellular chloride at depolarized potentials.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Loss of GABAergic inhibition following activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR</title><p>Shifts in intracellular chloride concentration have been shown to result in ‘apparent cross-desensitization’ of glycine- and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors whereby sustained activation of one chloride-permeable channel (e.g., glycine channel) results in reduced currents carried by another chloride-permeable channel (e.g., GABA<sub>A</sub> channel) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karlsson et al., 2011</xref>).

When activated near the resting membrane potential (−83 mV), PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR passes inward current and depolarizes D1-MSNs. When activated at potentials more depolarized than the chloride reversal potential, PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR passes transient or small outward currents, likely due to influx and accumulation of intracellular chloride that overwhelms endogenous mechanisms to restore the chloride gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huguenard and Alger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Staley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thompson and Gähwiler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karlsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raimondo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfonsa et al., 2015</xref>). Bath application or systemic injection of high potency exogenous agonists of chloride conductances (e.g., uPSEM<sup>792</sup>) is a very different phenomenon than physiological activation of native chloride conductances (e.g., GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors) by endogenous agonists. The release and clearance of endogenous neurotransmitters are usually tightly controlled and occur over the scale of milliseconds, allowing the neurons to better maintain a stable intra- and extracellular chloride gradient. This is unlike exogenous agonists that result in sustained activation over seconds or minutes and cause massive chloride influx and a shift in chloride reversal potential. In addition, the expression of endogenous chloride conductances is also regulated, unlike viral overexpression of exogenous conductances (e.g., PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR) which only augments the magnitude of chloride influx, hence the unpredictable nature of neuronal responses to the activation of exogenous chloride conductances with exogenous agonists.</p><p>More commonly, chloride conductances inhibit action potential firing through electrical shunting. Opening channels decrease membrane resistance which reduces (shunts) depolarization in response to inward current. While there was a significant decrease in membrane resistance associated with opening PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in D1-MSNs (~30% reduction), it was not sufficient to prevent suprathreshold depolarization by current injection. The majority of neurons were equally capable of firing action potentials to current injection. Despite using high viral titer in our experiments, the decrease in membrane resistance we observed was lower than previously reported in cortical layer 2/3 neurons where PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation suppressed firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magnus et al., 2019</xref>). While increasing PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR conductance by further increasing expression levels could theoretically improve shunting efficacy, the data in this study show a strong correlation between PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR conductance and the rightward shift in PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR reversal potential, suggesting that increasing expression levels will only promote further depolarization with PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation. The lack of shunting efficacy in D1-MSNs is likely due to their low membrane resistance (~78 MΩ in brain slices as measured above) relative to other neurons in the brain (e.g., pyramidal neurons in cortex and hippocampus). It is important to note that membrane resistance is inversely proportional to temperature, age, and number/activity of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kroon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Waters and Helmchen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>), and therefore, the shunting efficacy of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyRs during behavioral experiments in vivo is likely to be lower than in brain slices.</p><p>In the awake behaving state in vivo, MSNs show brief and irregular spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations between depolarizations (−50 to −60 mV) that facilitate action potential firing and hyperpolarizations (−80 to −90 mV), with the overall membrane potential following a Gaussian distribution (mean ~ −69 mV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahon et al., 2006</xref>). The cell-attached data show that activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR triggers action potential firing when the neurons are depolarized to subthreshold potentials by increasing extracellular potassium. A caveat of these data is that increasing extracellular potassium may indirectly impair chloride extrusion via the potassium-chloride cotransporter, KCC2, which may exacerbate instability of the chloride gradient and make the cells more excitable. Such KCC2 perturbance is expected to affect both control and PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR cells. However, the increased excitability observed in our experiments was limited to the PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR cells supporting the conclusion of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR driven increase in excitability. The current-clamp data showed that activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR depolarized D1-MSNs by ~20 mV and was sufficient to produce depolarization block in a proportion of neurons. This implies that in vivo, PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation will effectively increase the probability and duration of spontaneous depolarizations, and increase the probability of D1-MSN firing especially during these depolarizations. The results also show that PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation results in ‘apparent cross-desensitization’ of GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic currents, producing a rightward shift in the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential and a profound reduction of inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic currents onto D1-MSNs, likely attributed to electrical shunting since the reduction was observed at all potentials. Given the critical role of local GABAergic inhibition in the striatum in regulating neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koós and Tepper, 1999</xref>), PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR triggered reduction of GABAergic inhibition will further increase the likelihood of D1-MSNs activation rather than inhibition. Thus, increased c-fos expression in D1-MSNs following in vivo activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR is likely caused by PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR-induced depolarization and firing in addition to loss of GABAergic inhibition, and reflects increased neuronal activity of D1-MSNs in vivo.</p><p>Finally, PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR-induced depolarization may allow robust calcium influx via voltage-gated calcium channels and NMDA receptors relieved from voltage-dependent magnesium pore-block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayer and Westbrook, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayer et al., 1984</xref>). Calcium influx activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), calcium response elements in genes, and various other signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pasek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapham, 2007</xref>), which are known to influence synaptic plasticity and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wayman et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that when used to silence neurons, PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation could confound the interpretation of experimental results due to depolarization-induced calcium influx, independent of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR’s effect on action potential firing like in the case of depolarization-block.</p><p>In summary, activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR expressed in D1-MSNs in the ventral striatum enhanced neuronal activity through direct depolarization and did not suppress action potential firing via membrane shunting. The results of our study show that the PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR approach to silence neurons may not be suitable for all cell types and highlight the need to validate the inhibition of neuronal firing by PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in the cell type of interest prior to behavioral studies. More broadly, these data demonstrate that achieving neuronal silencing with chloride conductances continues to be challenging and may result in unexpected neuronal activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Using a vibrating microtome (Leica Biosystems, IL). Coronal brain slices (220 µm) containing the ventral striatum were collected and incubated at 32°C for 4 min, then transferred to room temperature until use. All recordings were from neurons in the ventro-medial shell of the nucleus accumbens. Cells were visualized using IR-DIC and fluorescence on an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope (Olympus, MA). Transduced D1-MSNs were identified by visualization of eGFP or eYFP. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made at 35 ± 1°C with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440a digitizer with Clampex and Axoscope software (Molecular Devices, CA). Data were digitized at 20 kHz. For voltage-clamp experiments, data were filtered at 2 kHz. Recordings were performed in modified Krebs’ buffer. In the majority of experiments, receptor antagonists were used to eliminate fast synaptic transmission (3 µM NBQX or DNQX and 100 µM picrotoxin).

Series resistance was monitored throughout the recordings and not compensated. Reported voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of −8 mV between the internal and external solutions. To measure neuronal excitability, current was injected in 50 pA increments (2 s). In determining the current–voltage (I-V) relationship using voltage steps, the external solution of some recordings included 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to eliminate sodium channel-dependent spiking. There were no differences in the shape of the I-V with or without TTX, so data were combined. Reversal potentials were determined by linear regression considering each replicate an individual point. Recordings in which current did not cross 0 pA were omitted from analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 2). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic currents were evoked with electrical stimulation delivered by a bipolar stimulating electrode placed in the brain slice, in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX/DNQX) to isolate fast GABAergic synaptic transmission.

Z-stack images of the viral injection site in the right hemisphere (two to three brain sections) were collected. Expression of c-fos and eGFP/eYFP was manually quantified by counting fluorescent cells within the image frame.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joseph V Raimondo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ofer Yizhar (Reviewer #2); Melanie A Woodin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This manuscript performs a much-needed validation of a new generation of chemogenetic tools based on the PSAM family of ligand-gated chloride channels. The authors expressed PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in D1 MSNs in striatum. They then perform c-Fos staining after systemic injection of the ligand (uPSEM<sup>792</sup>) and show that paradoxically, c-Fos expression is elevated in the expressing cells. This is followed bys a detailed and thorough investigation of the electrophysiological effects of uPSEM<sup>792</sup> delivery in acute brain slices. The authors find that uPSEM mostly depolarizes the PSAM-expressing neurons, which is expected from the chloride reversal potential in these cells, but also fails to shunt action potential firing. They further demonstrate that prolonged activation of the PSAM channels leads chloride accumulation and a further shift of the chloride reversal and a loss of GABAa-mediated inhibition in the same cells. Altogether, their findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the paradoxical excitatory effects of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in D1 MSNs in-vivo. This amounts to a cautionary tale regarding the need to validate the effects of chemogenetic or optogenetic tools prior to their application in behavioral experiments.</p><p>The reviewers deemed your work of sufficient interest.

The study is well-done and written in a clear and concise manner. It would be of importance to many scientists working in this field, particularly since few studies have been published utilizing these new potentially powerful tools for chemogenetic inhibition.

However, such a comprehensive study is beyond the scope of this paper. In the original reports by Magnus et al. (2011, 2019), activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR in cortical or hippocampal cells also resulted in an inward current and depolarization of these neurons, but the neuronal silencing was attributed to a shunting effect. We believe the major contribution of our paper is that shunting from chloride channels such as PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR may not be sufficient to silence certain types of neurons and may in fact activate those neurons due to the instability of the chloride gradient. Our results showcase that chloride gradient instability represents a fundamental barrier to using chloride conductances as a reliable strategy to silence neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In Figure 6 the authors conclude that PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation in D1-MSNs reduces GABAergic synaptic inhibition.

The amplitudes would be decreased at some membrane potentials (due to changes in driving force), but it’s not clear why they would be reduced at all potentials.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer’s point is well taken. We speculate that there are two effects contributing to the reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor currents: (1) a change in driving force resulting in a rightward shift in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor reversal potential and (2) a general reduction at all potentials due to postsynaptic electrical shunting. Calculation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor reversal potential is challenging given the small amplitude of the currents. For this reason, rather than attempting to fit individual currents, we performed a linear fit based on the means ± SEM of the five neurons recorded (inset in 6C). We would be happy to remove the results of the reversal potential fit if the Reviewer thinks it is warranted. However, independent of the shift in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor reversal potential, the I-V plot in Figure 6C illustrates the dramatically reduced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated inhibition upon activation of PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR, which predisposes medium spiny neurons for further excitation. These points are now added to the discussion (page 10):</p><p>“The results also show that PSAM<sup>4</sup>-GlyR activation results in ‘apparent cross desensitization’ of GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic currents, producing a rightward shift in the GABA<sub>A</sub> reversal potential and a profound reduction of inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> synaptic currents onto D1-MSNs, likely attributed to electrical shunting since the reduction was observed at all potentials.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) N values are relatively low throughout, and/or aren't clearly explained.
