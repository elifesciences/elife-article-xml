acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS) and the multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF). Notably, impaired head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) often accompanies defects in the flagellum structure, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found the disruption of CCDC113 produced spermatozoa with disorganized sperm flagella and HTCA, which caused male infertility. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 could bind to CFAP57 and CFAP91, and function as an adaptor protein for the connection of radial spokes, nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), and doublet microtubules (DMTs) in the sperm axoneme. Moreover, CCDC113 was identified as a structural component of HTCA, collaborating with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to connect sperm head to tail during spermiogenesis. Together, our studies reveal that CCDC113 serve as a critical hub for sperm axoneme and HTCA stabilization in mice, providing insights into the potential pathogenesis of infertility associated with human <italic>CCDC113</italic> mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>male infertility</kwd><kwd>flagellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014219</institution-id><institution>National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81925015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32230029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2702600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023A03J0886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Project of Guangzhou</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023A03J0871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82371615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yuzhuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CCDC113 is a key structural hub for sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) stability, with defects leading to male infertility through disruption of sperm flagellar and HTCA integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Male fertility relies on the continuous production of spermatozoa through a complex developmental process known as spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis involves three primary stages: spermatogonia mitosis, spermatocyte meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, spermatids undergo complex differentiation processes to develop into spermatozoa, which includes nuclear elongation, chromatin remodeling, acrosome formation, cytoplasm elimination, and flagellum development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hermo et al., 2010</xref>). The integrity of spermatozoa is essential for their migration through the female reproductive tract and subsequent successful fertilization. An intact spermatozoon contains properly formed sperm head, head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), and flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parker, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roldan, 2019</xref>). Numerous components have been identified in the sperm HTCA and flagellum that are essential for the sperm integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehti and Sironen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Defects in sperm flagellum and HTCA can lead to reduced sperm motility or abnormal sperm morphology, termed as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) or acephalic spermatozoa syndrome (ASS), which, in turn, causes male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sudhakar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The sperm flagellum possesses an evolutionarily conserved axonemal structure composed of ‘9+2’ microtubules, specifically, nine peripheral doublet microtubules (DMTs) surrounding two central microtubules known as the central pair (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inaba and Mizuno, 2016</xref>). Axonemal dyneins, radial spokes (RSs), and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) are arranged on DMTs with a 96 nm repeating unit structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar and Singh, 2021</xref>). Within the axoneme, the N-DRC and RS are crucial for maintaining axonemal integrity, forming crossbridges between adjacent DMTs and linking the DMTs to the central apparatus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar and Singh, 2021</xref>). Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, biochemical techniques, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) facilitated the analysis of the axonemal structures, revealing numerous components among RS, N-DRC, and DMTs that may serve as hubs for axoneme stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). For example, CFAP91 has been identified as a protein that extends from the base of RS2 through the N-DRC base plate to RS3, thus stabilizing RS2 and RS3 on the DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bicka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dymek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gui et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, CFAP57 extends through the N-DRC and interacts with RS3 via its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). Recent analyses suggest that CCDC96 and CCDC113 may form a complex that extends parallel to the N-DRC, connecting the base of RS3 to the tail of dynein g (IDA g) and the N-DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). However, the functions of these proteins in stabilizing the sperm flagellum remain unknown.</p><p>The sperm flagellum is tightly anchored to the sperm head through the HTCA, a complex structure based on the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). This structure consists of two cylindrical microtubule-based centrioles and associated components, including well-organized segmented columns, capitulum plate, and basal plate. The segmented columns and capitulum plate, located below the basal plate, are thought to originate from the dense material emanating from the proximal centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fawcett and Phillips, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zamboni and Stefanini, 1971</xref>). Many proteins have been identified in the sperm HTCA, with mouse models exhibiting phenotypes characteristic of ASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). SPATA6 is the first protein identified as a component of the HTCA using the knockout mouse model, and is crucial for its formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). Deficiencies in SUN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elkhatib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) and PMFBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) have been associated with ASS in both humans and mice. The centriole-related protein CENTLEIN acts as a bona fide linker between SUN5 and PMFBP1, participating in the HTCA assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>). Notably, impaired HTCA often coincides with defects in the sperm flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the stabilization of the HTCA may be closely associated with the integrity of sperm flagellum. However, the mechanism that maintains the stabilization of both the sperm flagellum and the HTCA remains to be clarified.</p><p>Here, we identified an evolutionarily conserved coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) protein, CCDC113, and found that it forms a complex with CFAP57 and CFAP91, thereby facilitating the connection of RS, N-DRC, and DMTs in the axoneme. Knockout of <italic>Ccdc113</italic> resulted in spermatozoa with flagellar defects and head-tail linkage detachment, leading to male infertility. Ultrastructural analysis showed that the loss of CCDC113 disrupted both the sperm axoneme and HTCA. CCDC113 localizes on the manchette, HTCA, and flagellum in elongating and elongated spermatids. Further analysis revealed that CCDC113 is indispensable for the connection of CFAP91 and DRC2 with DMTs in the sperm axoneme, and it interacts with SUN5 and CENTLEIN to stabilize the sperm HTCA. These results suggest that CCDC113 serves as a critical hub in maintaining the structural integrity of both the sperm flagellum and HTCA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCDC113 complexes with CFAP57 and CFAP91</title><p>CCDC113 is an evolutionarily conserved CCDC protein identified in the ciliated species. Comparative analysis of CCDC113 structures from <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> showed structural similarity among CCDC113 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recent cryo-EM analysis in the structure of the 96 nm modular repeats of axonemes from the <italic>T. thermophila</italic> cilia and human respiratory cilia revealed that CCDC113 localizes to the linker region among RS, N-DRC, and DMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting it may serve as a structural component connecting RS, N-DRC, and DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bazan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>). To further investigate, we examined the interactions between CCDC113 and its neighboring axoneme-associated proteins, CFAP57 and CFAP91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We transfected HEK293T cells with a GFP-tagged CCDC113 and FLAG-tagged CFAP57 or CFAP91, then performed anti-FLAG-immunoprecipitations. CCDC113 was present in both FLAG-CFAP57 and FLAG-CFAP91 immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), indicating CCDC113 interacts with both CFAP57 and CFAP91. Given that CFAP91 has been reported to stabilize RS on the DMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bicka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dymek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gui et al., 2021</xref>) and cryo-EM analysis shows that CCDC113 is closed to DMTs, we speculated that CCDC113 may connect RS to DMTs by binding to CFAP91 and microtubules. To test this, we detected the interaction between CCDC113 and β-tubulin (TUBB5) and found that CCDC113 was present in MYC-TUBB5 immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, since CFAP57 extends through the N-DRC and CCDC113 is closed to the N-DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghanaeian et al., 2023</xref>), we further examined the interaction between CCDC113 and N-DRC components adjacent to DMTs. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis showed that CCDC113 could bind to DRC1, DRC2, and DRC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). We also included two sperm outer dense fiber proteins, ODF1 and ODF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>), which are located far from the sperm axoneme, as negative controls in the co-IP experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, neither ODF1 nor ODF2 bound to CCDC113.

Histological sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) revealed that seminiferous tubules of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited a tubular lumen with flagella emerging from the developing spermatids. In contrast, flagellar staining appeared reduced in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, red asterisks). Immunofluorescence staining for acetylated tubulin (ac-TUBULIN), a marker for sperm flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez et al., 2020</xref>), further confirmed the flagellar defects in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we examined spermatids at different stages in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> testes using periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining. Pioneering work in the mid-1950s used the PAS staining in histological sections of mouse testis to visualize glycoproteins of the acrosome and Golgi in seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oakberg, 1956</xref>). The pioneers discovered in cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules the association of differentiating germ cells with successive layers to define different stages that in mice are 12, indicated as Roman numerals (XII). For each stage, different associations of maturing germ cells were always the same with early cells in differentiation at the periphery and more mature cells near the lumen. In this way, progressive differentiation from stem cells to mitotic, meiotic, acrosome-forming, and post-acrosome maturing spermatocytes was mapped to define spermatogenesis with the XII stages in mice representing the seminiferous cycle. The maturation process from acrosome-forming cells to mature spermatocytes is defined as spermiogenesis with 16 different steps that are morphologically distinct spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O’Donnell, 2014</xref>). While acrosome biogenesis and nuclear morphology in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> spermatids from steps 1–10 were comparable to those in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spermatids, abnormal club-shaped heads were observed in spermatids from steps 11–16 in <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, black asterisk). In addition, the manchette of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> spermatids was more elongated compared to that of <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, the disruption of CCDC113 impaired spermiogenesis.</p><p>Next, we examined the spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis and found that the sperm count in the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cauda epididymis was significantly decreased compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The motility of the released spermatozoa from <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cauda epididymis showed that <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> spermatozoa were completely immotile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). H&amp;E staining of the cauda epididymis showed fewer hematoxylin-stained sperm heads in the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cauda epididymis compared to the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cauda epididymis. Notably, unlike the control group, which exhibited linear eosin staining in the epididymal lumen, the <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice showed numerous coiled eosin-stained structures without sperm heads in the epididymal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, red circles). To determine the morphological characteristics of the spermatozoa, we conducted single-sperm immunofluorescence using an anti-α/β-tubulin antibody to label the sperm flagellum and lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) to visualize the sperm acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakata et al., 2015</xref>).

In early round spermatids, the centriole pair initially localizes to the caudal nuclear pole and expands the electron-dense material, some of which exhibits striation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). As spermatids develop, the dense material around the centrioles gradually transforms into a well-organized structure, clearly identified as the basal plate, capitulum plate, and segmented columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dooher and Bennett, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2020</xref>).

Given that the cryo-EM of sperm axoneme and HTCA could powerfully strengthen the role of CCDC113 in stabilizing sperm axoneme and HTCA, it represents valuable direction for future research. <italic>Ccdc113<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice did not exhibit other ciliopathies, such as situs inversus, hydrocephalus, or abnormal ciliogenesis of tracheal cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), which suggests that CCDC113 may specifically function in spermiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phylogenetic analysis and structural similarity analysis</title><p>The amino acid sequence of CCDC113 of seven species were downloaded from UniProt.

The author should discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Good question. Considering that CCDC113 is localized in the sperm neck region and interacts with SUN5 and CENTLEIN, it may play a direct role in connecting the sperm head and tail. Indeed, PAS staining revealed that <italic>Ccdc113</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> sperm heads exhibit abnormal orientation in stages V–VIII of the seminiferous epithelia (Figure 6C-D). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that the absence of CCDC113 caused detachment of the damaged coupling apparatus from the sperm head in step 9–11 spermatids (Figure 6E). These results suggest that the detachment of the sperm head and tail in <italic>Ccdc113</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> mice may not be a secondary effect of sperm flagellum defects. We have discussed this point further below:</p><p>“CCDC113 can interact with SUN5 and CENTLEIN, but not PMFBP1 (Figure 7A-C), and left on the tip of the decapitated tail in <italic>Sun5</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> and <italic>Centlein</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> spermatozoa (Figure 7K and L). Furthermore, CCDC113 colocalizes with SUN5 in the HTCA region, and immunofluorescence staining in spermatozoa shows that SUN5 is positioned closer to the sperm nucleus than CCDC113 (Figure 7G). Therefore, SUN5 and CENTLEIN may be closer to the sperm nucleus than CCDC113. PAS staining revealed that <italic>Ccdc113</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> sperm heads are abnormally oriented in stages V–VIII seminiferous epithelia (Figure6 C and D), and TEM analysis further demonstrated that the disruption of CCDC113 causes the detachment of the destroyed coupling apparatus from the sperm head in step 9–11 spermatids (Figure 6E).

We now understand that directly detection of CCDC113 precise localization in sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA) using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) could powerfully strengthen our model. Recent advances in cryo-EM have indeed advanced our understanding of axonemal structures analysis of axonemal structures and determined the structures of native axonemal DMTs from mouse, bovine, and human sperm (Leung et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). However, high-resolution structures of sperm axoneme and HTCA regions, including those involving CCDC113, have yet to be fully characterized. Thus, we would like to discuss this point and consider it a valuable direction for future research.</p><p>“Given that the cryo-EM of sperm axoneme and HTCA could powerfully strengthen the role of CCDC113 in stabilizing sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus, it a valuable direction for future research.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Bazan, R., Schröfel, A., Joachimiak, E., Poprzeczko, M., Pigino, G., &amp; Wloga, D.

The statistical analysis section indicates this but quantification is missing for most figures including co-IP, most IF, PAS staining, EM, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for the insightful comments and guidance to improve our data quality. All the experiments in this study were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. We have quantified the co-IP experiments in Figures 1C-H and 7A-F, the IF data in Figures 2K, 5C, and 5D, as well as the PAS staining in Figure 6C. Since electron microscopy samples require very little testicular tissue and the sections obtained are very thin, the likelihood of capturing sections specifically at the sperm head-tail junction is considerably low. This challenge makes it difficult to perform quantitative analysis and statistical evaluation in the TEM experiment. To address this limitation, we have quantified the percentage of <italic>Ccdc113</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup> sperm heads with abnormal orientation in stages V–VIII of the seminiferous epithelium to indicate impaired head-to-tail anchorage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S2 is compelling and might be indicated as a major figure instead of a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comment.

The work in the manuscript here does indicate a role in sperm flagella and the head-to-tail coupling apparatus but remains descriptive until the methodology of Walton et al is applied. Hopefully, the authors will consider it for a follow-up study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this problem. We have revised this part and highlighted the Walton et al’s work in the Discussion.</p><p>“CCDC113 is a highly evolutionarily conserved component of motile cilia/ﬂagella. Studies in the model organism, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, have revealed that CCDC113 connects RS3 to dynein g and the N-DRC, which plays essential role in cilia motility (Bazan et al., 2021; Ghanaeian et al., 2023). Recent studies have also identified the localization of CCDC113 within the 96-nm repeat structure of the human respiratory epithelial axoneme, and localizes to the linker region among RS, N-DRC and DMTs (Walton et al., 2023). In this study, we reveal that CCDC113 is indispensable for male fertility, as Ccdc113 knockout mice produce spermatozoa with flagellar defects and head-tail linkage detachment (Figure 3D).”</p><p>“Overall, we identified CCDC113 as a structural component of both the flagellar axoneme and the HTCA, where it performs dual roles in stabilizing the sperm axonemal structure and maintaining the structural integrity of HTCA. Given that the cryo-EM of sperm axoneme and HTCA could powerfully strengthen the role of CCDC113 in stabilizing sperm axoneme and head-tail coupling apparatus, it a valuable direction for future research.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion may be focused on the key aspects of CCDC113 related to sperm flagella and the head-to-tail coupling apparatus that represent a genuine advance. The more speculative parts of the Discussion that have not been addressed by experimentation in the Results section may be considered for removal in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this.

The pioneers discovered in cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules the association of differentiating germ cells with successive layers to define different stages that in mice are twelve, indicated as Roman numerals (XII). For each stage, different associations of maturing germ cells were always the same with early cells in differentiation at the periphery and more mature cells near the lumen. In this way, progressive differentiation from stem cells to mitotic, meiotic, acrosome-forming, and post-acrosome maturing spermatocytes was mapped to define spermatogenesis with the XII stages in mice representing the seminiferous cycle. The maturation process from acrosome-forming cells to mature spermatocytes is defined as spermiogenesis with 19 different steps that are morphologically distinct spermatids. It is from steps 8-19 of spermiogenesis that the formation of the flagellum takes place. Final maturation occurs in the epididymis as sperm move through the caput, corpus, and cauda of the organ with motile spermatozoa generated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much!</p></body></sub-article></article>
