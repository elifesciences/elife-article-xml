Interestingly, female patients also display various degrees of reproductive disorders, in line with the subfertile phenotype of Mc4r KO female mice. However, the cellular mechanisms by which MC4R regulates reproduction are unknown. Kiss1 neurons directly stimulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release through two distinct populations: the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, controlling GnRH pulses, and the sexually dimorphic Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons controlling the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Here, we show that <italic>Mc4r</italic> expressed in Kiss1 neurons regulates fertility in females. In vivo, deletion of <italic>Mc4r</italic> from Kiss1 neurons in female mice replicates the reproductive impairments of Mc4r KO mice without inducing obesity. Conversely, re-insertion of <italic>Mc4r</italic> in Kiss1 neurons of Mc4r null mice restores estrous cyclicity and LH pulsatility without reducing their obese phenotype. In vitro, we dissect the specific action of Mc4r on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> versus Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons and show that Mc4r activation excites Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons through direct synaptic actions. In contrast, Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons are normally inhibited by MC4R activation except under elevated estradiol levels, thus facilitating the activation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons to induce the LH surge driving ovulation in females. Our findings demonstrate that POMC<sup>ARH</sup> neurons acting through MC4R directly regulate reproductive function in females by stimulating the ‘pulse generator’ activity of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and restricting the activation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons to the time of the estradiol-dependent LH surge, and thus unveil a novel pathway of the metabolic regulation of fertility by the melanocortin system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kisspeptin</kwd><kwd>melanocortin</kwd><kwd>POMC</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD099084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Victor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK133760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Victor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD090151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Victor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54AG062322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navarro</surname><given-names>Victor M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012756</institution-id><institution>Lalor Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Talbi</surname><given-names>Rajae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008601</institution-id><institution>Charles A.

The increase in obesity correlates with a decrease in fertility rates, leading to conception challenges that are experienced by approximately 15% of couples in the United States currently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Health, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) binds (1) α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH), an agonist product of the pro-opiomelanocortin (<italic>Pomc</italic>) gene, and (2) the inverse agonist, agouti-related peptide (AgRP), to regulate food intake and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cone, 2006</xref>). While the role of MC4R on food intake is largely mediated by neurons located in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shah et al., 2014</xref>), its expression in the brain is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) with the specific function of the different MC4R-expressing neurons in areas beyond the PVN remaining to be fully explored. Inactivating mutations in <italic>MC4R</italic> are a leading cause of monogenic obesity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farooqi et al., 2003</xref>) and cause excessive obesity and hyperphagia in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balthasar et al., 2005</xref>). Scant evidence in humans shows an association between <italic>MC4R</italic> mutations and higher incidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hainerová et al., 2011</xref>), alterations in the timing of puberty onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doulla et al., 2014</xref>), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batarfi et al., 2019</xref>); however, other studies have shown no association between MC4R and reproductive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farooqi et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, the role of MC4R signaling in reproductive function in humans remains controversial despite the clear association found in mice. Supporting this role of MC4R, <italic>Mc4r</italic> null mice display an array of reproductive abnormalities that largely affects females, characterized by irregular estrous cycles, disrupted luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, reduced corpora lutea, and reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sandrock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2022</xref>). Further evidence from mice demonstrates that MC4R agonists robustly increase LH release in a kisspeptin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Kisspeptin is the most potent gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretagogue known to date, and it is mainly produced in two distinct neuronal populations. Kiss1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>), present in both sexes, control the pulsatile (tonic) release of GnRH, and sex steroids attenuate their release of kisspeptin. Kiss1 neurons of the anteroventral periventricular continuum area (Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>) are predominantly present in females and are responsible for generating the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge essential for ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>). Despite these critical roles of both populations of Kiss1 neurons for reproduction, the underlying mechanisms that determine how each Kiss1 population responds differently to sex steroids to regulate the GnRH tonic versus surge release remain unresolved.</p><p>In rodents, compelling evidence indicates a close interaction between Kiss1 neurons and the melanocortin system: (1) fibers from POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus (POMC<sup>ARH</sup>) project to and juxtapose Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2016</xref>; (2) melanocortin signaling through MC4R contributes to the permissive role of leptin on puberty onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Israel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2018</xref>); and (3) Mc4r expression on both Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Villa et al., 2024</xref>) and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens and Kauffman, 2021</xref>). Altogether, this evidence suggests a clear role for Mc4r in Kiss1 neurons, in the control of reproductive maturation and fertility.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the contribution of MC4R signaling versus obesity per se in the etiology of the reproductive impairments observed in <italic>Mc4r</italic> null mice, which could explain similar impairments observed in humans. Using genetic mouse models with specific deletion or re-insertion of <italic>Mc4r</italic> in Kiss1 neurons, we show that Mc4r action in Kiss1 neurons is necessary for normal reproductive function in female mice. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings evidenced an excitatory action of Mc4r on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and an estradiol-dependent inhibitory action on Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, with important implications for the timing of the preovulatory LH surge.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mc4r</italic> within Kiss1 neurons determines the timing of puberty onset in females</title><p>The expression of <italic>Mc4r</italic> within Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons has already been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Villa et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens and Kauffman, 2021</xref>), suggesting a role for MC4R in the regulation of fertility. To further investigate the specific role of Mc4r in Kiss1 neurons, we generated a Kiss1-specific Mc4r knockout mouse model (Kiss1- Mc4r KO). The specific deletion of <italic>Mc4r</italic> from Kiss1 neurons, as well as the absence of global recombination, was confirmed through RNAscope. While Kiss1 neurons of Kiss1- Mc4r KO mice lack <italic>Mc4r</italic> transcript compared to their control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), <italic>Mc4r</italic> was detectable in the PVN of all mice, which is a major site of <italic>Mc4r</italic> expression in the brain in the regulation of metabolism, therefore supporting the specific deletion of <italic>Mc4r</italic> only within Kiss1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Puberty onset was assessed daily from weaning age through the monitoring of vaginal opening (VO) and first estrus (FE). Kiss1- Mc4r KO females showed a significant advancement in the age of VO (p = 0.0150, Kiss1- Mc4r KO: 24.67 ± 0.39 vs. controls: 26.32 ± 0.53) and FE (p = 0.0341, Kiss1- Mc4r KO: 32.63 ± 1.4 vs. controls: 37.84 ± 1.90) compared to their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Body weight of Kiss1- Mc4r KO females at the age of puberty onset was similar between groups (p = 0.2596, Kiss1- Mc4r KO: 12.41 ± 0.30 vs. controls: 12.89 ± 0.26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggest that melanocortin signaling on Kiss1 neurons participates in the timing of puberty onset in females. Since the role of the melanocortin system on puberty onset is largely unexplored, we evaluated the expression profile of the main components of this system in the hypothalami of WT female mice at post-natal days (PND) 10, 15, 22, and 30. Interestingly, expressions of <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Mc3r</italic>, and <italic>Mc4r</italic> were significantly lower at the time of puberty onset (PND30) compared to earlier developmental ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This supports our in vivo data and suggests that a decrease in hypothalamic melanocortin signaling drives puberty onset, in line with the advancement in the age of VO and FE observed in Kiss1- Mc4r KO female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Mc4r</italic> expressed in Kiss1 neurons determines the timing of puberty onset.</title><p>Kiss1- Mc4r KO females display advanced puberty onset, assessed by daily monitoring of vaginal opening (<bold>A</bold>) and first estrus (<bold>B</bold>), as documented by cumulative percent and mean age of animals at vaginal opening (<bold>A</bold>) and first estrus (<bold>B</bold>) in Kiss1- Mc4r KO females (<italic>n</italic> = 24) compared to WT littermates (<italic>n</italic> = 19). *p &lt; 0.05 by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.

However, the mRNA expression of these genes, alone, does not necessarily reflect changes in their activities.

Finally, it must be noted that at this concentration, MTII is a non-selective MCR agonist, so we followed up using a perfusion of the Mc4r-selective agonist THIQ (100 nM) to determine if activation of MC4Rs alone was sufficient to invoke a postsynaptic response in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons from OVX + E2 females. Similar to MTII, THIQ was able to elicit an excitatory inward current in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons (4/5 cells, –7.4 ± 0.5 pA), indicating MC4R activation is sufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are activated by melanocortin agonists and respond to optogenetic stimulation of POMC neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Slices were taken from <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-injected (confocal image) brains to target fluorescent cells (arrowhead) for recording (white outline over electrode).

(<bold>H</bold>) A direct synaptic projection from POMC to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neuron (post hoc identified) was confirmed using the ‘rescue’ protocol: 1, baseline glutamatergic responses were initially generated (black trace); 2, then action potentials were eliminated by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the postsynaptic response (red trace); 3, blockade of potassium channels facilitated calcium entry into the terminal through ChR2 to release synaptic vesicles, ‘rescuing’ the postsynaptic glutamate response (green trace).

As seen when targeting low input resistance neurons (i.e., Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup>) with low-frequency optogenetic stimulation (5 ms pulse, 50 ms inter-spike interval), the first response in OVX + vehicle females was larger relative to the second response in OVX + E2-treated female mice.

After 2–4 weeks we did whole-cell recordings from putative Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and looked for a response to high-frequency optogenetic stimulation of POMC fibers in OVX + E2-treated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We were able to confirm that these were Kiss1 neurons based on the presence of a persistent sodium current and/or <italic>post hoc</italic> identification by scRT-PCR (40/77) cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). While this current is more prevalent in the AVPV Kiss1 population, Kiss1 neurons are the only ARH neurons to display this electrophysiological ‘fingerprint’ of a pronounced I<sub>NaP</sub> paired with a high capacitance and a low input resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, while recording from putative Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, we optogenetically stimulated POMC fibers at low frequency (1 Hz, 5 ms, 470 nm light) and recorded fast postsynaptic inward currents. The fast kinetics of the EPSC are also a tell-tale sign of an ionotropic glutamatergic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clements and Westbrook, 1991</xref>). Previously, CNQX was sufficient to block similar excitatory ESPCs in other postsynaptic targets of POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stincic et al., 2018</xref>). While the consistent latency from optogenetic stimulus and current response was indicative of a single synaptic delay, we wanted to establish that it was a direct synaptic connection, as we have previously shown for output of POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stincic et al., 2018</xref>) and Kiss1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stincic et al., 2021</xref>). First, we abrogated the optogenetic response with the addition of TTX (1 μM) to the bath, and then we were able to rescue the postsynaptic glutamate response with the addition of the K<sup>+</sup> channel blockers 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 0.5 mM) and tetraethyl ammonium (TEA; 7.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> channel block enables the calcium influx from ChR2 activation in the presynaptic terminals to be sufficient to restore vesicle fusion.

Therefore, we compared the postsynaptic glutamatergic responses following two optogenetic stimuli (50-ms interval between light flashes) in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons from OVX + vehicle versus OVX + E2-treated female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). As anticipated, we found that treatment with E2 increased the probability of glutamate release from POMC neurons onto Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons based on the significant decrease in the paired pulse ratio of the two stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

Therefore, Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are excited by the glutamatergic input from POMC neurons in an E2-dependent manner.</p><p>Next, we tested for a melanocortin response using a high-frequency stimulation protocol known to elicit peptide release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>). Only cells displaying a glutamatergic response were tested. Indeed, high-frequency stimulation evoked an excitatory inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) that was blocked by the selective MC3/4R antagonist SHU 9119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). However, the number of high-frequency responses seen in Kiss1 neurons was unexpectedly infrequent and relatively small (4/16, 25%, mean inward current: –1.4 ± 3.1 pA) compared to the efficacy of pharmacological MCR activation.

We suspected that the high-frequency stimulation was eliciting co-release of αMSH and β-endorphin, which would exert opposite effects on a postsynaptic cell. In order to isolate melanocortin signaling, we pretreated slices with the non-selective opioid antagonist naloxone (1 μM) and found an increase in the likelihood and magnitude of a response to high-frequency stimulation (9/23, 40%, mean inward current: –7.6 ± 2.9 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>).</p><p>Together, these optogenetic findings reinforced our pharmacological results showing that Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are excited by MCR agonists.

Bath application of melanotan II (MTII, 500 nM) generated an inhibitory outward current in a Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neuron from OVX female. As the cell was synaptically isolated using bath-applied TTX (1 μM), this represents a direct effect. Washout of MTII while still in TTX quickly led to a return to baseline RMP. (<bold>E</bold>) An IV relationship was plotted using voltage steps before and after MTII administration.

We did whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings from Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>-Cre::Ai32 neurons, which were isolated synaptically by bathing the neurons in TTX (1 μM), from OVX females. For these experiments, we tested the response to the high-affinity melanocortin receptor agonist MTII (500 nM). Surprisingly, we consistently measured an outward (inhibitory) current that could be reversed on washout of MTII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This outward current was associated with an increase in K<sup>+</sup> conductance based on the current-voltage plot (i.e., the outward current reversed at ~E<sub>K+</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Also, the inwardly rectifying I/V could indicate that MC4R is coupled to activation of inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels, as has been previously reported for MC4R signaling in pre-autonomic parasympathetic neurons in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohn et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that the coupling could be modulated by E2 via a Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (Gq-mER) as we have previously demonstrated in POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lagrange et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2003</xref>). For these experiments, we again utilized OVX females and targeted Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup>-Cre::Ai32 neurons. Once in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration, we perfused the slices with STX (10 nM), a selective ligand for the putative Gq-mER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2003</xref>), and tested the response to the MTII. Indeed, the outward current (inhibitory) response to MTII was completely abrogated and even reversed by STX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>). The short-term (bath) treatment with STX ensured that there was no desensitization of the Gq-mER with longer-term (in vivo) treatment with E2. Therefore, estrogen receptor activation can rapidly uncouple (i.e., desensitize) the MC4R inhibitory response in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons. We would predict that the intracellular signaling cascade for the heterologous desensitization is similar to what we have elucidated in POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2003</xref>), but this will need to be determined in future experiments. We next investigated the response in vehicle-treated, OVX females. Indeed, Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons were even more inhibited by the same MTII exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Therefore, in contrast to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, the MC4R appears to be coupled to the opening of K<sup>+</sup> channels in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons. To further establish whether the MTII was having pre- or postsynaptic effects, we measured the glutamatergic mEPSCs before and after melanocortin receptor activation. We found there was no significant effect on the frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), but there was an effect on the amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This further supports a postsynaptic locus of STX’s effects. However, post hoc comparisons found STX increased amplitude compared to both OVX and OVX + E. This result hints at a membrane-delimited effect as STX is a much more potent agonist for Gq-mER than E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings show that melanocortins act directly on Kiss1 neurons to contribute to the metabolic regulation of fertility, in line with previous reports showing that αMSH stimulates LH release in a kisspeptin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2016</xref>) and that Kiss1 neurons express the melanocortin receptor MC4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Villa et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens and Kauffman, 2021</xref>). Several studies in humans have linked <italic>MC4R</italic> mutations to reproductive abnormalities, including precocious puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doulla et al., 2014</xref>), PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batarfi et al., 2019</xref>), and hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hainerová et al., 2011</xref>). However, a direct association between <italic>MC4R</italic> mutations and reproductive function, independent from the obese condition of these patients, has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farooqi et al., 2003</xref>). In the current study, we show that the reproductive impairments observed in Mc4r-deficient mice, which replicate many of the conditions described in humans, are largely mediated by the direct action of melanocortins via Mc4r on Kiss1 neurons and not to their obese phenotype. This is because the ablation of Mc4r from Kiss1 neurons largely replicated the reproductive impairments observed in Mc4r KO female mice without inducing obesity, and the selective re-insertion of Mc4r into Kiss1 neurons of Mc4r KO mice significantly improved their reproductive function without changing their obese phenotype. Strikingly, puberty onset was advanced in Kiss1- Mc4r KO females. Our findings revealed low melanocortin expression in the hypothalamus of WT females during pubertal development, characterized by lower levels of <italic>Agrp</italic>, <italic>Mc4r</italic>, and <italic>Mc3r</italic> expression at the time of puberty onset (~PND30). This developmental decline in the expression of melanocortin receptors is in line with the advanced timing of puberty onset in females when Mc4r is congenitally ablated from Kiss1 neurons. A recent study using whole body MC3RKO mice showed a trend to delayed puberty onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lam et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting a larger role of melanocortins in the timing of puberty onset. Here, we show that in females, the combination of MC3R and MC4R action may be necessary for pubertal development. Interestingly, the <italic>Mc4r<sup>loxTB</sup></italic> and <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>: Mc4r<sup>loxTB</sup></italic> mice do not show an advancement in puberty onset as we observed in Kiss1- Mc4r KO mice; however, these mice are obese at the time of puberty onset already, which may affect the timing of sexual maturation independently of MC4R action in Kiss1 neurons. Of note, the findings presented in this study do not rule out the existence of additional sites of action of MC4R in other neuronal populations to regulate reproduction, for example, GnRH neurons, which also express Mc4r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Israel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roa and Herbison, 2012</xref>). Indeed, the lack of full recovery of the reproductive function in <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup>: Mc4r<sup>loxTB</sup></italic> mice suggests that Mc4r in Kiss1 neurons is necessary but not sufficient to achieve full reproductive capabilities.</p><p>In addition to early puberty onset, Kiss1- Mc4r KO females displayed an impaired preovulatory LH surge driving ovulation and had fewer corpora lutea in their ovaries compared to control littermates, further supporting a role of MC4R in regulating ovulation. While Mc4r has been documented in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), our data of (1) impaired LH surge observed in the Kiss1- Mc4r KO females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>), and (2) direct action of αMSH on Kiss1 ARH and AVPV/PeN neuronal populations through Mc4r (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) support a CNS role for MC4R in the regulation of fertility. However, an additional effect of MC4R at the level of the ovary cannot be ruled out. One possibility is that the genetic deletion of <italic>Mc4r</italic> from the <italic>Kiss1</italic> gene may have affected the ovary. However, to test this hypothesis, the co-expression of <italic>Mc4r</italic> and <italic>Kiss1</italic> in the ovary needs to be investigated. Another possibility is that, given the partial fertility of these mice, follicles may have developed at different rates, potentially due to irregular secretion of gonadotropins. As a result, fewer follicles would develop and ovulate. In adulthood, the reproductive phenotype observed in Kiss1- Mc4r KO and <italic>Mc4r<sup>loxTB</sup></italic> female mice (increased LH, irregular estrous cycles, oligo-ovulation, increased cystic follicles) correlates with the phenotype observed in PCOS mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCarthy et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, an association between <italic>MC4R</italic> mutations and PCOS has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batarfi et al., 2019</xref>). However, our mouse models failed to display higher levels of circulating androgens or AMH, two of the hallmarks of PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewailly et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that melanocortin signaling is unlikely to be a main contributing factor in the development of this syndrome.</p><p>Our data revealing early puberty onset, augmented LH pulse, and impaired LH surge driving ovulation support a direct role of MC4R on the two primary Kiss1 populations regulating these functions (ARH and AVPV/PeN). We further investigated this and found that Mc4r signaling excites Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and inhibits Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons in an estradiol-dependent manner. In Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, bath-applied or optogenetically evoked release of melanocortin agonists induces a direct excitatory inward current. Our studies using whole-cell voltage clamp in female mice were able to detect a melanocortin-mediated inward current in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons that would increase excitability. Previously, an MCR-activation effect was not detected in cell-attached recordings of diestrus females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manfredi-Lozano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sabine Hessler and Herbison, 2020</xref>). However, cell-attached recordings do not measure a direct response in isolated Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons but rather the summation of multiple synaptic inputs to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons. Most importantly, we did not see a difference in the excitatory response in synaptically isolated Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons from E2-treated versus vehicle-treated, ovariectomized females. This emphasizes the importance of doing whole-cell recording from isolated Kiss1 neurons. The modulatory actions of POMC<sup>ARH</sup> neuronal projections to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons can also occur through (1) the excitatory action of glutamate in a process that is facilitated in the presence of estradiol, in line with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stincic et al., 2018</xref>), and (2) the inhibitory action of β-endorphin, suggesting that POMC<sup>ARH</sup> neurons are able to exert a precise regulatory role of the GnRH pulse generator, that is Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, in response to metabolic challenges. In the AVPV/PeN, Mc4r agonists inhibited Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons in an estradiol-dependent manner, which utilized a Gα<sub>q</sub>-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (STX receptor) to attenuate the inhibitory tone of Mc4r in these neurons. Rapid estrogen signaling may act to ease transitions between states. Membrane-delimited E2 actions can quickly attenuate or enhance coupling between receptors and signaling cascades. These effects will precede E2-driven changes in gene expression that produce more stable alterations in signaling. This combination of mechanisms will reduce any lag between rises in serum E2 and physiological effects. Considering the abbreviated mouse reproductive cycle, parallel mechanisms acting on different timescales are particularly important.</p><p>Our pharmacology data clearly demonstrate the estradiol-dependent action of Mc4r in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, suggesting that similar to Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, this population is regulated by melanocortins. The effect of Mc4r agonists on Kiss1 neurons in the presence of TTX suggests a direct synaptic effect without the need for channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping. Nonetheless, to further demonstrate this interaction, we provide evidence of profound innervation of αMSH fibers and the presence of synaptic contact between POMC and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons through the optogenetic stimulation of a glutamatergic response in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons after low-frequency stimulation of POMC terminals. We intentionally avoided high-frequency stimulation of POMC terminals to prevent the co-release of β-endorphins (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>) and their possible additive effect on the inhibitory action of MC4R. Future studies will be aimed at the characterization of the endogenous opioid pathways in the induction of the LH surge.</p><p>To date, two instances of MC4R-mediated inhibition have been described in the central nervous system: MC4R can Gi,o couple to open K+ (Kir6.2) channels in parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sohn et al., 2013</xref>), and MC4R can directly couple to K+ (Kv7.1) channels in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghamari-Langroudi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, our findings describe an inhibitory role of MC4R in the reproductive neuroendocrine axis. This steroid state-dependent effect is particularly relevant because, in the context of reproduction, the two populations of Kiss1 neurons are strikingly different in their response to estradiol, where peptide expression in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> and Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons is inhibited or stimulated, respectively, in order to mount the negative versus positive feedback of sex steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>). This differential regulation allows for the episodic versus surge release of GnRH; however, the cellular mechanisms underlying these opposing roles of Kiss1 neurons to the same stimulus, that is circulating E2 levels, remain unknown. Although there were no differences in the magnitude of the electrophysiological responses to MTII in Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons in vehicle- versus E2-treated, ovariectomized females, we cannot rule out that E2 affects other systems activated by the MC4R signaling cascade as recently reported in MC4R-expressing neurons of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krause et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, puberty onset was advanced in Kiss1- Mc4r KO females. This data suggests that the inhibitory tone of MC4R signaling on Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons might also be involved in the timing of puberty onset, which in turn suggests a role for this female-specific population of Kiss1 neurons in sexual maturation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that metabolic cues, through the regulation of the melanocortin output onto Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, are essential for the timing and magnitude of the GnRH/LH surge. This study suggests that the melanocortin–kisspeptin pathway is one of the multiple pathways essential for the metabolic regulation of the HPG axis. Future studies are warranted to fully elucidate synaptic input and postsynaptic cascades in the POMC-Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> circuit.</p><p>Altogether, our data reveal a differential regulatory action of MC4R in the neural control of GnRH/LH release, participating in both the surge (E2-treated, ovariectomized female) and the pulse-like (ovariectomized female) modes of LH release through the cellular regulation of Kiss1 neurons, which translate into our findings on the conditional knockout of <italic>Mc4r</italic> from Kiss1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These findings are important because the reproductive abnormalities often attributed to obesity in MC4R-deficient patients may not be caused by the excess in body weight but, at least in part, by a deficiency in MC4R signaling directly at the level of Kiss1 neurons that affects predominantly the ability to mount a preovulatory LH surge.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Working model of the neuronal input from POMC ARH to Kiss1 ARH and AVPV/PeN populations.</title><p>POMC<sup>ARH</sup> neurons excite Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons via glutamate and α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH) release, which activate glutamatergic ionotropic receptors and Mc4r, respectively. In the low E2 state, αMSH fibers project to the AVPV/PeN, and Mc4r inhibit Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons via opening a K<sup>+</sup> channel. However, in the high E2 state, E2 enhances the glutamatergic excitation of both POMC and Kiss1 ARH neurons. E2 treatment rapidly abrogates (uncouples) the inhibitory MC4R signaling in Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons, allowing greater excitatory actions of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons via enhanced glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100722-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vivo experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Generation of Kiss1- Mc4r KO, <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>: <italic>Mc4r<sup>loxTB</sup></italic>, and <italic>Mc4r<sup>loxTB</sup></italic> transgenic mice</title><p>Kiss1- Mc4r KO mice were generated by crossing <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> knock-in mice and <italic>Mc4r<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:MGI:6278139">MGI:6278139</ext-link>) were obtained from Dr. Richard Palmiter (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Padilla et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>Mc4r<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:023720">IMSR_JAX:023720</ext-link>) were a gift from Dr. Brad Lowell (Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shah et al., 2014</xref>).

ARH injection coordinates were anteroposterior (AP): −1.10 mm, mediolateral (ML): ±0.30 mm, dorsoventral (DL): −5.80 mm (surface of brain <italic>z</italic> = 0.0 mm); 400 nl of the AAV (2.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/ml) was injected (100 nl/min) into each position.

Slices were then transferred to a holding chamber with artificial cerebrospinal fluid bubbled with the same gas mix and allowed to recover for at least 1 hr. For recordings, slices were placed in a perfusion chamber and visualized with an Olympus BX51W1 using either differential infrared contrast or oblique illumination. Kiss1 neurons in the ARH or AVPV/PeN were targeted for electrophysiological recordings as done previously and described below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stincic et al., 2021</xref>). Final concentration was calculated based on the drug in the known volume of the bath. Perfused drugs (TTX, naloxone, and STX) were constantly circulated and given at least 10 min to reach maximal effect. Focal application of drugs (MTII and THIQ) was done with the pump stopped (10–20 min). 0.3–1 μl was directly added to the known volume of the bath to achieve the desired final concentration. This approach enables precise timing of recordings and reduces the risk of receptor desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Solutions/drugs</title><p>Standard vibratome slicing, external, and internal recording solutions were utilized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stincic et al., 2021</xref>). TTX was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel), MTII and αMSH from Tocris (Minneapolis, MN). TEA, 4-AP, 17β-estradiol benzoate, and naloxone were purchased from Millipore-Sigma.

Ai32 mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:024109">IMSR_JAX:024109</ext-link>, C57BL/6 background) carry the floxed ChR2 (H134R)-EYFP gene in their Gt(ROSA)26Sor Locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>), allowing its expression in a Cre-dependent manner. Due to concerns of non-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>), we previously validated this model using single cell RT-PCR and documented that <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA was detectable in 99% of individually harvested eYFP cells (<italic>n</italic> = 126). In addition, we have used both AAV-injected <italic>Kiss1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> AAV or Kiss1xAi32 female mice and found no differences in electrophysiological results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). We used AAV-injected POMC-Cre female mice and avoided small soma, high input resistance (&gt;800 MΩ), ventrally located cells that are typically NPY/AgRP neurons. Instead, we targeted larger, more dorsomedial neurons in the ARH while avoiding fluorescent (POMC) cells. Unlike ARH Kiss1 neurons, POMC neurons do not make reciprocal projections, so uninfected POMC neurons do not display monosynaptic EPSCs in response to optogenetic stimulation. Next, we used a ramp IV protocol to probe for the presence of a persistent sodium current (I<sub>NaP</sub>). While this current is more prevalent in the AVPV Kiss1 population, Kiss1 neurons are the only ARH neurons to display this electrophysiological ‘fingerprint’ of a pronounced I<sub>NaP</sub> paired with a high capacitance and low input resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, we also harvested the cytosol at the end of all recordings and measured the expression of Kiss1. Only cells that expressed a persistent sodium current and/or expressed <italic>Kiss1</italic> mRNA were included in the final analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 40 ARH and 6 AVPV).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The animal studies were approved by the Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) in the Center for Comparative Medicine.

The initial question is a good one. Infertility associated with MC4 mutations in humans has typically been ascribed to the consequent obesity and impaired metabolic regulation. Whether there is a direct role for MC4 in regulating the HPG axis has not been thoroughly examined. Here, the researchers have put together an elegant combination of targeted loss of function and gain of function in vivo experiments, specifically targeting MC4 expression in kisspeptin neurons. This excellent experimental design should provide compelling evidence for whether melanocortin signalling has a direct role in arcuate kisspeptin neurons to support normal reproductive function. There were definite effects on reproductive function (irregular estrous cycle, reduced magnitude of LH surge induced by exogenous estradiol). However, the magnitude of these responses and the overall effect on fertility were relatively minor. The mice lacking MC4R in kisspeptin neurons remained fertile despite these irregularities. The second part of the manuscript describes a series of electrophysiological studies evaluating the pharmacological effects of melanocortin signalling in kisspeptin cells in ex-vivo brain slides. These studies characterised interesting differential actions of melanocortins in two different populations of kisspeptin neurons. Collectively, I think the study provides novel insights into how direct actions of melanocortin signalling, via the MC4 receptor in kisspeptin neurons, contribute to the metabolic regulation of the reproductive system. Importantly, however, it is clear that other mechanisms are also at play.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The loss of function/gain of function experiments provide a conceptually simple but hugely informative experimental design.

The initial question is a good one. Infertility associated with MC4 mutations in humans has typically been ascribed to the consequent obesity and impaired metabolic regulation. Whether there is a direct role for MC4 in regulating the HPG axis has not been thoroughly examined. Here, the researchers have assembled an elegant combination of targetted loss of function and gain of function in vivo experiments, specifically targetting MC4 expression in kisspeptin neurons. This excellent experimental design should provide compelling evidence for whether melanocortin signalling dirently affects arcuate kisspeptin neurons to support normal reproductive function. There were definite effects on reproductive function (irregular estrous cycle, reduced magnitude of LH surge induced by exogenous estradiol). However, the magnitude of these responses and the overall effect on fertility were relatively minor. The mice lacking MC4R in kisspeptin neurons remained fertile despite these irregularities. The second part of the manuscript describes a series of electrophysiological studies evaluating the pharmacological effects of melanocortin signalling in kisspeptin cells in ex-vivo brain slides. These studies characterised interesting differential actions of melanocortins in two different populations of kisspeptin neurons. Collectively, the study provides some novel insights into how direct actions of melanocortin signalling via the MC4 receptor in kisspeptin neurons contribute to the metabolic regulation of the reproductive system. Importantly, however, it is clear that other mechanisms are also at play.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The loss of function/gain of function experiments provides a conceptually simple but hugely informative experimental design. This is the key strength of the current paper - especially the knock-in study that showed improved reproductive function even in the presence of ongoing obesity. This is a very convincing result that documents that reproductive deficits in MC4R knockout animals (and humans with deleterious MC4R gene variants) can be ascribed to impaired signalling in the hypothalamic kisspeptin neurons and not necessarily caused as a consequence of obesity. As concluded by the authors: &quot;reproductive impairments observed in MC4R deficient mice, which replicate many of the conditions described in humans, are largely mediated by the direct action of melanocortins via MC4R on Kiss1 neurons and not to their obese phenotype.&quot; This is important, as it might change how such fertility problems are treated.</p><p>I would like to see the validation experiments for the genetic manipulation studies given greater prominence in the manuscript because they are critical to interpretation. Presently, only single unquantified images are shown, and a much more comprehensive analysis should be provided.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Given that mice lacking MC4R in kisspeptin neurons remained fertile despite some reproductive irregularities, this can be described as a contributing pathway, but other mechanisms must also be involved in conveying metabolic information to the reproductive system. This is now appropriately covered in the discussion.</p><p>(2) The mechanistic studies evaluating melanocortin signalling in kisspeptin neurons were all completed in ovariectomised animals (with and without exogenous hormones) that do not experience cyclical hormone changes. Such cyclical changes are fundamental to how these neurons function in vivo and may dynamically alter how they respond to hormones and neuropeptides. Eliminating this variable makes interpretation difficult, but the authors have justified this as a reductionist approach to evaluate estradiol actions specifically. However, this does not reflect the actual complexity of reproductive function.</p><p>For example, the authors focus on a reduced LH response to exogenous estradiol in ovariectomised mice as evidence that there might be a sub-optimal preovulatory LH surge. However, the preovulatory LH sure (in intact animals) was not measured.</p><p>They have not assessed why some follicles ovulated, but most did not. They have focused on the possibility that the ovulation signal (LH surge) was insufficient rather than asking why some follicles responded and others did not. This suggests some issue with follicular development, likely due to changes in gonadotropin secretion during the cycle and not simply due to an insufficient LH surge.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Talbi R et al. generated transgenic mice to assess the reproduction function of MC4R in Kiss1 neurons in vivo and used electrophysiology to test how MC4R activation regulated Kiss1 neuronal firing in ARH and AVPV/PeN. This timely study is highly significant in neuroendocrinology research for the following reasons.</p><p>(1) The authors' findings are significant in the field of reproductive research. Despite the known presence of MC4R signaling in Kiss1 neurons, the exact mechanisms of how MC4R signaling regulates different Kiss1 neuronal populations in the context of sex hormone fluctuations are not entirely understood. The authors reported that knocking out Mc4r from Kiss1 neurons replicates the reproductive impairment of MC4RKO mice, and Mc4r expression in Kiss1 neurons in the MC4R null background partially restored the reproductive impairment. MC4R activation excites Kiss1 ARH neurons and inhibits Kiss1 AVPV/PeN neurons (except for elevated estradiol).</p><p>(2) Reproduction dysfunction is one of obesity comorbidities. MC4R loss-of-function mutations cause obesity phenotype and impaired reproduction. However, it is hard to determine the causality. The authors carefully measured the body weight of the different mouse models (Figure 1C, Figure 2A, Figure 3B). For example, the Kiss1-MC4RKO females showed no body weight difference at puberty onset. This clearly demonstrated the direct function of MC4R signaling in reproduction but was not a consequence of excessive adiposity.</p><p>(3) Gene expression findings in the &quot;KNDy&quot; system align with the reproduction phenotype.</p><p>(4) The electrophysiology results reported in this manuscript are innovative and provide more details of MC4R activation and Kiss1 neuronal activation.</p><p>Overall, the authors have presented sufficient background in a clear, logical, and organized structure, clearly stated the key question to be addressed, used the appropriate methodology, produced significant and innovative main findings, and made a justified conclusion.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed my comments.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The reviewers noted that they received comments in response to their concerns, and some improvements have been made to the manuscript. However, as described below, in some cases, a rebuttal was provided, but changes were not made to the manuscript. It is suggested that these issues be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for the assessment of the manuscript and recommendations for its improvement. We have addressed the remaining comments from reviewer #2 below, and hope that they find our revisions satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The manuscript convincingly shows that MC4R in kisspeptin-producing cells can influence reproductive function. This suggests that fertility problems associated with melanocortin mutations are likely due to direct effects on the reproductive systems rather than simply being side effects of the resultant obesity.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that this reviewer finds the data convincing and thank them for the careful review of the manuscript, which has helped to improve its published version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have responded to the reviewer's comments and made several improvements to the manuscript.</p><p>The authors are correct in pointing out that the POMC-Cre animals should be fine for studies involving the administration of AAVs to adult animals. I have misinterpreted how these mice were being used, and this concern is fully addressed.</p><p>Unfortunately, in some cases, the authors rebutted the reviewer's comments but did not change the manuscript. I suggest addressing several issues in the manuscript (after all, it is not the reviewer's opinion that counts; this process is about improving the manuscript).</p><p>(1) Validation of the KO is insufficiently reported. From the methods, it appears that this was done thoroughly, but currently, only a single image of the arcuate nucleus is shown, and no image of the AVPV is shown. There is no quantitative information provided. The authors can keep these data as supplementary material, but they should be comprehensive and convincing, as so much depends on the degree of knockout in this model. One cannot assume complete KO based simply on the relevant genetics, as there are examples in this system where different Cre lines produce different outcomes with various floxed genes in the two major populations of kisspeptin neurons. This figure should show the quantitation of the RNAscope analysis from each of the two regions regarding the percentage of kisspeptin cells showing expression of MC4R mRNA. In addition, the lack of MC4 labelling in the arcuate nucleus, outside of kisspeptin neurons, is a concern. One would expect to see AgRP or POMC cells at this level, but are they still showing expression of MC4? A single image is insufficient to be convinced of the model's efficacy.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns regarding the validation of the MC4RKO model. Below, we provide clarification and additional justification for our approach.</p><p>(1) Quantification of MC4R in the Arcuate Nucleus (ARC): As noted by the reviewer, we were unable to detect sufficient MC4R signal in the ARC of KO mice to perform meaningful quantification. This is consistent with the expected outcome of a successful MC4R deletion. Given the low endogenous expression levels of MC4R in this region, even in control animals, and the technical limitations of RNAscope in detecting very low-abundance transcripts, especially for receptors, the absence of MC4R signal in the ARC of KO mice strongly supports effective deletion. Moreover, the MC4R loxP mouse has been published and validated by many labs including Brad Lowell’s lab who’s done extensive work using these mice for selective deletion of Mc4r from various neuronal populations such as Sim1 and Vglut2 neurons (Shah et al., 2014, de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2020). To further strengthen our validation, we provide additional images from another animal (Fig_S1) to illustrate the consistency of the MC4R KO in the ARC. These will be included as supplementary material, as suggested.Regarding AgRP and POMC neurons, MC4R is not highly expressed in these neurons (as per previous literature, e.g., Garfield et al., Nat Neurosci. 2015; Padilla SL et al, Endocrinology 2012; Henry et al, Nature, 2015). Instead, MC4R is predominantly found in downstream neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and other hypothalamic regions (which is intact in our KO mice as shown in our validation figure). Thus, the absence of MC4R labeling in AgRP or POMC cells in our images aligns with known expression patterns and does not contradict the validity of our model.</p><p>(2) MC4R Expression in the AVPV and OVX Effect on Kiss1 Expression: We acknowledge the reviewer’s request for MC4R expression analysis in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). However, due to the timing of tissue collection after ovariectomy (OVX), Kiss1 expression in the AVPV is significantly suppressed, making it technically unfeasible to perform co-staining of MC4R with Kiss1 in this region. This is a well-documented effect of estrogen depletion following OVX (Smith et al., 2005; Lehman et al., 2010). While we acknowledge that an ideal validation would include AVPV co-labeling, the experimental constraints related to OVX preclude this analysis in our dataset.</p><p>Given these considerations and validations, we are confident that the KO is effective and specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 88: &quot;... however, conflicting reports exist&quot;. Expand on this sentence to describe what these conflicting reports show. The authors responded to my comment but made no changes to the introduction. As a reader, I dislike being told there are conflicting reports, but then I have to go and look up the reference to see what that actual point of conflict is.</p></disp-quote><p>By conflicting reports we meant that other studies have shown no association between MC4R and reproductive disorders, this has now been included in the revised manuscript (Line 89).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Could the authors explain how a decrease in AgRP would be interpreted as a &quot;decrease in hypothalamic melanocortin tone&quot; in line 142 and line 364? These overly simplistic interpretations of qPCR data detract from the overall quality of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reference to a decrease in melanocortin tone referred to the decrease in the expression of melanocortin receptor signaling, this has been clarified in the revised manuscript (lines 142 and 360).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please show the individual cycle patterns for all animals, as in Figure 2B. This can be a supplemental figure, but the current bar charts are not informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that the bar charts are not informative as they include the critical statistical analysis. We have now included all individual estrous cycle data in new separate supplemental figure (Sup. Figure 3). Therefore, we have excluded the representative cycles from the main figures as they are now in the new Supplemental. We have changed the orders of the figures in the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In their rebuttal, the authors state: &quot;Mice lack true follicular and luteal phases, and therefore, it is impossible to separate estrogen-mediated changes from progesterone-mediated changes (e.g., in a proestrous female). Therefore, we use an ovariectomized female model in which we can generate an LH surge with an E2-replacement regimen [1]. This model enables us to focus on estrogen effects, exclude progesterone effects, and minimize variability. Inclusion of cycling females would make interpretation much more difficult.&quot; I disagree, but the authors can take this position if they wish. However, they should not report the responses to exogenous estradiol in an ovariectomised mouse as a &quot;preovulatory LH surge&quot; (line 380). An ovariectomised mouse cannot ovulate, and the estrogen-induced LH surge is significantly different in magnitude and timing from the endogenous preovulatory LH surge (likely due to the actions of progesterone). One goal of these studies is to understand why the ovulation rate appears to be low in the MC4-KO animals. Hence, evaluating whether the preovulatory LH surge is typical is important. This has not been done. The authors have shown that the response to exogenous estradiol is sub-normal. Such an effect might lead to a reduced preovulatory LH surge, but this has not been measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s concern about the nature of the preovulatory LH surge. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript and described it as “an induced LH surge” throughout the text (Lines 163, 533, 6560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) I believe that the ovulation process should be considered &quot;all or none,&quot; and I do not quite understand the rebuttal discussion. The authors describe that &quot;numerous follicles mature at the same time....&quot;. That is not disputed. My point was that each mature follicle will receive the identical endocrine ovulatory signal (correct? Or do the authors believe something different?). If it were sufficient for one follicle to ovulate, then all of those mature follicles (the number of which will be variable between animals and between cycles) would be expected to undergo ovulation. The fact that they do not raise several possibilities. One that the authors favor is that an insufficient ovulatory signal might approach a threshold where some follicles ovulate and others do not. This possibility is supported by the apparent increase in cystic follicles, which might be preovulatory follicles that did not complete the ovulation process. Such variation might be stochastic, within normal variation for sensitivity to LH. However, it is also possible that the follicles have not matured at the same rate, perhaps influenced by abnormal secretion of LH or FSH during earlier phases of the cycle, and hence are not in the appropriate condition to respond to the ovulation signal when it arrives. Some may even have matured prematurely due to the elevated gonadotropins reported in this study. Given the data and the partial fertility, the most likely explanation is that the genetic manipulation has resulted in fewer follicles being available for ovulation due to changes in follicular development rather than a deficit of the ovulation signal, although the latter mechanism might also contribute. A third possibility is that genetic manipulation has directly affected the ovary. The authors did not answer whether Kiss1 and MC4 are co-expressed in the ovary. I think the authors might want to rule this out by showing no change in MC4R expression in the ovary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment and agree that these are possible outcomes. We have now acknowledged them in the Discussion.</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s question, we have not investigated the co-expression of Kiss1 and Mc4r in the ovary. While MC4R has indeed been documented in the ovary (Chen et al. Reproduction, 2017), the changes in gonadotropin release and supporting in vitro data included in this manuscript clearly document a central effect, however, an additional effect at the level of the ovary cannot be completely ruled out. This has now been added to the discussion (Line 378-387).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Lines 390, 454 &quot; impaired LH pulse&quot; What was the evidence for impaired LH pulse (see figure 2D)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. This comment referred to augmented LH release. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript (Line 394).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper's strengths remain, as outlined in my original review. The authors have addressed what I perceived to be weaknesses, predominantly by changing the tone of discussion and interpretation of the data. This is appropriate. I consider the focus on the LH surge as the primary mechanism too narrow, and the authors should be considering how other changes during the cycle might influence ovarian function.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful evaluation of our manuscript and their constructive feedback. We are pleased that our revisions have addressed the perceived weaknesses and that the adjustments to the discussion and interpretation were deemed appropriate.</p><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s perspective on broadening the discussion beyond the LH surge to consider additional cycle-dependent influences on ovarian function. While our current study focuses on this specific mechanism, we recognize that ovarian function is influenced by multiple physiological changes throughout the cycle. We have refined our discussion to reflect this broader context and appreciate the suggestion to consider these additional factors in future studies.</p><p>We have addressed all of the reviewer’s comments to the best of our ability and hope they find the revised manuscript satisfactory.</p></body></sub-article></article>
