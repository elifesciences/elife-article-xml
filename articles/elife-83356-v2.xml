Here we explored the mechanisms underlying this synaptic plasticity related to projections from the visual and entorhinal cortices to the auditory cortex in mice using optogenetics of dual pathways. High-frequency laser stimulation (HFS laser) of the visuo-auditory projection did not induce long-term potentiation. However, after pairing with sound stimulus, the visuo-auditory inputs were potentiated following either infusion of cholecystokinin (CCK) or HFS laser of the entorhino-auditory CCK-expressing projection. Combining retrograde tracing and RNAscope in situ hybridization, we show that <italic>Cck</italic> expression is higher in entorhinal cortex neurons projecting to the auditory cortex than in those originating from the visual cortex. In the presence of CCK, potentiation in the neocortex occurred when the presynaptic input arrived 200 ms before postsynaptic firing, even after just five trials of pairing. Behaviorally, inactivation of the CCK<sup>+</sup> projection from the entorhinal cortex to the auditory cortex blocked the formation of visuo-auditory associative memory. Our results indicate that neocortical visuo-auditory association is formed through heterosynaptic plasticity, which depends on release of CCK in the neocortex mostly from entorhinal afferents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>cross-modal association</kwd><kwd>long-term potentiation</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>Hebbian

integrate information from different modalities. This integrated processing is fundamental for creating complete and context-rich memories. Traditionally, it is assumed to mainly occur in higher-order association cortices as evidenced by both anatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusick et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seltzer et al., 1996</xref>) and physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fuster et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sakai and Miyashita, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sugihara et al., 2006</xref>) studies.

With respect to the visuo-auditory association, we have demonstrated that neurons in the auditory cortex (AC) start to respond to light stimuli after a classical fear conditioning, coupling light and electrical stimulation (ES) of the AC, and this type of association can be blocked by inactivation of the entorhinal cortex (EC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). This is consistent with that removal of the bilateral medial temporal lobe, where the EC locates, prevents the formation of long-term declarative memory in patient H.M. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Milner and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>).</p><p>The EC is strongly and reciprocally connected with both the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swanson and Köhler, 1986</xref>), and rich in cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive neurons, both in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenwood et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Innis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Köhler and Chan-Palay, 1982</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meziane et al., 1997</xref>). As the most abundant neuropeptide in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beinfeld et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dockray et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Innis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larsson and Rehfeld, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rehfeld, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanderhaeghen et al., 1980</xref>), sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8S) was shown to have excitatory effects on pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dodd and Kelly, 1981</xref>) and plays an important role in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horinouchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meziane et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nomoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsutsumi et al., 1999</xref>).

In line with these findings, we have previously shown that the cortical projecting neurons in the EC of mouse and rat mostly are CCK<sup>+</sup> and glutamatergic, and are important for visuo-auditory association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, how various pathways are involved and the underlying mechanism to establish the visuo-auditory association is still not clear.</p><p>In the present study, we expanded our research on visuo-auditory association by using two channelrhodopsins, Chronos and ChrimsonR, to examine various ways to potentiate the visual cortex (VC) to AC projection: (i) high-frequency laser stimulation (HFS laser) of VC-to-AC projection with classical high-frequency stimulation protocol; (ii) infusion of a CCK agonist in the AC followed by (a) pairing of presynaptic activation of VC-to-AC terminals expressing opsin by single pulse laser stimulation with postsynaptic noise-induced AC firing (CCK + Pre/Post Pairing), (b) presynaptic activation of VC-to-AC terminals (CCK + Pre), (c) postsynaptic noise-induced AC firing (CCK + Post), and (d) nothing (CCK alone); (iii) HFS laser of EC-to-AC CCK<sup>+</sup> projection followed by (a) pairing of presynaptic activation of VC-to-AC terminals expressing opsin by single pulse laser stimulation with postsynaptic noise-induced AC firing (HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing), (b) presynaptic activation of VC-to-AC terminals (HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre), (c) postsynaptic noise-induced AC firing (HFS laser EC-to-AC + Post), (d) nothing (HFS laser EC-to-AC alone); (iv) HFS laser of VC-to-AC projection followed by Pre/Post Pairing (HFS laser VC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing); and (v) testing different parameters of the pairing protocol: the frequency of the laser stimulation of the EC-to-AC CCK<sup>+</sup> projection; the delay between the termination of HFS laser of EC-to-AC CCK<sup>+</sup> projection and Pre/Post Pairing (Delay 1); and the delay between presynaptic activation of VC-to-AC projection and postsynaptic AC activation (Delay 2). Of particular interest was to test spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), an extension of the Hebbian learning rule, stating that, in order to induce potentiation, the critical window between the arrival of presynaptic input and postsynaptic firing should not be more than 20 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>).

We used laser stimulation of VC-to-AC projection to evoke presynaptic input and noise stimulus to trigger postsynaptic AC firings. Since the latency of fEPSP<sub>VC-to-AC</sub> is approximately 2–2.5 ms, and the firing latency of noise responses in the AC of mice is mostly equal to or longer than 13 ms, we presented the laser stimulus 10 ms after noise. Therefore, we activated the presynaptic input just before the postsynaptic firing (Pre/Post Pairing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Replacing the classical HFS protocol (HFS laser of the VC-to-AC projection) with local infusion of CCK-8S followed by pairing between laser stimulation-induced presynaptic VC-to-AC inputs and postsynaptic firing evoked by noise stimuli led to the potentiation of the VC-to-AC inputs. We hypothesize that these events may underlie the visuo-auditory association observed in the AC, further demonstrating the critical role of CCK to enable synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Simple pairing between HFS laser of the EC-to-AC CCK<sup>+</sup> projection and presynaptic activation of the VC-to-AC projection without postsynaptic activation did not induce LTP in the VC-to-AC inputs.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>). Bittner et al. reported that five pairings of presynaptic subthreshold inputs with postsynaptic calcium plateau potentials produce a large potentiation, and that presynaptic inputs can arrive seconds before or after postsynaptic activity, a phenomenon termed ‘behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This may account for the highly plastic nature of place fields in the hippocampus. In agreement, we observed potentiation in the neocortex, even when presynaptic input arrived 200 ms (Delay 2) earlier than postsynaptic firing and after only five trials pairing, but only in the presence of CCK. This time window could perhaps be extended as the paring trials increase. In general terms, these results fit with the fact that neuropeptides are known to exert slow and long-lasting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van den Pol, 2012</xref>).

This exclusion may limit the generalizability of our results. Future research including both genders would be valuable to understand more comprehensively the neurobiological mechanisms involved in visuo-auditory associations. Acknowledging this limitation, our study paves the way for subsequent research to explore potential gender-specific variations and their implications.</p><p>The natural condition that can activate the EC-to-AC projection similarly to the HFS laser is pending future exploration.

Future studies can further examine how other areas are integrated to form cross-modality associative memory ultimately. In summary, we found that a direct projection from the VC to the AC provide an anatomical basis for visuo-auditory association. The VC-to-AC inputs was potentiated after pairing with postsynaptic firing evoked by the AS in the presence of CCK that was applied either exogenously or (endogenously) released from the EC-to-AC CCK<sup>+</sup> projection terminals stimulated with an HFS laser. In the presence of endogenous CCK, significant potentiation of presynaptic input could be induced even if it arrived 200 ms earlier than postsynaptic firing and after only five trials of pairing. Finally, through the behavior experiments, we proved that the EC-to-AC CCK<sup>+</sup> projection is important for both establishing and retrieving the recent visuo-auditory associative memories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Cholera Toxin Subunit B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# C34775</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mm-Slc17a7-C2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 416631-C2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mm-Cck-C1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 402271-C1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mm-Tomato-C4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 317041-C4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UNC Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-Ef1α-Flex-Chronos-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UNC Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-Syn-hM4Di-EGFP-WPRE-PA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Taitool BioScience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-Syn-EGFP-WPRE-pA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Taitool BioScience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAVretro-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGH</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A gift from James M.

and Sprague–Dawley rats. For the behavioral experiments, we exclusively used male subjects. All animals were verified to have clean ears and normal hearing. They were kept under a controlled environment with a 12 hr-light/12 hr dark cycle, with the light period spanning from 8:00 pm to 8:00 am the following day. The temperature was maintained at 20–24°C and humidity levels were kept between 40 and 60%. All animals were provided with unlimited access to both food and water. All experimental procedures received approval from the Animal Subjects Ethics Sub-Committee of the City University of Hong Kong (reference number of animal ethics review: A-59 and A-0467).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viruses</title><p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were purchased from the UNC Vector Core (AAV9-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato, AAV9-Ef1α-Flex-Chronos-GFP), Taitool BioScience (AAV9-Syn-hM4Di-EGFP-WPRE-PA, AAV9-Syn-EGFP-WPRE-pA), Addgene (AAVretro-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGH [#105553-AAVrg]), and Brain VTA (AAV9-EF1a-DIO-EYFP-WPRE [PT-0899], AAV9-Syn-DIO-ChrimsonR-mCherry-WPRE-Hgh [PT-1374], AAV9-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-EYFP-WPRE-hGH pA [PT-0043], AAV9-Syn-Cck2.3 [PT-1629]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgery</title><p>For the procedure involving intracranial injection and the implantation of optical and drug cannulas, the animals were first prepared by administering an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of pentobarbital at a dosage of 80 mg/kg (Dorminal 20%, Alfasan International B.V., Woerden, the Netherlands). For the induction of anesthesia required for acute in vivo recordings, we utilized urethane at a concentration of 2 g/kg (i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Throughout the surgical procedure, we frequently administered 2% lidocaine (Tokyo Chemical Industry [TCI], #L0156, Tokyo, Japan) in droplet form directly onto the incision site to provide localized pain relief. To sustain anesthesia throughout the surgery, we periodically administered supplementary doses of either pentobarbital sodium or urethane. The animals were positioned on a stereotaxic instrument to ensure precision and stability. Prior to incision, the scalp area was thoroughly sterilized using 70% ethanol to prevent infection. A careful midline incision was then made, and the skull was carefully exposed. Meticulous adjustments were made to align the bregma and lambda reference points, as well as to ensure the leveling of the left and right sides. Following this preparation, craniotomies were then performed over the target brain regions, creating the necessary access for the subsequent procedure. Throughout the surgery, the animal’s body temperature is maintained between 37 and 38°C using a heating blanket (Homeothermic Blanket System, Harvard Apparatus, USA) to prevent hypothermia. All surgical tools are sterilized via autoclaving before the procedure to uphold strict hygiene standards. Post-surgery, animals used for chronic experiments are closely monitored until they fully regain consciousness. Following recovery, they are returned to the Laboratory Animal Research Unit of the university for regular care. To prevent postoperative infections, erythromycin ointment is applied to the wound daily for a minimum of 1 wk.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Brain microinjection of the AAVs or retrograde tracer</title><p>A pipette with a fine tip, loaded with AAV or retrograde tracer, is mounted on a Nanoliter 2000/Micro4 system (World Precision Instruments [WPI], Sarasota County, FL). To initiate the procedure, craniotomies of approximately 0.5–1 mm in diameter are performed over the targeted brain regions. The pipette is then carefully advanced to the target depth and held in place for 5 min to ensure stability before the infusion begins. The AAV or tracer is infused at a consistent rate of 25 nL/min, a standard speed for all injections to maintain precision. Following a 5 min infusion period, the pipette is gradually withdrawn, taking care to minimize potential damage to brain tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug infusion</title><p>For acute in vivo electrophysiological recordings, we utilized a 5 µL Hamilton syringe (#7105, Reno, NV) connected to a custom glass pipette via a flexible plastic tube (RWD Life Science #62329, Shenzhen, China). This assembly was operated by a syringe pump (KD Scientific #78-8210, Holliston, MA) to precisely infuse various drugs near the recording site in the AC. In chronic experiments, cannulas with an outer diameter of 0.41 mm (RWD Life Science #62004 and #62108, Shenzhen) were bilaterally implanted in the AC at specific coordinates: AP –2.9 mm, ML 0.35 mm medial to the juncture of the parietal and temporal skull bones, and DV –0.85 mm from the dura, on both the left and right sides. For bilateral drug infusion in the AC through these implanted cannulas, two 5 µL Hamilton syringes (#7105, Reno), connected to soft PE tubes (RWD Life Science #62329, Shenzhen) and corresponding injectors (RWD Life Science #62204, Shenzhen), were controlled by a dual syringe pump (KD Scientific #78-8210, Holliston) for the administration of different drugs. For drug infusion via the transverse sinus, we employed the same type of drug cannulas, implanting them directly above the sinus. The infusion system utilized for this process mirrored that used for bilateral infusion in the AC through implanted cannulas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Retrograde tracing</title><p>For retrograde tracing, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) with Alexa Fluor-488 conjugate (CTB488, 5 mg/mL, Fisher Scientific #C34775) was injected into the AC of rat (AP –3.5 mm [site 1], –4.5 mm [site 2], and –5.5 mm [site 3], ML 3.8 mm ventral to the edge differentiating the parietal and temporal skull, and DV –0.5 mm [depth 1] and –0.9 mm [depth 2], 50 nL for each of these six site-depth combinations).

Three weeks later, the mice were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (Dorminal 20%, Alfasan International B.V.) and transcardially perfused with 20 mL of warm (37°C) 0.9% saline, 20 mL of warm fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.4% picric acid, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS), and 20 mL of the same ice-cold fixative. Brains were dissected out and postfixed in the same fixative for 24 hr at 4°C. The tissues were then washed three times with PBS and cryoprotected in 10% (overnight [O/N] at 4°C), 20% (O/N at 4°C), and 30% (O/N at 4°C) sucrose in PBS. Tissues were embedded in OCT compound, sectioned at 20 µm, and mounted onto Superfrost plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For in situ hybridization (RNAscope), the manufacturer’s protocol was followed (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, San Francisco, CA). All experiments were replicated in three animals. The probes were designed by the manufacturer and available from Advanced Cell Diagnostics. The following probes were used in this study: Mm-Slc17a7- C2 (#416631-C2), Mm-Cck-C1 (#402271-C1), and Mm-Tomato-C4 (#317041-C4). All images were taken with the same settings on the same confocal microscope. The expression level of <italic>Cck</italic> in each animal was normalized against the mean <italic>Cck</italic> expression observed in the projecting neurons located within the VC. Neurons were categorized based on their <italic>Cck</italic> expression levels: those exhibiting <italic>Cck</italic> expression below the established average were defined as 'low <italic>Cck</italic>-expressing' neurons, whereas neurons with <italic>Cck</italic> expression surpassing this average value were classified as 'high <italic>Cck-</italic>expressing' neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>in vivo fEPSP recording with optogenetics</title><p>To avoid photoelectric artifacts, we employed glass pipette electrodes (~1 MΩ) to record the fEPSPs when stimulating the projecting terminals that expressed various opsins in different experimental setups. In all our experimental setups, we followed a structured three-phase approach: initially, a baseline recording was conducted to establish the initial activity levels responding to different stimuli. This was followed by the manipulation phase, where specific experimental interventions were applied. Finally, recordings were made post-manipulation to observe and document the effects of the interventions. During both the baseline and post-manipulation recording phases of our experiments, the intensity of the stimuli was consistently maintained at the same level to ensure comparability. Additionally, a fixed ITI of 15 s was established for identical stimuli, allowing for sufficient recovery and response consistency. When using two or three types of stimuli, we interleaved them, spacing each evenly within the 15 s trial period for balanced presentation. Different intervention protocols were described as follows.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Modified HFS protocol</title><p>We modified the HFS protocol and used four trials of 1 s laser pulse train (635 nm, the pulse width is 5 ms) at 80 Hz, each separated by a 10 se ITI, as illustrated in the upper part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. To activate the VC-to-AC projection, we injected AAV9-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato (4.1 E+12 vg/mL, UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC) in two locations (150 nL/each) of the VC of wildtype mice. The coordinates were as follows: AP –2.7 mm (site 1) and –3.3 mm (site 2), ML 1.7 mm, DV –0.5 mm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Pre/Post Pairing protocol</title><p>The Pre/Post Pairing protocol entailed laser stimulation (635 nm, with a pulse width of 5 ms) of the projection from the VC to the AC to induce presynaptic activation, paired with a noise stimulus for postsynaptic firing. Given that the latency for the fEPSP from VC-to-AC is typically around 2–2.5 ms, and the latency for noise-induced responses in the AC of mice is generally 13 ms or more, we timed the laser stimulus to occur 10 ms following the noise stimulus. This timing ensured that presynaptic input was activated just prior to the onset of postsynaptic firing. We repeated this pairing sequence across a total of 80 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>CCK (or ACSF) + Pre/Post Pairing protocol</title><p>Following the baseline recording, CCK-8S (10 ng/µL, 0.5 µL, 0.1 µL/min; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) or ACSF was infused into the AC.

This was then followed by 80 trials of presynaptic activation, achieved through laser stimulation of the projection from the VC-to-AC; and (iii) CCK +Post: after the baseline recording and infusion of CCK-8S into the AC, the procedure was followed by 80 trials of noise stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>HFS laser VC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing protocol</title><p>To activate the VC-to-AC projection, we injected AAV9-Ef1α-Flex-Chronos-GFP (3.7 E+12 vg/mL, UNC Vector Core) in the VC (the coordinates and volume of virus were the same as above described) of CaMKIIα-Cre mice.

The HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing process was carried out for a total of five trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-7"><title>HFS laser EC-to-AC alone, HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre, and HFS laser EC-to-AC + Post protocols</title><p>The protocols we employed were in line with the HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing protocol, with the following specific variations: (i) HFS laser EC-to-AC alone: after completing the baseline recording, we administered only the HFS laser targeting the EC-to-AC pathway. This was done without any subsequent Pre/Post Pairing and was carried out for a total of five trials. (ii) HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre: following the baseline recording, HFS laser stimulation was applied to the EC-to-AC pathway. Then, 10 ms after the completion of the HFS, laser stimulation of the VC-to-AC projection was carried out, but without the accompanying noise stimulus. The process was carried out for a total of five trials. (iii) HFS laser EC-to-AC+Post: post-baseline recording, we applied HFS laser to the EC-to-AC pathway. Subsequently, 10 ms following the termination of the HFS, a noise stimulus was introduced, but without the presynaptic activation of the VC-to-AC projection. The process was carried out for a total of five trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-8"><title>Different variations of the HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing protocol</title><p>To investigate how varying parameters in this protocol influenced the potentiation of inputs from the VC to the AC, we focused on three specific variables: the frequency of HFS laser (referred to as ‘frequency’ with a default value of 80 Hz), the interval between the cessation of HFS laser stimulation and the onset of the Pre/Post Pairing (termed ‘Delay 1’ with a default value of 10 ms), and the time gap between presynaptic and postsynaptic activations (named ‘Delay 2’ with a default value of 0 ms). When adjusting any one of these variables, the other two were maintained at their respective default settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-9"><title>L-365,260 (or ACSF) + HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing protocol</title><p>Following the baseline recording, L-365,260 (10 µg/mL, 0.5 µL, and 0.1 µL/min, Tocris Bioscience) or ACSF was infused into the AC. This was then followed by five trials of HFS laser EC-to-AC + Pre/Post Pairing as described above. After that, we transitioned into the post-pairing recording phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-10"><title>High-Intensity Noise + Pre/Post Pairing protocol</title><p>In the High-Intensity Noise + Pre/Post Pairing protocol, we administered a 90 dB SPL noise stimulus and then waited for 10 ms prior to initiating the Pre/Post Pairing as above described. The presynaptic activation of the VC-to-AC projection was triggered using 635 nm laser stimulation (with a pulse width of 5 ms). Concurrently, the postsynaptic firing was evoked by the noise stimulus. This High-Intensity Noise + Pre/Post Pairing sequence was repeated for a total of five trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optimizing laser intensity for pathway-specific activation</title><p>To determine the optimal laser intensity for activating two distinct pathways, we conducted experiments on <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Ires-Cre</sup> mice. In one set of experiments, we injected AAV9-Ef1α-Flex-Chronos-GFP into the EC, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. For another set, AAV9-Syn-ChrimsonR-tdTomato was injected into the VC, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>. In both sets, we stimulated the terminals in the AC using 473 nm and 635 nm lasers at various intensity levels. In the EC-injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right), we observed that the fEPSP slopes progressively increased with the intensity of the 473 nm laser, reaching saturation at 30 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (indicated by a green solid line). However, the 635 nm laser did not evoke any responses, even at an intensity as high as 40 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (represented by a red dashed line). On the other hand, in VC-injected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, right), the fEPSP slopes increased and saturated with the 635 nm laser (red solid line). Interestingly, at 40 mW (green dashed line), the 473 nm laser could induce fEPSPs, but these responses were relatively small. Therefore, to minimize the likelihood of cross-activation between the two pathways, we carefully controlled the fiber end intensities of the 473 nm and 635 nm lasers, keeping them below 30 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 40 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Brain slice preparation and patch-clamp recordings</title><p>At least 4 wk after virus injection, acute brain slices were prepared using a protective cutting and recovery method to achieve a higher success rate for patch clamp. Briefly, anesthetized mice received transcardial perfusion with NMDG-aCSF (92 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM thiourea, 5 mM Na-ascorbate, 3 mM Na-pyruvate, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O, and 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O; pH 7.3–7.4), and the brain was gently extracted from the skull and then cut into 300-μm-thick sections. Slices were submerged in NMDG-aCSF for 5–10 min at 32–34°C to allow protective recovery and then incubated at room temperature ACSF (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 12.5 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>·4H<sub>2</sub>O, and 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O, ~25°C) for at least 1 hr before transferring into recording chamber. All solutions were oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 30 min in advance.</p><p>Whole-cell recordings were made from pyramidal neurons at the AC at room temperature. The signals were amplified with Multiclamp 700B amplifier, digitized with Digital 1440A digitizer, and acquired at 20 kHz using Clampex 10.3 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Patch pipettes with a resistance between 3 and 5 MΩ were pulled from borosilicate glass (WPI) with a Sutter-87 puller (Sutter). The intracellular solution contained 145 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na2-GTP, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.3; 290–300 mOsm. The pipette was back-filled with internal solution containing 145 mM K-gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na2-GTP, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; pH 7.3; 290–300 mOsm.</p><p>Pyramidal neurons were identified based on their characteristic pyramidal-like morphology and a regular spiking firing pattern, determined by injecting a range of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing currents in 50 pA steps for 1 s each. An ES electrode was positioned approximately 200 μm from the recording neuron, and laser stimulations were administered via an optic fiber. Only those neurons responsive to both laser and ES were selected for subsequent experiments. In the voltage-clamp recording mode, with a holding potential of –70 mV, we recorded EPSCs elicited by both electrical (0.05 Hz, 0.5 ms) and laser (0.05 Hz, 5 ms) stimulations for a duration of 10 min. This was followed by HFS using a laser (80 Hz, five pulses, 5 ms pulse width) targeting either CCK<sup>+</sup> EC terminals (using 473 nm laser) or VC terminals (using 635 nm laser). After 10 ms, we paired presynaptic activation, induced by laser stimulation of the VC-to-AC projection, with postsynaptic activation triggered by ES of the AC. This pairing protocol was repeated five times at 10 s intervals. Subsequently, EPSCs induced by both electrical and laser stimulation were recorded for an additional 30 min. Throughout the recording, –5 mV hyperpolarizing pulses of 10 ms duration were applied every 20 s to monitor the access resistance (Ra). Recordings were terminated if Ra varied by more than 20%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Endogenous CCK release detection with fiber photometry</title><p>We administered an injection of AAV-Syn-DIO-ChrimsonR-mCherry (5.0 E+12 vg/mL, BrainVTA, Wuhan, China) into the EC (AP –4.2 mm, ML 3.5 mm, and DV –3.0 mm, 300 nL) of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Ires-Cre</sup> mice. Concurrently, AAV-Syn-Cck2.3 (5.2 E+12 vg/mL, BrainVTA) was injected into the AC of these mice. Following the virus injections, fiber optic cannulas (200 µm, 0.37 N/A, Inper, Hangzhou, China) were implanted in both the EC and AC, 10 min after virus injection. The tip of each cannula was positioned 100 µm above the site of virus infusion to ensure optimal light delivery. After a 3-week period, allowing for sufficient expression of the injected vectors, we proceeded to record the CCK dynamics (excitation light: 465 nm) and the isosbestic signal (excitation light: 405 nm) in the AC when activating the CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the EC with HFS laser stimulation (635 nm laser at 50 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Visuo-auditory association task</title><p>VS lasting 5 s and AS lasting 3 s were initially paired and presented to mice. Each pair of stimuli was separated by a brief interval of 0.5 s. This pairing was repeated for 25 trials in each session, with an ITI of 30 s. Mice underwent four such sessions daily over a period of 3 d. On the fourth day, we conducted a baseline assessment, measuring the percentage of freezing behavior over a 10 s period following the separate presentations of VS and AS. Subsequently, the AS was paired with foot shocks, administered over three trials, to condition the mice. On the fifth day, post-conditioning tests were performed, evaluating freezing responses to both VS and AS independently. To assess the roles of different pathways and CCK in our experimental task, we conducted specific manipulations at various phases, as follows. (1) Inactivation of CCK<sup>+</sup> EC-to-AC projection during the encoding phase: In <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Ires-Cre</sup> mice, we bilaterally injected AAV9-Syn-DIO-hM4Di-EYFP (300 nL, 5.70E+12 vg/mL, BrainVTA) or AAV9-EF1a-DIO-EYFP (300 nL, 5.24E+12 vg/mL, BrainVTA) into the EC (using the same coordinates as above), followed by bilateral implantation of drug cannulas in the AC. Three weeks later, behavioral tasks commenced. During the encoding phase, we inactivated the CCK<sup>+</sup> EC-to-AC projection by bilaterally infusing CNO (3 µM, Sigma-Aldrich #C0832, Darmstadt, Germany) into the AC before each day’s VS and AS pairing for the first three days. (2) Inactivation of VC-to-AC projection during the encoding phase inactivation of VC-to-AC projection during the encoding phase: We bilaterally injected either AAV9-Syn-hM4Di-EGFP (4.5 E+12 vg/mL, Taitool BioScience, Shanghai, China) or AAV9-Syn-EGFP (1.42 E+13 vg/mL with a twofold dilution, Taitool BioScience) into the VC (the coordinates and volume of virus were the same as above described) of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Ires-Cre</sup> mice. After 3 wk, behavioral tasks began. To inactivate the VC-to-AC projection during encoding, CNO (3 µM) was infused into the AC prior to the VS and AS pairing on the first three days. (3) Inactivation of CCK<sup>+</sup> EC-to-AC projection the during retrieval phase: Using a similar method as in step 1, we inactivated the CCK<sup>+</sup> EC-to-AC projection during the retrieval phase. CNO (3 µM) was infused into the AC before the freezing response tests to VS and AS on day 5. (4) Inactivation of VC-to-AC projection during the retrieval phase: Following the procedure in step 2, we inactivated the VC-to-AC projection during the retrieval phase. CNO (3 µM) was infused into the AC before day 5’s freezing response tests to VS and AS. (5) Blockade of CCK signaling during the encoding phase in wildtype mice: Drug cannulas were bilaterally implanted in the AC of wildtype mice. After a 5-day recovery period, behavioral experiments commenced. To inhibit the CCK signaling pathway, L-365,260 (10 µg/mL, 0.5 µL at 0.1 µL/min, Tocris Bioscience) or ACSF was bilaterally infused into the AC before the pairing of visual and auditory stimuli (VS and AS) on the first three days. (6) Activation of CCK signaling in <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice during the encoding phase: In <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, a drug infusion cannula was implanted atop the venous sinus (transverse sinus) to facilitate intravenous (i.v.) drug administration. Before the VS and AS pairing on the first three days, we injected either CCK-4 (0.01 mL, 3.4 µM) or saline (0.01 mL) through the implanted cannulas to activate the CCK signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histology</title><p>Animals were anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and subsequently perfused transcardially with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS (4% PFA). The brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hr. Brain tissues were sectioned at 60 µm thickness using a vibratome (Leica VT1000 S, Wetzlar, Germany). Nissl staining (Neurotrace 640, 1:200 in 0.01 M PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 hr, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was conducted to indicate the neurons. Imaging was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E upright fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan) or a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope (Oberkochen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Acoustic stimuli, visual stimuli, electrical stimulation, and laser stimulation</title><p>In our experiments, all stimuli were generated using RZ6 and RZ5D processing stations (Tucker-Davis Technologies [TDT], FL) with control facilitated by Synapse software from the TDT Synapse suite. The acoustic stimuli, created as analog signals, were transmitted through a free-field magnetic speaker (MF-1, TDT). We calibrated the sound pressure level of these acoustic stimuli using a condenser microphone (Center Technology, Taipei). Visual stimuli, also in the form of analog signals, were presented via a white LED array. The ESs aimed at activating the AC were generated by the TDT system and administered through a low-impedance stimulation electrode, coupled with an isolator (ISO-Flex, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel). For laser stimulation, we utilized a laser generator (Inper, #B1465635), which was activated by signals sent from the Synapse-controlled RZ5D processor. The laser light was then directed to the specific target areas via a fiber patch cable (200 µm, 0.37 NA, Inper). Throughout these procedures, all events were captured and recorded by the TDT system, ensuring accurate documentation and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification of the electrophysiological data</title><p>The fEPSP slope (in vivo) and EPSC amplitude (ex vivo) were used to compare the response level before and after different manipulation protocols. To calculate the fEPSP slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper), we initially identified the most linear segment (marked by a starting point t1 and an end point t2, typically ranging from 20% and 80% of the maximum amplitude) within the descending phase of the fEPSP. We then conducted a linear regression analysis using the data from this specific segment (spanning from t2 to t1). The absolute value of the slope of the resultant regression line was thus determined to be the slope of the fEPSP. For comparative analyses, baseline values of fEPSP slopes or EPSC amplitudes were first averaged. Subsequent values were then normalized against this baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (IBM, USA).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In this manuscript, He and colleagues demonstrate the role of cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive neurons in the entorhino-auditory projection and the peptide CCK itself in the plasticity of visuo-auditory (VC-AC) association. Using a series of in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology recordings the authors provide evidence that high-frequency stimulation of the CCK-positive neurons paired with an auditory stimulus can evoke long-term potentiation (LTP) of the visuo-auditory projection and temporal parameters of the plasticity were systematically explored. The observed plasticity also has behavioral relevance. The reviewers agree upon the significance and broad impact of the current work but also raised a substantial issue with control experiments summarized below:</p><p>1. Address whether CCK alone or CCK in a particular context would be sufficient for potentiation. This includes control experiments requested by Reviewer #1, points 1-4, and general comments by Reviewer #2.</p><p>2. The manuscript will need significant improvement in scientific communication to have better readability, method and figure description, and accuracy as suggested and detailed by both Reviewers.</p><p>3. Please provide a key resource table if you have not already.</p><p>4. Comment on the limitation of the exclusion of females from the behavioral study may benefit the manuscript.</p><p>With your revision, please provide a point x point response to each reviewer comment from both the public review and recommendations for authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. To remove the ambiguity raised in the first comment in public review, in figure 1G the synaptic strength after the application of CCK but before pairing VALS and noise should be used as the baseline; in Figures 2E, 3G, control conditions of HFLSEA alone, HFLSEA+ VALS (Suppl. Figure 2D), and HFLSEA+noise/electrical stimulation should be added.</p><p>2. To deal with the issue raised in the third comment, the CCK receptor blocker can be added to the experiments in Figure 2E and 3G to see if the plasticity will be affected.</p><p>3. For comment 4, to examine the contribution of VC-AC and EC-AC projections in this visuo-auditory memory task (Figure 6), the authors can try disrupting the EC-AC or VC-AC projections during visuoauditory pairing and disrupting VC-AC projection during the final test.</p><p>4. The introduction was poorly written and hard to follow. The rationale, objective, and significance of the study were not well elaborated. I would like to recommend the authors refine it.</p><p>5. I couldn't find how the slope of fEPSP is calculated. Please illustrate it in Figure 1C.</p><p>6. In Figure 4A, the area highlighted by the box is mostly higher visual areas. The primary visual cortex is more lateral to it and ignored. Is there any reason behind this selection? For example, are retrogradely labeled neurons denser in higher visual areas than the primary visual area? Please quantify the density of retrogradely labeled neurons across areas and layers.</p><p>7. How are the axons coming from VC or EC distributed across layers? Related to the anatomy, from which layers were the recordings done? Does the plasticity of VC-AC projection measured by fEPSP (Figure 1,2) or EPSC (Figure 3) depend on layers? Please add details in the figures and text.</p><p>8.

Using a series of in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology recordings the authors provide evidence that high-frequency stimulation of the CCK-positive neurons paired with an auditory stimulus can evoke long-term potentiation (LTP) of the visuo-auditory projection and temporal parameters of the plasticity were systematically explored. The observed plasticity also has behavioral relevance. The reviewers agree upon the significance and broad impact of the current work but also raised a substantial issue with control experiments summarized below:</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the reviewers’ constructive comments, which are very helpful for us to improve our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Comment on the limitation of the exclusion of females from the behavioral study may benefit the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the limitation arising from the exclusion of female subjects in our behavioral study. We understand that including both genders could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the visuo-auditory association and its neural underpinnings. This aspect will be considered in future research to ensure a more inclusive and representative analysis. We included a discussion of this limitation in our manuscript to provide a complete perspective on our study's scope and implications as follow.</p><p>“Gender limitation. In the behavioral part of our study, we focused exclusively on male subjects, which presents a notable limitation. Gender differences in brain function and response to stimuli are well-documented, suggesting that our findings might not fully extend to female subjects. This exclusion may limit the generalizability of our results. Future research including both genders would be valuable to understand more comprehensively the neurobiological mechanisms involved in visuo-auditory associations. Acknowledging this limitation, our study paves the way for subsequent research to explore potential gender-specific variations and their implications.<bold>”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With your revision, please provide a point x point response to each reviewer comment from both the public review and recommendations for authors.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. To remove the ambiguity raised in the first comment in public review, in figure 1G the synaptic strength after the application of CCK but before pairing VALS and noise should be used as the baseline; in Figures 2E, 3G, control conditions of HFLSEA alone, HFLSEA+ VALS (Suppl. Figure 2D), and HFLSEA+noise/electrical stimulation should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For comment 4, to examine the contribution of VC-AC and EC-AC projections in this visuo-auditory memory task (Figure 6), the authors can try disrupting the EC-AC or VC-AC projections during visuoauditory pairing and disrupting VC-AC projection during the final test.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to comment 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The introduction was poorly written and hard to follow. The rationale, objective, and significance of the study were not well elaborated.

Hope it is better now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I couldn't find how the slope of fEPSP is calculated. Please illustrate it in Figure 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1C, we have depicted the method for measuring the slope of the fEPSP. To calculate this slope, we initially identify the most linear segment (marked by a starting point t1 and an end point t2, typically ranging from 20% and 80% of the maximum amplitude) within the descending phase of the fEPSP. We then conduct a linear regression analysis using the data from this specific segment (spanning from t2 to t1). The slope of the resultant regression line is thus determined to be the slope of the fEPSP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 4A, the area highlighted by the box is mostly higher visual areas. The primary visual cortex is more lateral to it and ignored. Is there any reason behind this selection? For example, are retrogradely labeled neurons denser in higher visual areas than the primary visual area? Please quantify the density of retrogradely labeled neurons across areas and layers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. In response, we have quantified the density of retrogradely labeled neurons across different areas and layers, as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. Our findings reveal a higher density of retrogradely labeled neurons in the higher order associative visual cortex (VC) compared to the primary VC. Notably, layer V emerged as the most predominant layer in terms of neuron density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How are the axons coming from VC or EC distributed across layers? Related to the anatomy, from which layers were the recordings done? Does the plasticity of VC-AC projection measured by fEPSP (Figure 1,2) or EPSC (Figure 3) depend on layers? Please add details in the figures and text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive comments and suggestions. The axons coming from VC and EC are distributed in both superficial and deep layers. We recorded across layer II/III to layer V (as indicated in Figure 1B). And we also added the following description in the main text: “The recording of fEPSPs was conducted across layers II/III to layer V within the auditory cortex (AC) (Figure 1B).”. The criterion for fEPSP recording is that the laser stimulation of VC-AC projection and EC-AC projection can both evoke responses in the recording site, as well as noise induced response. And the criteria of slice recording are (1) there are EPSCs of the patched cell to both laser stimulation of the VC-AC projection and electrical stimulation of AC; (2) in cases where no EPSC response was observed in the patched cell following laser stimulation of the EC-AC projection, it was crucial that other nearby cells within the same slice demonstrated EPSC responses to the stimulation.</p><p>Regarding the inquiry about whether the plasticity of the VC-to-AC projection is layer-dependent, our current dataset does not provide enough evidence for a definitive conclusion. However, this is an intriguing question and merits further investigation in future studies. We truly value this insightful suggestion and are appreciative of the opportunity to consider this aspect in our ongoing research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

This observed difference in fidelity compared to the findings in the Klapoetke et al., 2014 study could be attributed to the distinct experimental setups.

In response, we have incorporated a set of control experiments designed to evaluate whether AS yield the same effect as high-frequency laser stimulation of the visual cortex to auditory cortex. This involved presenting high-intensity noise (90dB) prior to the Pre/Post pairing, as documented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-G. Our findings suggest that such generalized high-intensity stimuli do not result in the potentiation of the VC-to-AC projection, nor do they enhance the noise response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– 2 E: It's not clear whether VALS is just a simple 5 sec stimulation; in which case it's surprising that HFLS of EC to AC alone can evoke LTP.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we didn’t make it clear.
