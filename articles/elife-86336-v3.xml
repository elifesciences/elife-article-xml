of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To identify metabolites whose trafficking is mediated by sleep-dependent endocytosis, we conducted metabolomic analysis of flies that have increased sleep due to a block in glial endocytosis. We report that acylcarnitines, fatty acids conjugated to carnitine to promote their transport, accumulate in heads of these animals. In parallel, to identify transporters and receptors whose loss contributes to the sleep phenotype caused by blocked endocytosis, we screened genes enriched in barrier glia for effects on sleep. We find that knockdown of lipid transporters <italic>LRP1</italic>&amp;2 or of carnitine transporters <italic>ORCT1</italic>&amp;2 increases sleep. In support of the idea that the block in endocytosis affects trafficking through specific transporters, knockdown of <italic>LRP</italic> or <italic>ORCT</italic> transporters also increases acylcarnitines in heads. We propose that lipid species, such as acylcarnitines, are trafficked through the BBB via sleep-dependent endocytosis, and their accumulation reflects an increased need for sleep.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>acylcarnitine</kwd><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK120757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolites, such as acylcarnitines, accumulate in <italic>Drosophila</italic> heads when endocytosis is blocked and reflects an increased need for sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the regulation of sleep is normally studied on a behavioral and circuit level, there is increasing evidence for a role of basic cellular physiology. For instance, we found that disruption of endocytic and trafficking pathways in glia increases sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artiushin et al., 2018</xref>). Glia of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood/hemolymph-brain barrier (BBB) emerged as a new cellular locus of sleep regulation in this study, such that genetically manipulating endocytosis in these cells alone was sufficient to increase sleep. As the increased sleep appeared to reflect higher sleep need, we asked if sleep enhances endocytosis through the BBB and found that this was indeed the case. However, the nature of the molecules trafficked through the BBB in a sleep-dependent manner was not known.</p><p>Barriers that separate the solutes of blood/hemolymph of the periphery from the interstitial fluid of the central nervous system display a rich profile of transporters, receptors, and trafficking proteins, which often reflect their unique functions. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> barrier glia populations share many conserved features with vertebrate barriers that employ endothelial and astrocytic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeSalvo et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Weiler et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, both are capable of moving lipids and carbohydrates, ions, amino acids, and xenobiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Weiler et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the fly barrier populations may serve specialized roles in metabolism, as not only the conduit of energy sources from the periphery, but also by containing the enzymatic machinery necessary for processing energy sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</xref>), and secreting signals in reference to nutritional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given that much of the traffic through the barrier involves energetic substrates, we conducted metabolomic profiling to identify candidate metabolites whose trafficking may be inhibited by an endocytosis block in glia. As genetic manipulations to block endocytosis can directly impact endocytosis-dependent carrier traffic as well as indirectly affect levels of membrane-associated transporters/receptors by altered recycling, we asked if specific glial proteins mediate effects of trafficking on sleep. Thus, we complemented the metabolomic approach with a knockdown screen to broadly search for barrier genes involved in sleep regulation. We report here that specific lipid and carnitine transporters act in barrier glia to affect sleep, and that disrupting expression of these transporters or of endocytosis leads to an accumulation of acylcarnitines in the head.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Blocking endocytosis in glia induces acylcarnitine accumulation in fly heads</title><p>Our previous work showed that expression of <italic>shibire (shi</italic>), a dominant negative dynamin that blocks endocytosis, in all or BBB glia increases sleep. To attain an unbiased, global assessment of metabolites that may be relevant to the increased sleep seen in <italic>Repo-GAL4&gt;20xShi.ts<sup>1</sup></italic> flies (hereafter referred to as <italic>Repo&gt;Shi<sup>1</sup></italic>), we conducted LC-MS analysis. Heads of male and female <italic>Repo&gt;Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> flies as well as <italic>GAL4</italic> and UAS controls were collected on dry ice with sieves and immediately frozen at –80°C. Each sample contained 200 fly heads (equal male and female), with five samples per genetic condition.</p><p>As an initial analysis, raw signal was scaled per each metabolite in reference to other samples within the dataset, and comparisons were made between Repo &gt;Shi flies and each control, as well as controls to each other by Welch’s t-test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Metabolites of interest were those for which signal from the experimental samples was significantly different, in the same direction, when compared to both controls, while controls compared to each were not significant. Of secondary interest were metabolites where a difference was seen in controls, but was proportionally smaller than consistent differences of each control to the experimental samples.</p><p>In surveying this dataset, the outstanding functional category, which contained multiple metabolites whose signal was consistently different in experimental animals versus controls, were the acylcarnitines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the fold changes for given metabolites in this group, which consists of fatty acids conjugated to carnitine, were the highest overall. Carnitinylation occurs on fatty acids of various chain lengths, but only a subset of chain lengths in this dataset had sufficient signal, therefore we statistically compared <italic>Repo&gt;Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> flies to each of the parental controls for metabolites that had signal in at least three of five biological replicates for each genotype. Expression of <italic>Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> in glia increased abundance in fly heads of the following acylcarnitine species: C2, C16, C16:1, C17, C18:1, C18:2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The only metabolite of this group with less signal in experimental animals was the longer chain, C24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Carnitine and deoxycarnitine were not significantly altered as compared to both controls.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Fatty acid acylcarnitine accumulation in Repo&gt;<italic>Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> fly heads.</title><p>Acylcarnitine species in <italic>Repo&gt;Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> relative to parental controls.

These acylcarnitine species are different from those enriched in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>); in particular, hydroxylated acylcarnitines are enriched in the body with a block in glial endocytosis. These data indicate that endocytosis block, which increases sleep need, also affects lipids in the body, but the nature of the lipids affected is different.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of barrier glia genes that affect sleep</title><p>In addition to identifying metabolites that accumulate as a result of blocked glial endocytosis, we sought to identify glial molecules whose function might be impacted by the block in endocytosis and thereby contribute to the effect on sleep. As noted above, glia of the BBB are the most relevant glial subtype for sleep-dependent endocytosis. We identified genes enriched in barrier glia by referring to transcriptional profiling that compared expression in the two glial populations that comprise the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BBB—subperineurial and perineurial glia (SPG+PG)— to all neurons, and all glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeSalvo et al., 2014</xref>). Preference was given to previously studied genes, particularly transporters, receptors, and those involved in trafficking, although many genes among the top 50 highly expressed in the barrier glia populations were also tested for effects on sleep. Of the genes enriched in barrier glia, we focused on those that showed low variability in expression from sample to sample. UAS-RNAi constructs for candidate genes were expressed with <italic>Repo-GAL4 or RepoGS</italic> drivers. Sleep in <italic>Repo-GAL4</italic> lines was compared with that in GAL4 and UAS alone controls, while sleep changes with <italic>RepoGS</italic> were determined by comparing flies maintained on RU486 with control flies tested without RU486. Knockdown of most genes did not produce a significant phenotype, but sleep was increased with knockdown of some transporter genes <italic>CG3036</italic>, <italic>CG6126</italic>, <italic>mnd, VMAT, CG6836, Rh50, CG4462</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), cytoskeleton/trafficking factors <italic>CG8036</italic>, <italic>Vha16, nuf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as well as <italic>lsd-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), <italic>acon,</italic> and <italic>MtnA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To investigate whether supplementing fly food with acylcarnitines could alter sleep, we fed flies each of three mixes of acylcarnitines of varying chain lengths, Mix 1 (A-141, Sigma), 2 (A-144, Sigma), and 3 (A-145, Sigma).

Using a dual-pronged approach of a targeted genetic screen and unbiased metabolomic analysis, we report here that the passage of lipids through the BBB is important for sleep. Blocking such transport increases sleep in conjunction with an accumulation of acylcarnitines.</p><p>Through a pan-glial RNAi knockdown screen of candidate genes expressed in the fly barrier, we identified molecules that affect daily sleep amount. In initial follow-up experiments, we targeted knockdown to each barrier layer separately, which is subject to the concern that behavioral phenotypes requiring simultaneous knockdown in both barrier populations would be missed. Nevertheless, we consider this scenario to be less probable, as permeability through the populations is quite different, with smaller solutes likely passing through the PG but not the tight barrier of the SPG, lipophilic solutes, or xenobiotics potentially passing through each uninhibited, and larger solute requiring endocytic mechanisms that likely have to work in each population in tandem. Therefore, in most cases of knockdown, transport would either be inhibited by the one barrier population essential for it or would be interrupted by either population. This was indeed the case for the <italic>VMAT</italic> isolated in the initial screen. The lipid and carnitine transporters we subsequently focused on also produced phenotypes through knockdown in a single barrier layer, although we also tested effects of knockdown in both layers. While there was redundancy at the level of the transporters, the two barrier layers did not compensate for each other.</p><p>An additional consideration of preliminarily screening with pan-glial drivers is that if knockdown in multiple glial subtypes has opposing effects on sleep, we may have obscured a role for the barrier cells. Again, we attempted to minimize this risk by primarily selecting genes whose expression is both highly abundant and specifically enriched in the barrier populations, as opposed to the transcriptome dataset of all glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeSalvo et al., 2014</xref>). The assumption is that multifold expression in the barrier populations is indicative of prevailing importance in these cells, although this is a caveat.</p><p>The vesicular monoamine transporter (<italic>VMAT</italic>) has previously been identified as a target of reserpine, which promotes sleep in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nall and Sehgal, 2013</xref>). <italic>VMAT</italic> mutants exhibit higher baseline sleep, and also lose less sleep than controls when subject to mechanical sleep deprivation. <italic>VMAT</italic> can traffic multiple monoamines such as dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and octopamine, but no single neuronal population or neurotransmitter system was implicated as responsible for the <italic>VMAT</italic> sleep phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nall and Sehgal, 2013</xref>). In flies, <italic>VMAT</italic> exists as two isoforms, <italic>VMAT-A</italic>, which is expressed in monoaminergic neurons, and <italic>VMAT-B</italic>, which appears to be specific to PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeSalvo et al., 2014</xref>), as it is also found in fenestrated glia in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Romero-Calderón et al., 2008</xref>), which are a specialized form of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kremer et al., 2017</xref>). It is unknown whether <italic>VMAT-B</italic> would function similarly in glia as <italic>VMAT-A</italic> does in neurons. <italic>VMAT-B</italic> contains an additional cytoplasmic domain, which has been suggested to promote retention in the plasma membrane as opposed to trafficking to vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greer et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>VMAT</italic> knockdown increased sleep, as did disrupting endocytic trafficking at the barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artiushin et al., 2018</xref>). Whole-brain levels of monoamines were not altered in flies that expressed <italic>Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> in glia, nevertheless it is possible that this gross analysis would not be sensitive to local changes at the barrier. In the visual system glia, <italic>VMAT-B</italic> may be necessary for uptake of histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Romero-Calderón et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, histamine is known to alter permeability of the BBB in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our metabolomic data indicated that acylcarnitines are elevated in the heads of the long-sleeping <italic>Repo&gt;Shi<sup>1</sup></italic> flies. Acylcarnitines are transported to mitochondria for fatty acid oxidation, but are also secreted as they are found in plasma in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schooneman et al., 2013</xref>). Given that circulating acylcarnitines can be taken up by cells, we investigated <italic>Lrp1</italic>/<italic>Megalin</italic> and <italic>Orct</italic>/<italic>Orct2</italic> as candidate transporters for this uptake. <italic>Lrp1</italic> and <italic>Megalin</italic> are lipoprotein carrier receptors known to function in the fly barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brankatschk et al., 2014</xref>) and although knockdown of each one separately in all glia did not affect sleep, reducing expression of both in all glia or barrier glia increased sleep. Likewise, knockdown of <italic>Orct</italic> and <italic>Orct2,</italic> which are homologs of the human carnitine transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eraly and Nigam, 2002</xref>) and transport carnitine as well as acylcarnitines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pochini et al., 2004</xref>), increases sleep. LC-MS analysis shows that knockdown of these transporters enriches acylcarnitines in fly heads just as blocking endocytosis does, supporting the idea that <italic>LRP</italic> and <italic>ORCT</italic> are among the proteins affected by the block in endocytosis. Exactly where the accumulation of acylcarnitines occurs is not known at this time, but we suggest that it is largely extracellular. In addition, given that heads contain brains as well as fat body, we acknowledge that the fat body may contribute to changes in acylcarnitines and other metabolites reported here. It is further possible that the differences in lipid species elevated in head as opposed to body samples may reflect the different outputs of the head and abdominal fat bodies, respectively.</p><p>Acylcarnitine accumulation in flies with blocked glial endocytosis or lipid transport could occur as a consequence of the high sleep in these animals. We believe this is unlikely as an increase in acylcarnitines appears to generally occur under conditions of sleep deprivation, that is conditions that would promote sleep. Carnitine conjugation of long chain fatty acids was reported in cortical metabolites of sleep-deprived mice, while short and medium chain fatty acids were reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinard et al., 2012</xref>). Changes in acylcarnitines were also noted in the peripheral blood of sleep-deprived or sleep-restricted humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Weljie et al., 2015</xref>) as well as over a day:night cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dallmann et al., 2012</xref>). We find too that a common feature of short-sleeping fly mutants, which are models for chronic sleep deprivation, is an increase in acylcarnitines, regardless of the mechanism that causes the sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedont et al., 2023</xref>). In the metabolomic analysis reported here, samples were collected at ZT 0–3, and so not after a period of sleep deprivation; however, all the manipulations (knockdown of <italic>Orct/Lrps</italic> or expression of <italic>Shi</italic>) increased sleep need, and so may be associated with high acylcarnitines at all times. Thus, acylcarnitines are generally associated with sleepiness rather than sleep. While this does not necessarily mean that they promote sleep, we show here that feeding flies low concentrations of medium and long chain acylcarnitines modestly increases sleep, although the fate of these acylcarnitines or where they act to affect sleep is not known. High concentrations have no effect, either due to some feedback mechanism or perhaps because high levels of the methanol solvent inhibit feeding. Regardless of their role in sleep regulation, we suggest that acylcarnitines are a key marker of sleep need across species, and could be exploited for this purpose. Sleep is likely required to reduce levels of acylcarnitines, perhaps as part of a broader role in metabolic homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The initial screen was performed with lab stock drivers:;;<italic>Repo-GAL4</italic>/TM6c, <italic>Sb</italic> and UAS-<italic>Dicer; Repo</italic>GeneSwitch.

For the sleep assay, ~7-day-old iso31 flies were housed individually in glass tubes containing acylcarnitine or methanol or methanol and aqueous formic acid control food in Percival incubators. As above, sleep was determined based upon activity recorded with the Trikinetics DAM system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trikinetics.com/">http://www.trikinetics.com/</ext-link>). All flies were maintained in a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle and behavior was monitored for 5 days, of which the last 3 were analyzed for sleep.

For the initial comparisons of metabolomic data, Metabolon performed Welch’s t-tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) on scaled signal data for each metabolite, to compare different conditions. Raw signal was scaled so that the median would be equal to 1, using all samples that had been concurrently run. Missing values were filled in with the lowest value of run samples for that metabolite. Additional details of statistics tests are listed in the figure legends. For the qPCR results, the experimental group was compared to control iso31 by Mann-Whitney T test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolomics of Repo&gt;20x<italic>Shibire</italic> fly heads.</title><p>All measured metabolites and their respective categories are listed for samples from <italic>Repo-GAL4</italic>&gt;UAS-20x<italic>Shibire</italic>, and both parental controls.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work cannot be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we would be willing to consider an extensively revised manuscript if you choose to address the reviewers' concerns and resubmit to <italic>eLife</italic> as a new submission.</p><p>Specifically, as you will see from the comments below, while all of the reviewers found the question and approach of this study to be very interesting, all felt that several additional experiments including routine controls and procedural enhancements as well as careful rewriting would be required. Particularly critical is to attempt experiments to establish causality of acylcarnitine build up and sleep regulation (e.g through acylcarnitine microinjection?). A subset of other issues raised in the reviewer discussions included the need for: (1) more complete description of used methods used; (2) description of all drivers as well as transgenic constructs used, with references as well as validation of driver expression via UAS-GFP if not previously described (primarily to more clearly implicate barrier glia as against other glial cells). (3) validation of RNAi efficacy via qRT (repo&gt;RNAi and head or brain mRNA levels); (4) ideally, key experiments to employ more than one RNAi transgene to ensure that effects are not due to off-target effects, while acknowledging that sometimes these genetics are difficult (e.g. with TRiP lines).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Artiushin et al. use a combination of metabolomics and behavioral genetics to detail the relationship between sleepiness and lipid transport in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In previous studies, the Sehgal lab found that disrupting endocytosis in glia of the fly blood-brain barrier is sufficient to increase sleep. Here, the authors sought to explore the mechanism(s) behind this phenomenon by measuring metabolites in the heads of Repo&gt;shi1 flies. LC-MS found elevations in a variety of acylcarnitines in the heads of long-sleeping Repo&gt;shi1 flies, then behavioral experiments found that RNAi-mediated knock-down of two lipid-transport related genes (Lrp1 and Megalin) or two carnitine transporters (Orct and Orct2) are sufficient to significantly increase sleep time. Finally, LC-MS measurements in each long-sleeping RNAi-knock down genotype (Repo&gt;Lrp1RNAi, MegalinRNAi and Repo&gt;OrctRNAi, Orct2RNAi) also showed increased levels of acylcarnitine species. Together, these studies nicely parallel findings of heightened acylcarnitine levels in the blood of sleep-deprived humans, indicating that the fly provides a tractable model for understanding the mechanistic link between fatty acid metabolism and sleep.</p><p>While the authors' interpretations are consistent with their findings, the addition of a few key experiments, new analyses of behavioral data, and text edits could strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Main comments:</p><p>The authors find sleep effects of manipulating fatty acid transport-related pathways in BBB glia, but it is not clear to me whether the acylcarnitines are moving into the brain or out of it. These possibilities each indicate different (and interesting) possibilities for sleep regulation and/or function. Along similar lines, the authors could test whether acylcarnitine levels are increased in the bodies of sleep deprived flies – this finding might help to distinguish whether these are sleep-promoting signals generated in the periphery or a metabolite that needs to be cleared from the brain.</p><p>If the sample material for LC-MS experiments came from whole heads, then it is possible that the head fat bodies contributed to the fatty acid changes shown in Figures 1, 5 &amp; 6. The authors should mention and discuss this possibility in the manuscript.</p><p>Do the sleep changes in Figures2-4 alter sleep during the day or night (or both)? Do these RNAis alter sleep architecture or waking locomotor activity?</p><p>The authors use Gal80TS to restrict the timing of Mgl/Lrp1 RNAi (Figure 3B-C) and Orct/Orct2 RNAi (Figure 4B-C). A clearer description of the temperature protocols should be included. Do the 18°C and 31°C represent different groups of flies that were tested in parallel? Or do they show the same flies before and after a temperature increase? In addition, the flies housed at 18°C (when RNAi expression should be blocked) show similar behavioral phenotypes as the 31°C condition and as flies expressing the same RNAis without Gal80TS (see panels 3A &amp; 4A, respectively). These data indicate either that the Gal80 repressor is not effectively blocking RNAi expression or that the sleep effects observed here cannot be solely attributed to the RNAi knock-downs.</p><p>Does supplementing fly food with acylcarnitines alter sleep? If so, are flies expressing Mgl/Lrp RNAi or Orct/Orct2 RNAi in perineural glia sensitized to dietary acylcarnitines?</p><p>Do all error bars indicate SEM as listed in the legends? Several of the behavioral plots appear to show overlapping error bars across comparisons that are designated as statistically significant. See Figures 3B, 3C, 4B, 4C and Figure 3 – —figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here, Artiushin et al. perform metabolomics on the heads transgenic mutants that exhibit long sleep due to inhibition of glial endocytosis (via repo driving shibire) compared to genetic controls. They identified multiple changes in metabolites; the most consistent and significant change was increased acylcarnitine levels. The authors performed a candidate screen by driving RNAi-mediated inhibition of 50 glia-enriched genes with pan-glial or sub-glial expression drivers. Knockdown of lipid transporter proteins in barrier glia led to increased acylcarnitines and increased sleep, suggesting that increased acylcarnitine levels may increase sleep. Previous results had shown that barrier glia and endocytosis were involved in sleep regulation; these data support the hypothesis that lipid metabolites, transported by barrier glia into the brain, mediate sleep regulation. Specifically, they point to the hypothesis that increased acylcarnitine levels in the brain are correlated with induction of sleep.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported but some specific aspects need to be clarified or tested.</p><p>1) The n are low for several behavioral experiments and the number of trials is not clear for any experiments. Sleep and behavior are notoriously inconsistent from trial to trial. Experiments should be repeated with 16-32 flies per trial with 3 trials per experiment to demonstrate robustness of results.</p><p>2) As negative controls for subglial drivers that drive RNAi expression and affect sleep behavior, the authors should also test a non-barrier sub-glial expression driver such as eye glial drivers for effects on sleep behavior.</p><p>3) Are there other methods of increasing acylcarnitine levels in the body or brain that will increase sleep?</p><p>4) What are acylcarnitine levels for short-sleeping mutants?</p><p>This reviewer appreciates all the data and statistics listed for metabolomics. These data will be invaluable for other researchers in the field. Nevertheless, the precise n and trial number for each experiment should be listed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is a follow up to a previous publication from the group that linked blood-brain-barrier function to sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In this new report, they document changes in metabolites that occurs when the fly BBB is disrupted, with acylcarnitines accumulating in particular. Finally, using RNAi, they show that disruption of candidate transporters in the BBB alter sleep.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript provides promising data with the potential to be very interesting; however, the current version of this manuscript is hastily assembled. For example, the introduction refers somewhat vaguely to this group's previous paper, of which the current work is an extension, without really giving the reader much context of the state of the field. Although familiar with that previous paper, I had to refer back to it at several points when reading the current document to make full sense of the current manuscript. Particularly poor are the documentation of the methods; an expert in the field would not be able to replicate the findings based on the methods. For just one example-unless I am mistaken (and I misread Flybase), the Shi.ts1 manipulation used to impair the BBB is a temperature sensitive allele, yet there is no mention of samples being placed in restrictive or permissive temperatures. They do an RNAi screen in the middle of this paper, but that screen and its methods are not described. Not even all the fly stocks that appear to be used in the manuscript appear listed in the Methods.</p><p>More complete documentation of the experiments being performed would make it easier to properly evaluate the figures and conclusions.</p><p>The paper needs a major rewrite of the methods. Other areas that need to be addressed:</p><p>In Table 1 (and Figure 1), many of the metabolites labelled as interesting appear to be upregulated to quite a degree when comparing the two control strains, which makes it hard to judge whether these metabolic changes are meaningful or not. They appear to use a t-test for each metabolite, which further confounds the interpretation-some kind of false discovery rate correction should be applied to such large lists of comparisons.</p><p>On a related note, the manuscript could do a better job of guiding the reader to how the genetic manipulations are linked to the metabolite profile deemed important/different in the first figures. For example, comparing the results from Figure 5 and 6, it would appear that only C16 and C16.1 are showing differences that are found in Figure 1, but I could only find this upon careful examination myself when the authors should really do a better job to help us make sense of this data. Similarly, Figure 2's results don't seem in any way connected to the metabolite profiles, so I cannot understand why this data is included here.</p><p>Other aspects that I found difficult to assess:</p><p>– The RNAi screen, were more than one RNAi aimed at the same gene to confirm the effects?</p><p>– The raw values for metabolites are labelled as &quot;area under the curve&quot; in Figure 1 (unclear what that means) and plotted as μM in Figure 5.</p><p>– The n's for each experiment appear to be 13-16 per genotype. That sounds like a single tracking experiment to me. Were any of these experiments done as independent biological replicates (i.e. repeated on separate days?)</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Modulation of sleep by trafficking of lipids through the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood brain barrier&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor requests you to consider responding appropriately to the remaining minor queries and comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Does Figure 1 represent data from the same experiments described in Table 1? It's not clear to me whether Figure 1 shows more detail from the same data points or represents additional replicates. Also, the legend for Figure 1 describes the use of T-tests for significance – these should be analyzed using ANOVA instead with post hoc comparisons for the significance of each fatty acid.</p><p>2. The authors list the contents of each acylcarnitine type that is contained within the mixtures that are fed to flies, but a clearer discussion in the text that compares these lists with the lipids that were significantly changed in figure 1 might help the reader.</p><p>3. Is sleep architecture changed in flies that sleep more with acylcarnitine feeding?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed all of my concerns from the first version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors did great work in addressing the majority of prior reviewer comments, specifically by clarifying their Materials and methods and adding supplementary experiments that increase confidence in their findings. The authors find that many different types of gene manipulations in the blood-brain barrier are associated with both long sleep and high acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain; the number of these experiments strongly supports a relationship between these three events. Precisely how these different gene manipulations in the BBB lead to acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain and how/where/why acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain might cause long sleep (as opposed to resulting from long sleep) remain unclear. Thus, while the authors present sufficient and exciting evidence that sleep, BBB function, and acylcarnitines are related, due to the lack of a cohesive model or mechanism, the authors are right to be cautious in making more specific claims about the causal nature of these relationships.</p><p>This manuscript was clearer and more well-written than the previous version. This reviewer did not go through with a fine-tooth comb to examine whether claims of causality were overstated; the authors should do this.</p><p>I include here a few points that could be mentioned in the discussion, results, or methods sections as caveats or clarifying points:</p><p>– Is there any evidence in the literature that acylcarnitines are removed from the brain via the BBB, as would be suggested by acylcarnitine accumulation after the loss of endocytosis or transporter function in BBB? Is this the authors' hypothesis?</p><p>– The feeding experiments, though the effects were mild, go one step toward addressing the role of acylcarnitines in triggering sleep except that it's not clear if eating acylcarnitines leads to acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain or if this is a separate effect.</p><p>– Another detail that the authors could add: the time of day of collection for metabolomics experiments. The authors might comment in the discussion on how this timing might relate to the mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86336.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Previous figures actually plotted SD in some cases, but we have now fixed this so error bars show SEM, as indicated in the legends of the revised MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here, Artiushin et al. perform metabolomics on the heads transgenic mutants that exhibit long sleep due to inhibition of glial endocytosis (via repo driving shibire) compared to genetic controls. They identified multiple changes in metabolites; the most consistent and significant change was increased acylcarnitine levels. The authors performed a candidate screen by driving RNAi-mediated inhibition of 50 glia-enriched genes with pan-glial or sub-glial expression drivers. Knockdown of lipid transporter proteins in barrier glia led to increased acylcarnitines and increased sleep, suggesting that increased acylcarnitine levels may increase sleep. Previous results had shown that barrier glia and endocytosis were involved in sleep regulation; these data support the hypothesis that lipid metabolites, transported by barrier glia into the brain, mediate sleep regulation. Specifically, they point to the hypothesis that increased acylcarnitine levels in the brain are correlated with induction of sleep.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported but some specific aspects need to be clarified or tested.</p><p>1) The n are low for several behavioral experiments and the number of trials is not clear for any experiments. Sleep and behavior are notoriously inconsistent from trial to trial. Experiments should be repeated with 16-32 flies per trial with 3 trials per experiment to demonstrate robustness of results.</p></disp-quote><p>All the experiments have been repeated at least 3 times and additional numbers have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As negative controls for subglial drivers that drive RNAi expression and affect sleep behavior, the authors should also test a non-barrier sub-glial expression driver such as eye glial drivers for effects on sleep behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we used non-barrier glial drivers <italic>MZ0709-GAL4, NP2222-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Eaat-GAL4</italic> with tubgal80ts to express <italic>Lrps</italic> or <italic>Orcts</italic> RNAi in ensheathing glia, cortex glia and astrocyte-like glia respectively. None of these affected sleep (Figure 3—figure supplement 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Are there other methods of increasing acylcarnitine levels in the body or brain that will increase sleep?</p></disp-quote><p>We used acylcarnitines as a food supplement for <italic>iso31</italic> and report increases in sleep with some of them (Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 2).

These data will be invaluable for other researchers in the field.

In this new report, they document changes in metabolites that occurs when the fly BBB is disrupted, with acylcarnitines accumulating in particular. Finally, using RNAi, they show that disruption of candidate transporters in the BBB alter sleep.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript provides promising data with the potential to be very interesting; however, the current version of this manuscript is hastily assembled. For example, the introduction refers somewhat vaguely to this group's previous paper, of which the current work is an extension, without really giving the reader much context of the state of the field. Although familiar with that previous paper, I had to refer back to it at several points when reading the current document to make full sense of the current manuscript. Particularly poor are the documentation of the methods; an expert in the field would not be able to replicate the findings based on the methods. For just one example-unless I am mistaken (and I misread Flybase), the Shi.ts1 manipulation used to impair the BBB is a temperature sensitive allele, yet there is no mention of samples being placed in restrictive or permissive temperatures. They do an RNAi screen in the middle of this paper, but that screen and its methods are not described. Not even all the fly stocks that appear to be used in the manuscript appear listed in the Methods.</p><p>More complete documentation of the experiments being performed would make it easier to properly evaluate the figures and conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omissions. As noted, we have conducted additional experiments and also extensively re-written the manuscript to address these concerns. In particular, we now indicate that we maintained <italic>shibire</italic> flies for metabolomics at 30℃, even though sleep phenotypes are evident at permissive temperatures also (Artiushin et al., 2018) and we include details of the screen as well as a list of fly stocks in Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper needs a major rewrite of the methods. Other areas that need to be addressed:</p></disp-quote><p>The methods section has been rewritten in the revised MS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Table 1 (and Figure 1), many of the metabolites labelled as interesting appear to be upregulated to quite a degree when comparing the two control strains, which makes it hard to judge whether these metabolic changes are meaningful or not. They appear to use a t-test for each metabolite, which further confounds the interpretation-some kind of false discovery rate correction should be applied to such large lists of comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>Short, medium, long and very long chain acylcarninites are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. We have used one-way ANOVA with Holk-Sidak post-hoc comparisons to compare these in experimental and control groups in the revised manuscript (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, the manuscript could do a better job of guiding the reader to how the genetic manipulations are linked to the metabolite profile deemed important/different in the first figures. For example, comparing the results from Figure 5 and 6, it would appear that only C16 and C16.1 are showing differences that are found in Figure 1, but I could only find this upon careful examination myself when the authors should really do a better job to help us make sense of this data. Similarly, Figure 2's results don't seem in any way connected to the metabolite profiles, so I cannot understand why this data is included here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight, and have added comparison of Figure 5-6 data to Figure 1. Regarding Figure 2, we acknowledge that these data are not connected to metabolite profiles, but they were important findings of our transporter screen and we feel they should be reported. If the reviewer feels these data should be in the supplement, we can move them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other aspects that I found difficult to assess:</p><p>– The RNAi screen, were more than one RNAi aimed at the same gene to confirm the effects?</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript reports the use of multiple RNAis for Lrp1/Mgl and Orct/Orct2. We have now also checked the knockdown efficiency of RNAi lines by qPCR (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The raw values for metabolites are labelled as &quot;area under the curve&quot; in Figure 1 (unclear what that means) and plotted as μM in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>The metabolite data were from two different facilities (Metabolon and The Penn Metabolomics Core). They used different methods, ’area under the curve’ by Metabolon and μM by the Penn Metabolomics Core to show raw values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The n's for each experiment appear to be 13-16 per genotype. That sounds like a single tracking experiment to me.

The sleep data are from at least 3 independent trials and about 48 flies per genotype.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Does Figure 1 represent data from the same experiments described in Table 1? It's not clear to me whether Figure 1 shows more detail from the same data points or represents additional replicates. Also, the legend for Figure 1 describes the use of T-tests for significance – these should be analyzed using ANOVA instead with post hoc comparisons for the significance of each fatty acid.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Figure 1 represents data from the same experiments described in Table 1. We did indeed use one-way ANOVA with Holk-Sidak post-hoc comparisons, and not T-tests, for significance in figure 1. Table 1 compares the experimental to each of the parental controls separately and so uses a T-test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors list the contents of each acylcarnitine type that is contained within the mixtures that are fed to flies, but a clearer discussion in the text that compares these lists with the lipids that were significantly changed in figure 1 might help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a comparison of acylcarnitine mixtures (from Σ) and the ones that are significantly changed in figure1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The authors find that many different types of gene manipulations in the blood-brain barrier are associated with both long sleep and high acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain; the number of these experiments strongly supports a relationship between these three events. Precisely how these different gene manipulations in the BBB lead to acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain and how/where/why acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain might cause long sleep (as opposed to resulting from long sleep) remain unclear. Thus, while the authors present sufficient and exciting evidence that sleep, BBB function, and acylcarnitines are related, due to the lack of a cohesive model or mechanism, the authors are right to be cautious in making more specific claims about the causal nature of these relationships.</p><p>This manuscript was clearer and more well-written than the previous version. This reviewer did not go through with a fine-tooth comb to examine whether claims of causality were overstated; the authors should do this.</p><p>I include here a few points that could be mentioned in the discussion, results, or methods sections as caveats or clarifying points:</p><p>– Is there any evidence in the literature that acylcarnitines are removed from the brain via the BBB, as would be suggested by acylcarnitine accumulation after the loss of endocytosis or transporter function in BBB? Is this the authors' hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We were not able to find anything in the literature that says acylcarnitines are removed from the brain via the BBB. It is possible that this uptake is specific for glial cells (<italic>Drosophila</italic> BBB is composed entirely of glia). Please note too that although the role of the BBB is supported by the sleep phenotypes we get with knockdown of lipid/carnitine transporters specifically in the BBB, the metabolomic analysis was conducted with manipulations of all glia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The feeding experiments, though the effects were mild, go one step toward addressing the role of acylcarnitines in triggering sleep except that it's not clear if eating acylcarnitines leads to acylcarnitine accumulation in the brain or if this is a separate effect.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that at this point we do not know if the fed acylcarnitines accumulate in the brain. We have acknowledged this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another detail that the authors could add: the time of day of collection for metabolomics experiments. The authors might comment in the discussion on how this timing might relate to the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>The flies were collected at ZT 0-3 for the metabolomics analysis.
