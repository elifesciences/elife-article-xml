coupled, such that the efficacy of anabolic osteoporosis treatments may be limited by bone destruction. The multi-kinase inhibitor YKL-05–099 potently inhibits salt inducible kinases (SIKs) and may represent a promising new class of bone anabolic agents. Here, we report that YKL-05–099 increases bone formation in hypogonadal female mice without increasing bone resorption. Postnatal mice with inducible, global deletion of SIK2 and SIK3 show increased bone mass, increased bone formation, and, distinct from the effects of YKL-05–099, increased bone resorption. No cell-intrinsic role of SIKs in osteoclasts was noted. In addition to blocking SIKs, YKL-05–099 also binds and inhibits CSF1R, the receptor for the osteoclastogenic cytokine M-CSF. Modeling reveals that YKL-05–099 binds to SIK2 and CSF1R in a similar manner. Dual targeting of SIK2/3 and CSF1R induces bone formation without concomitantly increasing bone resorption and thereby may overcome limitations of most current anabolic osteoporosis therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>salt inducible kinase</kwd><kwd>osteocyte</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>kinase inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR066261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wein</surname><given-names>Marc N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK116716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wein</surname><given-names>Marc N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR067285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wein</surname><given-names>Marc N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK011794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kronenberg</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK092590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berdeaux</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR059847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berdeaux</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simultaneous inhibition of two distinct kinase targets stimulates bone formation without concurrently increasing bone resorption, therefore representing a promising new treatment strategy for osteoporosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is a major problem in our aging population, with significant health and economic burden associated with fragility fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harvey et al., 2010</xref>). Bone mass is determined by the balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaidi, 2007</xref>). Osteocytes, terminally differentiated cells of the osteoblast lineage buried deep within mineralized bone matrix, sense hormonal and mechanical cues to bone and in turn regulate the activity of cells on bone surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dallas et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of current osteoporosis therapeutics act by slowing down bone resorption, a strategy that most often fails to fully reverse the effects of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Compston et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, bone anabolic treatment strategies are limited; development of orally available small molecules that stimulate bone formation represents a major unmet medical need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estell and Rosen, 2021</xref>). Notably, efficacy of parathyroid hormone-based subcutaneous administration of osteoanabolic agents (teriparatide and abaloparatide) may be blunted by concomitant stimulation of bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilezikian, 2008</xref>). As such, orally available agents that stimulate bone formation without inducing bone resorption represent the ‘holy grail’ in osteoporosis drug development.</p><p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling in osteocytes stimulates new bone formation by osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wein, 2018</xref>). Salt inducible kinases (SIKs) are broadly expressed AMPK family serine/threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakamoto et al., 2018</xref>) whose activity is regulated by cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wein et al., 2018</xref>). In osteocytes, PTH signaling leads to protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of SIK2 and SIK3, a signaling event that suppresses cellular SIK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>). Genetic deletion of SIK2 and SIK3 in osteoblasts and osteocytes dramatically increases trabecular bone mass and causes phenotypic and molecular changes in bone similar to those observed with constitutive PTH receptor action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimori et al., 2019</xref>). PTH signaling inhibits cellular SIK2/3 function; therefore, small molecule SIK inhibitors such as YKL-05–099 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sundberg et al., 2016</xref>) mimic many of the actions of PTH, both in vitro and in vivo in initial studies in young, eugonadal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite these advances, major unanswered questions remain regarding small molecule SIK inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for osteoporosis. First, initial in vivo studies with YKL-05–099 showed increased bone formation (via a PTH-like mechanism) and, surprisingly, <italic>reduced</italic> bone resorption. Typically, bone formation and resorption are tightly coupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sims and Martin, 2020</xref>), and both are increased by PTH. Therefore, one goal of the current study is to define the mechanistic basis underlying the ‘uncoupling’ anti-resorptive effect of this agent. While YKL-05–099 is a potent SIK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tarumoto et al., 2020</xref>), this compound also targets several other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sundberg et al., 2016</xref>), leaving open the possibility that some of its in vivo activities may be SIK-independent. Kinase inhibitor multi-target pharmacology has been exploited therapeutically for cancers whose growth is dependent on multiple activated kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dar et al., 2012</xref>), yet this strategy has not been widely explored for use of kinase inhibitors in non-oncologic disease indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson and Gray, 2018</xref>). Second, the safety and efficacy of longer-term YKL-05–099 treatment in a disease-relevant preclinical osteoporosis model remains to be determined. Finally, relevant to therapeutic efforts to develop SIK inhibitors for osteoporosis, the phenotypic consequences of post-natal SIK gene ablation are unknown.</p><p>Here, we tested YKL-05–099 in female mice rendered hypogonadal by surgical oophorectomy and observed increased trabecular bone mass, increased bone formation, and reduced bone resorption. Despite these beneficial effects, toxicities of hyperglycemia and nephrotoxicity were noted. Inducible, post-natal SIK2/3 gene deletion caused dramatic bone anabolism without hyperglycemia or BUN elevation, indicating that these side effects were due to inhibition of SIK1 or other targets of YKL-05–099. Notably, inducible, global SIK2/3 gene deletion <italic>increased</italic> bone resorption. While YKL-05–099 potently blocked osteoclast differentiation in vitro, deletion of SIK2/3 or SIK1/2/3 showed no obvious effects on differentiation or function of isolated osteoclast precursors. YKL-05–099 also potently inhibited CSF1R, the receptor for the key osteoclastogenic cytokine M-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mun et al., 2020</xref>). Modeling revealed that YKL-05–099 prefers a common conformation of both CSF1R and SIK2. Consistent with these results, YKL-05–099 blocked M-CSF action in myeloid cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the dual target specificity of YKL-05–099 allows this multi-kinase inhibitor to uncouple bone formation and bone resorption.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YKL-05–099 increases trabecular bone mass in hypogonadal female mice</title><p>We previously showed that the SIK inhibitor YKL-05–099 increased bone formation and bone mass in young, eugonadal mice while simultaneously suppressing osteoclastic bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these findings, we tested the efficacy of this compound in female mice rendered hypogonadal by surgical removal of the ovaries (OVX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), a common preclinical model for post-menopausal osteoporosis. In this study, 12-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice were subjected to sham or OVX surgery. 8 weeks later, mice from each surgical group were randomly divided into three treatment groups for 4 weeks total treatment. We performed side-by-side comparison of YKL-05–099 (18 mg/kg) with human PTH 1–34 (100 mcg/kg). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, YKL-05–099 treatment increased trabecular bone mass in the femur and L5 vertebral body of hypogonadal female mice. Compared to once daily PTH (100 mcg/kg) treatment, YKL-05–099 (18 mg/kg) led to comparable gains in trabecular bone mass. In contrast, this dose of PTH increased cortical bone mass and bone strength. The relationship between cortical bone mass and bone strength was preserved in response to YKL-05–099, indicating that this agent does not cause obvious defects in cortical bone quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>YKL-05–099 increases cancellous bone mass in hypogonadal female mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of ovariectomy (OVX) study design.

As expected, intermittent PTH treatment in OVX mice led to exuberant new bone formation leading to increased accumulation of unmineralized (osteoid) matrix on trabecular surfaces. Although YKL-05–099 increased osteoblast numbers and bone formation rate (as assessed by dual calcein/demeclocycline labeling), osteoid surface was <italic>not</italic> increased by this treatment. This raised the possibility that YKL-05–099 treatment might both accelerate bone matrix deposition by osteoblasts <italic>and</italic> its subsequent mineralization. This observation prompted us to assess bone mineralization density distribution by quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roschger et al., 2008</xref>) in order to assess potential effects of YKL-05–099 on bone matrix mineralization. This methodology is best suited to assess mineralization distribution patterns (BMDD) in cortical bone (where YKL-05–099 action was minimal). Only minor BMDD differences between the groups were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>). Notably, the mean calcium concentration between fluorochrome labels given 7 and 2 days prior to sacrifice (Ca<sub>Young</sub>, which was measured for the evaluation of Ca<sub>Low</sub>) did not differ greatly indicating similar mineralization kinetics between the groups based on this technique. Future study is needed to examine potential effects of YKL-05–099 on matrix mineralization in more detail.</p><p>A second, provocative effect of YKL-05–099 occurred at the level of bone marrow adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Paula and Rosen, 2020</xref>). PTH signaling in mesenchymal lineage precursors may shift cellular differentiation from adipocyte to osteoblast lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maridas et al., 2019</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), acquired hypogonadism in response to OVX surgery led to increased marrow adipocytes in the metaphyseal region. YKL-05–099 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) reduced marrow adipocyte volume as assessed by semi-automated histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tratwal et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies are needed to define a potential cell intrinsic role for salt inducible kinases (or other intracellular targets of YKL-05–099) in bone marrow adipocyte differentiation and survival.</p><p>Given the clear effects observed in trabecular bone in response to YKL-05–099 treatment, we next turned our attention to the safety profile of this agent over the course of 4 weeks of treatment. Surgical treatment group (sham versus OVX) had no impact on parameters measured in vehicle-treated mice; for this reason, data are presented by drug (vehicle, PTH, or YKL-05–099) treatment. YKL-05–099 treatment had no effect on peripheral white blood cell numbers, hemoglobin, platelet counts, or absolute monocyte count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Prior to sacrifice, standard toxicology profiling was performed on fasting serum. While most parameters were unaffected by YKL-05–099 treatment, we did note mild but significant increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Hyperglycemia may be related to a potential role of salt-inducible kinases downstream of hepatic glucagon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, current genetic models do not necessarily predict nephrotoxicity from in vivo SIK inhibition. Taken together, these results largely demonstrate an appealing therapeutic action in bone in response to YKL-05–099 treatment. However, the potential tolerability issues observed with YKL-05–099 and key differences from the pharmacologic actions of PTH (with respect to bone resorption) prompted us to develop genetic models of adult-onset SIK isoform deletion to gain insight into whether some effects of YKL-05–099 may be related to non-SIK targets of this multi-kinase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sundberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inducible, global SIK2/3 deletion increases trabecular bone mass and increases bone turnover</title><p>Similar to YKL-05–099 treatment, deletion of SIK2 and SIK3 in mesenchymal lineage bone cells with Dmp1-Cre increases trabecular bone area and mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimori et al., 2019</xref>).

These agents boost bone mass and reduce fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bone et al., 2017</xref>), yet are linked to rare but serious side effects (osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures) which are related to excessive suppression of both bone resorption and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2020</xref>). New bone anabolic therapies for osteoporosis are desperately needed in order to provide more effective treatment options for this common and debilitating disease. Currently, analogs of parathyroid hormone (teriparatide and abaloparatide) represent the most commonlyused class of bone anabolic osteoporosis treatment agents. While effective in increasing spine bone density, efficacy of such agents may be limited by concomitant stimulation of bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estell and Rosen, 2021</xref>). For this reason, novel strategies that stimulate bone formation without simultaneous induction of bone resorption are highly desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leder, 2018</xref>). Here, we show that the small molecule kinase inhibitor YKL-05–099 boosts bone formation and trabecular bone mass in a commonly used preclinical model of post-menopausal osteoporosis. In addition to stimulating bone formation, YKL-05–099 treatment inhibits bone resorption. This appealing combination of anabolic and anti-resorptive effects is, to date, only seen with the biologic agent romosozumab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McClung et al., 2014</xref>), an anti-sclerostin antibody whose widespread use is limited due to risk of increased cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fixen and Tunoa, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated mechanisms underlying the in vivo effects of YKL-05–099 treatment, and compared these results with those obtained following post-natal, ubiquitous <italic>Sik2/3</italic> gene deletion. While both organismal perturbations led to increased bone formation and increased trabecular bone mass, key differences were observed. First, YKL-05–099 uncoupled bone formation and bone resorption while <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion stimulated both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. High bone resorption seen in response to <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion is likely driven by increased RANKL expression by osteoblasts and osteocytes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wein et al., 2018</xref>). As shown here, we did not observe a cell-intrinsic role for salt-inducible kinases in osteoclast differentiation using ex vivo assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Rather, YKL-05–099 likely blocks osteoclast differentiation via potent inhibition of CSF1R. As such, our current data support a model in which dual target specificity of YKL-05–099 may explain its ability to uncouple bone formation and resorption in vivo. Interestingly, YKL-05–099 appears to show greater efficacy with respect to increasing trabecular bone mass in OVX mice, suggesting that this compound relies on states of high bone turnover for its full bone-building activity.</p><p>Second, YKL-05–099 caused mild hyperglycemia and increased BUN, changes not observed following <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion. Future studies are needed to better understand the mechanism of these potential (albeit mild) tolerability issues associated with YKL-05–099 treatment. Furthermore, complete characterization of metabolic and renal phenotypes in global/post-natal SIK isoform-selective and compound mutants represents a powerful future approach to better define the physiologic role of these kinases. To date, our studies have focused primarily on the function of SIKs downstream of parathyroid hormone signaling in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimori et al., 2019</xref>). However, potential therapeutic targeting of these kinases for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, and skin pigmentation disorders remains a high priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). As such, the genetic tools described here to study postnatal roles of SIKs may be valuable reagents across multiple fields, in conjunction with complementary models that address the kinase function of SIK isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darling et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Detailed analysis of bones from OVX mice treated with YKL-05–099 for 4 weeks revealed unanticipated findings including trends toward reduced bone marrow adipocytes and potential effects on matrix mineralization. First, there may be a direct role of PTH signaling in differentiation of bone marrow adipocyte precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maridas et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, activation of other cAMP-linked GPCR signaling systems, such as ß3-adrenergic receptors, can also inhibit SIK cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berggreen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henriksson et al., 2012</xref>) and regulate bone marrow adipocyte size and numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheller et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine whether a cell-intrinsic role exists for SIKs in bone marrow adipocyte differentiation or response to catecholamines. Second, we were surprised to note that YKL-05–099 treatment accelerated bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,H</xref>) without increasing osteoid surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These findings are in stark contrast with the effects of PTH treatment which, as expected, increased bone formation and accumulation of under-mineralized bone matrix. These results suggest that YKL-05–099 somehow accelerates both matrix deposition and decreases osteoid maturation time. The assessment of Ca<sub>Young</sub> (the mean calcium concentration between the double labels) which represents the calcium level at a well-defined young tissue age, did not show large differences among selected samples from all study groups. However, future studies are needed to investigate how this compound might stimulate mineralization of newly formed bone matrix in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murshed and McKee, 2010</xref>). Our previous studies indicated that YKL-05–099 treatment stimulates bone formation via PTH-like effects in osteocytes, including suppressing expression of the osteoblast inhibitor sclerostin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>). Whether YKL-05–099 has direct effects on osteoblast activity remains to be determined.</p><p>Our OVX study demonstrated that YKL-05–099 treatment increased trabecular, but not cortical, bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, sclerostin antibody treatment increases both trabecular and cortical bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2009</xref>). At this point, we do not understand the mechanistic basis of this compartment-selective effect of this small molecule. Analysis of cortical bone at multiple time points after YKL-05–099 treatment is needed to conclusively demonstrate the absence of a cortical bone effect of this compound. However, <italic>Sik2/3</italic> gene deletion appears to preferentially increase remodeling and bone formation on cancellous bone surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that SIK inhibitors may stimulate remodeling-based bone formation. Further studies using larger animals with dedicated assays to measure modeling versus remodeling-based bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ominsky et al., 2014</xref>) are needed to assess this possibility. Moreover, our current studies do not assess whether or not SIK inhibitors, like PTH or sclerostin antibody treatment, stimulate bone formation by activation of previously-quiescent bone lining cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). The relative contribution of sclerostin suppression to YKL-05–099-mediated bone formation also remains to be determined.</p><p>Our current claim that YKL-05–099 ‘uncouples’ bone formation and bone resorption is based upon our histomorphometry and serum bone turnover marker data which clearly show that this agent increases bone formation without increasing the measured resorption-related parameters. Future study is needed using dynamic histomorphometry in association with cement line visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langdahl et al., 2016</xref>) to see if this compound can stimulate modeling-based bone formation independent of bone resorption. While both <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion and YKL-05–099 treatment potently stimulate bone formation, we acknowledge that future study is needed to definitively prove that the bone anabolic effect of YKL-05–099 in vivo is due to targeting these two kinases. Currently, reagents (such as mice expressing an inhibitor-resistant SIK2<sup>T96Q</sup> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2012</xref>) to rigorously address this question are not available. A final limitation of this OVX study is that our model using C57Bl/6J mice showed obvious OVX-induced loss of trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in L5 vertebrae but not in the distal femur metaphyseal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). Demonstrating OVX-induced loss of trabecular bone in the appendicular skeleton can be challenging, especially in strains (like C57Bl/6J) which show low amounts of trabecular bone at this skeletal site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klinck and Boyd, 2008</xref>). Future studies will be needed in other mouse strains and/or robust rat OVX models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Varela et al., 2017</xref>) to further demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of SIK inhibitors in bone loss associated with hypogonadism.</p><p>Achieving specificity in active site kinase inhibitors is challenging due to the conserved nature of the ATP-binding pocket across protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). It is plausible that due to small threonine residues (CSF1R: Thr663; SIK2: Thr96) at the so-called gatekeeper position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azam et al., 2008</xref>), the active sites of both CSF1R and SIK2 can accommodate multiple inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klaeger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>). Our modeling here further demonstrates that YKL-05–099 preferentially engages the CODI conformation of both kinases in a common binding mode. As such, multi-target binding of kinase inhibitors represents both a challenge and an opportunity as such agents are developed for chronic, non-oncologic indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson and Gray, 2018</xref>). While avoiding undesired off-target effects will be necessary to avoid unacceptable toxicities, it remains possible that targeting precise combinations of kinases may lead to synergistic therapeutic benefits.</p><p>In summary, these findings demonstrate that a single kinase inhibitor can uncouple bone formation and bone resorption via concurrent effects on distinct kinases in distinct cell types. This work provides a framework for development of ‘next generation’ inhibitors with improved selectivity toward relevant SIK isoforms (likely SIK2 and SIK3) and CSF1R versus the remainder of the kinome. Furthermore, this work highlights the power of combining complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches to explore the target biology and therapeutic mode of action of a small molecule kinase inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The following published genetically modified strains were used: <italic>Sik1</italic> floxed mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5648544">MGI:5648544</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nixon et al., 2016</xref>), and <italic>Sik2</italic> floxed mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5905012">MGI:5905012</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu</sup> mice (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5085429">MGI:5085429</ext-link>) were purchased from EUCOMM and bred to PGK1-FLPo mice (JAX #011065) in order to generate mice bearing a loxP-flanked <italic>Sik3</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimori et al., 2019</xref>). Ubiquitin-Cre<sup>ERt2</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruzankina et al., 2007</xref> JAX #008085) were intercrossed to <italic>Sik1/2/3</italic> floxed mice. In some instances, ubiquitin-Cre<sup>ERt2</sup> mice were intercrossed to Ai14 tdTomato<sup>LSL</sup> reporter mice (JAX #007914). Cre<sup>ERt2</sup>-negative littermate controls were used for all studies to account for potential influence of genetic background and impact of tamoxifen on bone homeostasis. All mice were back-crossed to C57Bl/6J for at least five generations.</p><p>Both males and females were included in this study, except for the OVX studies where only female mice were used. All procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with guidelines issued by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) in the Center for Comparative Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School under approved Animal Use Protocols (2019N000201). All animals were housed in the Center for Comparative Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital (21.9 ± 0.8°C, 45 ± 15% humidity, and 12 hr light cycle 7 am–7 pm).</p><p>For OVX studies, 12-week-old sham- and OVX-operated female C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from a commercial vendor (JAX #000664). Mice from each surgical group were randomly allocated into three drug treatment groups. Drug treatments started 8 weeks after OVX surgery for a total of 4 weeks. YKL-05–099 was dissolved in PBS + 25 mM HCl and injected IP once daily five times per week for a total of 20 injections. PTH was dissolved in buffer (10 mM citric acid, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-80, pH 5.0) and injected SC once daily five times per week for a total of 20 injections. Power calculations were performed based on previous data where eugonadal mice were treated with YKL-05–099 for 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>), detailed below. For experiments in which mice were treated with either vehicle or PTH (or YKL-05–099), mice were assigned to alternating treatment groups in consecutive order. Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, catalog #T5648) was dissolved in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Thereafter, equal volume of sunflower oil (Sigma, catalog #88921–250 ML-F) was added, the solution was vortexed and placed un-capped in a 65°C incubator overnight in order to evaporate ethanol. This working solution of tamoxifen dissolved in sunflower oil at a concentration of 10 mg/mL was used for intraperitoneal injections.</p><p>The sample size for this study was determined using the following power calculation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grassi et al., 2016</xref> performed a similar study design to assess the effects of the small molecule H<sub>2</sub>S donor GYY4137 on OVX-induced bone loss. In these studies, femoral BV/TV (%± SD) fell from 7.8 ± 2 to 4.2 ± 1 following OVX. From these studies, a sample size of n = 5/group would be required to reach 95% power to detect a ‘p’ value of 0.05. In our published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wein et al., 2016</xref>) with YKL-05–099 (6 mg/kg/d) treatment caused BV/TV to increase from 10.6 ± 1.0 to 12.5 ± 1.0. In these studies, a sample size of n = 7/group would be required to reach 95% power to detect a ‘p’ value of 0.05. In our preliminary data using YKL-05–099 18 mg/kg/d caused BV/TV to increase from 10.3 ± 2.0 to 16.3 ± 2.0. In these studies, a sample size of n = 3/group would be required to reach 95% power to detect a ‘p’ value of 0.05. In designing these experiments, a conservative estimate will be used of n = 8/group, as this number reflects one additional mouse per group beyond the minimum number needed from the aforementioned scenarios. In addition, since more stringent ANOVA analysis will be required to test for an interaction between surgery and drug treatment, a larger size will be necessary. For studies investigating the effects of <italic>Sik2/3</italic> gene deletion on bone parameters, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The sample size was determined based on our previous experience characterizing the skeletal effects of <italic>Sik2/3</italic> gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishimori et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Antibodies and compounds</title><p>YKL-05–099 was synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sundberg et al., 2016</xref>), PLX-5622 was obtained from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ).

Femora and vertebrae were dissected, fixed overnight in neutral buffered formalin, then stored in 70% EtOH until the time of scanning. In brief, the distal femoral metaphysis and mid-diaphysis were scanned using 70 kVp peak X-ray tube potential, 113 mAs X-ray tube current, 200 ms integration time, and 10 μm isotropic voxel size. Cancellous (trabecular) bone was assessed in the distal metaphysis and cortical bone was assessed in the mid-diaphysis. The femoral metaphysis region began 1700 μm proximal to the distal growth plate and extended 1500 μm distally. Cancellous bone was separated from cortical bone with a semiautomated contouring program. For the cancellous bone region, we assessed trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm), trabecular number (Tb.N, 1/mm), connectivity density (Conn.D, 1/mm<sup>3</sup>), and structure model index. Transverse µCT slices were also acquired in a 500 μm long region at the femoral mid-diaphysis to assess total cross-sectional area, cortical bone area, and medullary area (Tt.Ar, Ct.Ar and Ma.Ar, respectively, all mm<sup>2</sup>); cortical bone area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar, %), cortical thickness (Ct.Th, mm), porosity (Ct.Po, %) and minimum (<italic>I</italic><sub>min</sub>, mm<sup>4</sup>), maximum (<italic>I</italic><sub>max</sub>, mm<sup>4</sup>) and polar (<italic>J</italic>, mm<sup>4</sup>) moments of inertia. Bone was segmented from soft tissue using fixed thresholds of 300 mg HA/cm<sup>3</sup> and 700 mg HA/cm<sup>3</sup> for trabecular and cortical bone, respectively. Scanning and analyses adhered to the guidelines for the use of micro-CT for the assessment of bone architecture in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouxsein et al., 2010</xref>). Micro-CT analysis was done in a completely blinded manner with all mice assigned to coded sample numbers. Samples from some mice were unable to be measured due to dissection artifacts. All measured samples were included in subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mechanical testing</title><p>Femora were mechanically tested in three-point bending using a materials testing machine (Electroforce 3230, Bose Corporation, Eden Prairie, MN). The bending fixture had a bottom span length of 8 mm. The test was performed in displacement control moving at a rate of 0.03 mm/s with force and displacement data collected at 50 Hz. All bones were positioned in the same orientation during testing with the cranial surface resting on the supports and being loaded in tension. Bending rigidity (EI, N-mm2), apparent modulus of elasticity (E<sub>app</sub>, MPa), and ultimate moment (M<sub>ult</sub>, N-mm) were calculated based on the force and displacement data from the tests and the mid-diaphysis bone geometry measured with μCT. Bending rigidity was calculated using the linear portion of the force-displacement curve. The minimum moment of inertia (I<sub>min</sub>) was used when calculating the apparent modulus of elasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histomorphometry</title><p>Femora were subjected to bone histomorphometric analysis. The mice were given calcein (20 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection) and demeclocycline (40 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection) on 7 and 2 days before necropsy, respectively. The femur was dissected and fixed in 70% ethanol for 3 days. Fixed bones were dehydrated in graded ethanol, then infiltrated and embedded in methylmethacrylate without demineralization. Undecalcified 5 μm and 10-μm-thick longitudinal sections were obtained using a microtome (RM2255, Leica Biosystems., IL, USA). Five μm sections were stained with Goldner Trichome and at least two nonconsecutive sections per sample were examined for measurement of cellular parameters. The 10 μm sections were left unstained for measurement of dynamic parameters, and only double-labels were measured, avoiding nonspecific fluorochrome labeling. A standard dynamic bone histomorphometric analysis of the tibial metaphysis was done using the Osteomeasure analyzing system (Osteometrics Inc, Decatur, GA, USA). Measurements were performed in the area of secondary spongiosa, 200 μm below the proximal growth plate. The observer was blinded to the experimental genotype at the time of measurement. The structural, dynamic, and cellular parameters were calculated and expressed according to the standardized nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dempster et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>For the adipocyte parameters, we used sections of the proximal tibia with H and E staining at ×20 magnification. The following MAT outcome parameters were measured and calculated: [1] MAT volume as a percentage of the tissue volume (total adipose tissue volume: Ad.V/TV; %), [2] MAT volume as a percentage of the marrow volume (marrow adipose tissue volume: Ad.V/Ma.V; %), [3] adipocyte density (Ad.Dn; cells/mm2 marrow area) representing adipocyte number. These measurements were performed by semi-automatically tracing out individual adipocytes ‘ghosts’ in all the fields analyzed. Adipocyte ghosts appear as distinct, translucent, yellow ellipsoids in the marrow space. The total proximal tibia area below the secondary spongiosa was measured in 1–4 sections per biopsy. Adipocyte analysis was performed using a semi-automated measurement program on ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) based image analysis software adapted from the OsteoidHisto package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van 't Hof et al., 2017</xref>). All assessments of the sections were performed together by examiners (YV and AV-V) who were blinded to the intervention assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Serum analysis</title><p>Three hr fasting serum was collected at ZT3 from mice just prior to sacrifice by retro-orbital bleed. Serum was isolated and analyte levels were determined using the following commercially available detection kits: P1NP (IDS Immunodiagnostic Systems, #AC-33F1), CTX from IDS (#AC-06F1). All absolute concentrations were determined based on interpolation from standard curves provided by the manufacturer. DRI-CHEM 700 veterinary chemistry analyzer (Heska, Loveland, CO) was used for measurement of serum analytes: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, BUN, calcium, cholesterol, globulin, glucose, phosphorus, total bilirubin, triglycerides, and total protein. For complete blood counts, whole blood was collected into heparin-coated tubes and kept on ice. CBCs were measured on a 2015 Heska Element HT5 Veterinary Hematology Analyzer. HeskaView Integrated software was used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative Backscattered Electron Imaging (qBEI)</title><p>Distal femora from six study groups were analyzed (n = 8 each group): SHAM VEH, SHAM PTH, SHAM YKL, OVX VEH, OVX PTH, and OVX YKL. These bones were embedded undecalcified in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and measured for bone mineralization density distribution (BMDD) using qBEI. The surfaces of the sample blocks were flattened by grinding and polishing (Logitech PM5, Glasgow, Scotland) and carbon coated so as to facilitate qBEI. A scanning electron microscope equipped with a four quadrant semiconductor backscatter electron detector (Zeiss Supra 40, Oberkochen, Germany) was used. Areas of metaphyseal (MS) and cortical midshaft bone (Ct) were imaged with a spatial resolution of 0.88 µm/pixel. The gray levels, reflecting the calcium content, were calibrated by the material contrast of pure Carbon and Aluminum. Thus, the resulting gray level histograms could be transformed into calcium weight percent (wt% Ca) histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roschger et al., 1998</xref>). Five parameters were derived to characterize the BMDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roschger et al., 2008</xref>). For information about Ca<sub>Young</sub>, which is the mean calcium concentration of the bone area between the double fluorescence labels, the identical bone surface measured with qBEI was additionally imaged in a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica TCS SP5, Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) using a laser light of 405 nm for fluorescence excitation and a 20x object lens (pixel resolution of 0.76 µm). By matching the CLSM with the qBEI images, the sites of the fluorescence labels were overlaid exactly onto the qBEI images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Ca<sub>Young</sub> was obtained from a total of 39 areas from a subgroup of nine samples and was subsequently used to calculate Ca<sub>Low</sub>, which reflects the percentage of newly formed bone area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Ubiquitin-Cre<sup>ERt2</sup>; tdTomato<sup>LSL</sup> mice were treated with tamoxifen (1 mg IP Q48H, three injections total). Two weeks after the first tamoxifen injection, mice were sacrificed and bone marrow cells were isolated by flushing with ice cold PBS using a 25G needle. 10<sup>6</sup> bone marrow cells were protected from light and stained on ice for 30 min with the following primary antibodies in a 10 µL staining volume. APC anti-mouse/human CD 11b antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), FITC anti-mouse CD3 antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), and PE/Cy7 anti-mouse Ly-6C antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, CA). After staining, cells were washed twice with FACS buffer (PBS plus 2% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum) and analyzed on a SORP 8 Laser BD LSR flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bone marrow macrophages and osteoclast differentiation</title><p>Bone marrow cells were harvested from 4 week-old C57BL/6J mice. Femur and tibia were removed and the marrow cavity was flushed out with 10 mL 1x phosphate-buffered saline per mouse (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, MA) with a 25 G needle (Becton, Dickinson and Company, (Franklin Lakes, NJ)) which was then centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was removed, and cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and incubated for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min to collect cells. Bone marrow cells were plated on 100 mm non-treated tissue culture dishes (Corning Inc, Corning, NY) and maintained in alpha minimum essential medium eagle (MEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 15% fetal bovine serum FBS (Gemini Bio, West Sacramento, CA), 1x penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Waltham, MA), 1x GlutaMAX supplement (Gibco, Waltham, MA) and in the presence of 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN). These cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 3 days, then collected by trypsinization. Primary osteoclast precursors were then seeded in 96 well plates at 2,000 cells/well (20,000 cells/mL), and differentiation was induced with 50 ng/mL of recombinant mouse RANKL (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Fresh medium was replenished every 3 days.</p><p>For experiments with 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment, primary osteoclast precursors were seeded after initial culture on non-treated plates into six-well plates in the presence of 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 3 days. Cells were then treated with 300 nM of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or vehicle (methanol, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 3 days. Fresh medium with 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF (R and D systems, MN) was then added for another 3 days prior to collecting cells for subsequent osteoclast differentiation.</p><p>For osteoclast differentiation assays, primary osteoclast precursors were seeded in 96-well plates, and differentiation was induced with 50 ng/mL of recombinant mouse RANKL (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF (R and D systems, Minneapolis, MN). Fresh medium was replenished every 3 days. sTRAP assay was measured with acetate buffer from acid phosphatase leukocyte kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 1M sodium L-tartrate dibasic dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and pNPP substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Fifty µL of cell culture supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate and 150 µL of substrate mix was added. Plate was then incubated 37°C for an hour. Reaction was terminated by adding 3N NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), which results in an intense yellow color. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm.</p><p>TRAP staining was performed using acid phosphatase leukocyte kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to visualize osteoclasts. TRAP buffer was prepared freshly on the day of experiment by mixing acetate buffer containing sodium acetate and acetic acid with sodium tartrate and naphthol AS-BI phosphate disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). TRAP staining solution was prepared by mixing Fast Garnet GBC Base with sodium nitrite. For TRAP staining, culture medium was removed from cells, and cells were fixed with fixative solution for 5 min at room temperature. Fixative solution was prepared fresh on the day of experiment by mixing citrate solution, acetone with 37% formaldehyde. Cells were then washed twice with deionized water and stained with TRAP staining solution for 60 min at 37°C.</p><p>For pit resorption assays, primary osteoclast precursors were seeded in 96-well resorption plates at 2000 cells/well (Corning, Inc, Corning, NY), and differentiation was induced with 50 ng/mL of recombinant mouse RANKL and 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF. Fresh medium with M-CSF and RANKL was replenished every 3 days. Culture was aspirated and cells were washed three times with 1x PBS. A total of 100 µL of 10% bleach was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Bleach solution was removed and cells were washed twice with deionized water. Plates were air-dried at 4°C overnight and osteoclast resorption pits were visualized the next day. Pit resorption was quantified using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>gDNA deletion analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured bone marrow macrophages or cortical bone using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For cultured bone marrow macrophages, cell were treated with vehicle (methanol) or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (0.3 µM) for 72 hr prior to gDNA isolation. For cortical bone, mice were treated with tamoxifen (three 1 mg IP injection every 48 hr) and then sacrificed 7 days after the first tamoxifen injection. Epiphyses were removed and bone marrow cells were flushed using ice cold PBS. Remaining cortical bone fragments were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and then pulverized using a mortar and pestle. Bone tissue was then subjected to gDNA isolation and quantified using a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). 15 ng gDNA was used for each qPCR reaction. For each gene, one primer pair was used that was internal to the targeted loxP sites and a second external primer pair was used to normalize to input gDNA amount. See PCR primer Appendix for primer sequences used. Relative abundance of the targeted gene was calculated by the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method using the external primer pair as control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Livak and Schmittgen, 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>TF-seq</title><p>Ocy454 cells were infected with lentiviral particles expressing TF-seq library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Connell et al., 2016</xref>) and eGFP. Infected cells were isolated by sorting for GFP expression. The cell line was confirmed to be mycoplasma-free by PCR. Thereafter, cells were plated at a density of 50,000/ml in 96 well plates (5000 cells/well) and allowed to expand at 33°C for 48 hr. Cells were then moved to 37°C for 24 hr, then treated with vehicle (DMSO) or YKL-05–099 for time points ranging from zero minutes to 4 hr with n = 3 wells per condition. Cells were washed with ice cold PBS and then lysed with RLT buffer (Qiagen, supplemented with ß-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −80°C. RNA was purified using Agentcourt RNA Clean XP to precipitate the nucleic acids in 1.25 M NaCl and 10% PEG-8000. Maxima reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was run according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a multiplexed primed reverse transcriptase reaction. The biotinylated 96-well sequence tagged TF-seq-specific reverse transcriptase primers, and the biotinylated 96-well degenerate sequence-tagged polydT reverse transcriptase primers were used at 750 and 250 nM final concentrations, respectively, with 50 units of Maxima. After sequencing-tagging all cDNA during reverse transcriptase, each 96-well plate was pooled and the unincorporated primers were washed away from the cDNA by precipitating with 10% PEG-8000 and 1.25 M NaCl. Amplification of the TF-seq gene reporter amplicon was performed on 50% of the cDNA using primers with full Illumina-compatible sequencing adapters in a 600 µl PCR reaction for 28 cycles. The 422 bp amplicon was then gel extracted for sequencing. TF-seq is a 50 bp single-end read, well-tag, RNA UMI, followed by a 17 bp constant sequence, then the reporter tag UMI, and ultimately the reporter tag. We counted the number of unique RNA molecules for every well and reporter element, requiring a perfect match for the respective tags. UMI tag counts for each reporter element were obtained. Reporter element activity was expressed as fold change versus baseline (time 0) for each drug treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Generation of models of kinases in various conformational states</title><p>Models of CSF1R (FMS), SIK1, and SIK2 (QIK) in four conformations, the CIDI, CIDO, CODI, and CODO states, were generated using DFGmodel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ung and Schlessinger, 2015</xref>). DFGmodel uses a multi-template homology modeling approach to construct composite homology models in various kinase conformations. The models are based on an augmented version of a structurally validated sequence alignment of human kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Modi and Dunbrack, 2019</xref>). For the CIDO, CODI, and CODO states, DFGmodel uses multi-template approach, where manually curated sets of determined structures, covering a unique range of conformations for each state are used as template structures. For the CIDI, DFGmodel uses a single-template approach to construct the models; DFGmodel searches a library of kinase structures annotated by Kinformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rahman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kinametrix.com">http://www.kinametrix.com</ext-link>) to identify a best-matched kinase in CIDI state as template. DFGmodel then uses MODELLER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>) v9.21 to generate homology models for each kinase. For CIDI, CIDO, and CODO states, 50 models were generated; POVME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durrant et al., 2014</xref>) v2.1 was used to estimate the binding site volume of each model, where 10 models with the largest volume were selected. For CODI, four sets of templates are required to cover the observed conformation, thus 40 models were generated for each of these sets; eight models with the largest volume in each of the sets were selected.

Cells were scraped into ice cold PBS and cell pellets were lysed in TNT (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)). Cells were vortexed twice in lysis buffer for 30 s followed by centrifugation at top speed at 4°C for 5 min. Protein concentration in cell lysates was quantified using Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Equal amounts of protein were then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBST plus 5% milk for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C in TBST with 5% BSA plus primary antibodies (source and dilutions below). Membranes were then washed three times with TBST for 5 min, followed by secondary antibody incubation (1:2000 goat anti-rabbit) for 30 min at room temperature. Next, membranes were washed again for three times with TBST for five minutes followed by detection with Pierce ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and imaging by Azure c600. The primary antibodies were: SIK2 (1:1000), CSF1R phospho-Y723 (1:1000), CSF1R (1:1000), phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000), ERK1/2 (1:2000), Tubulin (1:1000) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-SIK3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>When two groups were compared, statistical analyses were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Population samples were shown to be normally distributed. For OVX studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), two-way ANOVA was performed followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test (GraphPad Prism 9.1.1). p Values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. The numbers of mice studied in all experiments are described in figure legends, and in all figures data points represent individual mice. All data points indicate individual biologic replicates (independent experimental samples) and not technical replicates (the same sample re-analyzed using the same method). A Source Data File is presented for all figures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

This novel strategy may overcome limitations of most current anabolic osteoporosis therapies, such as PTH. The reviewers agree that their comments and concerns were addressed.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dual targeting of salt inducible kinases and CSF1R uncouples bone formation and bone resorption&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers and the Editors agree this is a very interesting, novel and informative study. However, a few issues need to be addressed to strengthen its conclusions and its biological and translational relevance.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Please address point-by-point reviewers' concerns and comments.</p><p>2. In particular, please explain why the pharmacological studies were performed at 24 weeks of age whereas the genetic models were analyzed at 9 weeks. Alternatively, perform additional experiments as suggested by Reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The primary objective of this manuscript was to examine if multi-kinase inhibitor YKL-05-099 can inhibit salt inducible kinases (SIKs) with the goal to examine a new class of bone anabolic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. The hypothesis tested is that deletion/inhibition of SIK2 and SIK3, broadly-expressed AMPK family serine/threonine kinases, would increase trabecular bone mass and other outcome measures associated with diminished bone quality and density seen in osteoporosis. To this end, the authors provide a thorough investigation of their hypotheses using robust measurements and validate their findings utilizing multiple techniques. They tested YKL-05-099 in female mice rendered hypogonadal by surgical oophorectomy. Their outcome measures of interest were trabecular bone mass, bone formation, and bone resorption and found that YKL-05-099 was successful in increasing anabolism and, surprisingly, decreasing resorption, leading them to investigate why this inhibitor differed from the effects of deletion of SIK2 and SIK3. They found that YKL-05-099 also inhibited the CSF1 (M-CSF) receptor, thus, inhibiting osteoclast activity. This is an interesting manuscript but there are some flaws in the conduct of the experiments and in the analyses which lessen its impact.</p><p>1. The authors initially recognize that PTH-derived osteoanabolic agents are limited by concomitant stimulation of bone resorption in the introduction but do not address this limitation in detail with sufficient background/context in the discussion/conclusions.</p><p>2. It might also be interesting to address recent clinical trials on denosumab (RankL inhibitor) and how inhibition of SIKs might affect downstream RankL production.</p><p>3. They need to specify that the mice are C57Bl/6J for the ovariectomy studies, even though they mention that the wild type mice were purchased from Jax. Also, they do not give the background strains of the genetic models. They must do that, and if they are not C57Bl/6J, it is difficult to make a comparison between the studies. They say they use both male and female mice, but only provide data for females. This is reasonable, but where do they use male mice?</p><p>4. They have a problem with their power analyses, or lack of them. They used a published model to determine their sample size for the ovariectomy studies, but did not achieve the endpoint of the published study (femoral trabecular BV/TV decreasing from 7.8% to 4.2%). In fact, they had no difference in the femoral trabecular BV/TV and barely significant difference in tBMD with ovariectomy. Nevertheless, they did observe a highly significant decrease in the vertebral BV/TV. But it illustrates that they needed more mice in the ovariectomy studies, more like 12/group. They even state that &quot;since more stringent ANOVA analysis will be required… a larger size will be necessary&quot; (I will come back to the statistical analyses below, which are also not correct). In addition, in Figure 1., only the cortical thickness seems to show 8 animals/group. In fact, in the L5 BV/TV the PTH-treated groups are only 4 and 5 animals, as far as I can tell. Why are there less than 8 animals/group in some of the panels, and how did they decide to exclude, or not analyze, some of the animals? With respect to the genetic gene deletion studies, why did they not perform power analyses prior to undertaking the experiments?</p><p>5. They have to perform 2-way ANOVA for all of the ovariectomy work. They cannot use 1-way ANOVA. They also must show all their data as means + SD, not SEM. Where they used Student's t-tests with 2 groups, were the population samples proven to be normally distributed? Would the significance remain the same if non-parametric tests were used?</p><p>6. With respect to Figure 1., they have to modify the text in the Results. They cannot state &quot;that YKL-05-099 tended to greater gains in trabecular bone mass&quot;. It's about the same as for PTH. They do not show that there is any significant difference between PTH and YKL-05-099 in the OVX mice. They also need to add to this sentence &quot;in these mice but had no effect on intact mice&quot;. This is an interesting observation, and suggests that YKL-05-099 is only effective when there is an increase in osteoclast activity.</p><p>7. Notwithstanding, there are some issues with Figure 2., that do not fit with Figure 1. Why is the BFR so high in the Sham-YKL-05-099-treated mice, when there is no increase in BV/TV in these mice? Also, they must add osteoclast numbers to the figure. This is imperative.</p><p>8. They have to be careful with the use of the term &quot;bone mass&quot; that they are really meaning &quot;mass&quot; not &quot;area&quot; or &quot;volume&quot;. For instance, when referring to the Nishimori paper on p. 6, second paragraph, &quot;area&quot; may be more appropriate for the massive changes that occur in development with deletion of the Siks. Similarly, with the uCT and histomorphometry in Figures 3 and 4. In fact, the uCT images in Figure 3B appear to show a great increase in the growth plate or resorption (it is hard to tell). It is most important that they indicate where in the trabecular bone the uCT analysis was done in each of the groups of mice.</p><p>9. The age of the DKO mice (6-9 weeks) used in Figures 3 and 4 is not appropriate to compare with the YKL-05-099-treated OVX mice (24 weeks old). The DKO mice are young, rapidly growing mice, as they note on p.6, 2nd paragraph. But then, they refer to them as adult-onset DKO in the next paragraph, and in the title of the legends. This is not correct; the mice will have just reached puberty at 6 weeks when the inducible DKO occurs. They must repeat this study with mice the same age as the OVX mice. They may obtain a milder effect of SIK deletion on the bone phenotype.</p><p>10. Why did they examine the metabolic parameters at 8 weeks of age, not 9, which is when they killed the other mice? Also, were all the mice fasted for the same 3 h? What time is ZT3? Perhaps the increase in blood glucose and BUN caused by YKL-05-099 were because of the age differences?</p><p>11. In Figure 5, it seems that the 4-OHT has effects on the abundance of SIK2 and SIK3, and there is less protein in vehicle-treated DKO cells, suggesting the Cre is leaky. They also need to show the abundance of SIK1.</p><p>12. Figure 7. shows that YKL-05-099 may inhibit a number of tyrosine kinases. They need to address the possibility that some of the effects they observe are due to other kinases than SIKs and the CSF1R. The effect on the growth plate may be similar to that of gefitinib and the off-target effects could be due to inhibition of other kinases.</p><p>13. Why did they use such a high dose (15 uM) of YKL-05-099 in Figure 8E, F and G? This might be toxic.</p><p>14. How many times were the in vitro experiments repeated. This needs to be mentioned in the methods or legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should present osteoclast surface or number in figure 2D because ES/BS can be affected by changes in bone formation. Specifically, an increase in bone formation can reduce eroded surface even if osteoclast number does not change.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Tang and colleague report that the multikinase inhibitor YKL-05-099 increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption in hypogonadal female mice with mechanisms that are likely to involve inhibition of SIKs and CSFR1, respectively.

The quality of the data is outstanding and most of the authors' conclusions are supported by the data as shown.</p><p>1. Measurements of osteoclast number upon pharmacological treatments should be provided.</p><p>2. What is the experimental evidence that the increase of bone formation observed in mice treated with YKL-05-099 is mediated by SIKs inhibition?

We have re-emphasized this concept in the first paragraph of the revised discussion along with new references to important review articles on this topic:</p><p>“Currently, analogs of parathyroid hormone (teriparatide and abaloparatide) represent the most commonly-used class of bone anabolic osteoporosis treatment agents. While effective in increasing spine bone density, efficacy of such agents may be limited by concomitant stimulation of bone resorption (5). For this reason, novel strategies that stimulate bone formation without simultaneous induction of bone resorption are highly desired (47).”</p><p>With these changes, appropriate context is now provided for readers to appreciate the potential clinical significance of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It might also be interesting to address recent clinical trials on denosumab (RankL inhibitor) and how inhibition of SIKs might affect downstream RankL production.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we appreciate this opportunity to provide additional clinical context for this study and to comment on the relationship between SIKs and RANKL expression. Since anti-resorptive agents (bisphosphonates and denosumab) represent first line osteoporosis therapy, we have revised the discussion to first state:</p><p>“Anti-resorptive therapies (bisphosphonates and the anti-RANKL antibody denosumab) have long represented first line treatment for patients with osteoporosis. These agents boost bone mass and reduce fractures (47), yet are linked to rare but serious side effects (osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures) which are related to excessive suppression of both bone resorption and bone formation (48).”</p><p>Next, we included a sentence in the second paragraph of the discussion to remind the reader about the relationship between SIKs and control of RANKL expression:</p><p>“High bone resorption seen in response to Sik2/3 deletion is likely driven by increased RANKL expression by osteoblasts and osteocytes (9).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The Methods section notes that C57Bl/6J mice from JAX (catalog number 000664) were used for OVX studies. The Results text has been revised to include this information as well. The methods section has been revised to indicate that are genetically-modified mice have been back-crossed to C57Bl/6J for at least 5 generations. The figure legends have been revised to indicate where male versus female mice were used for our gene deletion studies. We observe comparable (and dramatic) skeletal effects in response to <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion in male and female mice. Fasting serum analyses were performed with male mice while histology and microCT was performed on female mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. They have a problem with their power analyses, or lack of them. They used a published model to determine their sample size for the ovariectomy studies, but did not achieve the endpoint of the published study (femoral trabecular BV/TV decreasing from 7.8% to 4.2%).

With respect to the genetic gene deletion studies, why did they not perform power analyses prior to undertaking the experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful and important questions. Prior to performing the OVX studies in Figures 1 and 2, we performed power calculations which suggested a sample size of n=7/group. As detailed in the Methods section and above, we chose a sample size of n=8/group. While our study did not reveal obvious OVX-induced bone loss in the trabecular compartment of the distal femur metaphysis, we did observe clear OVX-induced bone loss in trabecular bone at L5. This experience highlights the common challenge to demonstrate trabecular bone loss in mouse OVX studies, especially in strains like C57Bl/6J where baseline levels of femur metaphyseal trabecular bone are low. For this reason, future studies will be required using other strains or rat models which may be more robust to detect OVX-induced bone loss. The Discussion (3<sup>rd</sup> to last paragraph) has been revised to revised to state:</p><p>“A final limitation of this OVX study is that our model using C57Bl/6J mice showed obvious OVX-induced loss of trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in L5 vertebrae but not in the distal femur metaphyseal region (Figure 1C, E). Demonstrating OVX-induced loss of trabecular bone in the appendicular skeleton can be challenging, especially in strains (like C57Bl/6J) which show low amounts of trabecular bone at this skeletal site (64). Future studies will be needed in other mouse strains and/or robust rat OVX models (65) to further demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of SIK inhibitors in bone loss associated with hypogonadism.”</p><p>We were unable to process some samples due to technical problems associated with bone dissection at the time of necropsy (growth plate trans-section leading to inability to measure distal femur parameters and vertebral body damage and/or isolation of the incorrect vertebral body). The Methods section has been revised to indicate this. No measured samples were excluded from analysis.</p><p>For our gene deletion studies, no power calculations were performed prior to starting experiments, as is frequently the case in skeletal phenotypic description of genetically-modified mice. The phenotype observed with postnatal ubiquitous <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion is quite dramatic and consistent across mice analyzed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Where they used Student's t-tests with 2 groups, were the population samples proven to be normally distributed? Would the significance remain the same if non-parametric tests were used?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important points. We obtained a biostatistics consultation from the Harvard Catalyst program to review our statistical methods in detail. For comparison between 2 groups using Student’s t-tests, population samples were normally distributed. The Methods section has been revised to include this information. For the ovariectomy study, we initially used the default analysis method in our statistical software program (GraphPad Prism 9.1.1) for overall comparisons and then post-hoc between group analysis. The default method actually was a 2-way ANOVA method followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests. The Methods section and figure legends have revised to include this important information. We apologize for any confusion. Finally, we have revised all figures to show data as means ± SD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. With respect to Figure 1., they have to modify the text in the Results. They cannot state &quot;that YKL-05-099 tended to greater gains in trabecular bone mass&quot;. It's about the same as for PTH. They do not show that there is any significant difference between PTH and YKL-05-099 in the OVX mice.

This is an interesting observation, and suggests that YKL-05-099 is only effective when there is an increase in osteoclast activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these excellent points. While the numeric means of the trabecular bone changes in response to YKL-05-099 were higher than those seen following PTH treatment, we agree that these differences are minor, and the text has been revised as suggested since the comparison between OVX+YKL and OVX+PTH was not statistically significant in any instances. Based on the observation that YKL-05-099 may be more effective in OVX mice (with increased osteoclast activity), we have revised the Discussion (second paragraph) to include the sentence:</p><p>“Interestingly, YKL-05-099 appears to show greater efficacy with respect to increasing trabecular bone mass in OVX mice, suggesting that this compound relies on states of high osteoclast activity for its full bone-building potential.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Notwithstanding, there are some issues with Figure 2., that do not fit with Figure 1. Why is the BFR so high in the Sham-YKL-05-099-treated mice, when there is no increase in BV/TV in these mice? Also, they must add osteoclast numbers to the figure. This is imperative.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important questions, and we appreciate the opportunity to respond. In the initial manuscript, osteoclast numbers from the OVX histomorphometry study were shown in Supplemental Table 3. Based on the suggestion from all three reviewers, we have revised Figure 2 to include graphs of these results along with eroded surface data. Both pieces of histomorphometry data show a similar message: osteoclast parameters tend to increase with PTH (as expected) and decrease with YKL-05-099 treatment. We agree that the potential disconnect between BFR/BS (histomorphometry, Figure 2H) and BV/TV (microCT, Figure 1C) data for the Sham+YKL group is interesting. 4 weeks of drug treatment may not be sufficient time to see changes in bone matrix deposition (measured by histomorphometry) ‘translate’ into increased trabecular bone by microCT. In addition, we note that there is a numerical increase in BV/TV in the Sham+YKL group compared to Sham+VEH (p=0.077). Therefore, the histomorphometry and microCT data here are internally consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

It is most important that they indicate where in the trabecular bone the uCT analysis was done in each of the groups of mice.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point. Indeed, <italic>Sik2/3</italic> deletion (with Dmp1-Cre or ubiquitin-Cre<sup>ERt2</sup>) causes increased trabecular bone area (presumably due cortical remodeling) and trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV, often referred to as trabecular bone mass) due to increased bone formation. We have revised the sentence on Page 6 accordingly. As indicated on page 6, we note growth plate expansion in response to Sik2/3 deletion with ubiquitin-CreERt2 (Figure 3B, 3E, 4A, and S5) along with dramatic changes in trabecular bone. The Methods section details how the 0.2 mm distal metaphyseal region was selected for trabecular bone micro-CT:</p><p>“Cancellous (trabecular) bone was assessed in the distal metaphysis and cortical bone was assessed in the mid-diaphysis. The femoral metaphysis region began 1,700 μm proximal to the distal growth plate and extended 1,500 μm distally.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The age of the DKO mice (6-9 weeks) used in Figures 3 and 4 is not appropriate to compare with the YKL-05-099-treated OVX mice (24 weeks old). The DKO mice are young, rapidly growing mice, as they note on p.6, 2nd paragraph. But then, they refer to them as adult-onset DKO in the next paragraph, and in the title of the legends. This is not correct; the mice will have just reached puberty at 6 weeks when the inducible DKO occurs. They must repeat this study with mice the same age as the OVX mice. They may obtain a milder effect of SIK deletion on the bone phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this very important comment, we have now performed additional experiments where <italic>Sik2</italic> and <italic>Sik3</italic> were deleted in older (12 week old) animals followed by analysis 4 weeks later. As shown in new Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-I, these mice show dramatic changes in trabecular bone and serum bone turnover markers that are largely consistent with what was observed in younger mutant animals. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, the figure legends have been modified to indicate that we are studying postnatal-onset of global Sik2/3 deletion in our studies in Figures 3 and 4. Deletion of <italic>Sik2/3</italic> in 12 week old mice also did not change serum glucose or BUN levels, as indicated in the manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Why did they examine the metabolic parameters at 8 weeks of age, not 9, which is when they killed the other mice? Also, were all the mice fasted for the same 3 h? What time is ZT3? Perhaps the increase in blood glucose and BUN caused by YKL-05-099 were because of the age differences?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We analyzed metabolic parameters at 2 weeks post tamoxifen, a time point when ubiquitin-Cre<sup>ERt2</sup>-mediated gene deletion is clearly noted. We reasoned that shorter time periods may be preferred for potential changes in serum parameters, while slightly longer time points may be better suited to phenotypic skeletal analyses. ZT3 means 3 hours after lights are turned on (~10am in our animal facility).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. In Figure 5, it seems that the 4-OHT has effects on the abundance of SIK2 and SIK3, and there is less protein in vehicle-treated DKO cells, suggesting the Cre is leaky. They also need to show the abundance of SIK1.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there are no commercially-available SIK1 antibodies that are suitable to detect endogenous murine SIK1 protein. For this reason, we developed a genomic DNA based assay to assess SIK1 gene deletion in vitro (Figure 5A, 6A) and in bone genomic DNA samples (Figure 3A). We agree that the immunoblotting data shown in Figure 5B suggested possible differences in protein loading. For this reason, we repeated this experiment, and in revised Figure 5C now show consistent loading and clear 4-OHT-mediated SIK2 and SIK3 protein deletion in DKO bone marrow macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Figure 7. shows that YKL-05-099 may inhibit a number of tyrosine kinases. They need to address the possibility that some of the effects they observe are due to other kinases than SIKs and the CSF1R. The effect on the growth plate may be similar to that of gefitinib and the off-target effects could be due to inhibition of other kinases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. While changes in growth plate chondrocyte hypertrophy were observed in <italic>Sik2/3<sup>f/f</sup></italic> ; ubiquitin-Cre<sup>ERt2</sup> mice (Figure 3B, 3E, 4A, and S5), we did not observe changes in growth plate or bone length in mice treated with YKL-05-099 (Figure 2). Revised Supplemental Table 1 now shows comparable femur bone length measurements in all mice irrespective of drug treatment. We acknowledge the possibility that additional off-target effects may be responsible for the biologic activity seen with YKL-05-099, as discussed and addressed in more detail below (see response to Reviewer 3, point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Why did they use such a high dose (15 uM) of YKL-05-099 in Figure 8E, F and G? This might be toxic.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. Initially, we chose to use high doses of YKL-05-099 in these short-term studies in order to see clear treatment effects. In response to this well-taken criticism, we have performed additional experiments to establish the dose response relationship for the effects of YKL-05-099 on M-CSF signaling in bone marrow macrophages. In new Figure 8—figure supplement 1, we now show data indicating that sub-µM doses of YKL-05-099 also show similar inhibitory effects on M-CSF action in short term signaling (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A) and gene expression (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B) studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. How many times were the in vitro experiments repeated. This needs to be mentioned in the methods or legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have now added information in all relevant figure legends indicating the number of times each in vitro study was repeated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should present osteoclast surface or number in figure 2D because ES/BS can be affected by changes in bone formation. Specifically, an increase in bone formation can reduce eroded surface even if osteoclast number does not change.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We have revised Figure 2 to now include histomorphometry data measuring osteoclast numbers (N.Oc/B.Pm) which previously was only shown in Supplemental Table 3. In general, osteoclast numbers correlate with eroded surface measurements in our histomorphometry results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study, Tang and colleague report that the multikinase inhibitor YKL-05-099 increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption in hypogonadal female mice with mechanisms that are likely to involve inhibition of SIKs and CSFR1, respectively. The authors also report that postnatal mice with inducible, global deletion of SIK2 and SIK3 show an increase of bone mass that is associated to both an augmentation of bone formation and bone resorption.</p><p>The paper provides novel and interesting information with potentially highly relevant translational implications. The quality of the data is outstanding and most of the authors' conclusions are supported by the data as shown.</p><p>1. Measurements of osteoclast number upon pharmacological treatments should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 has been revised to include osteoclast numbers (these data were previously only shown in Supplemental Table 3), a request also made by the other two reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the experimental evidence that the increase of bone formation observed in mice treated with YKL-05-099 is mediated by SIKs inhibition? It would be helpful if the authors could discuss this point in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. Unfortunately, it is not possible to rigorously demonstrate that the bone anabolic effect of YKL-05-099 is due to targeting salt inducible kinases. The fifth paragraph of the Discussion has been revised accordingly:</p><p>“Finally, while both Sik2/3 deletion and YKL-05-099 treatment potently stimulate bone formation, we acknowledge that future study is needed to definitively prove that the bone anabolic effect of YKL-05-099 in vivo is due to targeting these two kinases. Currently, reagents (such as mice expressing an inhibitor-resistant SIK2<sup>T96Q</sup> allele (63)) to rigorously address this question are not available.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
