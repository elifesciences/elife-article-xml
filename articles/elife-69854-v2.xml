Although fibrosis accompanies many cardiac pathologies and is generally deleterious, the role of fibroblasts in maintaining the basal ECM network and in fibrosis in vivo is poorly understood. We genetically ablated fibroblasts in mice to evaluate the impact on homeostasis of adult ECM and cardiac function after injury. Fibroblast-ablated mice demonstrated a substantive reduction in cardiac fibroblasts, but fibrillar collagen and the ECM proteome were not overtly altered when evaluated by quantitative mass spectrometry and N-terminomics. However, the distribution and quantity of collagen VI, microfibrillar collagen that forms an open network with the basement membrane, was reduced. In fibroblast-ablated mice, cardiac function was better preserved following angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE)-induced fibrosis and myocardial infarction (MI). Analysis of cardiomyocyte function demonstrated altered sarcomere shortening and slowed calcium decline in both uninjured and AngII/PE-infused fibroblast-ablated mice. After MI, the residual resident fibroblasts responded to injury, albeit with reduced proliferation and numbers immediately after injury. These results indicate that the adult mouse heart tolerates a significant degree of fibroblast loss with a potentially beneficial impact on cardiac function after injury. The cardioprotective effect of controlled fibroblast reduction may have therapeutic value in heart disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fibroblast</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL074257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallquist</surname><given-names>Michelle D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL115505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuwabara</surname><given-names>Jill T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRE29630019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuwabara</surname><given-names>Jill T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRNT33660474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tallquist</surname><given-names>Michelle D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRE834732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jasmine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apte</surname><given-names>Suneel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul G.

The main physiological role of the cardiac fibroblast is to maintain the ECM by balancing the deposition and degradation of structural ECM proteins and non-structural matricellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tallquist and Molkentin, 2017</xref>). This ECM network serves as a scaffolding that mechanically supports cardiomyocytes, transmits force, and regulates mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borg and Caulfield, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weber, 1989</xref>). It is thought that ECM-cytoskeletal connections are essential for proper stability and contraction of the cardiomyocyte, indeed, disruptions in these interactions underlie a wide range of cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey and Leinwand, 2011</xref>). In addition to matrix production, fibroblasts can functionally couple with cardiomyocytes via connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ongstad and Kohl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camelliti et al., 2004</xref>). Although the ECM network is thought to be primarily synthesized and organized by cardiac fibroblasts and integral to proper cardiomyocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eghbali et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eghbali et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ieda et al., 2009</xref>), there is limited data on homeostatic, fibroblast-specific ECM production in vivo and the potential impact of altering fibroblast numbers in the adult heart.</p><p>In response to cardiac injury, fibroblasts rapidly adopt an activated phenotype resulting in increased proliferation and deposition of a collagen-rich ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore-Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). An initial adaptive response maintains structural integrity of the damaged myocardium and prevents rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cleutjens et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Factor et al., 1987</xref>). However, prolonged and excessive ECM deposition impairs cardiac compliance due to ventricular wall stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talman and Ruskoaho, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frangogiannis, 2019</xref>) and can also disrupt electrical transmission between cardiomyocytes leading to contractile dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltrami et al., 1994</xref>). Despite its clinical and pathophysiological significance, no interventions currently exist to mitigate or reverse cardiac fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gourdie et al., 2016</xref>). The cardiac fibroblast has emerged as an ideal candidate to regulate fibrosis that accompanies cardiac injury, but its role remains relatively obscure.</p><p>Recent studies have focused on genetically targeting myofibroblasts or activated fibroblasts as a potential therapy for heart disease because of their contribution to fibrotic scar formation and subsequently reduced heart function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore-Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanisicak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molkentin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>). When chimeric antigen receptor-T cells were used to specifically target an endogenous cell-surface glycoprotein on activated fibroblasts, fibrosis was reduced, leading to better cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aghajanian et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, ablation of activated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>) or activated fibroblast-specific depletion of <italic>Grk2</italic>, a downstream effector of G protein-coupled receptors known to be elevated in patients with heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Travers et al., 2017</xref>), was shown to be cardioprotective following injury. While these studies suggest beneficial outcomes from fibroblast reduction, others have observed increased lethality and ventricular wall rupture, presumably due to reduced ECM deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanisicak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molkentin et al., 2017</xref>). When <italic>Hsp47</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Fstl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kretzschmar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maruyama et al., 2016</xref>), or <italic>Smad3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kong et al., 2018</xref>) were disrupted in activated fibroblasts, decreased cardiac function and rupture were observed. Taken together, these data suggest that manipulation of fibroblast numbers and matrix deposition may require a more nuanced approach based on improved fundamental knowledge. Considering that anti-fibrotic therapies are currently being proposed as treatments for heart pathologies, a thorough evaluation and understanding of fibroblast activities during tissue homeostasis is necessary but is presently unavailable.</p><p>Given the lack of data specifically addressing fibroblast functions in the uninjured heart, we reduced fibroblast numbers in the adult murine heart using an inducible fibroblast-specific Cre line. Surprisingly, no mortality resulted, even though fibroblast loss was sustained up to 7 months post-induction. Moreover, heart function, protein composition, and proteolytic turnover were largely well-maintained despite the level of fibroblast depletion. Analysis of matrix components, such as type I, IV, and VI collagen, demonstrated that the type I collagen fibrillar network appeared relatively unchanged, whereas changes in microfibrillar collagen and basement membrane components were observed. Fibroblast-ablated hearts also showed improved function after myocardial infarction (MI) and angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE) infusion, suggesting that an underlying reduction in fibroblast numbers or cardiac adaptation to fewer fibroblasts may be protective. Our findings reveal that fibroblast reduction before injury does not negatively affect the heart and may provide beneficial effects when cardiac remodeling or repair are provoked by injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic ablation of fibroblasts during cardiac homeostasis</title><p>After heart injury, fibroblasts are essential for the generation of replacement fibrous ECM, and multiple studies have suggested that disruption of fibroblast expansion may lead to wall rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanisicak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molkentin et al., 2017</xref>). Although it is thought that fibroblasts are indispensable for maintaining ECM structure during cardiac homeostasis, we recently demonstrated that a loss of up to 50% of resident fibroblasts was inconsequential for the architecture and function of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivey et al., 2019</xref>). These results led us to investigate whether the heart can tolerate a further reduction in fibroblast numbers. As PDGFRα is expressed in a majority of murine adult cardiac fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>), we induced diphtheria toxin A (DTA) expression using a <italic>Pdgfra<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> mouse line to deplete resident fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2018</xref>). The DTA expression following tamoxifen treatment led to fibroblast loss within several days. We refer to these mice as fibroblast-ablated or ablated. Cre activity, indicated by a tdTomato reporter, demonstrated that a reduction in PDGFRα lineage cells occurred by 14 days post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To investigate fibroblast reduction by an orthogonal approach, we assayed for vimentin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ali et al., 2014</xref>), which showed fewer vimentin-positive cells in ablated hearts compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we determined if other cell populations activated collagen production in compensation using a transgenic collagen reporter, collagen1a1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<italic>Col1a1</italic>-GFP). This reporter expresses GFP under the control of the <italic>Col1a1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore-Morris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yata et al., 2003</xref>). An overall reduction in collagen-expressing cells was observed in the ablated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C–E</xref>), suggesting that PDGFRα-expressing fibroblasts remain the primary producers of type I collagen even after their numbers are decreased. Reduced reporter activity was not limited to the ventricles, as reductions were also observed in the atria and septum, while aortic expression of the GFP reporter remained relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The reduced level of cells with type I collagen promoter activity persisted 7–15 months after ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting compensation for fibroblast loss does not occur by the expansion of the remaining PDGFRα or other cell populations for up to one year after ablation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of fibroblasts in adult ablated hearts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of PDGFRα lineage (tdTomato), vimentin immunostaining, and <italic>Col1a1</italic>-GFP reporter fluorescence in the left ventricular (LV) myocardium.

TAILS is an N-terminomics method that specifically identifies proteolytically cleaved (internal) peptides by labeling free N-termini at the protein level prior to trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleifeld et al., 2010</xref>). These free N-termini are a result of either proteolytic cleavage by proteases or proteins undergoing natural processes such as alternate splicing or removal of signal/pro/trans peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, to distinguish between naturally occurring processes and proteolytically cleaved peptides, further bioinformatics tools were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fortelny et al., 2015</xref>) to determine the position of the identified peptide within the protein and if the peptide matched with the known cleavage site for these natural processes they were considered as natural peptides and were ruled out as proteolytically cleaved peptides. The remaining peptides were further filtered and considered only if they had an isobaric tag at the N-terminus as these free N-terminus are most likely generated by proteolytic cleavages and not by trypsin digestion. Statistical tests were applied to determine quantitative differences based on the isobaric tag ratios between the two cohorts. The 8-plex iTRAQ TAILS analysis identified a total of 1834 blocked/labeled N-termini, of which 1519 were internal N-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Of these 1519 internal peptides, 62 peptides were differentially abundant and of these, 15 high confidence internal peptides corresponding to 8 proteins were more abundant in fibroblast-ablated hearts as compared to controls, implying higher proteolytic modification of these proteins, whereas 54 internal peptides corresponding to 30 proteins had higher abundance in controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c and d</xref>), thus, reconfirming that ablation of fibroblasts leads to less proteolytic activity.

Several proteolytic cleavages were detected in other cellular proteins, especially actin isoforms, but no ECM-derived internal peptides were identified as statistically significant.

Cardiomyocyte function was measured by recording contraction and calcium transients in individual cardiomyocytes. At baseline, we found that cardiomyocytes from ablated hearts had reduced sarcomeric shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), increased departure velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and slower relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Differences were also observed in sarcomeric shortening and systolic velocity after 14 days of AngII/PE infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Because calcium is a major determinant of cardiac contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz and Lorell, 2000</xref>), we examined intracellular calcium kinetics in cardiomyocytes from fibroblast-ablated hearts. Calcium amplitude during contraction was similar between cardiomyocytes from control and ablated hearts at baseline and after AngII/PE infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). After AngII/PE infusion, calcium amplitude in cardiomyocytes increased from baseline, indicating the expected response to drug infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Calcium kinetics, indicated by the decay time constant and the time to reach baseline, was slower at baseline and after AngII/PE infusion in fibroblast-ablated hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). These data suggest that sarcomere shortening and calcium handling are altered in cardiomyocytes after fibroblast reduction. Data from TAILS analysis also supports changes in cardiomyocyte contraction, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial respiration, as internal peptides from proteins involved in these processes were significantly changed in abundance in fibroblast-ablated hearts compared to controls.

We next sought to understand how hearts with pre-existing resident fibroblast loss fared after MI. To address this question, we permanently ligated the left anterior descending (LAD) artery &gt;7 weeks post- induction. At 10 weeks post-MI, ~77% of control mice (7/9) and 100% of ablated mice (7/7) survived. Compared to controls, fibroblast ablation did not affect cardiac mass or lung weight, which are key parameters of left-sided heart failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>).

Interestingly, among collagen-expressing cells, proliferation was reduced in hearts with reduced fibroblast numbers, suggesting that fibroblast numbers cannot be explained by an increase in the proliferation rates in the remaining fibroblast population. Taken together, these data suggest that the similar number of fibroblasts within the lesion may result by recruitment of existing fibroblasts rather than alternative origins of fibroblasts or increased proliferation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our knowledge of fibroblast biology in the injured heart is rapidly expanding. Because fibroblast-targeting is being contemplated as a mitigation strategy in fibrosis-associated cardiovascular diseases, an understanding of the homeostatic roles of fibroblasts is a crucial first step in this process. Fibroblasts are thought to be the primary source of type I collagen, and homeostatic collagen turnover and synthesis in the rat heart is estimated to be between 6 and 9% per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mays et al., 1991</xref>). Yet, our study reveals that the murine adult heart is functionally indistinguishable after sustaining fibroblast reduction for up to 7 months after ablation. Even though a complete ablation of fibroblasts was not obtained, the remaining fibroblasts did not expand and repopulate the heart. Despite this substantial loss of fibroblasts, proteomics of the decellularized ventricles did not detect massive changes in protein abundance, with type I collagen protein remaining relatively normal and fibrillar organization retained. Proteomics analysis was challenged by the high abundance of cardiomyocyte components relative to ECM, ECM post-translational modifications, and limited extractability of cross-linked components. Nonetheless, the collective data suggest that ECM in the unchallenged adult heart, once formed, is stable and has a low turnover rate, consistent with results from multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry, suggesting that ECM proteins have half-lives on the order of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The significant changes identified by TAILS in fibroblast-ablated hearts were surprisingly few in number and did not include any ECM-derived peptides, despite extensive offline fractionation prior to LC-MS/MS and identification of a large number of internal protein N-termini, suggesting that fibroblast depletion may not dramatically impact ECM proteolysis. One explanation is that although fibroblasts are primarily responsible for ECM degradation and deposition, there may be relatively low turnover at baseline in healthy hearts, and a 60–80% loss of these cells may not result in a significant change in protein composition. Alternatively, it is possible that the high sample complexity introduced by abundant cardiomyocyte proteins may have reduced the yield of ECM peptides, consistent with the finding that of the 1834 peptides, only 4.3% originated in secreted/ECM proteins. Nevertheless, this approach, in addition to label-free quantitation (LFQ)-proteomics and cardiac function analysis, also supports a relatively mild impact of fibroblast ablation overall on the heart, although significant changes in several contractile proteins and metabolic enzymes were identified. Perhaps, one potent contributor to unaltered ECM turnover is the unexpected reduction of proteolytic activity detected by gelatin zymography. Indeed, in addition to gelatin, MMP2 and MMP9, the enzymes principally detected by gelatin zymography are known to cleave numerous ECM components.</p><p>In support of previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivey et al., 2019</xref>), there was no mechanism within the heart that signals fibroblast replenishment even with reductions up to 75%. It has been suggested that cardiac fibroblasts are heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skelly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farbehi et al., 2019</xref>), and there is a possibility that a PDGFRα-negative fibroblast population compensates for fibroblast loss. However, analysis of total heart RNA argues that type I collagen transcript and reporter transgene levels remain reduced. Thus, in an undamaged heart, a reduction in collagen synthesis might be balanced by an equal reduction in collagen degradation, another action that has been primarily attributed to fibroblasts.</p><p>While severe changes to fibrillar collagen were not observed, there were more notable differences in the basement membrane and microfibrillar collagen surrounding cardiomyocytes. Therefore, these data suggest that fibroblasts produce factors, including matricellular proteins that may stabilize the fibrillar collagen network or its interactions with the cardiomyocyte basement membrane. Because collagen VI is secreted by fibroblasts and connects the basement membrane to fibrillar collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Naugle et al., 2006</xref>), we suspected that the observed basement membrane alterations in fibroblast-ablated hearts may be directly due to fibroblast loss. Alternatively, it is also possible that the observed basement membrane changes may be indirectly caused by disruption of collagen matrix organization or that the basement membrane and cell-proximate networks are not as well protected from a turnover as cross-linked collagen. Collagen VI was reported to be overexpressed in hypertension, diabetes, and post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Naugle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiro and Crowley, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that <italic>Col6a1</italic> knockout mice had improved heart function after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luther et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, our results are consistent with previous data in that the observed reduction in collagen VI at baseline and after 14 days of AngII/PE could, in part, explain the cardioprotective effect in fibroblast-ablated hearts after injury.</p><p>Because contraction is dependent on cardiomyocyte adhesion to the ECM which is mediated by the basement membrane, we expected to observe a disruption of cardiomyocyte contraction in fibroblast-ablated hearts. Indeed, our study is among the first to demonstrate that in vivo modulation of the ECM by fibroblasts leads to altered myocyte function. One explanation is that the disrupted basement membrane in ablated hearts could decrease myofilament calcium sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). While we did not examine free calcium in our hearts, the disrupted basement membrane could alter myofilament adhesion leading to reduced contraction of the sarcomeres. Changes in contraction efficiency could also be a result of the observed altered proteolysis of proteins that are part of the contractile machinery, such as myosin-6. Thin filament proteins can undergo modifications, such as proteolysis leading to thin filament deactivation and slowed myocardial relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biesiadecki et al., 2014</xref>). In response to AngII/PE infusion, decreased cardiomyocyte shortening and sustained normal cardiac functions were observed in fibroblast-ablated hearts. Therefore, we hypothesized that fibroblast loss predisposes the heart to physiological, rather than pathological hypertrophy in response to drug-induced fibrosis. However, because we analyzed hearts only after two weeks of AngII/PE infusion, long-term injury models should be examined to determine whether physiological hypertrophy is sustained over time in fibroblast-ablated hearts.</p><p>Because activated fibroblasts are key contributors to scar formation, fibroblasts have increasingly become a target of interest in combating heart disease. However, studies that have focused on specifically reducing activated fibroblasts or targeting genes in activated fibroblasts to attenuate pathological fibrosis have produced conflicting results. In some circumstances, fibroblast disruption leads to rupture while in other scenarios manipulations of fibroblasts appear to be protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanisicak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khalil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molkentin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aghajanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Travers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kretzschmar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maruyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kong et al., 2018</xref>). Our work further demonstrates that resident fibroblast reduction prior to injury may have beneficial outcomes under certain pathological conditions. Similarly, depletion of the resident fibroblast population prior to AngII/PE infusion reduced reactive fibrosis; however, replacement fibrosis was not affected after MI. We suspect that the collagen differences between these two injury types may be a result of replacement fibrosis leading to a more rapid and robust fibroblast expansion with MI compared to AngII/PE. We observed very few ruptures of the ventricular wall, in contrast to what has been previously reported with fibroblast manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanisicak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molkentin et al., 2017</xref>). Several distinctions between our model and those in other reports are that we removed fibroblasts several weeks prior to injury and the remaining fibroblasts are wild-type, while the previous studies were primarily targeting an activated, periostin-expressing fibroblast population. Our results suggest that lowering initial fibroblast levels could have beneficial effects in pathological conditions particularly in response to reactive fibrosis.</p><p>While we did not evaluate the ECM protein composition of the fibrotic scar, we predict that the ECM prior to injury may be altered resulting in subtle changes in matrix organization and stiffness. Although our proteomics data did not detect large differences in ECM components of fibroblast-ablated hearts at baseline, the differentially abundant ECM proteins that were observed could contribute to the protective response after injury. Because depletion of fibroblasts occurs several weeks before injury, the heart may have adapted prior to insult. Moreover, fibroblast loss increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to injury implicating a dynamic interaction between fibroblast and cardiomyocytes during pathology. Further investigation of the cardioprotective effect of resident fibroblast depletion will provide insights into the potential efficacy of anti-fibrotic therapies and delineate the long-term effects on the ECM and cardiac function.</p><p>In summary, these studies demonstrate the surprising finding that a significant reduction in cardiac fibroblasts is not detrimental to basal heart function. These observations suggest that cardiac tissue and especially the ECM may be very resilient. Further studies to determine the level of fibroblast loss that can be tolerated by cardiac tissue are warranted. Fibroblast loss prior to injury potentially resulted in a type of pre-conditioning that may be cardioprotective after injury. Further examination of the effect of fibroblast ablation after injury will provide insight into whether manipulation of the fibroblasts at specific stages of the pathological response may also have therapeutic value. Our study reinforces the idea that controlled fibroblast reduction may be a potential strategy for reducing maladaptive fibrosis in heart failure and other sustained cardiac diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal protocols and experiments were approved by the University of Hawaii at Manoa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Fixed tissue was washed with distilled H<sub>2</sub>O and decellularized in 10% NaOH until the tissue was clear. Decellularized tissue was washed in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O twice for 30 min, and then washed overnight at room temperature. Tissue was fixed with 4% tannic acid for 4 hr, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and dried in a Tousimis Samdri-795 critical point dryer. Samples were mounted on aluminum stubs with double-stick carbon tape and coated with gold/palladium in a Hummer 6.2 sputter coater.

The timing of decellularization was determined by DNA quantification using DAPI staining to confirm the lack of cells in tissue samples. Decellularized cardiac tissue was washed in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O with protease inhibitor three times for 5 min at room temperature with light agitation, and then washed overnight to completely remove detergent. Decellularized tissue was placed in 200 μL of Protein Extraction Reagent type 4 with protease inhibitor and sonicated 10 times for 10 s. At least 100 μg of protein was sent to the University of Mississippi Medical Center for mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry experiments were performed blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Proteomics of decellularized tissue</title><p>Lysates from decellularized heart tissue were obtained as described above and reduced, alkylated, and trypsin-digested into peptides. The peptides were cleaned using a Sep-Pak Vac C18 cartridge (Waters Corporation) and analyzed label-free by LC-MS/MS using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). A 15 cm Å ~75 μm C18 column (5 μm particles with 100 Å pore size) was used and the nano-ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC )run at 300 nL/min with a 150 min linear acetonitrile gradient (from 5 to 35% B over 150 min; A=0.2% formic acid in water; B=0.2% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile). The MS/MS was set up with the exclusion of 25s, and the samples were run with high-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 30% and an isolation width of 2m/z. The resolution setting was 70,000 for target values of the MS at 1e6 ions and in MS2 at a resolution setting of 17,500 for 1e5 ions. Mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.</p><p>The RAW files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Fisher). Precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Dynamic modification was set to oxidation (+15.995 Da [M]) and static modification was set to carbamidomethyl (+57.021 Da [C]). Samples were searched against the reviewed mouse database downloaded from Uniprot (on November 2018, with 16977 sequences). A strict false discovery rate of 1% was applied. Label-free quantification was done based on precursor ion intensity and normalization was done using the total peptide amount (from all peptides identified). Proteins were included only if they were identified by at least two high-confidence peptides.</p><p>For further visualizations such as multi-scatter plots, PCA, volcano plot, and heat map, normalized abundances from all the samples were imported in Perseus 1.6.5.0. Values were log 2(x) transformed and data were filtered by excluding proteins that were not identified in at least 50% of the samples. The missing values for proteins present in &gt;50%, but not all samples were imputed from the normal distribution feature. Multi-scatter plots and PCA analysis were performed using all proteins, whereas only ECM proteins were used for generating the volcano plot and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Perseus software was used to perform a t-test with inbuilt multiple hypothesis testing corrections using a permutation-based false discovery rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Heart degradomics using TAILS</title><p>A two-step protein extraction method was performed. The first used a commercially available mild detergent T-Per tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and the second used 4 M GuHCl to solubilize the remaining pellet. Samples were prepared for TAILS analysis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, heart tissue was homogenized in 0.5 mL of T-Per on ice and centrifuged, the supernatant was collected in a fresh tube (T-Per extract) and 4 M GuHCl containing a protease-inhibitor cocktail was added to the pellet, and incubated further at 4°C for 24 hr on a rotary shaker (GuHCl extract). All subsequent processing was done separately for T-Per and GuHCl extracts. Protein estimation was done using the Bradford assay and 200 µg of protein from each heart was denatured, reduced, and alkylated as per the iTRAQ labeling protocol (SciX). The iTRAQ labels were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide and samples were incubated with iTRAQ labels for 2 hr in the dark. Excess iTRAQ reagent was quenched by incubation with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min in the dark. After labeling, the respective extracts were combined (i.e. T-Per extracts combined with GuHCl extracts) for subsequent handling and MS analysis. After methanol-chloroform precipitation, the pellet was reconstituted in 100 µL of 100 mM NaOH, 50 µL of H2O, and 100 µL of 100 mM HEPES. Samples were digested overnight with trypsin (1:50 ratio) at 37°C. Peptide quantitation was performed using Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay kit (Thermo Fisher, 23275) and 500 µg of each sample was retained for analysis by MS (pre-TAILS sample; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The remaining sample was enriched for blocked N-Termini using HPG-ALD polymer to bind reactive (tryptic) N-termini (TAILS). Pre-TAILS and TAILS samples were fractionated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. About 32 fractions were collected which were pooled in bins to generate 4 final fractions for analysis on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer at the Lerner Research Institute Proteomics and Metabolomics Core. A small portion of the unfractionated sample was also retained and analyzed on the mass spectrometer. C18 clean-up of samples was done prior to LC-MS/MS. Bioinformatics analysis was done and N-termini identified with a false discovery rate of &lt;1% were annotated essentially as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>MI</title><p>Adult mice &gt;22.0 g were subjected to MI as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ieda et al., 2009</xref>).

Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane and mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet, 2001, 2002, or 2004) were implanted subcutaneously. A combination of 1.5 μg/g/day angiotensin II (Calbiochem, 05-23-0101) and 50 μg/g/day phenylephrine hydrochloride (Sigma, P6126) or saline, was infused for 7, 14, or 28 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Echocardiography was performed using a Vevo 2100 system (VisualSonics) to analyze cardiac function after MI and AngII/PE infusion. Systolic function was analyzed in conscious mice. Briefly, hair removal cream was applied to the chest to remove all fur. A layer of ultrasound gel was applied to the animal’s chest, and the probe was lowered at the parasternal line, 90° between the probe and the heart. B- and M-modes were performed to record 2-dimensional and 1-dimensional transverse cardiac measurements and used to analyze LV function. Independent echocardiography on mice 7 months post-induction at The Ohio State University also found no differences in cardiac measurements between control and fibroblast-ablated hearts.</p><p>Diastolic function was measured in mice anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Anesthesia and body temperature were maintained at 1% isoflurane and 37°C, respectively. M-mode in the short axis at the level of papillary muscles was used to measure systolic function. The 4-chamber apical view with color and tissue Doppler mode was used to measure E/A and E/E’ ratios. All measurements were performed by an experienced operator blinded to the mouse genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Pressure-volume loop</title><p>Cardiac hemodynamic measurements were assessed via a closed chest approach using a 1.4 rodent pressure-volume catheter (Transonic) advanced into the left ventricle through the right carotid artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shettigar et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (55 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) plus xylazine (15 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) in saline solution and placed in the supine position on a heat pad. Following a midline neck incision, the underlying muscles were pulled to expose the carotid artery. Using a 4–0 suture, the artery was tied and the pressure-volume catheter was advanced through the artery into the left ventricle of the heart. After 5–10 min of stabilization, values at baseline and stimulation at varying frequencies (4–10 Hz) were recorded. To measure the beta-adrenergic response, 5 mg kg<sup>–1</sup> dobutamine was injected IP. All the measurements and analysis were performed on LabChart7 (ADInstruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Cardiomyocyte CSA quantification</title><p>Cardiomyocyte boundaries were identified by WGA labeling in 10 μm tissue sections that were processed as described above.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with an IP injection of tribromoethanol (0.4 mg/g of body weight), the thoracic cavity was opened, and descending aorta was severed. The right ventricle was immediately flushed with EDTA buffer and the ascending aorta was clamped. The heart was excised and the left ventricle was perfused with EDTA and perfusion buffer. The heart was enzymatically digested with 0.5 mg/mL Collagenase Type II (Worthington, LS004176), 0.5 mg/mL Collagenase Type IV (Worthington, LS004188), and 0.05 mg/mL Protease Type XIV (Sigma, P5147). The atria and valves were removed and tissue was teased apart. Cells were dissociated by gentle trituration with a wide-bore pipette tip and cell suspension was filtered through a 100 μM nylon strainer. Cells were allowed to settle by gravity for 20 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended with Tyrode’s solution (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and contraction measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Measurement of cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title><p>Cardiomyocytes were loaded with 2 μM Fura-2 (Thermo Fisher, F1201) in Tyrode’s solution for 15 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Christopher L-H Huang as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1. and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are positive about the work, but between them, generate a large number of significant revisions, likely because of the unexpected findings in this study. This is reflected in one of the evaluation studies which suggest that &quot;This study is extremely well done, rigorous, and offers valuable insight for investigators interested in fibrosis, cardiac fibroblast biology, and mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling&quot;, but however, &quot;….the finding is completely unexpected and the paper…. does not extend to the mechanistic depth is needed to understand the basis for the finding. For this reason this review includes all the detailed comments made by the reviewers, in addition to drawing attention to each of the major points indicated particularly from reviewers 2-3.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1) In some cases, the results are expressed a &quot;stained area/tissue area&quot;, when clearly it would have been more appropriate to provide cell counts. At least, they should provide FACS plots showing the gating used for quantification to reassure the readers that PDGFRa was expressed at comparable levels in mice of different ages. Given that it is now widely accepted that cardiac fibroblasts are heterogenous in many ways, it would be important to understand whether this ablation affects this heterogeneity.</p><p>2) The hearts contained somewhere between half and one third of their normal number of fibroblasts, suggesting that one or two cell divisions would be sufficient to bring these cells back to normal levels. Following an MI, these cells enter rapid proliferation, and their numbers increase significantly. What happens in the ablated heart to fibroblast numbers?</p><p>3) A time resolved analysis of PDGFRa cells in the context of the two damage models would be very informative and possibly hint at mechanism.</p><p>4) Does the increase in NG2 indicate an upregulation of the protein in mural cells or increase (maybe compensatory) in the numbers of mural cells? Adding mural cells to the FACS-based quantification of inflammatory, endothelial and fibroblastic cells would help in answering this.</p><p>5) The authors did not attempt to measure diastolic function in the fibroblast-ablated hearts following damage in either the MI or the Ang II/phenylephrine models. The parameters they report are more relevant to systolic function (ejection fraction) and chamber dimension (LVID). However, I would have expected some measurement of transmitral flow such as E/A ratio or E wave deceleration time from a 4- chamber apical view, or even IVRT. This is important as ECM/fibrotic changes are expected to affect LV compliance/stiffness (i.e. diastolic function) usually before systolic involvement.</p><p>6) How was the collagen area measured in the 2 damaged models? By antibody staining or using Trichrome staining?</p><p>7) An important pathway that regulates calcium sensitivity and the actin cytoskeleton at the same time is the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. Did the authors find any changes in expression of the proteins in this pathway?</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>8) It is fascinating that no rupture is observed and that the relative collagen fraction between the ablated mice and controls is largely similar by 10 days. (A) Have the non-ablated fibroblasts proliferated and normalized the fibroblast numbers back to wild type levels? (B) Is it possible that collagen area as a percentage of tissue area may not be the most informative metric of fibrosis due to the significantly altered cardiac dimensions in mice with ablated fibroblasts? (C) It is puzzling that fibroblast ablation has so little impact on the ECM opening up questions regarding the cell state heterogeneity of the non ablated fibroblasts populations- are they all behaving like activated fibroblasts or matrifibrocytes to maintain the matrix?</p><p>9) This study paid a lot of attention to mechanisms of ECM deposition and remodeling but very little attention to degradation and turnover of the matrix. Are these mechanisms inhibited such that the matrix is no longer turning over once fibroblasts are ablated?</p><p>10) What is the basis for the reduction in collagen deposition observed for the Ang/PE model but not for the infarction model?</p><p>11) If the TAILS proteomics data suggests that cardiomyocyte remodeling may be occurring, is this finding reflected in the geometry of isolated myocytes at baseline measured for their contraction characteristics in figure 7?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(a) In the summary, there are a few ambiguities that slightly obscure the meaning: the term 'uninjured' is unclear; the following sentence [&quot;Analysis of cardiomyocyte function demonstrated weaker 42 contractions and slowed calcium decline in both uninjured and AngII/PE infused 43 fibroblast-ablated mice.&quot;] apparently differs from the comment that &quot;, cardiac function was better 40 preserved following angiotensin II/phenylephrine (AngII/PE)-induced fibrosis and 41 myocardial infarction&quot;.</p><p>(b) The Introduction is an appropriate review of the role of fibroblasts in cellular matrix formation and matrix formation, but should be slightly revised to provide a brief paragraph on the relationships between fibroblasts and the cardiomyocytes themselves, particularly in relation to influencing gap junction cohesion as well as, through their fusion, effects on capacitative properties of the cardiomyocyte syncytium with a potential for arrhythmic substrate.</p><p>(c) When the discussing the Results, the following merit further discussion.</p><p>(i) This appeared to be a system that did not show pathological hypertrophy: it exhibited downregulated cell adhesion, collagen binding, collagen fibril organization, and ECM organization, and upregulated membrane, mitochondrial and Z-disc genes, but an absence of uupregulation in Nppa, Nppb, and Myh7 and Myh6 genes related to pathological hypertrophy.</p><p>(ii) There was a contrast between: Normal indicators of excitation contraction coupling with similar ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in control and ablated cardiomyocytes both before and following AngII/PE infusion, with greater transients in the latter, in contrast to:</p><p>(iii) Mechanical indicators: Cardiomyocytes from ablated hearts showing reduced baseline sarcomeric shortening, speed of contraction with and slowed relaxation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors use an induction protocol that seems to lead to an efficiency of CRE activation somewhat below what has been reported for similar strains by others. They use a threshold of at least 45% reduction to include individual animals in the analysis. This does not seem a major improvement over their recent work in which they report the effects of a 50% reduction is minimal. Also, if their threshold is 45%, why do they keep referring to a 60 to 80% ablation in the text?</p><p>One important and surprising finding in this paper is that the cells surviving the ablation did not expand to make up for the lost numbers. However, I was surprised to see that most of the evaluation of the extent of depletion over time relied on the expression of PDGFRa itself, a gene whose expression has been reported to be modulated, that is expressed at different levels in different subsets (based on published scRNAseq data) and that is expressed by a single allele in this experimental setup. In some cases, the results are expressed a &quot;stained area/tissue area&quot;, when clearly it would have been more appropriate to provide cell counts. At least, they should provide FACS plots showing the gating used for quantification to reassure the readers that PDGFRa was expressed at comparable levels in mice of different ages. Given that it is now widely accepted that cardiac fibroblasts are heterogenous in many ways, it would be important to understand whether this ablation affects this heterogeneity. In other words, does ablation preferentially remove subpopulations of fibroblasts (such as more proliferative cells that express higher levels of Pdgfra) more than others? Knowledge of this may explain possible reasons for the lack of replenishment of fibroblasts. I think it would be worth using scRNAseq in this context.</p><p>The CRE strain used is active in a number of other organs and anatomical locations, ranging from lung fibroblast to adipogenic cells in fat depots to oligodendrocyte progenitors in the CNS. Did the authors look into these organs, or notice any systemic effects of their depletion protocol?</p><p>Based on the data presented, the hearts contained somewhere between half and one third of their normal number of fibroblasts, suggesting that one or two cell divisions would be sufficient to bring these cells back to normal levels. Following an MI, these cells enter rapid proliferation, and their numbers increase significantly. What happens in the ablated heart to fibroblast numbers? Do they increase as expected, do they plateau at lower or similar levels to the ones observed in controls? Does the scar still contain the same number of collagen-expressing cells?</p><p>A time resolved analysis of PDGFRa cells in the context of the two damage models would be very informative and possibly hint at mechanism, and I was surprised to see the analysis limited to one time point and performed by quantifying genes rather than cells themselves.</p><p>The proteomic analysis of the de-cellularized heart is a strong point of the paper. However, some of the changes observed may not be a direct effect of fibroblast ablation. For example, one of the proteins the authors reported to be upregulated in the fibroblast-ablated hearts is NG2, which is not expressed to any significant extent in fibroblasts. Rather, it is expressed at high levels in mural cells such as pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Does the increase in NG2 indicate an upregulation of the protein in mural cells or increase (maybe compensatory) in the numbers of mural cells? Adding mural cells to the FACS-based quantification of inflammatory, endothelial and fibroblastic cells would help in answering this.</p><p>I am a bit confused by the fact that the authors, although reported decreased LV internal diameter, found that cardiomyocytes did not increase in size. Usually, the reason for decreased chamber size would be hypertrophy, especially if it is observed in systole and diastole. How do the authors explain this?</p><p>I am surprised that the authors did not attempt to measure diastolic function in the fibroblast-ablated hearts following damage in either the MI or the Ang II/phenylephrine models. The parameters they report are more relevant to systolic function (ejection fraction) and chamber dimension (LVID). However, I would have expected some measurement of transmitral flow such as E/A ratio or E wave deceleration time from a 4- chamber apical view, or even IVRT. This is important as ECM/fibrotic changes are expected to affect LV compliance/stiffness (i.e. diastolic function) usually before systolic involvement.</p><p>How was the collagen area measured in the 2 damaged models? By antibody staining or using Trichrome staining? Why in the authors' opinion did fibroblast ablation decrease collagen area in the Ang II/phenylephrine model but not the MI model? Again these questions may be answered by analyzing the proliferative response to these insults.</p><p>A decrease in shortening without a decrease in calcium transient amplitude, as seen in the ablated hearts, indicates calcium desensitization. An important pathway that regulates calcium sensitivity and the actin cytoskeleton at the same time is the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway.

The flow cytometry demonstrates a relatively constant level of PDGFRa expression, independent of age, and the technique is sensitive to surface expression as we observed a decreased mean fluorescence intensity when animals were heterozygous for PDGFRa (as in the PDGFRa CreERT2/+ mice). As the reviewer was concerned about fibroblast heterogeneity, for updated analyses we have used Col1a1-GFP as an unbiased tag of collagen producing cells. The collagen GFP quantification identifies cells with type I collagen production and provides a non-PDGFRa focused view of the hearts at baseline, with aging, and after injury Figures 1A-E.</p><p>In regard to cell counts, in new data we have included cell counts/nuclei (Figure 1E, Figure 8 B, C, E). We agree with the reviewer that it is difficult to normalize cell counts. After injury, when quantifying fibroblasts, distinguishing individual fibroblasts, which have significant cellular extensions and increase in volume and can amass in one location is difficult. In addition, immune cell infiltration can vary greatly, altering the relative cell counts. In areas with cardiomyocytes, nuclear numbers can be skewed due to cardiomyocyte area. As these technical issues are most prevalent during MI and can confound quantification by IHC, we have included flow cytometry data to provide an additional perspective on cell number before and after MI Figures 1F and 8H,I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The hearts contained somewhere between half and one third of their normal number of fibroblasts, suggesting that one or two cell divisions would be sufficient to bring these cells back to normal levels.
