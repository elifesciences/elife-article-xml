regulation of pH. In vertebrates there are three family members: OTOP1 is required for formation of otoconia in the vestibular system and it forms the receptor for sour taste, while the functions of OTOP2 and OTOP3 are not yet known. Importantly, the gating mechanisms of any of the OTOP channels are not well understood. Here, we show that zinc (Zn<sup>2+)</sup>, as well as other transition metals including copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), potently activates murine OTOP3 (mOTOP3). Zn<sup>2+</sup> pre-exposure increases the magnitude of mOTOP3 currents to a subsequent acid stimulus by as much as 10-fold. In contrast, mOTOP2 currents are insensitive to activation by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Swapping the extracellular tm 11–12 linker between mOTOP3 and mOTOP2 was sufficient to eliminate Zn<sup>2+</sup> activation of mOTOP3 and confer Zn<sup>2+</sup> activation on mOTOP2. Mutation to alanine of H531 and E535 within the tm 11–12 linker and H234 and E238 within the 5–6 linker reduced or eliminated activation of mOTOP3 by Zn<sup>2+</sup>, indicating that these residues likely contribute to the Zn<sup>2+</sup> activating site. Kinetic modeling of the data is consistent with Zn<sup>2+</sup> stabilizing the opn2+en state of the channel, competing with H<sup>+</sup> for activation of the channels. These results establish the tm 11–12 and tm 5–6 linkers as part of the gating apparatus of OTOP channels and a target for drug discovery. Zn<sup>2+</sup> is an essential micronutrient and its activation of OTOP channels will undoubtedly have important physiological sequelae.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proton channel</kwd><kwd>sour taste</kwd><kwd>zinc</kwd><kwd>acid</kwd><kwd>otopetrin</kwd><kwd>ligand gating</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM131234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liman</surname><given-names>Emily R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM148591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldschen-Ohm</surname><given-names>Marcel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Members of the OTOP family of proton-selective ion channels, which includes the sour receptor OTOP1, are differentially sensitive to activation by zinc, which interacts with residues on tm 5-6 and 11-12 linkers that form part of the channel gating apparatus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pharmacological agents that can activate or inhibit ion channels have long been used as probes to describe the fundamental processes of channel gating and ion permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hille, 2001</xref>). For example, the discovery of the charged molecule TEA and the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin as a specific blocker of K<sup>+</sup> channels allowed for the early identification of residues lining the channel pore well before the channel structures were determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacKinnon et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yellen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, gating modifiers have been used to probe structural rearrangements that accompany the opening of voltage-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Swartz and MacKinnon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sack and Aldrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldschen-Ohm and Chanda, 2014</xref>). More recently, toxins that target pain-sensing ASIC and TRPV1 channels have been used to probe the conformational states of these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>). One of the most common modulators of channel activity is the trace metal zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), which can affect gating, permeation, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilly and Armstrong, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peralta and Huidobro-Toro, 2016</xref>). Zn<sup>2+</sup> binds to proteins with high affinity and specificity and regulates a wide range of cellular processes, including metabolism and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vallee and Falchuk, 1993</xref>). Zn<sup>2+</sup> is a potent inhibitor of proton transport molecules including the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 and the proton-selective ion channel OTOP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decoursey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bushman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Teng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>OTOP1 is a member of a family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurle et al., 2011</xref>), which includes, within vertebrates, two other members, OTOP2 and OTOP3, that also function as proton channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). OTOP proton channels are expressed throughout the body, where they play diverse and still poorly understood roles in pH sensing and homeostasis. In vertebrates and invertebrates, OTOP channels expressed in the gustatory system sense acids and function as sour taste receptors (OTOP1 for vertebrates; OTOPL1 for <italic>Drosophila</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ganguly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mi et al., 2021</xref>). In mice and zebrafish, OTOP1 plays an essential role in the formation of force-sensing calcium carbonate-based otoconia in the ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hurle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>), likely by regulating pH in the endolymph. OTOP2 and OTOP3 are both found throughout the digestive system, and their expression has been shown to correlate with disease progression in some forms of colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Most recently, an OTOP channel was shown to be critically involved in calcification and the formation of a skeleton in sea urchin embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given the recent discovery of OTOP proteins as forming ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tu et al., 2018</xref>), much remains to be discovered about how they function. For example, it was not known if the channels occupy open and closed states or if those terms even apply to these proteins, which bear no structural similarity to other ion channels, and that could conduct protons through a non-aqueous pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decoursey, 2003</xref>). Recently, we showed that OTOP channels are gated by extracellular protons, acting mostly likely on multiple titratable residues on the extracellular domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we report the first evidence that OTOP channels can be activated by Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. This confirms that OTOP channels are gated, like nearly all other ion channels. Using a chimeric channel approach and point mutations, we identify residues in the linkers between tm 11-12 and tm 5-6 that represent key determinants for and likely form the Zn<sup>2+</sup> activating site. We further propose that the elements of the gating apparatus of the channels that we identify are potential targets for pharmacological manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> both blocks and potentiates OTOP3 currents</title><p>While measuring the sensitivity of the three murine OTOP channels to inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup>, we noticed that mOTOP3 currents were larger following removal of Zn<sup>2+</sup> than before its introduction. We refer to this activating effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> as potentiation. For these and other experiments, murine OTOP channels were expressed in HEK-293 cells and studied by patch-clamp recording. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, all three murine OTOP channels carried inward currents in response to a pH 5.5 stimulus and were subsequently inhibited by 1 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> at pH 5.5. However, only mOTOP3 currents showed recovery during the Zn<sup>2+</sup> exposure and a large rebound, of nearly threefold, following its removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The potentiating effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> was dose-dependent over a concentration range of 0.1–10 mM and did not show evidence of saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This contrasts with the inhibitory effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on mOTOP3 currents, which for a stimulus of pH 5.5 showed clear saturation at 3 mM and could be fit with an IC<sub>50</sub>=0.31 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The difference in the dose dependence of inhibition and potentiation suggests that Zn<sup>2+</sup> interacts with distinct binding sites on the channels to produce the two effects (see below).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> blocks and potentiates mOTOP3 currents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces show Zn<sup>2+</sup> both inhibits and potentiates mOTOP3 currents.

The response to Zn<sup>2+</sup> was compared to the response in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the same cell. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, 3 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> caused a more than 10-fold increase in the peak current, the lowest concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, 0.3 mM, applied for up to 64 s produced only a negligible increase in the peak current and 1 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> had an intermediate effect. Thus, the potentiating effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, as measured by the peak current, was dose-dependent, with an apparent threshold of &gt;0.3 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Examination of the time dependence of the response showed increasing potentiation with exposure times up to ~16 s for concentrations of 1 and 3 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>, at which point the effect tended to saturate, although there was some variability from cell to cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to increasing the peak current, Zn<sup>2+</sup> pre-exposure also increased the apparent rate of activation to a pH 5.5 stimulus that otherwise slowly activates mOTOP3 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>). This change in apparent activation kinetics showed a dose and time dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At the higher concentrations (1 and 3 mM), an exposure of 1 s was sufficient to observe a maximal decrease in the time to peak current from ~4 s to &lt;1 s. At 0.3 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>, this effect required longer exposure times, and activation rates never reached the speed obtained with 1 s exposure to 1 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup>.

Thus, for this chimeric channel, the increase in fold potentiation mostly reflects the large decrease in the acid-induced currents, rather than an increase in the magnitude of the currents after Zn<sup>2+</sup> exposure and suggests that the 1–2 linker plays a role in acid activation of mOTOP3.</p><p>To determine if potentiating and inhibiting effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> were mediated by the same binding site, we next tested whether currents carried by O3/O2(L11–12) and other mOTOP3 chimeras retained sensitivity to inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup> following activation at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The data also suggest that a separate site with a faster off-rate mediates inhibition by Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, the channels may enter a state that is simultaneously activated (open gate) and inhibited. Upon removal of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, the channels may then transit through a fully open state, as the inhibition is relieved faster than the activation. To formally test these predictions, we generated a kinetic model reflecting these properties and asked if it could recapitulate our experimental observations.</p><p>We postulated a model comprised of interacting elements that can each transition between two configurations: a pore gate that is either closed or open, a binding site for protons, and two types of binding sites for Zn<sup>2+</sup> (one activating and one blocking), that are either unoccupied or occupied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). For a detailed description of this type of model representation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2014</xref>. The proton and activating Zn<sup>2+</sup> sites are energetically coupled to the pore such that binding speeds pore opening and/or slows pore closing. To model the competition of protons and Zn<sup>2+</sup> for the same activating site(s), we destabilized all states where both the proton and activating Zn<sup>2+</sup> sites are simultaneously occupied. We modeled the blocking Zn<sup>2+</sup> site as independent of all other model elements, except that when occupied all channel current is blocked. Simulated currents in response to the same pH and Zn<sup>2+</sup> protocols used in our experiments qualitatively describe our observed mOTOP3 current responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>), supporting the plausibility of our proposed mechanism. For example, the model recapitulates the rebound following addition and removal of Zn<sup>2+</sup> during an acid stimulus. It also recapitulates the speeding up of current activation for a pre-exposure to Zn<sup>2+</sup> at 0.3 mM, and the increase in current magnitudes with pre-exposure to Zn<sup>2+</sup> at 1 and 3 mM. It also qualitatively recapitulates the decay of the potentiated currents, which in the model is due to unbinding of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">3</xref>). Conceptually, upon occupancy of the activating site by Zn<sup>2+</sup> the channel will enter a potentiated state, and thereafter upon removal of Zn<sup>2+</sup> the channel will slowly return to its baseline activity in the absence of Zn<sup>2+</sup> with a time course that is largely described by the time course of Zn<sup>2+</sup> unbinding from the activating site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>).

At that time, mOTOP1 was shown to have near-perfect selectivity for protons over other ions, and to generate inward currents as the pH was lowered. Vertebrate OTOP2 and OTOP3, as well as invertebrate channels also carry inward proton currents in response to extracellular acidification, and where tested have been shown to function as proton-selective ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>). Nearly all descriptions regarding the functional properties of OTOP channels come from the heterologous expression of OTOP channels and save for the description of proton currents now attributed to mOTOP1 channels in taste cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bushman et al., 2015</xref>), all descriptions of OTOP channels postdate the discovery of the genes encoding the proton channels. That is, even by scouring the literature, it is difficult to find a description of a proton current that could be attributed to an OTOP channel in a native cell type. Thus, in contrast to K<sup>+</sup> channels where there was a vast literature regarding their functional properties before their cloning, for OTOP channels, this kind of information was not available.</p><p>Critically, before this work and that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>, it was not known if OTOP channels were gated, and if so by what. Here, we provide evidence that OTOP channels are gated by Zn<sup>2+</sup> and other transition metals. In the apo, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-free condition, mOTOP3 currents are small and slowly activating. With pre-exposure to 1–3 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> for several seconds, the currents increase in magnitude by up to 10-fold. This can only be explained if Zn<sup>2+</sup> either increases the probability that the channels open or produces a change in their conductance – gating them. We also find that pre-exposure to copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) strongly potentiates OTOP3 currents. Together with other recent evidence for pH-dependent gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>), we can now say with certainty that some OTOP channels are gated.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Structural considerations</title><p>The structures of two of the three OTOP channels have been reported at near-atomic resolution ([zebrafish OTOP1, chicken OTOP3, and <italic>Xenopus</italic> OTOP3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saotome et al., 2019</xref>)]. In addition, predictions are available for structures of mouse and human OTOP channels that appear to be reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>). All the structures to date share common features: The protomers assemble as dimers, and each protomer shows a twofold symmetry, leading to an overall pseudo-tetrameric stoichiometry. The four pseudo-subunits come together to form a central cavity that is filled with lipids and cannot support ion permeation. Instead, ions may permeate through the barrel-like structures formed from transmembrane domains 2–6 (N domain) and 8–12 (C domain) or at the intrasubunit interface (formed mostly by tm 6 and 12). From these static structures, it is not possible to tell if the channels are gated, and if so, what state they are in (open or closed). Based on the pH sensitivity of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>), we presume they are closed.</p><p>We have focused on mOTOP2 and mOTOP3, which show the most divergent functional properties. In addition to differences in the effects of Zn<sup>2+</sup> described here, we have also described differences in pH sensitivity of the two channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>). mOTOP3 is gated by protons, and thus conducts currents only in response to extracellular acidification (&lt;pH 5.5), while OTOP2 is constitutively open and conducts currents over a large pH range, including outward currents when the extracellular solution is alkalinized. The strikingly different functional properties of the two channels, but otherwise overall similar architecture, provided us the opportunity to identify motifs involved in gating using a chimeric approach.</p><p>Remarkably, we found that a short stretch of amino acids linking transmembrane domains 11–12 was necessary for Zn<sup>2+</sup> potentiation of mOTOP3 and sufficient to confer Zn<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive gating on mOTOP2. Within that stretch, we identified one amino acid, H531, mutations of which (to R or A) completely abolished Zn<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive gating in mOTOP3. As histidine is well documented to form part of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site in other Zn<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallee and Auld, 1990</xref>), including the voltage-gated proton channel HV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>), H531 likely contributes to coordinating Zn<sup>2+</sup> in mOTOP3. However, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is typically coordinated by sidechains of four or more residues, which in addition to the imidazole rings of histidine, includes sulfhydryl groups of cysteine, carboxyl group of acidic residues (aspartic and glutamic acid). Moreover, water can also participate in coordinating Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallee and Auld, 1990</xref>). In addition to H531, we have identified three other residues, H234, E238, and E535, that when mutated to alanine lead to reduced efficacy of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to potentiate mOTOP3. Based on the functional data provided in this paper and an AlphaFold structure of mOTOP3, we tentatively predict these four residues form the Zn<sup>2+</sup> activating binding site. Interestingly, alkali activation of mOTOP1 was recently shown to require a basic residue at a position equivalent to H531 in mOTOP3 and in the tm 11–12 linker at a position close to H234 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tian et al., 2023</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding could bring together residues in the tm 5–6 linker and tm 11–12 linker that are at a distance in the closed state (8 Å; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) to stabilize an open state, as shown for other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordon and Zagotta, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).

The dual blocking and potentiating effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> make it likely that the enhanced activity would be mostly evident under conditions where Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations dropped rapidly or that favored binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to its activating site over its blocking site.

After a gigaohm seal was formed and whole-cell recording was achieved, the cell was lifted and moved in front of the microcapillary tubes. The membrane potentials were held at –80 mV unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Patch-clamp electrophysiology solutions</title><p>Tyrode’s solution contained 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM dextrose, 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH).

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc). The sample sizes of 3–10 independent recordings from individual cells per data point are similar to those in the literature for similar studies. For comparison of fold potentiation, an ANOVA was used with the Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric) test (GraphPad Prism 9). All replicates are biological replicates. Number of replicates are indicated in the figure or figure legend. They represent recordings from different cells transfected with the same plasmid DNA. Data were excluded if a gigaohm seal was not established or maintained, as indicated by an inward current of &gt;80 pA (–80 mV) in the presence of the OTOP channel blocker Zn<sup>2+</sup> applied at pH 7.4. Data sets that represent time series were excluded if four or fewer time points were collected out of a possible eight time points, due to seal instability.</p><p>Representative electrophysiology traces shown in the figures were acquired with pClamp, and in some cases, the data was decimated by 10-fold before exporting into graphic programs, Origin (Microcal) and Coreldraw (Corel).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Kinetic modeling</title><p>A kinetic model was generated based on interacting binary elements as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2014</xref>. Briefly, each element can adopt one of two possible configurations (closed or open for the pore, unbound or bound for each binding site) with intrinsic rate constants for transitioning between them. The elements are energetically coupled such that binding at a particular site either promotes or inhibits pore opening. To simulate competition between H<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> for the activating site(s), occupation of one site energetically destabilizes the other.</p><p>Model parameters were manually adjusted to qualitatively recapitulate the experimental observations. Rate constants for pore opening/closing (<italic>k<sub>o</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>c</sub></italic>), proton binding/unbinding (<italic>k<sub>onH</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>offH</sub></italic>), Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding/unbinding to activating sites (<italic>k<sub>onZnA</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>offZnA</sub></italic>) and blocking site (<italic>k<sub>onZnB</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>offZnB</sub></italic>) are (s<sup>–1</sup> or M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> for binding rates): <italic>k<sub>o</sub></italic> = 0.02, <italic>k<sub>c</sub></italic> = 25, <italic>k<sub>onH</sub></italic> = 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>, <italic>k<sub>offH</sub></italic> = 1, <italic>k<sub>onZnA</sub></italic> = 35, <italic>k<sub>offZnA</sub></italic> = 1, <italic>k<sub>onZnB</sub></italic> = 5 × 10<sup>4</sup>, and <italic>k<sub>offZnB</sub></italic> = 20. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> these rates reflect the transition pairs from the unbound closed state C to either the unbound open state O (<italic>k<sub>o</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>c</sub></italic>) or each closed state having only a single binding site occupied (H∙C, Zn∙C, Blocked∙C) (<italic>k<sub>onH</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>offH</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>onZnA</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>offZnA</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>onZnB</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>offZnB</sub></italic>). To describe how binding to a site influences pore opening and/or binding to other sites, and vice versa, we define state-dependent interaction energies between the pore gate and binding site domains. These energies modulate the rate constants as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2014</xref>. The interaction between the proton site and pore gate is such that proton binding reduces the energy barrier for pore opening by –4 kcal/mol without affecting pore closure. For example, this means that the transition rate from H∙C to H∙O will be exp(–(–4 kcal/mol)/RT)~850 times faster than that from C to O, where RT is the product of the molar gas constant R and temperature T and has value 0.593 kcal/mol at a room temperature of 298 K. Reciprocally, pore opening reduces the energy barrier for proton binding by –1 kcal/mol. These energetic effects imply that pore opening must also increase the barrier for proton unbinding by 3 kcal/mol (assuming transition rates are described by a single transition state energy barrier). The interaction between the activating Zn<sup>2+</sup> site and pore gate is such that Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding both reduces the energy barrier for pore opening by –3 kcal/mol and increases the barrier to pore closure by 3 kcal/mol, thereby increasing opening frequency and stabilizing the open pore. Reciprocally, pore opening reduces the barrier for Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding to the activating site by –5 kcal/mol. These energetic effects imply that pore opening must also increase the barrier for Zn<sup>2+</sup> unbinding from the activating site by 1 kcal/mol, thereby stabilizing bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> at the activating site. To simulate competition between protons and Zn<sup>2+</sup> for the activating site, states with both proton and activating Zn<sup>2+</sup> sites occupied were destabilized by 6 kcal/mol, the value for which was simply chosen to be a somewhat large destabilizing energy. The Zn<sup>2+</sup> blocking site was assumed to be independent of all other elements, but when occupied blocks all channel current. This model includes 14 free parameters: eight rate constants describing the opening/closing of the pore gate and binding unbinding at the proton and Zn<sup>2+</sup> activating and blocking sites, and six state-dependent interaction energies defining how activation/occupation of the above elements influences the rates of the other elements. However, the model is relatively insensitive to some of the parameters (within reason). For example, binding/unbinding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the blocking site is very fast in comparison to the macroscopic current kinetics of proton activation and decay of Zn<sup>2+</sup> potentiation. Thus, any set of blocking kinetics that give a relatively rapid onset and offset of the block will likely perform similarly in the model.</p><p>For comparison with model simulations, the entire set of currents across all cells was uniformly scaled under the assumption that the maximal response following preapplication of 3 mM Zn<sup>2+</sup> is reflective of channels with an open probability of ~0.9, a measure that has not been experimentally verified. It is likely that the same model structure will similarly describe responses with lower maximal open probabilities, albeit with slightly different parameter values. Given these uncertainties, as well as the relatively large number of free parameters (11 parameters defining pore gating, binding to activating sites, and their interactions are most relevant), we did not attempt to optimize the model parameters, but instead manually identified parameters that qualitatively recapitulate the data. The time-dependent probability in each state was simulated as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1995</xref>, after first generating the matrix of transition rates between states from the model’s binary elements and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2014</xref>). Currents were computed from the simulated open probability assuming a conductance of 1 pS and a driving force of –80 mV in pH 5.5 and 0 in pH 7.4 as estimated from ramp experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teng et al., 2022</xref>). The choice of conductance is arbitrary given that we do not know how many channels are in each recording, and thus only contributes to the overall scaling of the current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Material availability</title><p>All materials generated during this study including mutant channels are available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jon T Sack (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation, the reviewers concur on these essential revisions to the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the explanation of the model predictions, it is not clear how the allosteric model can predict the desensitization of currents. This part needs a more detailed explanation. Also, it was difficult to tell if the description in methods of the kinetic model fully describes the model. There appear to be 24 different rate constants.

The same position should be replaced with histidine in OTOP2 and OTOP1, which have arginines. Related to this point: can the authors provide an explanation for the OTOP1 potentiation given that this isoform does not have the corresponding H531 residue?</p><p>3) Please comment on to what extent the desensitization of the proton currents could be a reflection of proton depletion given the large amplitude of the proton currents.</p><p>Also please attend to the specific comments of reviewers below. Only the experiments in section 2 above are viewed as essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors of this manuscript have discovered that the recently characterized proton (H<sup>+</sup>) gated, proton permeable channel OTOP3 is strongly potentiated by the extracellular application of zinc (Zn2+) ions, while the related isoform OTOP2 is not. After characterizing the main features of the potentiation effects, the authors show, through the construction of chimeric channels, that one of the extracellular linkers, the one between transmembrane domains 11-12 is capable of encoding the potentiation phenotype. Further experiments demonstrate that a histidine residue at position 531 in the 11-12 linker is mainly responsible for Zn2+ potentiation of OTOP3 channels.</p><p>In an attempt to provide a quantitative explanation for their findings, the authors produce a transition-state gating model that is capable of explaining most of the experimental findings by postulating that gating is influenced by the interaction of two separate binding sites for H<sup>+</sup> and Zn2+.</p><p>The experiments and analyses performed in this manuscript are of very high quality and the interpretation of the data and conclusions are supported by the data.</p><p>This is a contribution that should help understand the emerging physiological roles of this recent addition to the family of proton permeable channels.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) In several places in the manuscript, the authors mention that Zn potentiation indicates that the channels are gated, however, isn't activation by H an indication that the channels are are gated? Perhaps this statement should be explained in a more nuanced manner.</p><p>2) The solutions employed have a relatively low concentration of buffer, thus the proton currents will incur in proton depletion artifacts, especially for large amplitude currents. Please comment on to what extent the desensitization of the proton currents could be a reflection of proton depletion.</p><p>3) The data in figure 3A shows the time course of the wash-off of the Zn effect. What process do the authors think is reflected here? A slow k<sub>off</sub> for Zn unbinding or a slow rate constant for recovery from the potentiated state?</p><p>4) In the methods section, please explain in more detail the procedure to perfuse cells in whole-cell recordings. Were the cells lifted and brought to the perfusion tubes? Or were the cells attached and the surrounding solution changed? If the latter, how complete is the solution exchange to be expected?</p><p>5) In the explanation of the model predictions, it is not clear to me how the allosteric model can predict the desensitization of currents. This part needs a more detailed explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It was curious that it didn't seem like potentiation could occur in the presence of Zn. Despite the identification of an important His residue and the different concentration response of inhibition vs potentiation I do wonder whether the Zn potentiation is due to a second Zn site or is a special slow allosteric consequence of Zn inhibition dependent on the loop. Zn inhibition and potentiation both begin to occur at 0.3 mM. Perhaps the concentration response of inhibition vs potentiation by Cu could address the question from another angle. Two separate divalent sites might not have the same relative affinities for Zn and Cu.</p><p>It was difficult to tell if the description in methods of the kinetic model fully describes the model. There appear to be 24 different rate constants in the model. Perhaps labeling a table listing all the free parameters using a nomenclature clearly addressable to Figure 9A would help readers understand how the model works.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Line 4 typo &quot;vesibular&quot;.</p><p>– Figure 1B: typo in figure legend &quot;Inhibtion&quot;.</p><p>– Figure 1B: mOTOP 3 currents: is there a reason for removing the Zn2+ before reaching a steady-state current (the current during Zn2+ application shows the sum of the two different actions but does it reach a steady-state)?</p><p>– Figure 5. I suppose that all the divalent ions tested show a block of OTOPs, although data are not shown. Is there a correlation between the potency of inhibition and the potency of activation for each of the ions? For instance, Cu2+ is the most potent activator among the tested ones, does it also block with the highest potency? It would be interesting if, among these transition metals, the authors could isolate one that has different affinities of inhibition/activation to find a concentration suitable to study the two modulation mechanisms independently.</p><p>– Figure 6 Tm11-12 linker: from the chicken OTOP3 structure this linker seems to be the longest on the extracellular side. To characterize the properties of this linker to the fullest the authors should test two important aspects: does the length of the linker affect Zn2+ potentiation? This would also partly answer the extent of the interaction of Zn2+ coordination with other parts of the channel. Obviously, a long linker has the flexibility to reach out to residues not in the closest proximity. The second aspect that should be worth testing is if the position of this linker, located between tm 11 and 12, is also important for Zn2+ potentiation. What would happen if the linker is moved around OTOP3 extracellular side? Does the Zn2+ effect correlate only with the linker itself (aminoacidic sequence) or even with its position in the protein? This could also provide insights into the gating mechanism itself.</p><p>– Figure 8. Given the position of the loop in the chicken OTOP3 structure (PDB 6NF6), supported by the quality of the electron density map, H531 could potentially flip towards H234 and E238 (mOTOP3 numbering). Those residues are both conserved in chicken and mouse isoforms, so it should be worth testing if they can be part of the zinc-binding site through site-directed mutagenesis, as their position is reasonably close to H531 and not too buried into the membrane.</p><p>– Figure 8 Given the position of E535A in the chicken OTOP3 structure I would suggest testing the E535H mutation, to measure possible enhancement of the Zn2+ potentiation.</p><p>– Figure 8 Given the effect of H531 in OTOP3 it would be reasonable to wonder what happens when the same position is replaced with a histidine in OTOP2 and OTOP1, both bearing an arginine. Is the histidine sufficient to recapitulate the O3/O2tm11-12 phenotype? Or at least part of it?</p><p>– Figure 8 Regarding the previous point: do the authors have an explanation for the OTOP1 potentiation given that this isoform does not have the corresponding H531 (OTOP3 numbering) residue?</p><p>– Line 301 &quot;It is tempting to speculate that the binding site spans parts of the channel that are at a distance in the closed state and that come together in the open state as shown for other ion channels&quot; (Gordon and Zagotta, 1995b; Zhang et al., 2009).</p><p>The Zn2+ potentiation occurs even during pre-treatment at pH 7.4, a condition in which the channel is closed (Teng et al. 2022). Doesn't this suggest that the binding site is available also during the closed state? The authors suggested direct competition with H<sup>+</sup>, so that at pH 7.4 Zn2+ can bind to the extracellular side (interacting with the unprotonated H531) transitioning the channel into a state that facilitates pore opening at pH 5.5. If this is the case what is the mechanism of Zn2+ binding when H531 is protonated (experiment at pH5.5 Figure 1B)? I think that this aspect of the mechanism is still a bit elusive and needs clarification.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85317.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation, the reviewers concur on these essential revisions to the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the explanation of the model predictions, it is not clear how the allosteric model can predict the desensitization of currents.

We have updated the methods section on the model to better describe the parameters and how they map onto the scheme in Figure 9A. We note that there are 14 free parameters in the model, 11 of which are likely to be of the most importance. We also note that we did not attempt to optimize the model parameters, in part because there are so many, but instead manually found a parameter set that qualitatively describes our observations. To further help illustrate how the model works, we have included two new Supplementary Figures. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the model’s simulated time course for each individual gating or binding domain, and Supplementary Figure 3 contrasts the simulated time course for the decay of the zinc-potentiated current with that of zinc unbinding from the activating site to show that they are similar (i.e., the current decay can be largely accounted for by zinc unbinding in the model simulation). We also added a few lines describing this conceptually in the model section of the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the effect of H531 in OTOP3 it is reasonable to wonder if the histidine is sufficient to recapitulate the O3/O2tm11-12 phenotype or at least part of it.

Related to this point: can the authors provide an explanation for the OTOP1 potentiation given that this isoform does not have the corresponding H531 residue?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point. We have now tested the effect of introducing the equivalent residue to H531 in OTOP2 and OTOP1 (new Figure 8, supplementary figure 1). In the case of OTOP2, the channels remain insensitive to potentiation from Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, H531 is not sufficient in the context of OTOP2 to recapitulate the effect of swapping the entire 11-12 linker. We assume that other residues in the 11-12 linker, or changes in the overall conformation of the linker, are required to confer sensitivity to Zn<sup>2+</sup>. For OTOP1, we did observe an enhancement in the degree of potentiation for channels with H replacing R, although the channels are not as strongly potentiated as OTOP3 channels. This data is consistent with the notion that the Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site consists of several residues and that their relative contributions to energetically stabilizing Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the open/potentiated state may vary among different channels. It also is consistent with our model, which predicts that for a channel that is already activated by H<sup>+</sup> (as OTOP1 is at the pH tested), Zn<sup>2+</sup> will have a relatively smaller effect. There is certainly more to be done in determining the nature of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> activating site, in closed and open conformations of the channels, and within the context of different OTOP isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please comment on to what extent the desensitization of the proton currents could be a reflection of proton depletion given the large amplitude of the proton currents.</p></disp-quote><p>The decay of the currents was not a focus of this manuscript. It likely includes contributions from three factors: Zn2+ unbinding (de-potentiation), channel desensitization and ion accumulation (collapse of the H<sup>+</sup> gradient). In a separate manuscript, Teng et al., 2022a, we discuss this question in the context of OTOP1 and find that the decay of the currents is likely due to collapse of the H<sup>+</sup> gradients. For the experiments shown with OTOP3, our modeling shows that the decay of the currents can be be explained by unbinding of Zn2+. However, we cannot rule out that there is a component of either desensitization or gradient collapse. We now discuss this point when we describe the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) In several places in the manuscript, the authors mention that Zn potentiation indicates that the channels are gated, however, isn't activation by H an indication that the channels are are gated?

Please comment on to what extent the desensitization of the proton currents could be a reflection of proton depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>The buffer concentration was 10 mM, which is standard for this type of experiment. Higher concentrations did not change the kinetics of decay of other OTOP channels, in our hands, so we did not try higher concentrations for these experiments. The decay of the currents in these experiments is likely due to unbinding of Zn2+ and recovery of channels from the potentiated state (see essential revision #1 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data in figure 3A shows the time course of the wash-off of the Zn effect. What process do the authors think is reflected here? A slow k<sub>off</sub> for Zn unbinding or a slow rate constant for recovery from the potentiated state?</p></disp-quote><p>For the model in Figure 9A these are one and the same as the potentiated state is defined as that having Zn bound to the activating/potentiating site. This model, and thus Zn unbinding, can qualitatively explain the observed wash-off time course. We did not attempt to experimentally distinguish between them so we cannot provide a test of this hypothesis with available data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the methods section, please explain in more detail the procedure to perfuse cells in whole-cell recordings.

In similar experiments (Teng et al., 2022), we showed that complete solution exchange takes around 30 ms. This is now explained in the methods, Line 382.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the explanation of the model predictions, it is not clear to me how the allosteric model can predict the desensitization of currents. This part needs a more detailed explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It was curious that it didn't seem like potentiation could occur in the presence of Zn. Despite the identification of an important His residue and the different concentration response of inhibition vs potentiation I do wonder whether the Zn potentiation is due to a second Zn site or is a special slow allosteric consequence of Zn inhibition dependent on the loop. Zn inhibition and potentiation both begin to occur at 0.3 mM. Perhaps the concentration response of inhibition vs potentiation by Cu could address the question from another angle. Two separate divalent sites might not have the same relative affinities for Zn and Cu.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we do observe potentiation in the presence of Zn, see Figure 1 C, where one can see a recovery of the currents following an initial rapid block. In the manuscript, we presented several pieces of evidence showing that the Zn blocking site is distinct from the Zn potentiating site. This includes: (1) a difference in dose-dependence shown in Figure 1D, where it can be seen that inhibiton saturates at 3 mM Zn, while activation does not saturate even at 10 mM, implying that the inhibitory site is higher affinity, (2) the observation that all OTOP channels are blocked by Zn but only OTOP3, and to a lesser extent OTOP1, is potentiated and (3) the observation that potentiation can be eliminated in the OTOP3/OTOP2 11-12 chimera, which retains inhibition.</p><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion to look a little more carefully at inhibition by other transition metals that we found could activate mOTOP3 channels. Thus, we now include new data addressing this point. This data, now shown in Figure 5, shows that Ni, Cd, and Cu all block mOTOP3 channels. Interestingly, Ni produces nearly identical block of the channels as Zn, but much less potentiation, consistent with different metal binding affinities for the two sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was difficult to tell if the description in methods of the kinetic model fully describes the model. There appear to be 24 different rate constants in the model. Perhaps labeling a table listing all the free parameters using a nomenclature clearly addressable to Figure 9A would help readers understand how the model works.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Line 4 typo &quot;vesibular&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1B: typo in figure legend &quot;Inhibtion&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1B: mOTOP 3 currents: is there a reason for removing the Zn2+ before reaching a steady-state current (the current during Zn2+ application shows the sum of the two different actions but does it reach a steady-state)?</p></disp-quote><p>The duration of the Zn2+ stimulus in these experiments was based on the time needed to observe its inhibitory effect and we did not attempt to measure the steady-state activating effects under these conditions. This was done more carefully when we switched to a protocol that allowed us to study activation in the absence of inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5. I suppose that all the divalent ions tested show a block of OTOPs, although data are not shown. Is there a correlation between the potency of inhibition and the potency of activation for each of the ions? For instance, Cu2+ is the most potent activator among the tested ones, does it also block with the highest potency? It would be interesting if, among these transition metals, the authors could isolate one that has different affinities of inhibition/activation to find a concentration suitable to study the two modulation mechanisms independently.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. As described in the response to Reviewer 2, we now show that Ni, Cd and Cu (1 mM) all block mOTOP3 currents (pH 5.5). Thus, we could not find a metal ion that activates the currents without blocking them. There was no direct relationship between potency of inhibition and activation, and Ni which produced very little activation was as good a blocker as Zn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6 Tm11-12 linker: from the chicken OTOP3 structure this linker seems to be the longest on the extracellular side. To characterize the properties of this linker to the fullest the authors should test two important aspects: does the length of the linker affect Zn2+ potentiation? This would also partly answer the extent of the interaction of Zn2+ coordination with other parts of the channel. Obviously, a long linker has the flexibility to reach out to residues not in the closest proximity. The second aspect that should be worth testing is if the position of this linker, located between tm 11 and 12, is also important for Zn2+ potentiation. What would happen if the linker is moved around OTOP3 extracellular side? Does the Zn2+ effect correlate only with the linker itself (aminoacidic sequence) or even with its position in the protein? This could also provide insights into the gating mechanism itself.</p></disp-quote><p>The tm11-12 linkers are exactly the same length for mOTOP2 and mOTOP3, so length of the linker cannot explain the difference in sensitivity to Zn2+ potentiation. We have no doubt that changing the length of the linker could change function, but it is not clear what one could conclude from this experiment. Similarly, we do not propose that the linker on its own, irrespective of protein context, would potentiate the channels, and thus, moving the linker or swapping linkers would be extremely unlikely to open (potentiate) the channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8. Given the position of the loop in the chicken OTOP3 structure (PDB 6NF6), supported by the quality of the electron density map, H531 could potentially flip towards H234 and E238 (mOTOP3 numbering). Those residues are both conserved in chicken and mouse isoforms, so it should be worth testing if they can be part of the zinc-binding site through site-directed mutagenesis, as their position is reasonably close to H531 and not too buried into the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point. We tested mutations of H234 and E238 to alanine and found they reduced potentiation. A double mutation had a more severe effect (although it did not completely eliminate potentiation like H531A) which suggests that the four residues may constitute the Zn2+ (metal ion) potentiating site. We now include this data in a new figure 8. Future structural studies will be necessary to confirm that metal ions bind to this site and to understand and how metal binding stabilizes an open state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8 Given the position of E535A in the chicken OTOP3 structure I would suggest testing the E535H mutation, to measure possible enhancement of the Zn2+ potentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this might be an interesting mutant to test, but we do not believe the results, however it would turn out, would impact the conclusion of our study, and for this reason we did not prioritize is among the many mutants we could generate and test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8 Given the effect of H531 in OTOP3 it would be reasonable to wonder what happens when the same position is replaced with a histidine in OTOP2 and OTOP1, both bearing an arginine. Is the histidine sufficient to recapitulate the O3/O2tm11-12 phenotype? Or at least part of it?</p></disp-quote><p>See responses to essential reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8 Regarding the previous point: do the authors have an explanation for the OTOP1 potentiation given that this isoform does not have the corresponding H531 (OTOP3 numbering) residue?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We did find that mutation to H increased the degree of potentiation, but it is still curious that the positive charge on the arginine would not disrupt potentiation in the context of mOTOP1 as it does in the context of mOTOP3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 301 &quot;It is tempting to speculate that the binding site spans parts of the channel that are at a distance in the closed state and that come together in the open state as shown for other ion channels&quot; (Gordon and Zagotta, 1995b; Zhang et al., 2009).</p><p>The Zn2+ potentiation occurs even during pre-treatment at pH 7.4, a condition in which the channel is closed (Teng et al. 2022). Doesn't this suggest that the binding site is available also during the closed state?</p></disp-quote><p>There are two mechanisms by which Zn2+ could bind to the channel at pH 7.4. It could either bind to the closed state (which is something that our model predicts can happen at a low rate) or the channel can briefly transit through an open state (at low probability) from which Zn2+ will more rapidly bind. In either case, unbinding is predicted to be slow. This is consistent with the slow apparent on rate of Zn2+ at pH 7.4 (many seconds) and slow off rate (&gt;1 s). Essentially, Zn2+ traps the channel in an open state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggested direct competition with H<sup>+</sup>, so that at pH 7.4 Zn2+ can bind to the extracellular side (interacting with the unprotonated H531) transitioning the channel into a state that facilitates pore opening at pH 5.5. If this is the case what is the mechanism of Zn2+ binding when H531 is protonated (experiment at pH5.5 Figure 1B)? I think that this aspect of the mechanism is still a bit elusive and needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>For the experiment where the pH is 5.5, and the His residues is protonated, we need to presume that Zn2+ can bind, perhaps weakly, due to interactions with other residues, and that binding of Zn2+ causes the deprotonation of HIs531, which then may stabilize the Zn2+ ion. This is speculation, and we agree with the reviewer that there is still some question regarding the exact physical mechanism by which Zn binds to closed vs. open states of the channels and stabilizes the open state. We did not presume to have defined the precise role of H531 and other residues in this process, which may require structural information.</p></body></sub-article></article>
