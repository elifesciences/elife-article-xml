by interacting with its adaptor protein melanophilin (Mlph). Mlph contains four functional regions, including Rab27a-binding domain, Myo5a GTD-binding motif (GTBM), Myo5a exon F-binding domain (EFBD), and actin-binding domain (ABD). The association of Myo5a with Mlph is known to be mediated by two specific interactions: the interaction between the exon-F-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-EFBD and that between Myo5a-GTD and Mlph-GTBM. Here, we identify a third interaction between Myo5a and Mlph, that is, the interaction between the exon-G-encoded region of Myo5a and Mlph-ABD. The exon-G/ABD interaction is independent from the exon-F/EFBD interaction and is required for the association of Myo5a with melanosome. Moreover, we demonstrate that Mlph-ABD interacts with either the exon-G or actin filament, but cannot interact with both of them simultaneously. Based on above findings, we propose a new model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanosome</kwd><kwd>melanocyte</kwd><kwd>Myosin-5a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiang-dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In addition to the exon-F-binding domain and the globular tail domain-binding motif, the actin-binding domain of melanophilin interacts with myosin-5a tail region and mediates the association of myosin-5a with melanosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Melanosome is a specialized organelle within which melanin pigments are synthesized and stored. The peripheral accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes is essential for the intercellular transfer of the organelles from the dendrite tips of melanocytes to the adjacent keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hume and Seabra, 2011</xref>). Microtubule and the associated motor proteins are responsible for the long-range and bidirectional transport of melanosomes between the nucleus to cell periphery, and actin filament and the associated motor protein myosin-5a (Myo5a) are essential for the short-distance transport and the capture of melanosomes at cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu and Hammer, 2014</xref>). The overall effect of the two transport systems is the peripheral accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes. Lack of the latter causes the perinuclear accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes, a phenotype called ‘dilute’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Provance et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Myo5a is a processive motor that has been implicated in the transportation and the tethering of organelles along actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mehta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rudolf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoshimura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Myo5a has two heavy chains, each containing an N-terminal motor domain, six IQ motifs that act as the binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) or CaM-like light chains, and a tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ikebe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The tail of Myo5a can be further divided into three segments. The proximal tail is a long coiled-coil with length about 200 residues. The distal tail is the C-terminal globular tail domain (GTD). Between the proximal tail and the GTD is the middle tail, which is comprised of several short coiled-coils and the connecting loops. At least three essential functions are served by Myo5a tail. First, the coiled-coil regions enable Myo5a to form a dimer. Second, the GTD inhibits the motor activity of myosin head. Third, the tail is the binding site for the cargo proteins. The motor activity of Myo5a is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Krementsov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thirumurugan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). In the inhibited state, Myo5a forms a folded conformation, in which the GTDs fold back to interact and inhibit the motor function. Upon being activated by high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cargo or adaptor proteins, Myo5a transforms from the folded conformation to the extended conformation, in which the GTD dissociates from the motor domain and the inhibition is relieved.</p><p>Melanophilin (Mlph) is one of the best-studied cargo proteins of Myo5a. Together with Rab27a, Mlph mediates the attachment of Myo5a to melanosomes. Rab27a is a small GTPase that, in the GTP-bound form, is anchored into the melanosome membrane via its lipid moiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>) and Mlph bridges the interaction between Rab27a and Myo5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukuda et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagashima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2002a</xref>). The tripartite complex of Rab27a, Mlph, and Myo5a connects the melanosome to the actin filament. Lacking any one of these three components in melanocytes causes dilute phenotype perinuclear accumulation of melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukuda et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hume et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2002a</xref>).</p><p>Mlph contains four functional regions, including RBD (Rab27a-binding domain), GTBM (Myo5a GTD-binding motif), EFBD (Myo5a exon F-binding domain), and ABD actin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fukuda et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geething and Spudich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). The association of Myo5a with Mlph involves two molecular interactions. One is the interaction between the exon-F-encoded region (exon-F for simplification) of Myo5a and the EFBD of Mlph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fukuda and Itoh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2002a</xref>). Exon-F is an alternatively spliced exon presents in the middle tail of the melanocyte-spliced isoform of Myo5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huang et al., 1998</xref>). The exon-F/EFBD interaction is absolutely essential for the localization of Myo5a to the melanosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2002b</xref>). The other interaction is between the GTD of Myo5a and the GTBM of Mlph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Geething and Spudich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pylypenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). We previously found that GTBM activates Myo5a motor function by relieving the GTD inhibition on the motor domain and inducing a folded-to-extended conformational transition of Myo5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that the activation of Myo5a by Mlph-GTBM is regulated by another Myo5a-binding protein RILPL2 (Rab-interacting lysosomal protein-like 2) and the small GTPase Rab36, a binding partner of RILPL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mlph-ABD is essential to proper melanosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fukuda and Kuroda, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuroda et al., 2003</xref>). Besides being able to bind to actin filament, Mlph-ABD could interact with end-binding protein 1, which might facilitate the transfer of melanosomes from microtubules to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). In vitro motility assays at single-molecular level show that Mlph prolongs and slows the processive movements of Myo5a, presumably via the interaction between ABD and actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sckolnick et al., 2013</xref>). A cluster of conserved positively charged residues in ABD is essential for actin binding and Melanophilin localization in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuroda et al., 2003</xref>). An in vitro study suggests that Mlph-ABD is a target of protein kinase A and that the phosphorylated Mlph preferred binding to actin even in the presence of microtubules, whereas dephosphorylated Mlph bind to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oberhofer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical analysis of Mlph show that the ABD is not essential for the interaction with Myo5a nor the activation of Myo5a motor function, suggesting that a truncated Mlph protein containing the RBD and the two Myo5a-binding domains (the GTBM and the EFBD) but lacking the ABD is able to form a tripartite complex with Rab27a and Myo5a and thus sufficient for the recruitment of Myo5a to melanosome membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kuroda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2002b</xref>). However, using melan-ln cells (Mlph-null melanocytes), Hume et al. have found that the ABD-deleted Mlph cannot to promote the recruitment of Myo5a onto melanosomes, indicating that the ABD is necessary in situ for the association of Myo5a with Mlph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hume et al., 2006</xref>). This discrepancy between in vitro and cell culture results promoted us to investigate the interaction between Mlph-ABD and Myo5a.</p><p>In this study, we have identified a third interaction between Myo5a and Mlph, that is, the interaction between the exon-G-encoded region (exon-G for simplification) of Myo5a and Mlph-ABD. We find that the exon-G/ABD interaction is independent from the exon-F/EFBD interaction, and that, similar to exon-F/EFBD, exon-G/ABD is essential for the dilute-like phenotype induced by Myo5a-tail overexpression. Moreover, we demonstrate that Mlph-ABD interacts with either the exon-G of Myo5a or actin filament, but cannot interact with both of them simultaneously. Based on above findings, we propose a new model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The actin-binding domain of melanophilin (Mlph-ABD) contains a novel Myo5a-binding site</title><p>Myo5a binds to its cargo proteins, including Mlph, majorly via the middle tail domain (MTD, residues 1106–1467) and the GTD (residues 1468–1877; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top).

GST-Mlph-ABD was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified by GSH-Sepharose chromatography, and Flag-Myo5a-MTD was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by anti-Flag affinity chromatography. GST pulldown assay shows that GST-Mlph-ABD specifically interacted with Flag-Myo5a-MTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 2). Deleting the residues 401–437 of Mlph-ABD had little effect on the interaction with Myo5a-MTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3 and 4), indicating the N-terminal 37 residues of Mlph-ABD are not essential for the interaction. Further deletion of 437–446 slightly decreased the interaction and deletion of 446–455 eliminated the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 5 and 6), indicating that residues 446–455 are essential for the interaction with Myo5a-MTD. Similarly, we performed C-terminal truncation analysis of Mlph-ABD on the interaction with Myo5a-MTD and identified residues 560–571 essential for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taking together, we identified the middle portion of Mlph-ABD (residues 446–571) as the core of the novel binding site for Myo5a-MTD.</p><p>We then produced a number of truncated Myo5a-MTD constructs and performed GST pulldown assays to narrow down the region in Myo5a-MTD binding to Mlph-ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To simplify the experiments, we first compared the bacterial-expressed Myo5a-MTD with the Sf9 cell-expressed Myo5a-MTD in the interaction with Mlph-ABD. GST pulldown assay shows that both versions of Myo5a-MTD specifically interacted with Mlph-ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All the following pulldown experiments were performed using the bacterial-expressed Myo5a-MTD, unless otherwise indicated. C-terminal truncation of Flag-Myo5a-MTD shows that the C-terminal half of exon-G (residues 1453–1467) is essential for binding to Mlph-ABD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In the current study, we identified the third interaction between Myo5a and Mlph, i.e., the interaction between the exon-G of Myo5a and the Mlph-ABD. We demonstrated that, similar to the exon-F/EFBD interaction, the exon-G/ABD interaction is also required for the strong binding of Myo5a and Mlph.</p><p>Among the three interactions between Myo5a and Mlph, the GTD/GTBM interaction majorly regulates the motor function of Myo5a. At relative high ionic strength but not at physiological ionic strength, Mlph-GTBM binds to the GTD, inducing Myo5a to form the extended conformation and activating Myo5a motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). At physiological ionic strength, the GTBM-mediated activation of Myo5a depends on the interaction between the GTD and RilpL2, which is regulated by Rab36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Those findings are consistent with the three-dimensional structure of Myo5a-GTD and the folded structure of full-length Myo5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Niu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pylypenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wei et al., 2013</xref>), in both of which the GTBM-binding sites are buried at the GTD-GTD interface. Upon binding to the RH1 domain of RilpL2, the GTD exposes the GTBM-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wei et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore proposed that the binding of Rab36/RilpL2 to the GTD exposes the GTBM-binding site, thus facilitating GTBM to bind to the GTD and to activate the motor function of Myo5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The GTD/GTBM interaction is also required for the stable association between Myo5a and Mlph. The Myo5a tail construct containing all three Mlph-binding sites (the exon-F, the exon-G, and the GTD) produced dominant negative effect in melanocytes, and deleting the GTD abolished the dominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2002b</xref>).</p><p>The exon-F/EFBD and the exon-G/ABD interactions play a major role in the binding of Myo5a with Mlph. Although exon-F and exon-G are adjacent to each other, the exon-F/EFBD interaction and the exon-G/ABD interaction do not interfere with each other. Rather, those two interactions act synergically. We observed that Myo5a-MTD, containing both exon-F and exon-G but lacking the GTD, did not generate a dilute-like phenotype in melanocytes, but was co-localized well with Mlph and partially with melanosomes. Deletion of either exon-F or exon-G substantially weakened the interaction between Myo5a-MTD and Mlph and decreased the colocalization of Myo5a-MTD with Mlph, indicating the both exon-F and exon-G are required for the colocalization.</p><p>Our observation that Myo5a-MTD, containing both exon-F and exon-G, was co-localized partially with melanosomes seems to contradict the early work from Hammer laboratory, which showed that MC STK (a Myo5a fragment contains both exon-F and exon-G) did not exhibit any tendency to co-localize with melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2002b</xref>). However, careful examining their image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2002b</xref>) reveals a partial colocalization of MC STK with melanosomes, particularly at the perinuclear region. It is likely that some melanosome-bound Mlph molecules are unoccupied, some interact with Myo5a via the exon-F/EFBD and the exon-G/ABD interactions but not the GTD/GTBM interaction, and some interact with Myo5a via three interactions. In the former two cases, Myo5a-MTD would be able to bind to the melanosome via Mlph. We therefore conclude that presence of both exon-F and exon-G is sufficient for Myo5a to associate with Mlph, but insufficient for substituting the melanosome-bound Myo5a molecules which bind to Mlph via three distinct interactions.</p><p>As discussed above, the GTBM-binding site is buried at the GTD-GTD interface in the folded state of Myo5a, thus is inaccessible for Mlph, and the opening of GTBM-site depends on the interaction with Rab36/RilpL2. On the other hand, the exon-F and the exon-G are likely exposed. We therefore propose that the folded Myo5a first attaches to Mlph via the exon-F/EFBD and exon-G/ABD interactions, then interacts with Rab36/RilpL2 to open the GTBM-site, and finally interacts with the GTBM, forming the extended conformation and being activated.</p><p>One interesting finding of this study is that Mlph-ABD was able to separately interact with the exon-G of Myo5a or actin filament, but unable to interact with both of them simultaneously. In other words, Mlph-ABD binds to either exon-G or actin filament. This is consistent with the geometry of Myo5a, in which exon-G is located far from the motor domain, which interacts with actin filament to produce motility. Given the small size of Mlph-ABD, it is unlikely that Mlph-ABD is able to bridge the exon-G at one end of Myo5a and actin filament which associates with the motor domain located at the other end of Myo5a. An unsolved issue is how Mlph-ABD’s interactions with exon-G and actin filament are regulated. In vitro studies suggest that the interaction between Mlph-ABD and actin filament might be regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oberhofer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Based on our current finding and previous studies on the interaction between Myo5a and its associated proteins, we propose following model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). At stage 1, Mlph associates with melanosome via its interaction with Rab27a, which directly binds to the membrane of melanosome; the unattached Myo5a is in a folded conformation, in which the GTD binds to and inhibits the motor domain. At stage 2, Mlph interacts with the folded Myo5a via the interactions of EFBD/exon-F and ABD/exon-G; the attached Myo5a is still in folded conformation, because the GTBM-binding surface in the GTD is buried at the GTD-GTD interface. At stage 3, the buried GTBM-binding surface between the GTD-GTD interface is exposed and thus facilitate the binding of GTBM, causing the dissociation of the GTD from the motor domain and inducing the extended conformation of Myo5a (This step is probably regulated by the binding of Rab36/RilpL2 to the GTD). At stage 4, Mlph-ABD dissociates from exon-G and then binds to actin filament, thus enhancing the processive movement of Myo5a (This step might be regulated by the phosphorylation of Mlph-ABD). The interaction between Mlph-ABD and actin filament is regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oberhofer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model for the Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosome.</title><p>The Mlph-mediated Myo5a transportation of melanosome is comprised of four stages.

During this maturation process, melanosomes undergo microtubule and actin-based transport towards the cell periphery, mediated by different Rab proteins and their effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fukuda, 2021</xref>). For example, Rab27a mainly associates with intermediate and mature melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jordens et al., 2006</xref>). The melanosome-bound Rab27a in GTP-bound state binds to Mlph, which in turn recruits Myo5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2002a</xref>). We propose that the recruitment of Myo5a by Mlph consists of multiple stages. We expect that Myo5a-MTD, containing both exon-F and exon-G, is able to bind to Mlph at stage 1 and 2, but not at stage 3 and 4, and that Myo5a-Tail, containing all three Mlph-binding sites, is able to bind to Mlph at all four stages.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate a direct interaction between the exon-G of Myo5a and the ABD of Mlph, which is essential for the tight binding of Myo5a to Mlph both in vitro and in vivo. We expect that the melanosomal recruitment and activation of Myo5a are a highly coordinated process mediated by three interactions between Myo5a and Mlph, that is the exon-F/EFBD interaction, the exon-G/ABD interaction, and the GTD/GTBM interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), unless indicated otherwise.

Motivated by a discrepancy between in vitro and cell culture results regarding necessary interactions for MyoVa to be recruited to the melanosome, the authors used a series of pull-down and pelleting assays experiments to identify an additional interaction that occurs between exon G of MyoVa and Mlph. This interaction is independent of and synergistic with the interaction of Mlph with exon F. However, the interaction of the actin-binding domain of Mlph can occur either with exon G or with the actin filament, but not both simultaneously. These data lead to a modified recruitment model where both exon F and exon G enhance binding of Mlph to auto-inhibited MyoVa, and then via an unidentified switch (PKA?) the actin-binding domain of Mlph dissociates from MyoVa and interacts with the actin filament to enhance MyoVa processivity.</p><p>The only weakness noted is that the authors could have had a more complete story if they pursued whether PKA phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Mlph is indeed the switch for the actin-binding domain of Mlph to interact with exon G versus the actin filament.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93662.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors identify a third component in the interaction between myosin Va and melanophilin- an interaction between a 32-residue sequence encoded by exon-g in myosin Va and melanophilin's actin binding domain. This interaction has implications for how melanosome motility may be regulated.</p><p>The authors have now included some necessary controls that were requested. In terms of adding new information to increase the significance and impact of the paper, they added a single affinity measurement. Unfortunately, it did not involve Exon G specifically. Moreover, they did not add any new mechanistic or functional data to provide a more conceptual advance. For example, is the Exon G interaction regulated by phosphorylation? Is this what dictates the choice between Mlph's actin binding domain (ABD) binding to actin or to exon-G. How does local actin concentration influence this decision. What changes regarding melanosome dynamics in cells between these two alternatives? Do in vitro reconstitution assays show that binding to Exon-G instead of actin affects the processivity of a Rab27a/Myosin 5a/Mlph transport complex? Finally, while the authors make clear in the abstract and text that they are just identifying a third component that mediates the Melanophilin-dependent association of myosin-5a with melanosomes, the title gives the impression that they identified all three in this manuscript. I really think the title should be changed to something like Identification of a third component that mediates the Melanophilin-dependent association of myosin-5a with melanosomes, as this accurately reflects what is new in this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93662.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Jiabin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Lin-Lin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Qing-Juan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Shaopeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiang-dong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We appreciate your comments and suggestions on our manuscript.</p><p>In particular, we have measured the affinity between the middle tail domain of myosin-5a (Myo5a-MTD) and the actin-binding domain of melanophilin (Mlph-ABD) using microscale thermophoresis, and obtained the Kd of ~0.56 uM, which is similar to the Kd of the globular tail domain of myosin-5a (Myo5a-GTD) to the GTD-binding motif of melanophilin (Mlph-GTBM).

Textual alterations can be viewed in the “tracked change” version of the manuscript. Below is the comments from the editors and the two reviewers together with our point-by-point responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This study represents a useful description of a third interaction site between melanophilin and myosin-5a which is important in regulating the distribution of pigment granules in melanocytes. While much of the data forms a solid case for this interaction, the inclusion of important controls for the cellular studies and measurement of interaction affinities would have been helpful.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Interactions known to be important for melanosome transport include exon F and the globular tail domain (GTD) of MyoVa with Mlph. Motivated by a discrepancy between in vitro and cell culture results regarding necessary interactions for MyoVa to be recruited to the melanosome, the authors used a series of pull-down and pelleting assays experiments to identify an additional interaction that occurs between exon G of MyoVa and Mlph. This interaction is independent of and synergistic with the interaction of Mlph with exon F. However, the interaction of the actin-binding domain of Mlph can occur either with exon G or with the actin filament, but not both simultaneously. These data lead to a modified recruitment model where both exon F and exon G enhance the binding of Mlph to auto-inhibited MyoVa, and then via an unidentified switch (PKA?) the actin-binding domain of Mlph dissociates from MyoVa and interacts with the actin filament to enhance MyoVa processivity.</p><p>The only weakness noted is that the authors could have had a more complete story if they pursued whether PKA phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Mlph is indeed the switch for the actin-binding domain of Mlph to interact with exon G versus the actin filament.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for careful reading of the manuscript and appreciation of the study. We agree with the Reviewer that it is important to understand how the actin-binding domain of Mlph switch its interaction with the exon-G of Myo5a and actin filament. We would like to pursue this direction in our future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors identify a third component in the interaction between myosin Va and melanophilin- an interaction between a 32-residue sequence encoded by exon-g in myosin Va and melanophilin's actin-binding domain. This interaction has implications for how melanosome motility may be regulated.</p><p>While this work is largely well done and certainly publishable following needed revisions (e.g. some affinity measurements, necessary controls for the dominant negative experiments), I believe that additional work would be required to make a more compelling case. First, the study provides just one more piece to a well-developed story (the role of exon-F and the GTD in myosin Va: melanophilin (Mlph) interaction), much of which was published 20 years ago by several labs. Second, the study does not demonstrate a physiological significance for their findings other than that exon-G plays an auxiliary role in the binding of myosin Va to Mlph. For example, what dictates the choice between Mlph's actin binding domain (ABD) binding to actin or to exon-G. Is it a PTM or local actin concentration? It is unlikely to be alternative splicing as exon-G is present in all spliced isoforms of myosin Va. And what changes re melanosome dynamics in cells between these two alternatives? Similarly, the paper does not provide any in vitro evidence that binding to exon-G instead of actin effects the processivity of a Rab27a/Myosin Va/Mlph transport complex. For example, if the ABD sticks to exon-G instead of actin, does that block Mlph's ability to promote processivity through its interaction with the actin filament during transport? In summary, given that the authors did not directly test their model either in vitro or in cells, I do not think this story represent a significant conceptual advance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for careful reading of the manuscript and the suggestions of improving the manuscript. As suggested by the reviewer, we have measured the affinity between the middle tail domain of Myo5a (Myo5a-MTD) and Mlph-ABD (Kd ~0.562 uM), which is similar to that between the globular tail domain of Myo5a (Myo5a-GTD) and the GTBM of Mlph. In addition, we have performed additional experiments showing the integrity and the expression level of the dominant negative constructs in the transfected cells.</p><p>We believe more extensive experiments are required to address other questions raised by the reviewer. For example, what dictates the choice between Mlph's actin binding domain (ABD) binding to actin or to exon-G is an open question. As we proposed, phosphorylation by protein kinase A is only one possible mechanism. We would like to pursue them in our future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The reviewing editor feels strongly that addressing some of the points raised by the reviewers would make this a more compelling manuscript. In particular, a measurement of the affinity of the relevant fragments from melanophilin and myosin-5a would indicate that the interaction might be physiologically relevant. Concerning the dominant negative experiments, the lack of effect of an expressed fragment could be that the expressed fragments were simply degraded or expressed at too low of a level to be competing. The reviewer gives guidelines on how to address this. Reviewer #2 made a point that it would be compelling if the effect of phosphorylation as suggested in the model was tested, but we all agree that this could well be the subject of a later study. In addition, the authors make a very interesting proposal for how protein kinase A could be involved in this regulation as has been suggested previously. Perhaps the use of phosphomimetic mutations could give some insight into this. Such experiments, if consistent with the proposed model would certainly raise the impact of this study. Finally, a very clear periodicity in hydrophobic amino acids is apparent in the interacting sequences of both Myo5 (yrisLykrMidLmeqLekqdktVrkLkkqLkvFakkIgeLevgqmen) and Mlph (tdeeLseMedrVamtAseVqqAeseIsdIesrIaaLra). This is strongly suggesting a leucine-zipper-like coiled coil, rather than an interaction mediated solely by charge. Recent softwares (and easily accessible too) like AlphaFold multimer might yield important structural insight into the binding configuration and might help rationalize the effect of the mutations herein.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and the reviewers for their suggestions of improving the manuscript. We have performed the several essential experiments to address the concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p>(1) Regarding the affinity of the relevant fragments from melanophilin and myosin-5a. We have measured the affinity between Mlph-ABD and Myo5a-MTD using MST (Kd ~562 nM) (see revised Figure 3A).</p><p>(2) Regarding the concerns on the dominant negative experiments. We have examined the molecular sizes and expression levels of Mlph or Myo5a constructs by Western blots. First, we show that all constructs have correct molecular size in transfected cells (see revised Figure 6C and 7D), indicating that the inability of Myo5a or Mlph truncations to generate dilute-like phenotypes was not due to the intracellular degradation of the EGFP fusion protein. Second, by correcting for the percentage of transfected cells, we show that the overall expression levels of the wild-type construct and the mutants are roughly equal. Third, we categorized the expression levels into high and low, and calculated percentage of the DN phenotype in high and low expression levels. The results are consistent with the percentage of DN phenotype in total EGFP fusion protein cells.</p><p>(3) Regarding the suggestion to investigate the effect of phosphorylation by protein kinase A on Mlph-ABD’s interaction with Myo5a and actin filament. We understand that it is important to elucidate the mechanism by which the actin-binding domain of Mlph switch its interaction with the exon-G of Myo5a and actin filament. However, as we proposed, phosphorylation by protein kinase A is one possible mechanism, and more extensive experiments are required to address this question. Therefore, we would like to pursue it in our future research.</p><p>(4) Regarding the suggestion to predict the interaction between the exon-G of myosin-5a and Mlph-ABD using AlphaFold. We have used AlphaFold multimer to predict the Myo5a-MTD/Mlph-ABD interaction. Remarkably, the AlphaFold predicted that the binding of Myo5a-MTD with Mlph-ABD is mediated by an antiparallel coiled-coil formed by Myo5a (1430-1467) and Mlph (450-481), just as predicted by the editors. This prediction is also consistent with our finding that the exon-G of Myo5a interacts with Mlph-ABD. However, the predicted model cannot explain our mutagenesis results. We will pursue this point in the future research. Nevertheless, we are grateful to the editors for bringing this idea to our attention, because it will help us to design experiments to investigate the nature of Myo5a-exon-G/Mlph-ABD interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific minor comments</p><p>Q1: In figs 6-7 an overlay between DAPI and EGFP would be helpful for the reader to see perinuclear distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added the merged images of DAPI and EGFP in the revised Figure 6 and 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q2: The delta symbol in the pdf text was corrupted.</p></disp-quote><p>The corrupted delta symbol has been fixed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Q1: Please explain in detail early in the text what exon-G is - length, position in the tail, and evidence that it is a coiled coil (CC). Of note, is it only long enough for about 4 heptad repeats? Has it been shown biochemically to form a CC? Is the CC irreversible? What would be the consequence of removing the exon-G CC on the ability of surrounding regions to bind Mlph (exon-F and the GTD)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the revision, we added a new paragraph (the first paragraph in the results section) and revised Figure 1A to introduce the middle tail domain and alternatively spliced exons of Myo5a.</p><p>Exon-G is 32 amino acids in length, located at the C-terminal region of the middle tail domain, immediately before the globular tail domain. Exon-G region was predicted to form a short coiled-coil by using on-line tools (such as paircoil), and this prediction has not been tested biochemically. Moreover, we do not know whether the exon-G coiled-coil is reversible or not.</p><p>We have not examined the effect of removing the whole exon-G on the interaction between the GTD and Mlph-GTBM. The exon-G (residues 1436-1467) and the GTD core (residues 1498-1877) are separated by a long loop of 31 residues. We therefore expect that the removing the exon-G will not affect the GTD/Mlph-GTBM interaction.</p><p>Physically, exon-F is immediately followed by exon-G, and those two regions might interfere with each other. In our preliminary study, we found that removing the whole exon-G abolished the interaction between exon-F and Mlph-EFBD. On the other hand, removing the C-terminal half (residues 1454-1467) of exon-G had little effect the interaction between exon-F and Mlph-EFBD (see Figure 2C). In this work, we intentionally selected the later construct for functional analysis of the exon-G/Mlph-ABD interaction, because removing the C-terminal half of exon-G abolishes the interaction with Mlph-ABD, but does not affect the exon-F/Mlph-EFBD interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q2: Figures 1-3. While the pulldown experiments demonstrating an interaction between Mlph-ABD residues 446-571 and Myo5a-MTD are a good start, one would like to see affinity measurements to gauge the likelihood that this interaction is physiologically relevant. The same goes for the pulldown experiments demonstrating an interaction between (i) the C-terminal half of exon-G (residues 1453-1467) and the Mlph-ABD, (ii) between residues 1411-1467 (a short peptide containing exon-F and exon-G) and the Mlph-ABD, and (iii) between residues 1436-1467 (a short peptide containing exon-G) and the Mlph-ABD. This would also apply to the pulldowns in 3C-3E where versions of the proteins with charge residue changes were tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the reviewer’s opinion that determination of the affinities between Mlph-ABD and Myo5a-MTD and their variants will be helpful in understanding the physiological relevance of Exon-G/Mlph-ABD interaction. However, the extensive experiments suggested by the reviewer require many high quality, purified proteins, which are not trivial.</p><p>Nevertheless, we think it is important to know the affinity between Myo5a-MTD and Mlph-ABD (both wild-type), as this parameter can be used for the comparison of the three interactions between Myo5a and Mlph. Therefore, we have obtained the affinity between Myo5a-MTD and Mlph-ABD using microscale thermophoresis (MST). The dissociation constant (Kd) of Myo5a-MTD to Mlph-ABD is 0.562±0.169 uM, which is similar to that between Myo5a-GTD and Mlph-GTBM (~1 uM) (Geething &amp; Spudich (2007) JBC 282:21518). Consistent with GST pulldown results, MST shows that deletion of C-terminal half of exon-G (1453-1467) greatly decreases the MST signals (see revised Figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q3: While the domain negative (DN) approach to testing functional significance is OK, rescuing dilute/myosin Va null melanocytes with full-length myosin Va containing the various deletions would have been more convincing. Also, the authors must show (i) that the DN constructs are the correct size in transfected cells (i.e. are not degraded), and (ii) that they are expressed at roughly equal levels (either by doing Westerns and correcting for the percent of transfected cells, or by measuring total cellular fluorescence in transfected cells). Without this information, it remains possible that constructs not exhibiting a DN effect are simply degraded or poorly expressed. This applies to all the DN data in Figures 6 and 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Myo5a null melanocytes is ideal for investigating exon G function. Unfortunately, we do not have Myo5a null melanocytes derived from dilute mice.</p><p>To confirm the integrity of the overexpressed proteins in the transfected cells, we performed Western blot of those proteins, including EGFP-Mlph-ΔRBD (wild-type and two mutants) and Myo5a-Tail (wild-type and ΔG mutant), in the lysate of the transfected cells. Western blots show that all those proteins have correct molecular masses, indicating no degradation of those overexpressed proteins (see revised Figure 6C and 7C). Moreover, by correcting for the percentage of transfected cells, we show that the overall expression levels in each transfected cell of the wild-type construct and the mutants are roughly equal. This information is included in the revised manuscript (Line 222-225; 237-241).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q4: The authors scored the DN phenotype as yes/no but it mostly likely varies depending on the degree of over-expression. Showing that the degree of melanosome centralization scales with the degree of overexpression, and that the correlation between expression level and phenotype varies depending on the construct would strengthen the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s prediction that the degree of DN phenotype should depend on the of over-expression level. We analyzed the EGFP signals of transfected cells and found very few cells with medium expression level. Therefore, we simply categorized the expression levels into high and low, and calculated the DN phenotype in each categories as shown in the table below. These results are consistent with the expectation that the degree of DN phenotype depends on the over-expression level of the transfected constructs.</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Percentage of the EGFP-expressing cells with perinuclear aggregation of melanosomes.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Transfected construct</th><th>High expression</th><th>Low expression</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EGFP-Mlph-ΔRBD WT</td><td align="left" valign="top">59.2%(n=94)</td><td align="left" valign="top">23.8%(n=74)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EGFP-Mlph-ΔRBD E449A</td><td align="left" valign="top">22.5%(n=103)</td><td align="left" valign="top">4.9%(n=71)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EGFP-Mlph-ΔRBD E452A</td><td align="left" valign="top">20.8%(n=120)</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.7%(n=77)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EGFP-Myo5a-Tail</td><td align="left" valign="top">69.3%(n=96)</td><td align="left" valign="top">11.9%(n=63)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">EGFP-Myo5a-TailΔG</td><td align="left" valign="top">16.7%(n=110)</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.1%(n=72)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q5: The conclusion from the data in Figure 8A- &quot;the presence of both exon-F and exon-G is insufficient for binding to the Mlph occupied by Myo5a, but sufficient for binding to the unoccupied Mlph&quot;- should be verified by also doing the experiment in myosin Va knockdown cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.
