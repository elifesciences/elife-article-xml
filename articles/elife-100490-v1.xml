This study investigates the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Crowding specifically enhanced invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells through significant volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that crowding selectively relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, to the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. TRPV4 inhibition triggered by crowding decreased intracellular calcium levels, reduced cell volume, and increased invasion and motility. During this process, TRPV4 membrane relocation primed the channel for later activation, compensating for calcium loss. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues confirmed that plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 is specific to high-grade DCIS and indicates the presence of a pro-invasive cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway. Hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked crowding-induced effects, while TRPV4 activation reversed them. Silencing TRPV4 diminished mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells, reducing calcium depletion, volume reduction, and motility. This study uncovers a novel pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway driven by cell crowding and identifies TRPV4 as a potential biomarker for predicting invasion risk in DCIS patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ductal carcinoma in situ (known as DCIS) is an early form of breast cancer that develops in the milk ducts. It is non-invasive, which means that it does not spread into the surrounding breast tissue. Despite this, if left untreated, DCIS can develop into an invasive cancer that spreads to nearby tissues and has the potential to spread to other parts of the body.</p><p>It is difficult to predict which DCIS cases will develop into invasive breast cancers. Although DCIS cells can be graded according to how abnormal their appearance is, with high-grade being the most abnormal, this classification does not directly predict their invasive potential. Therefore, there is a need to develop new ways to better predict which DCIS cases are at risk of progressing to invasive cancers.</p><p>Bu et al. aimed to investigate whether cell crowding impacts how likely a DCIS cell is to become invasive. The rapid proliferation of cancer cells in confined spaces means that they often become crowded together, causing mechanical stress that can change their features and behaviour.</p><p>Bu et al. probed the effects of cell crowding on different types of breast cancer cells, including healthy breast cells, non-invasive DCIS cells of different grades and invasive breast cancer cells. The experiments revealed that while cell crowding does not drive low-grade DCIS and non-cancerous cells to become invasive, it can promote invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells. This is due to inhibition of proteins that allow calcium ions to pass into the cells. In particular, this inhibition of a protein known as TRPV4 reduces the number of calcium ions inside the cells, which makes the cells smaller and able to move more efficiently. Cell crowding also caused TRPV4 to move from the centre of the high-grade DCIS cells to the cell membrane.</p><p>Taken together, the findings reveal that different types of cancer cells respond differently to mechanical stress and identify cell crowding as a factor that can cause high-grade DCIS cells to become invasive. While further investigation is needed, the findings also suggest the location of TRPV4 as a potential marker of DCIS cells that are more likely to become invasive. In the future, markers of potential invasiveness could be used to ensure that cancer treatments are targeted specifically at patients with a greater risk of developing invasive breast cancer, preventing overtreatment of lower risk cases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DCIS</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>TRPV4</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd><kwd>calcium homeostasis</kwd><kwd>cell volume</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001287</institution-id><institution>Elsa U.

Numerous studies show that these processes are mediated by mechanotransduction, whereby cells translate mechanical stimuli into cellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broders-Bondon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2019a</xref>). While mechanotransduction is traditionally studied concerning fluid stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stylianopoulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polacheck et al., 2014</xref>), matrix stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moore et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Galbraith et al., 2002</xref>), and other biomechanical changes such as osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Finan and Guilak, 2010</xref>), the role of cell crowding, characterized by increased cell density and spatial constraints, is relatively less explored. A recent report shows that cell crowding plays a role in facilitating wound closure and repair by enhancing cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franco et al., 2019</xref>). As tissues develop, repair, or undergo pathological transformation, cell crowding becomes common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neurohr and Amon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fan and Meyer, 2021</xref>). This challenges individual cells, forcing them to perceive and respond to the mechanical constraints of a crowded environment. Our study used human breast cell line model systems to describe a novel mechanotransduction pathway triggered by cell crowding that induces invasiveness into surrounding tissues. Interestingly, this pathway exhibited unique selectivity, as it was specifically associated with a type of non-invasive cancer pathology and was not present in lower-grade or less aggressive pathologies. This suggests that not all cells possess the ability to translate mechanical stimuli, such as cell crowding, into cell invasiveness.</p><p>To assess the role of cell crowding in cell invasiveness, we chose in vitro cell lines linked to different pathological states that reflect cell crowding conditions in vivo, including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kader et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinder and Ellis, 2003</xref>) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böcker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinder and Ellis, 2003</xref>). ADH is an intraductal clonal epithelial cell proliferative lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinder and Ellis, 2003</xref>) and represents an intermediate step between normal breast tissue and in situ carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dupont and Page, 1985</xref>). ADH is associated with high risk as it is reported that an ADH diagnosis is associated with a fivefold increased risk of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kader et al., 2018</xref>). DCIS is a non-invasive form of cancer characterized by proliferating malignant epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Böcker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinder and Ellis, 2003</xref>). Unlike ADH, DCIS is considered a precursor to invasive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van Seijen et al., 2019</xref>). However, the mechanism of how DCIS transitions to invasive cancer is not well understood and therefore, there is currently no reliable and robust method to differentiate which DCIS cells are at high risk of becoming invasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Both ADH and DCIS conditions can potentially expose cells to crowding in vivo. However, how ADH and DCIS cells respond to such changes in cell density remains unknown. Our study revealed that cell crowding selectively triggered a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program in a specific type of DCIS cell line associated with high-grade pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shekhar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanotransduction program induced by cell crowding involved the inhibition of ion channels, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2016</xref>), a calcium-permeable ion channel, as identified from our mass spectrometry assay. This inhibition decreased intracellular calcium levels and inactivated TRPV4 and other ion channels, prompting their relocation to the plasma membrane. The inhibition also induced reduced cell volume and cortical stiffening, thereby promoting cell invasiveness and motility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell crowding enhances invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells</title><p>Cell crowding reflects a common condition in tumor microenvironments for ADH and DCIS, arising from aberrant cell proliferation within spatially constrained intraductal spaces. We examined the influence of this prevalent environmental factor on the invasiveness of these cells in vitro. To conduct this investigation, we assembled a panel of cell lines derived from the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, including its H-RAS mutation-driven derivatives associated with various pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">So et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller, 2000</xref>): MCF10AT1, MCF10DCIS.com, and invasive cells MCF10CA1a. MCF10AT1 resembles ADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawson et al., 1996</xref>), MCF10DCIS.com mimics high-grade DCIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2000</xref>), and MCF10CA1a represents a malignant invasive cancer that was observed to form metastatic lesions in a mouse xenograft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Santner et al., 2001</xref>). The current classification of DCIS relies on histological factors such as cell growth patterns and cytonuclear features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holland et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allred, 2010</xref>). Comedo-DCIS is a histologic subtype, which is characterized by apoptotic cell death, representing a high-grade DCIS with higher invasive potential than those of lower-grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shekhar et al., 2008</xref>). MCF10DCIS.com forms comedo-type DCIS lesions that can spontaneously transition to invasive cancer when xenografted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>To compare cell invasiveness under normal cell density and cell crowding conditions in vitro, we opted for a modified 2D matrix degradation assay. This approach allowed us to quantify overall cell invasiveness by normalizing it with the total cell number, thereby accounting for differences in cell densities. We chose this method over transwell, 3D Matrigel, or spheroid assays, where quantifying cell invasiveness as a function of cell density is challenging. By modifying an existing collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denisin and Pruitt, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>), we could determine the invasive cell fraction out of the total cell population by fluorescence imaging of the invasion gel bed and cell nuclei through low magnification (4 X) imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for a detailed procedure) when cells were at normal density versus under cell crowding conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell crowding selectively increases invasiveness in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We used a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay to assess the effect of cell crowding on cell invasiveness. Representative images show gelatin-Alexa488 conjugates, where dark areas in the green (Gelatin488) background indicate cell invasion through degradation, and DAPI staining marks cell locations (blue; DAPI) in a 2 d invasion assay of MCF10DCIS.com cells under normal density (ND; upper panel) and overconfluent (OC; lower panel) conditions. ‘Masked’ images are thresholded to produce positive masks applied to the ‘DAPI’ images. Individual cell locations detected in ‘DAPI’ images are marked with purple circles in ‘Detected points’ images. The total number of cells within the field of view is counted from these points. By overlaying the mask and DAPI images, ‘Masked DAPI’ images are obtained, and invaded cells are detected and represented by purple circles in ‘Masked points’ images. The invasive cell fraction is calculated by the ratio of the number of invaded cells to the total number of cells (0.24 for ND and 0.59 for OC MCF10DCIS.com cells). These data show that cell invasiveness is enhanced by cell crowding. Scale bar = 100 μm.

MCF10DCIS.com cell invasion is significantly higher under cell crowding than under ND conditions. (<bold>C</bold>) Invasive cell fractions of these cells between ND (blue circles) and OC (red circles) conditions are compared, showing that cell crowding-induced increases in invasiveness are notable only in MCF10DCIS.com cells.

Our goal was to determine a distinct time window, termed overconfluence (OC), where cell crowding-induced changes level off. The OC time window was achieved in cells cultured for an additional 5–10 d after reaching 100% confluence, with the growth medium replaced twice per day to prevent acidification. We confirmed that the cells remained largely viable under crowding conditions, with minimal cell death (~1.58%) similar to that observed in ND cells (~0.85%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).

These data suggest a striking and selective mechanosensing effect of cell crowding on cell invasiveness in MCF10DCIS.com cells. To ensure that acidification did not affect the invasiveness of MCF10DCIS.com cells despite the frequent replacement of the cell growth medium, we incubated ND cells for two days with acidified medium from cultures of OC MCF10DCIS.com cells.

Using a nanoindenter attached to the confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we extracted Young’s modulus of live individual cells to assess changes in cortical stiffness.

However, the changes in volume and stiffness from ND to OC conditions were more pronounced in MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The cell crowding-induced alterations in cell volume and stiffness were negligible in MCF10AT1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

The notable plasticity in cell volume and stiffness changes observed in MCF10DCIS.com cells in response to cell crowding potentially underscores the critical link between this plasticity and mechanosensitive increases in cell invasiveness. We assessed cell volume changes only as an effector event of cell crowding, without measuring cell stiffness, because cell volume reflects the mechanical properties of the entire cell, while Young’s modulus can vary depending on the location of indentations in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Radmacher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guilak et al., 2000</xref>).

Nav1.9 primarily contributes to the generation and propagation of action potentials in sensory neurons and is associated with various pain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dib-Hajj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2019</xref>).

However, unlike TRPV4, Nav1.9 and SK3 channels are not generally classified as mechanosensors. Consequently, we focused on TRPV4, the mechanosensor channel displaying the most significant increase in the plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, to further investigate its role in promoting pro-invasive cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.com cells.</p><p>To confirm the selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in OC-treated MCF10DCIS.com cells suggested by the mass spectrometry results, we performed immunoprecipitation using avidin beads on surface-biotinylated lysates from all four cell types under both control and OC conditions, followed by immunoblotting. The immunoblots showed a notable association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells, which was significantly lower in ND cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This association was not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells under any conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, in MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 associated with the plasma membrane under both conditions, with a slight increase in OC conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This increase suggests that these cells may also possess mechanosensing abilities, enabling them to respond to cell crowding. Additionally, immunoblots from whole-cell lysates showed consistent TRPV4 expression levels across different cell types and densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>), indicating that cell crowding influences ion channel trafficking without altering overall expression. This evidence strongly suggests that the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane is a mechanosensitive response to cell crowding.</p><p>To investigate the redistribution of TRPV4 in response to cell crowding, we performed IF imaging with confocal microscopy across all four cell types under both ND and OC conditions. The binding specificity of the TRPV4 antibody was validated in MCF10DCIS.com cells using TRPV4-specific shRNA, as demonstrated by IF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In contrast, it was prominently associated with the plasma membrane in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 was also associated with plasma membrane under ND conditions, but cell crowding also increased the association significantly as shown in MCF10DCIS.com cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Plasma membrane associations were verified using the plasma membrane marker DiIC18(3), which we previously used to visualize the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). IF images showed that TRPV4 successfully colocalized with DiIC18(3) in OC MCF10DCIS.com and OC MCF10CA1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, the non-interacting protein transferrin receptor (TfR; green) remained similarly distributed in the OC cells compared to the ND cells, indicating that the protein trafficking changes induced by cell crowding are specific to TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether other ion channels identified through mass spectrometry and the well-known mechanosensory channel PIEZO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coste et al., 2010</xref>) exhibit similar behavior, we conducted IF imaging on ND and OC MCF10DCIS.com cells targeting KCNN4 and PIEZO1. Unfortunately, due to the absence of specific antibodies, we were unable to examine SCN11. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, KCNN4 was observed to be mostly cytosolic, while PIEZO1 was mildly but slightly more associated with the plasma membrane than TRPV4 under ND conditions. However, under OC conditions, both PIEZO1 and KCNN4 also relocated to the plasma membrane, albeit to a lesser extent than TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The varying degrees of plasma membrane association of PIEZO1 and KCNN4 are quantified using line analysis, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>.</p><p>As expected, in MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and MCF10DCIS.com cells under ND conditions, TRPV4 was modestly present at the plasma membrane but predominantly localized intracellularly, with notable enrichment in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Under OC conditions, TRPV4 remained largely cytosolic in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells but migrated out of the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, in OC MCF10DCIS.com cells, approximately 80% of TRPV4 relocated to the plasma membrane, as shown by line analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane was evident under both ND and OC conditions, with a further increase under OC, aligning with the immunoprecipitation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 was quantified using line analysis and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 associations with the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus between ND and OC conditions in all four cell types. These IF imaging results underscore the mechanosensitive plasma membrane relocation of ion channels in MCF10DCIS.com, and to an extent, in MCF10CA1a cells, contrasting with the observed insensitivity of MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells to cell crowding.</p><p>To assess the relationship between cell crowding-induced cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, we investigated whether hyperosmotic conditions, which reduce cell volume without cell crowding, would also result in TRPV4 relocation. We subjected ND cells to the same PEG 300 condition (74.4 mOsm/kg for 15 min) used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> to induce cell volume reduction. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, such hyperosmotic cell volume reduction prompted significant plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, a response not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells, but observed in MCF10CA1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Quantitative line analysis confirmed these findings by assessing the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus). We confirmed that the apparent plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 under the hyperosmotic condition was indeed localized at the plasma membrane by using an extracellular domain antibody against TRPV4 in live MCF10DCIS.com cells, both untreated and treated with 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. As expected, significant antibody binding was observed only in PEG 300-treated cells, where intracellular TRPV4 had relocated to the plasma membrane unlike in untreated live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). This finding underscores the relationship between mechanosensitive cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, highlighting that both cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress lead to the same effect, which is particularly pronounced in MCF10DCIS.com cells.</p><p>We investigated whether TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane induced by cell crowding is reversible, as suggested by its impact on invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>). To test this, previously OC MCF10DCIS.com cells were reseeded under ND conditions. We then assessed TRPV4 localization via IF imaging to determine if most channels returned to the cytoplasm with only a modest localization at the plasma membrane, and could be relocated to the plasma membrane under mechanical stress, such as hyperosmotic conditions, again. Consistent with their initial ND state, reseeded ND MCF10DCIS.com cells displayed intracellular TRPV4 distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Upon exposure to hyperosmotic stress (74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300), TRPV4 was again relocated to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). These findings, quantified through line analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>), demonstrate that the mechanosensing response of MCF10DCIS.com cells is reversible.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Patient tissue analysis shows selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells</title><p>MCF10DCIS.com cells represent a basal cell model for high-grade DCIS cells driven by HRAS mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 2000</xref>). However, the majority of patient-derived DCIS cells originate from the luminal cell population and lack the HRAS mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Samson et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, there are limited options for patient-derived DCIS cell line models, and those that are available are not associated with well-defined pathological grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ransom and Sontheimer, 1995</xref>). Thus, to seek generality of our finding regarding the selective association between plasma membrane relocation and high-grade DCIS pathology, we examined 39 breast cancer patient tissue blocks to assess the selectivity in vivo. We designed an early-stage retrospective study by selecting various breast tissue pathologies that range from benign to invasive cancer. Those pathologies include benign (including usual ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, columnar changes), ADH, low- to high-grade DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We also incorporated normal regions for comparison. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to visualize tissue sections from each patient, excluding samples with prior cancer diagnoses or drug treatments. In total, 97 regions of interest (ROIs) from H&amp;E-stained sections of 39 patient tissue blocks were selected. Two pathologists independently assessed TRPV4 distribution patterns at the single-cell level in corresponding ROIs in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). A detailed methodology is described in the Methods section and more example images are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s6sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 6—source data 1</xref>. High-grade DCIS cells, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, clearly demonstrated plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), a feature absent in lower-grade DCIS cells (intermediate- and low-grade). This distinction sets them apart not only from cells with ADH and benign pathologies but also from lower-grade DCIS cells. As demonstrated by the IF images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> for MCF10CA1a (invasive cell mimic), IDC cells exhibited notable plasma membrane TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that they possess a similar pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability to high-grade DCIS cells.</p><p>We found that the sensitivity and specificity for plasma membrane TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells were 0.75±0.19 (15/20) and 0.98±0.03 (61/62), respectively (95% confidence interval) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). It is important to note that the specificity calculation excluded IDC cases. Notably, even in less aggressive pathologies, a significant amount of TRPV4 was localized in the nuclei, as shown for MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells in the IF images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. This underscores our interpretation from the in vitro results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref> that increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells results from changes in protein localization through trafficking alterations, rather than differences in expression levels. These initial in vivo results clearly demonstrate the selective and specific association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. Notably, this association is absent in lower-grade DCIS, ADH, benign, and normal cells, thereby confirming our in vitro findings using MCF10A cell derivatives. These results suggest a potentially critical role for TRPV4 in the progression of high-grade DCIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cell crowding inhibits ion channels and triggers their plasma membrane relocations</title><p>A calcium-permeant ion channel like TRPV4 is known to influence intracellular calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2005</xref>). While activation of TRPV4 typically elevates calcium levels and this potentially increases cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoffmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stutzin and Hoffmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clapham, 2007</xref>), the impact of its inhibition is less clear, given the multifaceted nature of calcium signaling in cell volume control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jentsch, 2016</xref>). This complexity is compounded by compensatory cellular mechanisms and the involvement of other ion channels in response to altered calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jentsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2005</xref>). Considering these factors, we hypothesized that cell crowding might inhibit calcium-permeant ion channels that are constitutively active at the plasma membrane, including TRPV4, which would then lower intracellular calcium levels and subsequently reduce cell volume via osmotic water movement. To test this, we employed the Fluo-4 calcium assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gee et al., 2000</xref>) to compare relative intracellular calcium levels of MCF10DCIS.com cells between ND and confluent (Con) conditions through 4 X confocal microscopy imaging with 488 nm excitation. For this calcium assay, we opted for confluent conditions instead of OC conditions to collect the Fluo-4 signal from confluent monolayers of MCF10DCIS cells, which demonstrates comparable cell-crowding induced TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as observed in the OC condition. This choice was made because more than one layer of cells was occasionally observed in OC conditions, which would yield an overestimation of crowding-dependent intracellular calcium levels. The intracellular Fluo-4 signal under Con conditions was significantly lower than that under ND conditions, as shown in the fluorescence images of ND versus Con cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Time-dependent Fluo-4 images were acquired over 25 min. For ND cell images, the average Fluo-4 intensity values were calculated from 10 to 15 selected cells (highlighted in the white box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For Con cell images, intensity values were derived from all cells within the entire 50 μm by 50 μm field of view, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. After background subtraction, the intensity values were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. The temporal Fluo-4 intensity profiles from both ND and Con cells remained largely constant over the measured 20 min period. However, Con cells exhibited significantly lower Fluo-4 intensity compared to ND cells, indicating reduced intracellular calcium levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Lower Fluo-4 intensity in Con cells than in ND cells was not due to limited Fluo-4 reagent in Con samples. Within cell clusters, cells experiencing crowding exhibited notably lower Fluo-4 levels compared to those at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that cell crowding had resulted in a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, likely due to the mechanosensitive inhibition of calcium-permeable channels like TRPV4.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cell crowding inhibits ion channels and triggers their plasma membrane relocations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To compare intracellular calcium (Ca²<sup>+</sup>) levels, we used a Fluo-4 AM assay, where green fluorescence intensity increases with higher intracellular Ca²<sup>+</sup> levels. Calcium levels are significantly lower in confluent (Con) MCF10DCIS.com cells. (<bold>B</bold>) The temporal progression of averaged Fluo-4 intensity in normal density (ND) MCF10DCIS.com cells (blue curve) in the box shown on the left image is compared with that of Con cells (red curve). Fluo-4 intensity is consistently lower in Con cells than in ND cells for approximately 25 min (200 ms acquisition time and 30 s time interval). (<bold>C</bold>) Fluo-4 intensity reduction due to cell crowding is significant in MCF10DCIS.com cells. 10 images were used for calculating average Fluo-4 intensities for both ND and Con cells. (<bold>D</bold>-<bold>H</bold>) Pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 with 1 nM GSK219 generates dips in the Fluo-4 signal. Fluo-4 images at the baseline (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) and the dip (<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>) post 1 nM GSK219 are compared in MCF10DCIS.com cells between ND (<bold>D</bold>) and Con (<bold>F</bold>) conditions. The Fluo-4 intensity time traces are compared between ND (blue; E) and Con (red; G) conditions, showing that the magnitude of the dip (marked as ΔCa) is significantly lower in Con cells, where TRPV4 activity is largely inhibited under cell crowding conditions. Notably, the magnitude of ΔCa increased with higher GSK219 doses (1 nM vs. 0.2 nM), but remained significantly lower in Con MCF10DCIS.com cells, with smaller changes observed under the 0.2 nM GSK219 condition. The number of ΔCa measurements (<bold>H</bold>) (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was as follows: MCF10DCIS.com (ND+ GSK219 Low: 9; ND+ GSK219 High: 12; Con+ GSK219 High: 10; Con+ GSK219 Low: 14). (<bold>I</bold>-<bold>M</bold>) TRPV4 activation with 0.2 pM GSK101 leads to a small spike in ND cells (<bold>I, J</bold>). However, in Con cells, the same GSK101 treatment leads to a notably larger spike in Fluo-4 intensity, indicating that TRPV4 inhibition and subsequent relocation to the plasma membrane by cell crowding primes the ion channels for activation. GSK101 treatment also leads to a dose-dependent increase in the spike magnitude with a higher GSK101 concentration being strikingly high in Con MCF10DCIS.com cells (0.05 pM: 101 L; 0.2 pM: 101 H). The number of ΔCa measurements (<bold>M</bold>) (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was as follows: MCF10DCIS.com (ND+ GSK101 Low: 7; ND+ GSK101 High: 9; Con+ GSK101 Low: 9; Con+ GSK101 High: 9). (<bold>N-Q</bold>) TRPV4 activation status-dependent intracellular localization changes. (<bold>N</bold>) IF images of TRPV4 (red) and TfR (green) in ND MCF10DCIS.com cells show that GSK101 does not increase plasma membrane association of TRPV4. However, GSK219 significantly relocates TRPV4 to the plasma membrane in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> for all dose cases), similar to ND cells treated with 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. (<bold>O</bold>) In OC cells, while GSK219 does not significantly alter TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane, GSK101 depletes plasma membrane TRPV4 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> for all dose cases), suggesting that TRPV4 activation status affects its trafficking. Relative plasma membrane associations with different treatments are quantified for ND (<bold>P</bold>) and OC (<bold>Q</bold>) cells using line analysis. The number of line analyses (P, Q) (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was as follows: ND and OC MCF10DCIS.com (control: 12 and 8; GSK219 Low: 6 and 7; GSK219 High: 6 and 13; GSK101 Low: 7 and 8; GSK101 High: 7 and 10; 2% PEG: 12 and 12). (<bold>R</bold>) The values of Fluo-4 spikes by GSK101 and dips by GSK219 show a linear relationship (<italic>R</italic>²~0.69) with the plasma membrane TRPV4 association, indicating a negative correlation between them. This reinforces the observation that TRPV4 inhibition increases its association with the plasma membrane, while activation shows the reverse effect. (<bold>S-V</bold>) Compared to the Fluo-4 intensity in control MCF10DCIS.com cells (S, T), shRNA showed similar baseline Fluo-4 levels (<bold>U, V</bold>). However, hyperosmotic stress by 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 (light gray box) led to a noticeable spike only in control ND cells. Additionally, cell crowding conditions (Con) led to a decreased Fluo-4 level (at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> baseline in the image in S and red time trace in T); but a reduced in Fluo-4 level difference in shRNA-treated MCF10DCIS.com cells (<italic>t</italic>1; U) compared to control cases (<bold>S, T</bold>), as shown in the image and time trace (<italic>t</italic>1; V). (<bold>W</bold>) Relative Fluo-4 time-averaged intensities are plotted for individual control ND (blue) vs. Con (red) cells, and shRNA-treated ND (semi-transparent blue) vs. Con (semi-transparent red) cells. Intracellular calcium levels in shRNA ND cells are lower than those in control ND cells, reflecting the reduced number of TRPV4 channels. The decrease in calcium levels by crowding (Con) in shRNA cells is clearly lower than in control cells, reflecting the importance of TRPV4 in mechanosensing cell volume reduction. The number of Fluo-4 average measurements (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was as follows: MCF10DCIS.com control and TRPV4 shRNA groups (ND: 19 and 18; Con: 11 and 17). (<bold>X</bold>) PEG 300-induced calcium spikes are significantly lower in shRNA cells (semi-transparent gray) than in control cells (gray), reinforcing TRPV4’s crucial role in MCF10DCIS.com mechanotransduction. The number of ΔCa measurements under 2% PEG 300 condition was as follows: ND MCF10DCIS.com (ND: 19; TRPV4shRNA: 16). (<bold>Y</bold>) TRPV4 silencing significantly reduced the mechanosensing cell volume reduction effect. Control ND cells underwent a 48% volume reduction in response to 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300, whereas TRPV4-silenced cells reduced their volume by only 27%. The number of single-cell volume measurements (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was as follows: ND and TRPV4shRNA treated MCF10DCIS.com (Control: 11 and 13; 2%

These results indicate that TRPV4 inhibition induces its strategic relocation to the plasma membrane, priming the channels for rapid activation to counteract the effects of mechanically-induced inhibition.</p><p>In contrast, in Con cells, where a greater number of inactive TRPV4 channels are likely present at the plasma membrane, GSK101 treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, likely due to internalization of the activated channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O and Q</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baratchi et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that plasma membrane TRPV4 levels were largely regulated by the channel’s activity status. Specifically, channel activation led to the internalization of TRPV4, while channel inhibition promoted the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane. This relationship was approximately linear, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>, with intracellular calcium changes inversely proportional to the plasma membrane fraction of TRPV4 (<italic>R</italic>² ≈ 0.69).</p><p>Contrary to our expectation, GSK219 treatment in Con cells slightly reduced TRPV4 levels at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O and Q</xref>). Moreover, higher doses of GSK219 increased nuclear TRPV4 levels in Con cells without affecting cytoplasmic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings suggest that further TRPV4 inhibition under crowding conditions triggers a distinct trafficking alteration. Recent studies have implicated nuclear TRPV4 in regulating nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Espadas-Álvarez et al., 2021</xref>), and, in light of this study and our findings, TRPV4 may relocate to the nucleus as a compensatory mechanism to maintain nuclear calcium regulation. This relocation could reflect an adaptive response to preserve calcium-dependent transcriptional programs or other nuclear processes essential for cell survival under mechanical stress.</p><p>Given the role of TRPV4 in osmoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liedtke and Friedman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2005</xref>), we investigated its significant relocation to the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic conditions. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, TRPV4 plasma membrane association increased from a baseline of ~15% to ~55% following 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 treatment, as shown by line analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4P</xref>). To explore whether TRPV4 inhibition contributed to this relocation, we conducted Fluo-4 assays under the same treatment conditions. The results revealed that osmotic water outflow induced an initial spike in intracellular calcium concentration, followed by a homeostatic relaxation aimed at restoring calcium levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This relaxation likely involved the inhibition of ion channels, including TRPV4, and their subsequent relocation to the plasma membrane.</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis, we confirmed the plasma membrane relocation of other ion channels, namely KCNN4 and PIEZO1, following the same PEG 300 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>, showing IF images and line analysis results). These findings suggest that the increased ion channel association with the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic stress reflects an adaptive response to water outflow, driven by the inhibition and redistribution of channels to regulate osmotic balance.</p><p>To investigate the role of TRPV4 in mechanotransduction, we used shRNA to silence TRPV4 gene expression, resulting in a ~50% reduction in TRPV4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then assessed the effects of TRPV4 silencing on intracellular calcium levels in ND and Con conditions, as well as the immediate calcium response to hyperosmotic stress induced by 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. In ND cells, hyperosmotic stress triggered a significant calcium spike, as shown in the Fluo-4 image (middle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>) and time trace (blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4T</xref>). In contrast, TRPV4 silencing in ND cells led to a lower intracellular calcium level (left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U</xref>) and a reduced calcium spike in response to hyperosmotic stress (middle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U</xref>, and semi-transparent blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4V</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of TRPV4 silencing on intracellular calcium levels was less pronounced in Con cells (semi-transparent red; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4V</xref>) compared to the ND counterpart (semi-transparent blue; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4V</xref>). The relative intracellular calcium levels are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4W</xref>.</p><p>Notably, TRPV4 silencing significantly reduced the immediate calcium spike as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4X</xref>. This calcium spike was attributed to increased calcium concentration due to hyperosmotically reduced cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, TRPV4 may play a critical role in mechanotransduction, enabling cells to sufficiently reduce their volume in response to mechanical stress (large volume plasticity). To further investigate this, we examined the effect of TRPV4 silencing on ND MCF10DCIS.com cell volume reduction in response to hyperosmotic stress. We indeed found that control ND cells underwent a 48% volume reduction in response to 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300, whereas TRPV4-silenced cells only reduced their volume by 27% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Y</xref>). Notably, the reduced cell volume change observed in TRPV4-silenced cells under hyperosmotic conditions supports the idea that the observed calcium spikes are driven by cell volume reduction. This finding reinforces the concept that TRPV4 enhances cellular mechanosensitivity through channel inactivation–induced calcium reduction in response to mechanical stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TRPV4 inhibition drives cell volume reduction and increased invasiveness under cell crowding</title><p>To elucidate the relationship between TRPV4 inhibition, cell volume reduction, and increased invasiveness under cell crowding, we investigated the effects of TRPV4 activity status on these processes.

This treatment duration was selected to align with the timeframe in which cell volume reduction and invasiveness changes are observed in response to cell crowding.</p><p>Under ND conditions, activating TRPV4 with GSK101 (0.05 or 0.2 pM for 2 d), which led to only modest calcium spikes and largely unaltered TRPV4 distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), did not significantly impact cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Conversely, TRPV4 inhibitor GSK219, which increased plasma membrane association in a dose-dependent manner, reduced cell volume, with the effect of 1 nM GSK219 (219 H) being similar to that of 74.4 mOsm/Kg (2%) PEG 300.

Compared to untreated ND cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 treatment slowed overall cell diffusion, while 1 nM GSK219 and 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 treatments increased cell diffusion. ShRNA TRPV4 (Sh-ctrl) increased cell motility under ND conditions. However, with TRPV4 depletion, treatment with 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 failed to increase cell diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) in shRNA-treated cells (Sh-PEG), unlike in the untreated cells.

Using a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay, we evaluated changes in invasiveness after 2 d treatments with GSK101 or GSK219. In ND MCF10DCIS.com cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 mildly suppressed cell invasiveness, while 0.05 pM GSK101 caused no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, GSK219 increased the invasive cell fraction in a dose-dependent manner under ND conditions, mirroring changes in Fluo-4 signals and plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Under OC conditions, GSK101 increased cell volume and suppressed cell invasiveness dose-dependently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Consistent with the trend in cell invasiveness, TRPV4 activation with 1 pM GSK101 significantly reduced single-cell movements, while inhibition with 0.2 nM GSK219 and 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 notably increased these movements.</p><p>Using the single-cell motility assay, we investigated how TRPV4 enhances cell invasiveness through a mechanotransduction mechanism involving cell-volume reduction. Reducing TRPV4 expression (~50%) via shRNA diminished the cell volume reduction effect of mechanosensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Y</xref>). We predicted that shRNA would also attenuate the increased cell motility effect of mechanosensing in MCF10DCIS.com cells.

We employed novel assays to quantify cell invasion and single-cell motility in cells with breast tissue pathologies, including DCIS and ADH, which experience cell crowding due to abnormal proliferation in confined ducts. Our results revealed a mechanotransduction pathway activated by crowding selectively in high-grade DCIS cells, establishing a direct link between crowding and invasiveness. This pathway includes ion channel inhibition, intracellular calcium reduction, compensatory channel relocation to the plasma membrane for priming them for later activation, cell volume reduction and cell stiffening, and increased invasiveness and motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, the compensatory relocation of ion channels to the plasma membrane serves as a reliable indicator of an active mechanotransduction pathway. This mechanotransduction capability that enables pro-invasive cell volume reduction distinguishes high-grade DCIS cells from normal, hyperplastic, or lower-grade DCIS cells, supporting previous findings that the ability of cells to reach minimal cell volume promotes efficient invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Watkins and Sontheimer, 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cell crowding activates a pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells but not in less aggressive or normal cells.</title><p>This cell-crowding-induced pro-invasive pathway involves a cascade of events, including ion channel inhibition, intracellular calcium reduction, cell volume reduction and cortical stiffening, and increased cell invasiveness and motility. In high-grade DCIS cells, calcium-permeable ion channels such as TRPV4 relocate to the plasma membrane upon inhibition, compensating for reduced intracellular calcium levels by priming the channels for later activation under mechanical stress. The pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway is selectively triggered by cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress in high-grade DCIS cells, which exhibit significant TRPV4 plasma membrane relocation, pronounced cell volume reduction, and increased motility and invasiveness. In contrast, less aggressive or normal cells remain significantly less or non-responsive to these stimuli. Notably, MCF10DCIS.com cells exhibit greater cell volume reduction compared to other cells, likely due to their larger baseline cell volume at normal density, demonstrating their high cell volume plasticity that correlates with crowding-induced invasiveness. The extent of TRPV4 plasma membrane relocation, cell volume reduction, and increased invasiveness and motility scales with each other, where the increased TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane can robustly serve as a marker of pro-invasive mechanotransduction activation. This mechanotransduction capability sets high-grade DCIS cells apart from less aggressive cells, providing a critical criterion that may help identify high-risk cells with invasive potential. This mechanotransduction capability was also validated in patient specimens, suggesting its relevance in clinical settings. Future investigations will include utilizing TRPV4 localization patterns as a diagnostic tool to assist in pathological grading and as a prognostic marker to identify high-risk DCIS cells likely to activate this pathway under mechanical stress.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100490-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Using mass spectrometry, we identified TRPV4 as a crucial component of this pathway, providing insights into how non-invasive breast cancer cells may evolve into invasive phenotypes under mechanical stress. Through Fluo-4 assays and TRPV4 activators and inhibitors, we found that cell crowding triggered TRPV4 inhibition, leading to reduced intracellular calcium and subsequent cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.com cells. Notably, TRPV4 inhibition prompted its relocation to the plasma membrane, priming it for later activation under suitable signaling conditions to maintain cellular homeostasis. TRPV4 inhibition by cell crowding increased invasiveness and motility, while TRPV4 activation had the opposite effect. Reducing TRPV4 protein expression by 50% via shRNA diminished both calcium decrease and volume reduction under mechanical stress, such as cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions. These TRPV4-knockdown cells did not exhibit increased motility under hyperosmotic conditions, demonstrating TRPV4’s critical role in mechanotransduction-induced invasiveness through lowering cell volume plasticity. Invasive MCF10CA1a cells showed similar but modest mechanotransduction capability. In contrast, other invasive breast cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, exhibited opposing responses to TRPV4 inhibition and activation, highlighting the heterogeneity of TRPV4 roles in invasive cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prevarskaya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery of a selective mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells was further validated through the analysis of patient-derived breast cancer tissues.

This selective relocation highlights TRPV4’s critical role in the pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway unique to high-grade DCIS cells and certain IDC subsets. These findings suggest that plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 may serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying high-grade DCIS lesions.</p><p>Our data indicate that ion channels beyond TRPV4 may contribute to pro-invasive mechanotransduction. Notably, SCN11A and KCNN4 showed increased plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, suggesting their roles in modulating ion flux and cell volume and thus contributing to the mechanotransduction response. Although PIEZO1 is known to respond to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coste et al., 2010</xref>), its lesser plasma membrane relocation compared to TRPV4 under cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions suggests a lesser role in promoting invasiveness in this case. Further comparisons are needed to determine the dominant ion channels driving mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells. However, it is evident that cell crowding-induced pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathway involves the coordinated action of multiple ion channels to significantly reduce intracellular calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We made the novel discovery that hyperosmotic conditions, which reduce cell volume through osmotic water efflux, mimic the effects of cell crowding by inducing similar pro-invasive cell volume reduction. Treatment with hyperosmotic agents such as PEG 300 caused TRPV4 to relocate to the plasma membrane and increased cell invasiveness, underscoring TRPV4’s role as a key mechanosensor responding to external mechanical stresses in this pathway. These findings suggest that the convergence of different mechanical stresses, including cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress, serves as a critical trigger for TRPV4 inactivation–driven, pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathways, activating a unified mechanotransduction signaling cascade.</p><p>The study’s insights have far-reaching implications, unlocking new research paths in cancer and biological sciences. By elucidating mechanosensitive responses to cell crowding, we can shed light on tissue development, wound healing, and physiological processes involving cell density changes. The parallels between cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions in driving pro-invasive behaviors warrant further investigation into the intricate mechanisms of cytoskeleton reorganization, ion channel, and transporter relocation, and enhanced cell invasiveness and motility. Importantly, our findings illuminate the mechanotransduction capability of high-grade DCIS cells that differentiate them from less aggressive cells. This understanding paves the way for developing diagnostic and prognostic strategies that leverage the selective intracellular localization patterns of TRPV4 and other mechanosensitive ion channels, ultimately guiding clinical decisions for patients with high-risk DCIS and other cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF10A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_0598">CVCL_0598</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF10AT1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Karmanos Cancer Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_5554">CVCL_5554</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Premalignant variant of MCF10A with oncogenic H-Ras expression</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF10DCIS.com</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Karmanos Cancer Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_5552">CVCL_5552</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DCIS progression model with features of comedo necrosis, derived from MCF10AT1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF10CA1a</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Karmanos Cancer Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_6675">CVCL_6675</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invasive carcinoma derivative of MCF10DCIS.com</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ETCC-010</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leibniz Institute DSMZ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_6G22">CVCL_6G22</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patient-derived, hTERT-immortalized DCIS cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ETCC-006</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Leibniz Institute DSMZ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_6G19">CVCL_6G19</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patient-derived, hTERT-immortalized DCIS cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MDA-MD-231</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_0062">CVCL_0062</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Highly aggressive, triple-negative breast cancer cell line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">hTRPV4 shRNA Plasmid;

The cytosol location was defined as the region between the 50% peak intensity points of the DiIC18(3) and DAPI signals. The ion channel signal in each window along the line was then averaged. The percentage of protein localization in the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus for a cell was calculated by dividing the average intensity of each location by the sum of intensities in all three locations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Live cell detection of plasma membrane-associated TRPV4</title><p>Cells were seeded in a LabTek II 8-well Chambered Coverglass dish (Thermo Fisher 155409) at a density of 10,000 cells per well and allowed to adhere and grow for 2 d. Afterward, the cells were incubated on ice for 1 hr with 1:300 Anti-TRPV4 (extracellular) rabbit primary antibody (Alomone ACC-124) in either complete media or 74 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 in complete media. Following the incubation, the cells were washed twice with the respective media (complete media or 74 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 in complete media) while remaining on ice. Subsequently, the cells were stained for 1 hr at 22 °C with 1:5000 Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG H+L Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher A31573) in the same respective media. After the staining period, the cells were imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Pipeline for analyses of patient histologic samples</title><list list-type="order" id="list1"><list-item><p>Specimen collection: A retrospective clinical study was conducted to collect patient tissue blocks under IRB approval from George Washington University (IRB# NCR203065), with patient consent waived.

A pathologist chose 39 patient breast formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens, representing a combination of the following pathologies: benign, ADH, IDC, low-, intermediate-, or high-grade DCIS, and IDC, along with normal tissue from each patient. Specimens associated with a past cancer diagnosis or drug treatment history were excluded.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sample preparation for histopathologic evaluation: For each FFPE block, two serial dissections were carried out. Tissue sections on unlabeled slides were stained with H&amp;E and subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining using anti-TRPV4 antibodies (Abcam 39260; 1:100 dilution). Whole-slide images were captured using the Olympus VS200 whole-slide imaging system. To validate the binding specificity of the antibody, both negative and positive control samples were prepared. IHC staining was performed by VitroVivo Biotech (Rockville, MD) and Histoserv, Inc (Germantown, MD).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Two sequential annotations: A breast surgical pathologist annotated the pathology stages within specified regions of interest (ROIs) on whole slide H&amp;E images, based on cell morphological features.

The 2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent was first prepared by adding 10 mL of the Fluo-4 calcium assay buffer and 200 μL of 250 mM probenecid to the desiccated calcium assay reagent at room temperature (21 °C). This mixture was then vortexed and allowed to sit for 15 min. While waiting for the 2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent to finish being prepared, the media from the well of a LabTek II Chambered Coverglass with Cover #1.5 Borosilicate Sterile 8-well plate (Thermo Fisher 155409) was removed and replaced with 200 μL of complete media. Once the 2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent was fully prepared, 200 μL of the reagent was added to the well with 200 μL of complete media. The 8-well plate was then placed at 37 °C and 5% CO₂ for 30 min. Following 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO₂, the 8-well plate was removed from the incubator and placed at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation in the reagent for 30 min at room temperature, the 8-well plate was imaged using the confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser for 30 min with 30 s intervals between images and an exposure time of 200 ms. If the sample was treated, the sample was imaged for 35 min with 30 s intervals, with the treatment being added after 5 min had elapsed. Added treatments all had a final volume of 200 μL and were composed of: 1 nM GSK 2 in 1:1 media:2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 0.2 nM GSK 2 in 1:1 media:2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 0.2 pM GSK 1 in 1:1 media:2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 1:1:1 water:media:2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, and 0.3 Osm/L PEG 300 in 1:1 media:2 X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Cell motility assay</title><p>Cells were first seeded in MatTek 35 mm dishes with No. 1.5 coverslip, 14 mm glass diameter, and Poly-D-Lysine coated glass bottoms (MatTek P35GC-1.5–14 C). Once the cells adhered, they were stained with 10 μg/mL WGA-488 (Thermo Fisher W11261) for 10 min at room temperature. Following the staining, the cells were washed with complete media twice and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO₂ for 1 hr. During this incubation, the cells received the following treatments: 0.2 pM GSK 101 in complete media for 1 hr, 0.05 pM GSK 101 in complete media for 1 hr, 1 nM GSK 219 in complete media for 1 hr, 0.2 nM GSK 219 in complete media for 1 hr, 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 in complete media for 15 min, and 1:1 hypoosmotic solution in complete media for 15 min.

Once the cells in the well reached the desired number of days post-confluence, they were stained using Propidium Iodide Ready Flow Reagent (Thermo Fisher R37169). Specifically, one drop of propidium iodide (PI) was added to 500 µL of cell growth medium per well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (22 °C). After staining, the cells were washed twice with complete growth medium. Next, the cells were stained with 1 µg/mL WGA-488 (Thermo Fisher w11261) in complete growth medium for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere. Following the incubation with WGA-488, the cells were washed three times with complete growth medium and then incubated for 2 hr at 37 °C in 5% CO₂ to allow WGA migration into the nuclei. Finally, the cells were imaged using confocal microscopy at 4 X magnification, with laser excitation at 488 nm for WGA-488 and 560 nm for propidium iodide.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is an inventor on US Patent 12013398 related to the findings described in this manuscript</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>A retrospective clinical study was conducted to collect patient tissue blocks under IRB approval from George Washington University (IRB# NCR203065), with patient consent waived.

The authors convincingly showed that enhanced TRPV4 plasmamembrane localization correlates with high-grade DCIS cells in patient tissue samples. Specifically in invasive MCF10DCIS.com cells they showed that overcrowding or over-confluence leads to a decrease in cell volume and intracellular calcium levels. This condition also triggers the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores (nucleus and potentially endosomes), to the plasma membrane (PM). When these over-confluent cells are incubated with a TRPV4 activator, there is an acute and substantial influx of calcium, attesting the fact that there are high number of TRPV4 channels present on the PM. Long-term incubation of these over-confluent cells with the TRPV4 activator results in the internalization of the PM-localized TRPV4 channels.</p><p>In contrast, cells plated at lower confluence primarily have TRPV4 channels localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Long-term incubation of these cells at lower confluence with a TRPV4 inhibitor leads to the relocation of TRPV4 channels to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores and a subsequent reduction in cell volume. Similarly, incubation of these cells at low confluence with PEG 3000 (a hyperosmotic agent) promotes the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is elegantly designed and the findings are novel. Their findings on this mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, calcium homeostasis, cell volume plasticity, motility and invasiveness will have a great impact in the cancer field and potentially applicable to other fields as well.
