Centrosome number is tightly regulated by limiting centriole duplication to a single round per cell cycle. This control is achieved by multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of the protein kinase PLK4, the most upstream facilitator of centriole duplication. Altered centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells cause p53-dependent growth arrest through poorly defined mechanisms. Recent work has shown that the E3 ligase TRIM37 is required for cell cycle arrest in acentrosomal cells. To gain additional insights into this process, we undertook a series of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify factors important for growth arrest triggered by treatment with centrinone B, a selective PLK4 inhibitor. We found that TRIM37 is a key mediator of growth arrest after partial or full PLK4 inhibition. Interestingly, PLK4 cellular mobility decreased in a dose-dependent manner after centrinone B treatment. In contrast to recent work, we found that growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition correlated better with PLK4 activity than with mitotic length or centrosome number. These data provide insights into the global response to changes in centrosome number and PLK4 activity and extend the role for TRIM37 in regulating the abundance, localization, and function of centrosome proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PLK4</kwd><kwd>TRIM37</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>E3 ligase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004089</institution-id><institution>Krembil Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelletier</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR FDN 167279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelletier</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012171</institution-id><institution>Ontario Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pelletier</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide CRISPR screens in human cells identifies a role for TRIM37 in growth arrest after chemical inhibition of PLK4.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The centrosome is a multi-protein complex that is the major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of metazoan cells influencing microtubule-based processes such as cell division, ciliogenesis, signalling, and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>). Each centrosome consists of two microtubule-based centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>). Each cell inherits a single centrosome from the previous cell cycle and subsequent centriole duplication is restricted to a single round of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gönczy and Hatzopoulos, 2019</xref>). Centriole duplication initiates at the G1/S transition and is largely a stepwise pathway dependent on the upstream kinase PLK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gönczy and Hatzopoulos, 2019</xref>). PLK4 is a low-abundance protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fode et al., 1996</xref>) that is recruited around the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sonnen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). PLK4 kinase activity is regulated by interaction with STIL and CEP85 resulting in the recruitment of SASS6 to form the cartwheel of the nascent daughter centriole followed by the recruitment of centriole elongation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohlmaier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azimzadeh et al., 2009</xref>). PLK4 functions as a homodimer and autophosphorylates itself in trans to generate a phosphodegron sequence that limits its abundance. This sequence is recognized by SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> and targets PLK4 for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rogers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cunha-Ferreira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guderian et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>PLK4 misregulation is often associated with pathological states.

In cell culture and mouse models, overexpression, inhibition, or deletion of PLK4 results in p53-dependent arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambrus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marthiens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vitre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Serçin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hudson et al., 2001</xref>).

A recent screen for mediators of supernumerary centrosome-induced arrest identified PIDDosome/p53 and placed the distal appendage protein ANKRD26 within this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>TRIM37 is an E3 ligase that has been associated with a myriad of cellular functions including gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatnagar et al., 2014</xref>), peroxisome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), various signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), and centriole biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balestra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balestra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meitinger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>). There is no consensus on how TRIM37 mediates these functions since its activities have been linked to mono-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatnagar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>), and E3-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) that result in changes in protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatnagar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meitinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balestra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meitinger et al., 2021</xref>), and abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). A number of centrosome-related TRIM37 functions have been described. In the absence of TRIM37, a collection of centriole proteins such as CNTROB, PLK4, CETN1/2, CP110 accumulate to form aberrant assemblies referred to as condensates or ‘Cenpas’ (centriolar protein assemblies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balestra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meitinger et al., 2021</xref>). These structures are dependent on the presence of CNTROB, but it is unclear why TRIM37 might suppress their formation in normal cells. TRIM37 is part of the 17q23 amplicon present in approximately 18% of breast cancer tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kallioniemi et al., 1994</xref>) and overexpression of TRIM37 in these lines renders them sensitive to the PLK4 inhibitor centrinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). TRIM37 interacts with PLK4 and CEP192 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). Although TRIM37 can promote ubiquitination of PLK4, it is distinct from SCF<sup>β−TRCP</sup> modification since it does not result in changes to PLK4 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, transiently overexpressed TRIM37 leads to CEP192 ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). In this model of TRIM37 function, PLK4-nucleated condensates consisting of PCM components facilitate mitosis in the absence of TRIM37 and the overexpression of TRIM37 decreases the cellular levels of CEP192 rendering cells sensitive to the loss of centrioles.</p><p>Here, we sought to determine how growth arrest is initiated in response to alterations in PLK4 activity and centrosome number. Using the specific PLK4 inhibitor, centrinone B, we modulated PLK4 activity to generate supernumerary centrosomes or centrosome loss and performed genome-wide chemical genetic screens in RPE-1 and A375 cells. Our screens identified distinct pathways mediating the response to partial and full PLK4 inhibition. Intriguingly, TRIM37 was required for growth when PLK4 was partially or fully inhibited but was dispensable for arrest triggered by PLK4 overexpression. Moreover, TRIM37 growth arrest activity was partially independent of its E3 ligase activity. These results highlight the complex role of TRIM37 and regulators of its function in the control of centrosome number homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Centrinone B induces concentration-dependent changes in centrosome number</title><p>Centrinone is a PLK4-specific inhibitor that is often used to study the cellular response to centrosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Another PLK4 inhibitor, CFI-400945, induces both centrosome amplification, or loss, in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mason et al., 2014</xref>). Since CFI-400945 also inhibits other mitotic kinases such as AURKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suri et al., 2019</xref>) it is unclear if its reported phenotypes are due to effects on PLK4, mitosis, or both. Centrinone and centrinone B are both potent inhibitors of PLK4 that show selectivity over the Aurora-family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). We used centrinone B for our experiments since it shows an even greater selectivity over the Aurora kinases compared to centrinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suri et al., 2019</xref>). We treated RPE-1 cells with 200 and 500 nM centrinone B and found that cell growth was greatly inhibited at both centrinone B concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, cell growth arrest was correlated with induction of p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), resulting in the accumulation of cells with 1 N DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We next imaged cells treated with centrinone B for 3 days to determine how centrosome number was affected as a function of centrinone B concentration. As expected, 500 nM centrinone B resulted in cells containing either a single or no centrosome, but cells treated with 200 nM failed to lose centrosomes and instead accumulated supernumerary centrosomes in approximately 50% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>). Staining for a panel of centriole and centrosome markers revealed that these extra structures contained CEP135, CEP120, CETN2, glutamylated tubulin, and could accumulate PCNT and CEP192 indicating that treatment with 200 nM centrinone B can induce amplification of bona fide centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these data indicate that centrosomes can be amplified or lost using 200 or 500 nM centrinone B, respectively, and that both phenotypes result in p53-dependent G1 arrest.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Concentration-dependent effect of centrinone B on centriole number.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RPE-1 cells were serially grown for 12 days and treated with DMSO or the indicated concentration of centrinone B.

Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous TRIM37 indicated that the protein was associated with the centrosome in most cells although it did not strictly co-localize with either γ-tubulin or CEP120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We verified that the anti-TRIM37 antibody used reliably detected endogenous TRIM37. The overall TRIM37 signal was greatly reduced in TRIM37<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and TRIM37 detected at the centrosome in interphase cells was largely diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We noted that a minor TRIM37 signal at the centrosome remained in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells but could not be further reduced using siRNA directed against TRIM37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting the antibody displays weak cross reactivity with another centrosomal component. Since the intensity difference in mitotic cells was not as large that observed in interphase cells after disruption and/or knockdown, we restricted our analysis to interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if TRIM37 localization was cell cycle-dependent, we co-stained TRIM37 with PCNA and CEP120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and detected TRIM37 in all cell cycle stages we could discern. We further determined if TRIM37 preferentially localized to mother or daughter centrioles by staining with CETN2 to detect all centrioles and CEP120 that preferentially localizes to daughter centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). TRIM37 localized to both mother and daughter centrioles in most cells and localized exclusively to the mother or daughter in only a small percentage of cells. Interestingly, in cells with two centrosomes, TRIM37 appeared to favor one centrosome over the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, arrowhead) and we observed a minor preference for exclusive association with mother or daughter centrioles in G1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

We created two TRIM37 E3 ligase mutants, one containing a C18R point mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatnagar et al., 2014</xref>) and another deleting the RING domain entirely (ΔRING). After stable expression in RPE-1 <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, the steady-state abundance of both ligase mutants was greater than the wild type (WT) protein, consistent with TRIM37 auto-regulating its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These pools were infected with virus to express TRIM37 and the indicated TRIM37 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and B). In addition, we performed clonogenic assays using varying centrinone B concentrations to fully characterize the growth arrest activity promoted by TRIM37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Robust cell arrest of WT cells was observed after treatment with 125 nM centrinone B or greater. Correspondingly, in RPE-1 cells, we observed increases of p53 and p21 abundance with increasing centrinone B that was attenuated in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, cells lacking TRIM37 arrested after treatment with very low doses of centrinone B (50–125 nM) but only partially after higher concentrations (≥150 nM). As observed with cell lines derived from the clonal TRIM37 disruption, both E3-defective mutants, C18R and ΔRING, promoted growth arrest activity. To examine PLK4 function more closely after inhibition by centrinone B, we monitored centrosome number and cellular PLK4 mobility. There was a dose-dependent increase in centrosome number up to 167 or 200 nM after which cells harbored one or no centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, abnormal centrosome number did not correlate with robust growth arrest in WT cells; cell growth was almost completely inhibited at 125 nM centrinone B although we observed minor centrosome abnormalities at this concentration. Recently, PLK4 phosphorylation status near its phosphodegron sequence was linked to its cellular mobility where decreased phosphorylation at this site resulted in decreased mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019</xref>). We expressed a PLK4 reporter construct (GFP-PLK kin + L1) and monitored PLK4 mobility using FRAP after treatment with centrinone B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019</xref>). PLK4 mobility decreased with increasing centrinone B concentrations that mirrored growth arrest activity. Based on RPE-1 cells, our data uncovered three phases in response to PLK4 inhibition. Phase I is TRIM37-independent and occurs at centrinone B concentrations where cells display minor centrosome number aberration (≤125 nM); a TRIM37-dependent phase II occurs at ≥150 nM centrinone B and can be further separated based on centrosome number; phase IIa cells harbor overduplicated centrosomes (150–200 nM) while phase IIb cells have lost one or both centrosomes (500 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similar trends were observed using A375 cells, although the exact concentrations of centrinone B required differed between the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We noted that our FB-TRIM37 construct was overexpressed compared to the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), so we created <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells lines that expressed inducible TRIM37-3xFLAG or TRIM37C18R-3xFLAG. Compared to our stable cell lines, the inducible lines expressed TRIM37 closer to endogenous levels, although the C18R mutant was always more highly expressed, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). While the total cellular amount of the stable FLAG-BirA constructs was ~20-fold higher than that of the DOX-inducible system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), the centrosomal difference was only ~3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We performed clonogenic growth assays in the absence or presence of DOX and 0, 167, or 500 nM centrinone B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Expression of either WT or C18R TRIM37 resulted in growth arrest although the growth arrest phenotype caused by TRIM37 C18R expression was weaker than that of WT cells. These data suggest that TRIM37 can support growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition in the absence of E3 ligase activity.</p><p>To distinguish between PLK4 activity and centrosome number, we used orthologous methods tTo corroborate these observations, we creato control centrosome number. First, we disrupted the gene encoding SASS6, a protein required for centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dammermann et al., 2004</xref>), to induce centrosome loss in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We recovered cells lacking centrioles indicating that TRIM37 is also required for growth arrest in these conditions since <italic>SASS6</italic> is essential in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leidel et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>SASS6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells were completely resistant to any dose of centrinone B, unlike <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Similar to centrosome loss induced by PLK4 inhibition, inducible expression of TRIM37 C18R partially rescued the growth arrest phenotype caused by SASS6 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). To induce centrosome amplification, we overexpressed PLK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2021</xref>), we found that disruption of <italic>TRIM37</italic> was unable to suppress growth arrest in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Together, these data suggest that TRIM37 is required for growth arrest after moderate or full PLK4 inhibition and this activity is partially independent of TRIM37’s E3 ligase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Growth arrest upon treatment with centrinone B does not correlate with an increase in mitotic length</title><p>Abnormal mitotic length has been put forth as an attractive model to explain growth arrest after centrosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambrus et al., 2016</xref>). We measured mitotic length after inhibiting PLK4 at different centrinone B concentrations using live-cell imaging of WT or <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> RPE-1 cells. Cells were treated with the indicated concentration of centrinone B for 3 days before imaging them for 24 hr, and the length of mitosis from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to telophase was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). WT RPE-1 cells treated with centrinone B did not exhibit a significant increase in mitotic length, compared to untreated cells, until concentrations reached 150 nM. Strikingly, the mitotic length of <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells treated with centrinone B was similar to that of WT cells until concentrations of 200 and 500 nM centrinone B; at which point the absence of TRIM37 partially suppressed the increase in mitotic length in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). We next examined whether TRIM37 E3 activity was required to rescue the shortened mitotic length observed in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells. We induced the expression of WT TRIM37 and the C18R mutant in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, treated them with 500 nM centrinone B and measured mitotic length. In the absence of protein induction, we observed a slight increase in mitotic length after centrinone B treatment and a larger increase after induction of WT TRIM37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, the mitotic length in the presence of centrinone B after expression of TRIM37 C18R did not change compared to similarly treated uninduced cells.

Quantification revealed that acute expression of WT TRIM37, but not C18R decreased the intensity of CEP192 and PCNT at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly the centriole component CEP120 was similarly diminished at the centrosome indicating that this effect is not specific to PCM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The co-expression of Myc-PLK4 and T7-TRIM37 in HEK293T cells resulted in modification of PLK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The modification was partially dependent on TRIM37 E3 activity, was not observed when TRIM37 505–709 was expressed, and increased in the presence of TRIM37 Δ505–709. MLN4924 is a general inhibitor of cullin-RING E3 ligases and treating cells with this compound should inhibit ubiquitination of PLK4 by SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soucy et al., 2009</xref>). Treatment of cells with MLN4924 resulted in stabilization of PLK4 but the modified forms remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To directly test if the observed modification was ubiquitinated PLK4, we co-expressed Myc-PLK4, T7-TRIM37, and HA-Ub in 293T cells. After immunoprecipitating PLK4, we probed for HA-Ub to detect ubiquitinated species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Although we detected an E3-dependent increase in total ubiquitinated proteins in the input of cells expressing WT and Δ505–709 T7-TRIM37, we only detected low levels of HA-Ub conjugates in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitates, suggesting that PLK4 modification upon expression of TRIM37 may not be due to its ubiquitination. As an alternative possibility, we tested if the modified PLK4 bands were due to phosphorylation by treating cell lysates with λ-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The slower migrating forms of PLK4 were lost after phosphatase treatment indicating that these modifications are primarily due to phosphorylation. To identify the kinase(s) responsible for the modification, we treated cells with inhibitors targeting PLK4, AURKA, PLK1, and CDK1 for 3–6 hr and probed for PLK4. The only treatment that substantially reduced PLK4 phosphorylation was PLK4 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Since we observed that TRIM37 promotes PLK4 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), we monitored GFP-PLK4 mobility by FRAP in WT, <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells and after TRIM37 siRNA but did not observe any differences compared to control cells indicating that the phospho-forms of PLK4 stabilized by TRIM37 likely lie outside the phosphodegron region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>). Together these data suggest that TRIM37 promotes the accumulation of phosphorylated PLK4 in an E3-dependent manner but this phenomenon does not require robust interaction with PLK4 itself.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most animal cells harboring abnormal centrosome numbers are subject to p53-dependent growth arrest and the mechanisms of these pathways are beginning to be understood. Here, by leveraging the various phenotypes caused by treatment of cells with different concentrations of the selective PLK4 inhibitor centrinone B, we uncover multiple pathways leading to growth arrest in response to abnormal centrosome numbers. Not only does centrosome number play a role, but we hypothesize that properties or the activity of PLK4 itself can also trigger growth arrest. Curiously, we found that TRIM37 is required for growth arrest in some, but not all centrinone B concentrations tested.</p><p>Several observations support our hypothesis that differential PLK4 inhibition used for our screens resulted in distinct cellular states. First, we observed clear differences in centrosome number. Second, MDM2 was cleaved using 200 nM, but not 500 nM centrinone B consistent with excess centrosomes in the former condition. Last, the genes derived from each screen were distinct. Specifically, we identified ANKRD26/PIDDosome only in the presence of excess centrosomes and also identified centriole proteins that, when disrupted, could decrease centrosome load, although we did not formally test this. We note that 200 nM centrinone B was not optimal to induce excess centrosomes in A375 cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), yet we still identified genes that overlapped with those from the comparable RPE-1 screen suggesting that these cells were subjected to similar conditions.</p><p>Centrosome amplification after partial inhibition of PLK4 has been previously observed using CFI-400495 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mason et al., 2014</xref>), YLT-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei et al., 2018</xref>), or analog-sensitive alleles of <italic>PLK4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moyer et al., 2015</xref>). Current models suggest that partially inhibited PLK4 reduces its auto-phosophorylation required for its degradation. As a consequence, PLK4 accumulates and promotes centriole overduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holland and Cleveland, 2014</xref>). While TRIM37 is involved in mediating growth arrest to partial PLK4 inhibition, it is not required for arrest after PLK4 overexpression, which also leads to extra centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). The fundamental difference between centrosome amplification caused by PLK4 overexpression or by partial inhibition may relate to the per molecule activity of PLK4, perhaps pointing a role for TRIM37 in regulating PLK4 activity. Our FRAP data indicated a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylated, and therefore active, PLK4 upon increasing centrinone B that correlated well with growth arrest activity. If altered PLK4 activity, and not extra centrosomes, is responsible for growth arrest, why would we identify proteins such as ANKRD26 and the PIDDosome that have clear roles in response to supernumerary centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fava et al., 2017</xref>)? Growth suppression after PLK4 inhibition at any concentration of centrinone B was only partially TRIM37-dependent, suggesting that multiple pathways might be activated in these conditions, one dependent on centrosomes and the other dependent on PLK4. Comparing our dataset with that of the PLK4 overexpression screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2021</xref>) yields an overlap of 22 genes that we propose are involved in a response to supernumerary centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). We suggest that the genes unique to our dataset (i.e., low-dose centrinone B treatment) might modulate the response to inhibited PLK4. <italic>CEP85</italic> and <italic>USP9X</italic> are such genes and both encode proteins that affect STIL, a regulator of PLK4 activity. CEP85 is required for robust STIL interaction with PLK4 while USP9X stabilizes STIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kodani et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, 53BP1 and USP28 were similarly dispensable for growth arrest after PLK4 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). In this case, the MDM2 p60 fragment that is known to interact with and stabilize p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oliver et al., 2011</xref>) might be redundant with the function of 53BP1-USP28. It is therefore an exciting possibility that PLK4 activity, by itself, may be a determinant of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest.</p><p>TRIM37 is proposed to mediate the degradation of CEP192 that in turn affects PCM assembly in mitotic cells treated with PLK4 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>), however, there is no consensus on the exact centrosome or centriole TRIM37 targets. We observed a decrease in overall CEP192 protein levels, but not those of PCNT, CEP215, or CEP120 after stable expression of FB-TRIM37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The effect of TRIM37 expression on centrosomal proteostasis is unclear. Two previous studies examining centrosomal protein abundance after TRIM37 expression detected decreases in overall CEP192, however one report did not detect changes in CEP215 or CEP152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>), while another detected decreases in CEP215 and PCNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>). We did not detect reciprocal changes in protein levels in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) suggesting that the effects on PCM are dependent on overexpressed TRIM37 or that the <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cell line acquired a genetic or epigenetic change that suppresses effects on PCM proteins. TRIM37 overexpression also decreased the amount of CEP192, PCNT, and CEP120 detected at mitotic centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). More work will be needed to identify direct and indirect targets of TRIM37 at the centrosome.</p><p>The E3 ligase activity of TRIM37 was required for changes in the bulk abundance of CEP192 and for the reduction in CEP192, PCNT, and CEP120 proteins at mitotic centrosomes. In contrast, we observed dosage-dependent phenotypes for the E3 ligase mutant TRIM37 C18R. Stable and high expression of this variant caused a strong growth arrest phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) while lower expression using an inducible system resulted in partial growth arrest activity in response to centrinone B treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). To explain this phenomenon, we consider that either the expression of the C18R mutant binds to and sequesters TRIM37 targets to phenocopy the effect of degradation, or that higher levels of TRIM37 C18R drive the formation of an E3-independent complex important for growth arrest, as has been suggested for a TRIM37 ligase-independent role in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Current models of TRIM37 growth arrest function after PLK4 inhibition have primarily focused on mitotic length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambrus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meitinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yeow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>). After complete PLK4 inhibition, cells containing one or no centrosome arrested, but in these studies, mitotic length and growth arrest were not well correlated and not long enough to activate a ‘mitotic timer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lambrus et al., 2015</xref>). This led to the speculation that small increases in mitotic length over multiple cell cycles might be equivalent to a single mitosis with a larger delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambrus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meitinger et al., 2016</xref>) but this possibility has not yet been tested. Here, however, we provide multiple lines of evidence that mitotic length may not be critical for growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition. First, in WT RPE-1 cells, we observed that treatment with 50 nM and 125 nM centrinone B led to ~25% and 90% decreases in cell proliferation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) without causing concomitant increases in mitotic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, when comparing WT and <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, we observed a significant difference in growth between these cell lines at 125 nM centrinone B or greater but did not detect significant differences in mitotic length until a treatment with 200 nM centrinone B. Third, induced expression of TRIM37 C18R caused a partial reduction in cell proliferation without any apparent effect on mitotic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). We also note that PLK4 overexpression in mice or flies results in increased mitotic indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marthiens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basto et al., 2008</xref>) indicative of lengthened mitoses, yet TRIM37 is not required for growth arrest under similar conditions in cultured cells. Mitotic length after treatment with 200 and 500 nM centrinone B is clearly affected by TRIM37 but our data does not suggest that this directly influences growth arrest.</p><p>Although others have observed TRIM37-dependent ubiquitination of PLK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meitinger et al., 2020</xref>), we detected low amounts of ubiquitinated PLK4 only after co-expression with the TRIM37Δ505–709 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In contrast, we found that TRIM37 primarily promoted PLK4 phosphorylation in a manner that was dependent on PLK4 activity itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). We did not find that PLK4 mobility by FRAP was affected by the loss of TRIM37 in the absence or presence of centrinone B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>) suggesting that the phosphorylation sites stabilized by TRIM37 lie outside the PLK4 phosphodegron-adjacent regions monitored by this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto and Kitagawa, 2019</xref>). It will be of interest to determine how TRIM37 promotes PLK4 phosphorylation, which regions of PLK4 are modified, and to assess if these phosphorylation events are contributing to TRIM37-dependent growth arrest in response to abnormal centrosome numbers or altered PLK4 activity.</p><p>We described three distinct growth arrest phases after PLK4 inhibition characterized by cellular centrosome number abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Our FRAP assays indicated that the mobility of PLK4 decreased after centrinone B treatment in a dose-dependent manner that mirrored the growth arrest activity of WT cells. We therefore propose that a direct aspect of PLK4 activity, either PLK4 itself or a substrate of PLK4, underlies the growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A level of PLK4 inhibition that does not affect centriole number initiates p53 arrest independent of TRIM37, but cell arrest after further PLK4 inhibition becomes dependent on TRIM37. TRIM37 itself promotes phosphorylation of PLK4 and can affect the abundance and/or localization of CEP192, PCNT, and CEP120, but the effect of these functions is not clear. SASS6 was required for growth arrest at all centrinone B concentrations, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggesting that centrioles themselves may play a role to integrate the growth arrest signal.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for growth arrest and TRIM37 growth arrest activity.</title><p>PLK4 activity decreases in a dose-dependent manner upon centrinone B addition. TRIM37 promotes PLK4 auto-phosphorylation (orange circles) outside the phosphodegron region (purple circles). PLK4 inhibition initially results in TRIM37-independent growth arrest. Continued addition of centrinone B results in centrosome overduplication that is detected by the ANKRD26/PIDDosome pathway in addition to a TRIM37-dependent growth arrest pathway. Complete inhibition of PLK4 results in TRIM37-dependent growth arrest. TRIM37 also prevents the appearance of CNTROB-dependent aggregates. We hypothesize that these aggregates might affect p53/p21 activation (dotted lines) (created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biorender.com/">https://biorender.com/</ext-link>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-73944-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In closing, we used CRISPR/Cas9 screening to characterize the global, dose-dependent response to PLK4 inhibition. While previous studies focused on complete PLK4 inactivation and mitotic length after centrosome loss as a potential mechanism driving p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, we found that the loss of PLK4 activity better correlates with the subsequent growth arrest. Proteomic analysis of PLK4 substrates and the cellular aggregates that form in the absence of TRIM37 will be required to provide mechanistic details of this pathway and may yield the identification of PLK4 substrates underpinning this response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

cells with altered centriole number, caused by inhibition of PLK4, the master regulator of centriole duplication. The authors identify the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM37 as a key mediator of this growth arrest, but, in contrast to previous work, they find that growth arrest correlates better with PLK4 activity than with the duration of mitosis or centrosome number. The work extends the role for TRIM37 in regulating centrosome protein levels, distribution, and function, and will be of interest to researchers interested in centrosome and growth regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73944.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lüders</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01z1gye03</institution-id><institution>Institute for Research in Biomedicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73944.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1, Major points</p><p>1. Previous data suggested that an important role of TRIM37 was to limit accumulation of CEP192 levels, yet here CEP192 levels appeared unchanged in TRIM37 knockout cells that stably express wild-type or RING domain mutant TRIM37. However, in agreement with previous work, transient expression of TRIM37 reduced CEP192 levels along with those of other PCM and centriole components in an E3-dependent manner. These data are rather confusing in light of the literature, and the current report does not really deal with these discrepancies but to me they suggest that high levels of TRIM37 can target multiple centrosome components for degradation, but this may be an experimental artefact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. To investigate this further, we performed additional replicates for the experiments examining the total cellular levels of PCM components in WT RPE-1, <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, and <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> stably overexpressing FLAG-BirA(FB) TRIM37. We now find that stable overexpression of FB-TRIM37 also results in lower steadystate levels of CEP192 (but not PCNT or CEP215). These results are found in Figure 6A and Figure 6B and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A and <italic>B</italic> and are now consistent with the literature showing that induced overexpression of TRIM37 affects CEP192 levels. However, we still do not observe reciprocal changes (i.e. an increase in abundance of CEP192) after <italic>TRIM37</italic> disruption. We also performed Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments using WT RPE-1 and <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells induced to express TRIM37-3xFLAG or stably expressing FB-TRIM37 to compare overall protein levels and centrosomal levels more directly (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2A-C). We find that induced TRIM37-3xFLAG is expressed at 4- to 5-fold higher levels than the endogenous protein while stably expressed FB-TRIM37 is expressed at 150- to 200-fold higher levels. We discuss that overexpressed TRIM37 may account for some of the observed phenotypes and/or our <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> clonal line may have acquired a mutation that suppresses the loss of TRIM37 (Page 14, paragraph 1) of the revised manuscript (also see Reviewer 1, major point 4).</p><p>In addition, we determined that the amount of CEP192 at mitotic centrosomes decreases after 4 or 8 hours of acute induction of TRIM37 and found that the abundance of another PCM component, PCNT, and a non-PCM centriole component, CEP120 are also diminished at mitotic centrosome after 4 or 8h acute TRIM37 expression. These data indicate that the effect of induced overexpression of TRIM37 is not restricted to CEP192 (Figure 6D). We now further discuss that the exact substrates, or proteins affected by TRIM37 expression or depletion remain to be fully delineated. Further work will be required to delineate direct versus indirect effects of TRIM37 and the mechanisms that control these functions (Page 14, paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The choice of cells for particular experiments is not always stated or explained. For instance, in Figure 3A: Trim37 KO pool used while in Figure 3B TRIM37 single KO. These are then combined with both transient and stable expression of TRIM37 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not always stating / explaining this well enough. In principle, however, we find this to be a strength of our work. Our key results can be reproduced using <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> lines generated by different methods and using different sgRNAs ensuring that we are not observing artefacts due to clonal selection or off-target effects. We first confirmed our screen results by infecting cells with virus to deliver two independent guides against TRIM37. Having confirmed the screen results, we generated a clonal <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> line. To further ensure the reproducibility of our observations we created additional <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> pools in two different cell lines. All experiments in our manuscript after the initial confirmation (Figure 3A) are now performed using our clonal TRIM37<sup>-/-</sup> line except for those in Figure 4B and C and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1D and E, where we use pools for the specific reason of disrupting TRIM37 in an independent manner. This is now more clearly noted in the revised version of the manuscript (Page 8, paragraph 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Two different concentrations (200 nM and 500 nM) of centrinone were used to compare responses of too many or no centrosomes in RPE1 and A375. While these concentrations result in centrosome amplification (200 nM) and loss (500 nM) in RPE1 cells, the phenotypes seem much less clear-cut in A375 cells. At 200nM 70% of cells have 0 or 1 centrioles (~35% each category) and only about 15% have centrosome amplification, whereas centrosome amplification occurs in 30% of RPE1 with 0-1 centrioles seen in fewer than 10% (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H). Hence the different outcomes of centrinone treatment makes conclusions about cell-type specific responses difficult. This difference may be due to differences in drug uptake/efflux, PLK4 activity or in expression of other components of these pathways. In fact, 167nM centrinone B in A375 cells would have been a much closer match to the 200nM treatment of RPE-1. These points should be discussed as they impact the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer rightly points out that the response to centrinone appears to differ between cell types, as shown previously (Meitinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020 and Yeow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020), and that this difference may impact our conclusions. We concur that 167 nM centrinone B in A375 cells would have been a better match to 200 nM centrinone B in RPE-1 cells based on our centrosome count experiment (Figure 4C and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1E). However, the screen results still reveal similar differential responses to the two centrinone B doses used. This caveat is now explicitly discussed in the revised manuscript (Page 13, paragraph 2). The 200 nM centrinone B screens in both cell lines identified genes known to respond to supernumerary centrosomes (ex. ANKRD26, CASP2, PIDD1, CRADD) and centriole components that when disrupted might decrease centrosome load (ex. STIL, CENPJ). Interestingly, the A375 screen identifies more genes in the latter group than the RPE-1 screen (ex. CEP120, CEP135, CEP152, SASS6; see Figure 2 —figure supplement 2C and F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I find the different outcomes of stable versus acute expression of TRIM37 ligase mutant confusing. Here, stable expression of TRIM37 ligase mutant increases mitotic length compared to that of TRIM37 wild-type, which contradicts a recent report by (Meitinger et al. 2021). What could be the potential reason for these differences?</p></disp-quote><p>Our initial experiments were performed using a cell line stably expressing FB-TRIM37 C18R. We performed new experiments to compare mitotic length in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells induced to express TRIM37 C18R-3xFLAG. Using this system, we find that, like Meitinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021, induced TRIM37 C18R-3xFLAG fails to increase mitotic length in the presence of centrinone (Figure 5B). This contrasts with stably overexpressed FB TRIM37 C18R that increases mitotic length that was presented in former Figure 5C. Although the data using the stable cell lines we included in the original manuscript with the rescue mutant is still valid (former Figure 5D), we decided to remove it from the revised manuscript since the inducible system provided more robust results and was used in subsequent experiments. We offer two possible explanations for this observation. First, similar to what we observed with wild type TRIM37, the expression level of FB-TRIM37 C18R is higher than induced TRIM37 C18R-3xFLAG. We discuss that high amounts of the E3-ligase mutant might drive the interaction of a critical complex stabilized by TRIM37 or that the catalytic inactive mutant might interact with a substrate that is normally degraded by wild type TRIM37, thus phenocopying the mitotic arrest phenotype (Page 14, paragraph 2). However, we still find that the induced expression of TRIM37 C18R-3xFLAG partially rescues the growth arrest phenotype in clonogenic assays. We present these new data in Figure 4E and F. To date, the model for growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition has focused on mitotic length. We provide multiple pieces of evidence, including those just described, that challenge this model. We discuss our findings that are inconsistent with a mitotic length model on Page 14, paragraph 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What could be the mechanism for TRIM37 action in regulating spindle assembly/mitotic duration and cell proliferation upon centrosome loss? How do those acentrosomal MTOCs form that decrease mitotic duration and promote proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>These are exciting questions that explore details of TRIM37 mechanism that are not addressed in the current manuscript. Our data challenges the view that mitotic length contributes to cell growth arrest mediated by TRIM37. Rather, we highlight the interplay between PLK4, TRIM37 and growth arrest. This does not mean that TRIM37 doesn’t contribute to ectopic mitotic structures or mitotic length, only that mitotic length is perhaps not the sole determinant of growth arrest. This is now better discussed on Page 14, paragraph 4 of the manuscript and included in our working model (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors find a difference in the % of cells expressing TRIM37 mutants upon stable or acute expression? This part needs a better summary, and again a table would help. I also wonder about protein expression levels; wild-type FB-TRIM37 seems to be expressed at much lower levels than the mutants in Figure 5B.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences in overall abundance are not due to heterogenous expression within the population. The TRIM37 mutants are expressed in all cells after stable expression (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2B and C, and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1B and D). Although we did not formally test this in the induced cell lines, these lines are selected using G418. TRIM37 is proposed to negatively regulate its own expression in an E3-dependent manner (Meitinger et al. 2021, Figure 3f). Our results are consistent with this as the TRIM37 C18R and TRIM37 DRING mutants have a higher overall abundance compared to TRIM37 or TRIM37 D505709 using either stable or induced cell lines. Some of the functional differences we initially observed can be explained by stable overexpression of FB-TRIM37 C18R versus induced expression of TRIM37 C18R3xFLAG. We have redone experiments using an inducible system and our results are now more consistent with those in the literature. We provide a table in Figure 7 —figure supplement 2A to summarize the TRIM37 mutants we used and their phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Other means of centrosome depletion (Cenpj, SAS6 etc) would have been useful to include in the manuscript in support of E3 ligase dependent and independent roles of TRIM37. It is not essential to perform these experiment but if data are available, including these would improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>To eliminate centrioles using another approach, we created an RPE-1 TRIM37<sup>-/-</sup> SASS6<sup>-/-</sup> cell line. Disruption of SASS6 suppresses growth arrest at all centrinone concentrations tested, including 125 nM centrinone B where arrest is largely TRIM37-independent (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3A and B). We find that similar to centriole loss induced by 500 nM centrinone B, TRIM37 C18R-3xFLAG partially rescues growth arrest in these conditions (Figure 4F). These data together suggest that TRIM37 catalytic activity is not strictly required for growth arrest function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors show that TRIM37 regulates PLK4 phosphorylation and that this modification could only be observed in HEK293T and not in RPE1. Why would there be a difference between HEK293 and RPE1?</p></disp-quote><p>In our original manuscript we did not directly compare 293T and RPE-1 using the same experimental conditions. We were referring to the appearance of PLK4 in our immunoprecipitation experiments using RPE-1 cells (Figure 7B; former Figure 4B) compared to PLK4 observed in (Figure 7D-G; former Figure 7A-D). There are key differences in how these experiments were performed including a longer transfection time and the presence of MG132 using 293T cells that might affect PLK4 modification. We were incorrect to try and make the comparison and apologize for this indiscretion.</p><p>However, we have now performed experiments using 293T, HeLa and RPE-1 cells. We find marked PLK4 modification after co-expressing TRIM37 and PLK4 in 293T and HeLa cells. However, such modifications are much less evident in RPE-1 cells.</p><p>We speculate that the presence of the modified forms will depend on rates of modification (phosphorylation, ubiquitination or other) and de-modification (dephosphorylation, deubiquitination, etc.) and on any proteins that might also form a complex with PLK4 and TRIM37. Interestingly, 293T and HeLa cells both contain extra copies of chromosome 17 that harbors the <italic>TRIM37</italic> locus. Since we observe modification in at least two of the cell lines tested, we conclude that this is not cell type specific.

We found that the TRIM37 signal was significantly decreased at the centrosome in interphase cells and mitotic cells, but the overall decrease was lower in mitotic cells. We therefore restricted our analysis to interphase cells. We also provide a more detailed analysis of TRIM37 localization based on cell cycle and mother/daughter centriole (Figure 3D-G). Finally, we quantify the centrosomal intensity of wild type FB-TRIM37, the E3-ligase mutants C18R and DRING (Figure 3I-J), and the PLK4 interaction mutants 505-709 and D505-709 (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1C and E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1, Minor points</p><p>1.

The data from Meitinger <italic>et al.</italic> explore the abundance of p53 and p21 and cell growth after Mdm2 inhibition. 53BP1 and USP28 are thought to affect p53 transcription (Cuella-Martin R <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). As such, p53 abundance should not be affected. Without quantification it is difficult to assess the relative abundance of the p53 transcriptional target, p21. The abundance of p21 appears to be lower in <italic>USP28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells, and possibly in <italic>TP53BP1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells.

To test this in a parallel manner, we also overexpressed PLK4 to induce centriole overduplication. Surprisingly, but consistent with recently published results (Evans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020), TRIM37 was not required for growth arrest after PLK4 overexpression (<italic>Figure 4G</italic>). Thus, TRIM37 is required for growth arrest after 200 nM centrinone treatment, but not PLK4 overexpression, yet both conditions result in centriole overduplication.

The presentation throughout the manuscript sometimes made it difficult to follow exactly what the authors meant when they referred to the various doses of Centrinone used in their experimentsoften using the terms &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot; without specifying exactly what they mean. In Figure 1A, for example, they present a growth inhibition curve using a log10 scale of Centrinone concentration, and they conclude that growth was inhibited &quot;at concentrations above 150nM, with full inhibition observed at concentrations greater than 200nM&quot;. I presume this is just sloppy language, as it appears that growth is significantly inhibited at 150nM and full growth inhibition is achieved at 200nM. However, in Figure 4D, the authors show another growth inhibition curve (this time presented on a linear scale) where significant growth inhibition is seen well below 100nM and full inhibition appears to be achieved at ~125nM. The discrepancy between these experiments is not noted, nor any reason for it explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and apologize for using ‘low’ and ‘high’ as they are ambiguous. We now refer to specific centrinone B concentrations or to inhibition ‘phases’ based on TRIM37-dependent growth arrest and centrosome number. The direct comparison between former Figure 1A and former Figure 4D (now Figure 4B) is not straightforward. The experiments presented were performed approximately 6 years apart and in slightly different ways. As reviewer 3 indicates, Figure 1A is presented in a log scale; this makes it difficult for the reader to determine the exact concentrations of centrinone B used. For this panel, we used, 0 (DMSO), 10, 30, 75, 165, 200 and 500 nM centrinone B. For former Figure 4D, we used 0, 50, 125, 150, 167, 200 and 500 nM. The only point that might be anomalous is 75 nM in Figure 1A. We do see approximately 25% inhibition using 50 nM centrinone B in Figure 4D, but no inhibition using 75 nM in Figure 1A. We can offer two explanations for this discrepancy. First, we noticed small deviations in the potency of centrinone B batches. Second, for Figure 1A, cells were assayed using a passaging assay where they are continuously plated, counted and re-seeded. Cells in Figure 4D were assayed using a clonogenic assay where cells are plated at low density and allowed to grow over the course of approximately two weeks. It is possible that a combination of these factors led to the discrepancy pointed out by the reviewer. To streamline this aspect of the manuscript, we have made the following change: we repeated the growth experiment for Figure 1A and now present the data by plotting the results from the individual replicates with the mean and standard deviation. We show only the 200 and 500 nM centrinone B concentrations since we derive our basic conclusions from these conditions (i.e. both concentrations result in p53dependent growth arrest where centrioles are overduplicated after 200 nM centrinone B, while centrioles are lost after treatment with 500 nM) and these are the conditions we subsequently used in our screens. We hope that this explanation and changes satisfy this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While discrepancies such as this may seem trivial, they make it hard to interpret some of the authors conclusions. For example, in their initial screen, the &quot;low&quot; dose of Centrinone (200nM) leads to centriole amplification and genes that block centriole duplication or PIDDosome function (which normally signals the presence of extra centrioles) are required for the growth arrest triggered by this concentration of the drug (Figure 1B). To me, this suggests that centriole amplification is required for this growth arrest at 200nM. However, when the authors test a more graded series of concentrations they conclude &quot;excess centrioles might not be the trigger for this arrest at low Centrinone B concentrations&quot;. I assume they are using &quot;low&quot; here to indicate concentrations at or below 150nM (even though they use low to mean 200nM in their initial screen)? In the Discussion, they state that TRIM37 is &quot;required for the growth arrest in response to partially or fully inhibited PLK4, but this activity was independent of the presence of excess centrioles&quot;. Again, it is not clear to which experiments they are referring when they talk about &quot;partially&quot; or &quot;fully&quot; inhibited PLK4, but, if this is correct, then why are genes required for centriole duplication and PIDDosome function identified in their initial screen as being required for the growth arrest at 200nM but not 500nM? Do they consider 200nM to be fully inhibiting PLK4?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clearer about these points. We now characterize the doseresponse to centrinone B based on growth arrest, centrosome number and TRIM37 dependence (Page 8, paragraph 3, Figure 4E<italic>).</italic> Briefly, we observe cell arrest in the following phases: (1) without major centrosome abnormalities at 125 nM centrinone B (Phase I); (2) with supernumerary centrosomes at 150-200 nM centrinone B (Phase IIa); (3) with centrosome loss at 500 nM (Phase IIb). Phase I growth arrest is independent of TRIM37 while Phase II is dependent on TRIM37. Moreover, where required, we refer to specific concentrations of centrinone B, rather than use the relative terms ‘low’ and ‘high’.</p><p>We initially observed that cells arrested after treatment with either 200 or 500 nM centrinone B. Additionally, we observed centriole over-duplication in cells treated wtih 200 nM but centriole loss with 500 nM. Our initial hypothesis was that either centriole overduplication or loss resulted in growth arrest. To determine if centriole overduplication caused by 200 nM centrinone B triggers growth arrest, we induced centriole overduplication using a parallel method by overexpressing PLK4 and, surprisingly, TRIM37 was not required for growth arrest in these conditions, similar to that observed by Evans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020. Thus, there are two conditions where centriole overduplication is observed and the growth arrest in only one condition is dependent on TRIM37. This is an important difference that we now better highlight in our revised manuscript on Page 13, paragraph 3. We now present a model (new Figure 8) and a table (Figure 7 —figure supplement 2A) that summarizes our results.</p><p>Briefly, it is thought that partially inhibited PLK4 blocks its own auto-phosphorylation and therefore blocks its degradation. The overall abundance of PLK4 therefore increases under these conditions and overduplication occurs. In our hands, we consider PLK4 to be partially inhibited in RPE-1 or A375 cells at any concentrations of centrinone B at 200 nM or lower.</p><p>We agree that it is interesting we detect genes required for centriole duplication and PIDDosome function in our 200 nM screen. We now discuss this more explicitly. We note that TRIM37 suppression of growth arrest is only partial, suggesting another pathway might be active. We suggest that at 200 nM there is a centrosome-dependent response characterized by the ANKRD26/PIDDosome pathway and a PLK4 activity pathway that TRIM37 participates in. We compare our screen results to those of Evans et al. to identify genes potentially involved in these two different responses (Page 13, paragraph 3).</p><p>Please also see similar comment to Reviewer 2, Minor point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presumably it will only require textual changes to address this point, but it is hard to assess the broader significance of the paper until these points are clarified: is the main point of this paper that the cells response to Centrinone treatment is complicated and the role of TRIM37 equally so; or, is there a narrative that leads to a clear hypothesis that can explain these surprising findings?</p></disp-quote><p>The current model suggests that TRIM37 E3-dependent remodeling of CEP192 and</p><p>subsequent mitotic length changes underlies its growth arrest activity after centriole loss. We have data that is consistent with previously published results and data that challenges some of these recent reports. Importantly, our data does not support a model where mitotic length is the sole determinant of growth arrest and provide a new model for growth arrest and TRIM37 function (Figure 8). While revising our manuscript we performed an additional set of experiments to test this by indirectly monitoring PLK4 activity after centrinone B treatment in the presence or absence of TRIM37. To do so, we expressed GFPPLK4kin+L1 (containing the PLK4 kinase domain plus the unstructured L1 region or full length GFP-PLK4; see Yamamoto S <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019) and performed FRAP analyses (Figure 4D; Figure 7 —figure supplement 1H and I). In this assay, PLK4 mobility is linked to its phosphorylation status near the phosphodegron where decreased mobility corresponds decreased phosphorylation. We find that PLK4 mobility decreases in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with centrinone B mirroring the cell arrest phenotype leading us to suggest cell arrest is directly dependent on PLK4 activity. We hypothesize that PLK4, or a substrate of PLK4 is important for the growth arrest signal (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It seems a striking omission that the authors show that p53 and p21 are induced by 200nM and 500nM Centrinone (Figure 1D), but they don't assay these proteins at any concentration lower than this. Perhaps they are saving this data for a subsequent manuscript, but the authors certainly seem to draw conclusions from several experiments they perform at concentrations below 200nM, so they should at least explain why they don't assay p53 and p21 status in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not including this data in the original version of the manuscript. We find that p53 and p21 increase in a dose-dependent manner and that this response is attenuated in <italic>TRIM37</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells.

In the abstract the authors claim that the way in which altered centrosome numbers cause a p53-dependent growth arrest is evolutionarily conserved. This is misleading, as it implies that the loss and gain of centrosomes trigger the same arrest (which is probably not correct), and most of the data to date suggests that flies and worms (two popular models for centrosome research) do not have such a growth-arrest pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We modified this statement to indicate that p53-dependent arrest is confined to mammalian cells: “Altered centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells cause p53-dependent growth arrest through poorly defined mechanisms”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3, comment in ‘significance’</p><p>I could not discern, however, whether one could draw any broader conclusions than this, in part due to the presentation problems described above. Moreover, in the abstract the authors propose that altering PLK4 activity alone is sufficient to signal growth arrest. This would be an important conclusion, and I presume this refers to the very low dosage Centrinone experiments that trigger growth arrest without altering centrosome numbers and which does not require TRIM37? If so, this arrest is poorly characterised here and will be the subject of a future investigation, so it seems to strange to have this as a major conclusion in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.
