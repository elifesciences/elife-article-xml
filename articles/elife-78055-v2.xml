In PD, the amygdala is prone to develop insoluble αSyn aggregates, and it has been suggested that circuit dysfunction involving the amygdala contributes to the psychiatric symptoms. Yet, how αSyn aggregates affect amygdala function is unknown. In this study, we examined αSyn in glutamatergic axon terminals and the impact of its aggregation on glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). We found that αSyn is primarily present in the vesicular glutamate transporter 1-expressing (vGluT1<sup>+</sup>) terminals in the mouse BLA, which is consistent with higher levels of αSyn expression in vGluT1<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex relative to the vGluT2<sup>+</sup> glutamatergic neurons in the thalamus. We found that αSyn aggregation selectively decreased the cortico-BLA, but not the thalamo-BLA, transmission; and that cortico-BLA synapses displayed enhanced short-term depression upon repetitive stimulation. In addition, using confocal microscopy, we found that vGluT1<sup>+</sup> axon terminals exhibited decreased levels of soluble αSyn, which suggests that lower levels of soluble αSyn might underlie the enhanced short-term depression of cortico-BLA synapses. In agreement with this idea, we found that cortico-BLA synaptic depression was also enhanced in αSyn knockout mice. In conclusion, both basal and dynamic cortico-BLA transmission were disrupted by abnormal aggregation of αSyn and these changes might be relevant to the perturbed cortical control of the amygdala that has been suggested to play a role in psychiatric symptoms in PD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alpha-synuclein</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>vGlut</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>synucleinopathies</kwd><kwd>psychiatric symptoms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Hong-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Hong-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018231</institution-id><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-020616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Michael X</given-names></name><name><surname>Rousseaux</surname><given-names>Maxime WC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Hong-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018231</institution-id><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-020625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rousseaux</surname><given-names>Maxime WC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018231</institution-id><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-020572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Hong-Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of physiological, histological, and optical approaches reveals synapse-specific function of α-synuclein in mouse brain under both normal and pathological states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>α-synuclein (αSyn) is a soluble protein abundant at presynaptic axon terminals, where it regulates the dynamics of synaptic vesicles through interaction with synaptic proteins and presynaptic membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burré et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Runwal and Edwards, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vargas et al., 2017</xref>). αSyn is also prone to form insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates, which are the major protein component of Lewy pathology seen in synucleinopathies like Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mezey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Spillantini et al., 1997</xref>). Increasing evidence supports the notion that pathologic αSyn propagates between synaptically interconnected brain regions and underlies PD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Angot et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Uemura et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The amygdala is a key limbic structure for emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>). Compelling clinical evidence indicates that cortical control of the amygdala activity is impaired in PD, leading to an inappropriate encoding of emotion valence or deficits in linking emotion to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the amygdala shows selective vulnerability to Lewy pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sorrentino et al., 2019</xref>), thus an impaired amygdala network function has been proposed to underlie the disrupted emotion processing in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding et al., 2002</xref>). Still, the normal function of αSyn and how its aggregation can impair amygdala circuit function remain poorly understood. Here, we show that αSyn is primarily present in vesicular glutamate transporter 1-expressing (vGluT1<sup>+</sup>) cortical axon terminals, and, by contrast, is barely detectable in vGluT2<sup>+</sup> thalamic axon terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In an αSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs) model of synucleinopathies, αSyn pathology decreases vGluT1<sup>+</sup> cortico-BLA glutamatergic transmission, without affecting the vGluT2<sup>+</sup> thalamo-BLA neurotransmission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a partial (secondary to αSyn aggregation) or complete (<italic>Snca</italic> KO mice) depletion of soluble αSyn from the axon boutons promotes short-term depression at cortico-BLA synapses in response to prolonged stimulation, leading to an impaired gain control of cortical inputs to the BLA. Therefore, we conclude that both gains of toxic properties and loss of normal function of αSyn contribute to the input-specific disruption of cortico-BLA synaptic connectivity and plasticity in synucleinopathies. Our data support clinical observations of an impaired cortical control of the amygdala activity that could contribute to psychiatric deficits in PD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>αSyn localizes preferentially in vGluT1<sup>+</sup> axon terminals in mouse brain</title><p>Compelling evidence from PD patients suggests that the amygdala exhibits an impaired responsiveness to sensory stimuli, arising mainly from the cerebral cortex and the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>).

For example, while αSyn mRNA expression is high in glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurons, it is largely absent from GABAergic neurons across brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taguchi et al., 2016</xref>). To further explore such a cell subtype-selective αSyn expression among glutamatergic neurons and synapses, our study shows that αSyn is preferentially present at vGluT1<sup>+</sup>, but not vGluT2<sup>+</sup>, axon terminals across several brain regions, including the BLA and the striatum. Consistent with the observation from the axon terminals, we also detected higher amounts of αSyn in the cell bodies of cortical neurons relative to thalamic neurons using the recently generated <italic>Snca<sup>NLS/NLS</sup></italic> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geertsma et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, our results support a cell- and synapse-subtype-selective αSyn protein expression among glutamatergic neurons in the mouse brain.</p><p>Endogenous levels of αSyn are determinants of neuronal vulnerability to αSyn pathology. As expected, we observed a decrease in cortical, but not thalamic, inputs to the BLA neurons in a PFF-seeding model of synucleinopathies. At a relatively early-stage (i.e. one-month post-injection), αSyn pathology decreases the number of functional cortical inputs to the BLA without loss of synapse or changes in presynaptic release probability. We posit that the disrupted cortico-BLA transmission can be caused by a reduced size of readily-releasable synaptic vesicle pool and/or a number of presynaptic release sites. This hypothesis was built on a wealth of evidence showing that αSyn aggregates decrease the expression of several synaptic vesicle-associated SNARE proteins (e.g. Snap25 and VAMP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, our study also suggests a decreased AMPA receptor-mediated response can underlie the impaired cortico-BLA transmission in PFFs-injected mice. On the other hand, an increased relative contribution of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors can be a compensatory mechanism for an overall reduction in AMPA-EPSCs at cortico-BLA synapses– a hypothesis that warrants further investigation. It is worth noting that such a decreased AMPA-EPSC of BLA neurons is input specific, which selectively occurs at cortico-BLA synapses. Thus, the molecular mechanisms that cooperate pre- and post-synaptic changes at the cortical inputs, but not the thalamic inputs, remain to be defined.</p><p>Our study further highlights the dependence of regional and cellular vulnerability on the endogenous αSyn, i.e., those neurons or axon terminals that express high levels of αSyn are prone to be functionally impacted by αSyn pathology relative to those that lack of or express low levels of αSyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Surmeier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thakur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vasili et al., 2022</xref>). Of particular interest is that vGluT2<sup>+</sup>/TH<sup>+</sup> midbrain dopamine neurons and their axon terminals in the striatum have been shown to be more resilient to neurodegeneration in postmortem PD brains and animal models studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinkellner et al., 2022</xref>).

Using an electrophysiological approach, we revealed that a partial or complete removal of αSyn from the axon terminals leads to an enhanced short-term depression in response to repetitive stimulation of cortico-BLA synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Short-term synaptic plasticity is an important ‘gain control’ mechanism for neurons to properly balance their responsiveness to distinct afferents in an input-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1997</xref>).

Physiologically, synapse-specific presence of αSyn could underlie such difference in the short-term plasticity profiles of the two inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>One can postulate that once aggregates form, a decreased synaptic strength associated with αSyn toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and an enhanced synaptic depression due to the loss of αSyn normal function at presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) make the BLA neurons less likely to respond to sustained and repetitive sensory inputs from cortical regions. These circuit changes might explain studies showing a decreased functional connectivity of cortico-amygdala, but not the thalamo-amygdala network in PD patients, which further leads to a failed amygdala responsiveness to the aversive sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type (WT) C57Bl/6J mice (Jax stock#:000664, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>) of both sexes (3–4 month-old) were obtained from the Van Andel Institute vivarium internal colony and used in the study. αSyn knockout (<italic>Snca</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:003692">IMSR_JAX:003692</ext-link>) were originally purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and then were backcrossed on a C57BL/6J background to generate heterozygous <italic>Snca</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice.

Please note the distribution of pS129 αSyn immunoreactivity within the external capsule, where cortical afferents enter BLA (Figure 3B, C), indicating the formation and accumulation of αSyn pathology along the axons arising from the cortical regions. We also performed co-staining of vGluT1 and pS129 αSyn. Their immunofluorescent signals did not show co-localization, suggesting that aggregation perhaps concentrated at soma and axons. This observation is consistent with evidence in the literature (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011), showing pS129 pathology was more prominent within axons of cultured neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Consistent with our initial observations, reduction of both αSyn immunofluorescence within vGuT1<sup>+</sup> axon terminals and the proportion of vGluT1 showing αSyn immunoreactivity were also detected using syn9027 antibody (Figure 5E-H). The percentage of αSyn-immunoreactive vGluT1<sup>+</sup> terminals detected with Syn9027 in PFFs-injected mice was higher than those detected with Syn1, perhaps reflecting differences in the exposure of their epitopes (Syn1: aa 91-99; Syn9027: aa 130-140). We thank the reviewer again for raising this important question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please provide evidence on whether the defect could be rescued with a cortically injected/expressed α-syn AAV.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewers and editors for raising this question. We agree that successful execution of such an experiment could provide a definitive answer to the question that rises from our work – are the changes in synaptic plasticity related to the decrease in available αSyn at the synapse? Unfortunately, there are technical challenges that prevent us of conducting such experiment.</p><p>– First, there is a large body of in vitro evidence suggesting that αSyn concentration needs to be properly maintained at synaptic terminals for its physiological function (i.e., “synuclein homeostasis”) (Dettmer et al., 2016). Also, the propensity of soluble αSyn to aggregate in the presence of PFFs has been shown to be concentration dependent (Courte et al., 2020; Vasili et al., 2022), which would be an inherent problem if we were to increase levels of soluble αSyn after PFFs injections have triggered the formation of aggregates in the brain. The same applies to the AAV approach, which is known to increase αSyn levels in rodents eventually resulting in its aggregation; AAV-mediated expression of αSyn in conjunction with PFFs inoculation augments the development of αSyn pathology (Thakur et al., 2017). The combined effect of AAV-mediated overexpression and recruitment of αSyn into aggregates would make it hard to determine the level of soluble αSyn that could be maintained at the synaptic terminals.</p><p>– Second, the BLA receives glutamatergic inputs from broad cortical regions. The present work electrically stimulated the external capsules to activate these cortical inputs and revealed deficits in the short-term plasticity of cortico-BLA synapses of PFFs injected mice (Figure 6). To rescue such deficits in synaptic plasticity using repetitive electric stimulation (<italic>optogenetics would not work due to ChR2 inactivation</italic>), synaptic levels of αSyn should be brought to “normal levels” across wide cortical regions. To achieve this goal, multiple injections to cover most of the cerebral cortex will be required, and the variability associated with such multi-site manipulation would be unpredictable, not only because of the possible differences in the amounts of injected material but also because αSyn levels could be affected by the processes triggered by the injection <italic>per se</italic> (i.e., inflammatory response(Acosta et al., 2015)).</p><p>– Last, the “physiological” level of soluble αSyn at axon terminals remains undefined and unmeasurable in vivo, so even in the case that we were to succeed in increasing the levels of αSyn at the synapse, failure to rescue the functional deficits would not be a definitive answer. The increase could be simply not sufficient to rescue the deficits; this situation will be analogous to the PFFs injected animals when compared to the αSyn KO mice.</p><p>Altogether, in vivo rescue studies will require not only extensive optimization of the experimental conditions but also access to technologies and resources that are not currently available</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Additional experiment – for example, looking at paired-pulse ratios of EPSCs – is needed to further support the conclusion on presynaptic release deficits.</p></disp-quote><p>To support further presynaptic release deficits, we performed additional experiments/analyses (Figure 4), including:</p><p>– Quantification of vGluT1<sup>+</sup> terminals using stereology (Figure 4A-C), which shows no difference in vGluT1 density between groups and suggests no degeneration of cortical axon terminals in the BLA.</p><p>– Paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) of cortico-BLA synapses using both electric and optogenetic stimulation (Figure 4D-G). No difference was detected in PPRs between groups, indicating that the decreased cortico-BLA transmission was not due to a lower presynaptic initial release probability.</p><p>– Analyses of quantal release: We analyzed Sr<sup>2+</sup>-induced, optogenetically-evoked quantal glutamate release from cortico-BLA synapses (Figure 4H-J) and detected a significant reduction in the frequency, but not the amplitude, of Sr<sup>2+</sup>-induced EPSCs in PFFs-injected mice.</p><p>Combining evidence in the literature, we posit that reduced presynaptic release sites and/or number of synaptic vesicles likely underlie the disrupted cortico-BLA transmission associated with αSyn pathology. These new results and discussion can be found on Pages 13-17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The selective localization of α-synuclein to vGLUT1, but not vGLUT2, positive terminals is convincing. The effect of PFFs on EPSCs in the amygdala and on short-term depression in cortical-amygdala synapses is also convincing.

Does IF with another synuclein antibody show the same results? Does increasing expression of synuclein at these terminals rescue the defects?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we further clarify that the decreased cortico-BLA basal transmission and the abnormal short-term plasticity are likely due to both the gained toxic properties of αSyn aggregation and the loss of αSyn normal function. Also, we have followed the Reviewer’s suggestion and performed additional immunostaining using a different monoclonal antibody Syn9027 against αSyn (Peng et al., 2018). We confirmed (1) a reduced proportion of vGluT1<sup>+</sup> terminals that are αSyn immunoreactive; and (2) a decreased αSyn immunoreactivity at vGluT1<sup>+</sup> axon terminals in slices from PFFs-injected mice relative to those from controls (Figure 5E-H). Thus, immunostaining studies using two different antibodies support a reduced soluble αSyn at cortical axon terminals. Please also see responses to the essential revision #2 above.</p><p>In addition, cortico-BLA synapses from slices of PFFs-injected mice showed enhanced short-term depression, which recapitulated key kinetic feature of a complete αSyn depletion in SynKO mice (Figure 6). Combining immunohistochemical and physiological information, we posit that deficits in short-term plasticity of cortical-BLA synapses in PFFs-injected mice are largely caused by the depletion of normal αSyn from axon terminals. However, as addressed in essential revision #3 (see above) it is technically impossible to increase αSyn levels without causing toxic effects in the PFFs mouse model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no data that there are abnormal aggregates in the amygdala. Can the authors please show proteinase K digested tissue with an antibody to total synuclein or use an antibody to phosphorylated synuclein?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that pathologic αSyn aggregates should have been documented in the initial submission. We have included experimental data showing the accumulation of pathologic Ser129-phosphorylated αSyn in the BLA– both Lewy body- and Lewy neurite-like structures were visualized (Figure 3). Please also see the response to the essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the mechanism of how potential abnormal α-synuclein causes reduced short-term plasticity is unclear. Did the aggregates sequester vesicles and prevent release from the reserve pool? Was the RRP diminished?</p></disp-quote><p>In the present study, we used the prolonged electric repetitive stimulation protocol (300 pulses@12.5Hz) to gradually discharge readily releasable pool (RRP, the early phase) and recruit the reserve pool (the late phase) of synaptic vesicles (SVs) into the cycle (Alabi and Tsien, 2012; Cabin et al., 2002). We did not detect statistically significant differences in the temporal profiles of cortico-BLA EPSCs to the first 100 stimuli between PBS- and PFFs-injected mice (Figure 6). This observation indicates the RRP at cortico-BLA synapses perhaps is likely not diminished, which agrees with the data from morphology study by Froula et al., (2018) (Froula et al., 2018). Thus, we posited that development of αSyn pathology does not diminish RRP at cortico-BLA synapses. Interestingly, we noticed that the depression of cortico-BLA synapses was enhanced toward the late phase of the repetitive stimulation in slices from PFFs-injected mice compared to controls (Figure 6), indicating an impaired SVs refilling process once RRP is depleted during repetitive stimulation.</p><p>Consistent with evidence from hippocampal slices, we also observed stronger depression of cortico-BLA EPSCs in response to repetitive stimulation in slices from αSyn KO mice. Such a progressive suppression of glutamate release in the absence of αSyn has been linked with a depletion of synaptic vesicle pool (Cabin et al., 2002). Moreover, we detected a decreased immunoreactivity of soluble αSyn at the vGluT1<sup>+</sup> axon terminals in the BLA (Figure 5). Furthermore, PFFs-mediated αSyn aggregation decreases the expression of synapsins (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2011), and loss of synapsins function is known to decrease SVs numbers (Siksou et al., 2007). Thus, it is plausible that the size of SVs reserve pool is smaller in the PFFs models due to both a loss of normal αSyn function and a consequence of its gained toxic properties. A decreased SVs reserve pool or impaired mobility can slow RRP refilling during repetitive stimulation and lead to an enhanced short-term depression (Alabi and Tsien, 2012).</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that the enhanced short-term depression observed in the mice with αSyn pathology was mainly caused by a decreased SVs reserve pool and/or an impaired refilling of RRP at cortico-BLA synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Excellent work has shown that normal α-synuclein acts as a clamp-on vesicle release- how does this data support or refute these studies (PMID: 31110017)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the elegant work by Sun <italic>et al.,</italic> demonstrated a functional cooperation of αSyn and VAMP2 (PMID: 31110017). It is worth noting that the work by Sun <italic>et al.,</italic> was built on an in vitro system that employs αSyn overexpression, making the levels of αSyn non-physiological; overexpression also promotes the formation of αSyn oligomers, which eventually leads to pathologic aggregation. While αSyn-VAMP2 binding was detected, whether the αSyn-VAMP2 interaction <italic>per se</italic>, and/or other high order αSyn species, mediates the SVs attenuation remains unclear.</p><p>Further, the technical differences between the present work and Sun <italic>et al.</italic>, such as in vivo versus in vitro models, levels of αSyn species in terminals and soma (endogenous or overexpression) and its toxic species, temporal resolution of the used experimental approaches/outcomes (optical imaging versus electrophysiology) make a direct comparation difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of the PFF model and α-synuclein KO mice was well-chosen however, PBS as a control for a protein injection model might not be the best fit. Consider a monomer injected mouse as another negative control to control for injections of protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that αSyn monomer injection could be an additional negative control for injection of protein in PFFs models. There is a vast body of literature using PFFs models showing no difference in pathology development between monomeric αSyn- and PBS-injected animals, so most studies combined two treatments as a “control” group (e.g., (Chatterjee et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2019; Luk et al., 2009; Rey et al., 2016)). Since our main goal was to focus on the function impact of the pathology, we opted for PBS as control because it represents a “cleaner” option (i.e., monomer preparations can in some cases elicit proinflammatory responses associated with presence of endotoxins). In addition, in the present study, we did not detect αSyn pathology and the subsequent impairments of cortico-BLA transmission when PFFs were injected into syn KO mice (Figure 3—figure supplementary 1), providing further evidence that injection of protein <italic>per se</italic> was not be sufficient to impair basal cortico-BLA transmission. Therefore, adding an additional control group with monomeric αsyn injection would not change the conclusion. The authors sincerely request to use the available resources to work on other key studies but will include monomer-injected controls in future follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

What are the endogenous expression levels of a-syn in the thalamus? Please provide a quantitative description.</p></disp-quote><p>αSyn immunoreactivity from WT mice gives diffused signals due to its presynaptic enrichment. Such staining would be ideal to tell the endogenous expression levels of αSyn protein in the thalamus. To solve this issue, we used <italic>Snca<sup>NLS/NLS</sup></italic> reporter mice to determine αSyn protein localization in the cortical and thalamic areas. These mice localize endogenous αSyn to the nucleus, allowing the visualization of cellular topography (Figure 2A) (Geertsma et al., 2022). We detected significantly lower αSyn expression in the thalamus compared to the cortex, although there is subregion heterogeneity in αSyn expression levels in the thalamus. Particularly, the centromedial thalamaus that projects heavily to the BLA shows an absence of αSyn expression; these observations provide further support to of our physiology data (Figure 2B-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Because the striatum also receives convergent cortical and thalamic inputs, it would strengthen the conclusion if the authors systematically investigate corticostriatal vs thalmostriatal terminals in parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to point #4 of this reviewer’s Public Review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors used optogenetic tools to verify the results using electrical stimulation of external and internal capsules. It would be helpful if release probability is also compared using optogenetic stimulation. Indeed, the desensitization properties of ChR2 may complicate the readout. However, the relative change in EPSC amplitudes would further strengthen the claim.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we employed both electrical and optogenetic stimulations to assess the potential effects of αSyn pathology on the initial release probability at cortico-BLA synapses. We did not detected changes in PPRs using either approach (Figure 4D-G). These data and related discussion have been included in the revised manuscript. We concluded that PFFs-induced αSyn aggregation does not alter the initial release probability of SVs at cortico-BLA terminals.</p><p>References</p><p>Acosta SA, Tajiri N, Pena I de la, Bastawrous M, Sanberg PR, Kaneko Y, Borlongan CV. 2015.
