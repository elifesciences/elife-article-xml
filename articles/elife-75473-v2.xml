MPNSTs, which affect approximately 10% of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and cause severe organ damage, are associated with high morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mowery and Clayburgh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Widemann, 2009</xref>). Chemotherapy and radiotherapy provide only limited benefits to MPNST patients, and there is no targeted therapy approved for clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vitolo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">van Noesel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kroep et al., 2011</xref>). The key to improving the prognosis of MPNST patients is extended resection with negative surgical margins, which still faces problems such as the difficulty of surgery, high risk of local recurrence, and distant metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Widemann and Italiano, 2018</xref>). There is thus a very large unmet medical need to develop efficient therapeutic strategies for MPNSTs.</p><p>Photothermal therapy (PTT), a minimally invasive, highly specific, and temporally and spatially selective local treatment modality, has gained increasing attention in the field of cancer theranostics, including for the treatment of MPNSTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Huang and Lovell, 2017</xref>). Traditional PTT contains two elements: photothermal agents (PTAs) and lasers. PTAs can be grouped into inorganic and organic materials. Inorganic PTAs include noble metal materials (e.g., Au, Pd, Pt, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2016a</xref>), metal chalcogenide materials (e.g., Ag<sub>2</sub>S, CuS, Cu<sub>2-x</sub>Se, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sheng et al., 2018</xref>), carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes, carbon dots, and graphene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), and graphene analogs (two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides [MXenes], two-dimensional monoelemental materials [Xenes], hexagonal boron nitride, carbon nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Thapa et al., 2016</xref>). However, inorganic PTAs have intrinsic issues such as poor biodegradability, disappointing processability, and apparent cytotoxicity. Organic PTAs include mainly small molecules (e.g., cyanine, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, croconaine, boron dipyrromethene, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattarai and Dai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pan et al., 2019</xref>) and semiconducting polymer-based nanoparticles (e.g., polyaniline, polypyrrole, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). Although the advantageous properties of organic agents include distinct biodegradability and biocompatibility, optimization of photothermal conversion efficiency and photothermal stability is highly challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, both organic and inorganic PTAs significantly hinder the clinical application of PTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Near-infrared (NIR) lasers, which represent a promising type of PTT-related laser, play significant roles in addressing the demand for superficial tumor therapy due to their biowindow characteristics, which include a lower background signal and higher tissue penetration depth than those of other biowindows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). NIR light can be divided into four distinct regions according to wavelength: NIR-I (700–950 nm), NIR-II (1000–1350 nm), NIR-III (1600–1870 nm), and NIR-IV (2100–2300 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sordillo et al., 2017</xref>). The latest research on light-responsive wavelengths for PTT has focused mainly on NIR-I and NIR-II biowindows in combination with NIR lasers and wavelength-matched PTAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). The evidence regarding NIR-III lasers remains comparatively limited in the field of PTT. Compared with NIR-I and NIR-II lasers, NIR-III lasers possess relatively high penetration depths and low optical scattering effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Horton et al., 2013</xref>). The total attenuation lengths of human prostate and breast cancer have been revealed to be higher in the NIR-III optical windows than in the other NIR regions, confirming the potential for application of NIR-III lasers in tumor therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The majority of MPNSTs are located on the body surface including head, neck, and extremity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Le Guellec et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it could be boldly speculated that NIR-III laser would effectively induce photothermal ablation of MPNSTs due to their surface layout characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sordillo et al., 2017</xref> previously demonstrated that NIR-III treatment appears to involve a better wavelength range for tissue containing high collagen than conventional NIR-I treatment. In addition, a previous genetic profiling study has revealed that collagen expression is significantly upregulated in MPNSTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Karube et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the photothermal effects of NIR-III could be more concentrated in MPNSTs than in adjacent normal skin and soft tissue. Moreover, the safety of NIR-III has been widely demonstrated in various medical applications, including optical imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shi et al., 2016b</xref>), eye disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sakimoto et al., 2006</xref>), and even cosmetic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adatto et al., 2017</xref>). In summary, the potential therapeutic effectiveness and desirable safety of NIR-III treatment will likely accelerate its clinical application compared with that of traditional photothermal theranostic methods. Although the application of NIR-III for PTT has not yet been demonstrated in MPNSTs, the existing data further strengthen our expectation that NIR-III laser can be used for PTT of tumors without the utilization of PTAs.</p><p>In this work, with the aim of reducing the pain of MPNST patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>) and avoiding the intrinsic drawbacks of PTAs and the aforementioned critical problems, we performed PTT using a 1650 nm NIR-III laser in a simple manner without the addition of PTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The relatively high collagen content of MPNSTs ensure the efficiency of photothermal tumor ablation and make the NIR-III laser a suitable and potent therapeutic modality that has potential for use in clinical applications. In principle, the photothermal conversion of the NIR-III laser is attributed to the thermal molecular movement of the irradiated object after laser irradiation. In addition, the power safety limit for the NIR-III laser is higher than that for NIR-I and NIR-II lasers, which in turn leads to efficient and safe tumor ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). Both in vitro and in vivo results indicate that the photothermal conversion ability of the NIR-III laser is enough to rapidly ablate cancer cells, which affirms the antineoplastic effect of NIR-III PTT. This PTAs-free PTT strategy possesses unique advantages for the development of clinical application and the improvement of patient prognosis due to the excellent biocompatibility and predominant photothermal conversion efficiency of NIR-III laser.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Disease models and therapeutic illustrations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photograph and (<bold>b</bold>) magnetic resonance images of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) patient.

In contrast, in the NIR-II group, an increase in power density elevated the aqueous solution temperature to a certain extent.

First, the dependence of the temperature increment on power density was evaluated in chicken breast models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). The temperature of the chicken breast surface rapidly increased from 27.2°C to 76.7°C within 10 min under NIR-III laser irradiation (1.5 W cm<sup>–2</sup>). In addition, the results of photothermal penetration experiments further validated the highly efficient photothermal performance of the NIR-III laser, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and e</xref>. The difference between the temperature at 0 s and the temperature at 600 s (ΔT) was still over 10°C even when a chicken breast of 10 mm thickness was used to block the radiation. Similar results were obtained in the pig fat penetration experiments, namely, the extent of the temperature change was proportional to the power density and inversely proportional to the fat thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f–i</xref>). Notably, temperature range (36.6–91.1°C) varied with laser power and fat thickness.

In the 5 min group, the 0.25 W cm<sup>–2</sup> NIR-III laser induced a 25% reduction in cell viability, while lasers with higher power density all exhibited a strong killing effect. In the 10 min group, NIR-III irradiation caused maximum cell death regardless of the power density. In addition, the tumor killing efficiency of the NIR-III laser at different penetration depths was also evaluated. The NIR-III laser (1 W cm<sup>–2</sup>) demonstrated almost 100% cell killing efficiency after penetrating chicken skin thickness of 4 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the S462 cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>).

Cells with ER stress can initiate a self-protection mechanism termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) that induces a set of transcriptional and translational events to restore ER homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Qi and Chen, 2019</xref>). To explore the specific mechanism, we investigated the interactions between ER pathway-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). It could be found that the key transcription factors regulating the UPR (ATF4 and ATF6B) were among the top upregulated mRNAs related to protein processing in ER pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). RT-qPCR analysis also confirmed the significant upregulation of ATF4 and ATF6B in the NIR-III (0.5 W cm<sup>–2</sup>, 5 min) group and the NIR-III (1 W cm<sup>–2</sup>, 5 min) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). It was demonstrated in previous studies that ATF4 and ATF6B contributed to stress relief and survival by inducing the expression of ER chaperones, which have critical functions in facilitating protein folding and assembly. We identified the most significantly upregulated ER chaperones genes P4HB and HSP1A1 and further confirmed the upregulation of these two genes using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>).</p><p>In addition to ER chaperones, the UPR regulated by ATF4 and ATF6 also upregulates the components of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Proteins that do not properly fold within a certain time are targeted for ERAD, which efficiently retro-translocates them from the ER into the cytosol for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. According to KEGG enrichment analyses, the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (hsa04120) was also enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). GO enrichment analyses revealed the related key biological processes including protein polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The interactions between ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway-related genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>. The most significantly upregulated mRNAs including UBA3, UBE2E1, and HERC3 were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, it can be speculated that the ER stress response (ERSR) enabled a proportion of STS26T cells to survive the NIR-III laser treatment through improving protein-folding capacity and ubiquitylating unfolded proteins.</p><p>Whole-transcriptome sequencing and corresponding bioinformatics analyses were also performed on S462 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the ER pathway was not enriched in the analyses, indicating that heterogeneity exists in response to NIR-III laser treatment among different MPNST cell types. Notably, STS26T cells exhibited stronger resistance to NIR-III laser treatment than S462 cells, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In clinic, the main management for MPNSTs is still surgical resection with sufficient margins, which is often highly risky due to expected damage to adjacent nerves and neurovascular bundles. Therefore, it is applicable to combine preoperative NIR-III photothermal laser treatment and surgery to reduce the scope and the risk of surgery. In addition, postoperative local recurrence and distant metastasis are unfavorable factors affecting the outcomes of MPNST patients. The postoperative application of NIR-III laser treatment at the resection margin could be a potent modality to reduce the risk of local recurrence. However, further experiments and clinical studies are necessary for verification of the safety and effectiveness of these clinical applications.</p><p>Mechanically, it is possible that STS26T MPNST cells strongly enhanced the protein processing capacity of the ER to survive the ER stress induced by NIR-III laser treatment. The specific mechanism and regulatory networks need to be explored in the future. In addition, it is speculated that the combination of NIR-III laser treatment with an ER stress inhibitor (such as icariin or ghrelin) could potentially increase therapeutic effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2019</xref>), which should be further verified in future studies. Although the tumor ablation effect is influenced by individual differences in molecular response and treatment efficiency, an optimal effect can still be achieved by optimizing the power density and irradiation time of the NIR-III laser.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we developed a distinct NIR-III photothermal laser treatment for MPNSTs that does not involve traditional PTAs. The safety, effectiveness, and underlying mechanisms were systematically assessed both in vitro and in vivo, which verified the excellent antineoplastic effect originating from the remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of the NIR-III laser. This work provides preclinical evidence for the effectiveness of NIR-III treatment against MPNSTs. Further clinical studies are needed to establish safe and optimal therapeutic parameters. It is expected that this PTAs-free NIR-III PTT approach may be further generalized for the treatment of other benign and malignant skin and soft-tissue tumors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing, Experiments in the revision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The use of photos and magnetic resonance images of MPNST patients was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (Reference number: SH9H-2019-T163-2).

Current analysis showed that more than 11,000 genes were up-regulated and more than 8,000 genes were down-regulated after NIR-III treatment with either 1 W cm-2 or 0.5 W cm-2, which means around 20,000 genes were significantly regulated, that's almost all of the genes were regulated since human just express around 20,000 genes. The qPCR result in Figure 6d showed that ATF4 only regulated to 1.2 times compared to the control after 0.5 W cm-2, which is obviously not significantly regulated. Why did authors choose ATF4, ATF6B, HSPA1A and P4HB for validation, why not XBP1, MAPK8 or other genes?

The authors should provide more details about the RNAseq datasets and how did they analyze the data. Current analysis showed that more than 11,000 genes were up-regulated and more than 8,000 genes were down-regulated after NIR-III treatment with either 1 W cm-2 or 0.5 W cm-2, which means around 20,000 genes were significantly regulated, that's almost all of the genes were regulated since human just express around 20,000 genes.

A deeper analysis should be performed and a detailed description of the samples is also helpful. The authors also need to deposit the RNAseq to a public database.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out these issues. We performed the differential expression analysis at transcript level and a corrected P-value of 0.05 was set as the thresholds for significant differential expression. Despite of the quantity of the differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), several DETs correspond to the same gene. We have revised the relevant content in the manuscript.</p><p>According to the RNA-seq, the transcript ENST00000404241 encoding ATF4 was significantly up-regulated in the NIR (0.5 W cm<sup>-2</sup>) group (logFC = 2.29). However, the PCR results showed that ATF4 expression level was only up-regulated 1.2-fold at the transcriptional level. We believed the reason was that PCR detected the expression of all ATF4 transcripts (including ENST00000337304, ENST00000404241 and ENST00000396680), thus resulting in a lower fold upregulation of ATF4. In addition, considering the efficiency of transcription factors, which means very small amounts of transcription factors could exert transcriptional regulation, it is believed that the upregulation of ATF4 was biologically meaningful.</p><p>According to previous investigations and the RNA-seq results, it can be speculated that ATF4 and ATF6B are the key transcription factors that mediate unfolded protein response (UPR) in STS26T xenograft (Annu Rev Pathol.2015;10:173-94). Therefore, we first verified the upregulation of these transcription factors using RT-qPCR method. Furthermore, ATF4 and ATF6B could subsequently upregulate the expression of ER charperones, which was critical for UPR. Meanwhile, the upregulation of the top upregulated ER chaperones genes P4HB and HSP1A1 using RT-qPCR approach has been further confirmed.</p><p>According to your kind suggestion, we have further supplemented the analysis related to the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis pathway and refined the manuscript. In addition, we have supplemented the method of RNA-seq and added the data availability statement: The datasets generated for this study can be found in DRYAD at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9km7.

The tumor-therapeutic safety and efficacy of NIR-III laser are suggested to be compared with the traditional and mostly used NIR-I and NIR-II lasers together with photothermal agents.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for your constructive question. In terms of tumor-therapeutic safety, the traditional NIR-I or NIR-II photothermal therapy exist inherent biosafety issues due to the introduction of photothermal agents. Inorganic photothermal agents have intrinsic issues such as poor biodegradability, disappointing processability and apparent cytotoxicity. Although the advantageous properties of organic agents include distinct biodegradability and biocompatibility, the deficient photothermal conversion efficiency and photothermal stability limit these further biological applications. However, NIR-I or NIR-II laser irradiation alone can not reach the appropriate temperature to kill tumors. Therefore, NIR-III laser treatment can circumvent the biosafety problems of photothermal agents. In terms of tumor-therapeutic efficacy, NIR-III lasers possess relatively high penetration depths and low optical scattering effects compared with NIR-I and NIR-II lasers. The total attenuation lengths of human prostate and breast cancer have been revealed to be higher in the NIR-III optical windows than in the other NIR regions, confirming the potential for application of NIR-III lasers in tumor therapy (Sordillo D C, Sordillo L A, Sordillo P P, et al. Fourth near-infrared optical window for assessment of bone and other tissues[C]//Photonic Therapeutics and Diagnostics XII. SPIE, 2016, 9689: 499-506.).</p><p>Finally, we greatly appreciate and thank the reviewers’ kind, professional and constructive reminding, comments and suggestions for this manuscript.

I would like to suggest performing more replicates for RNA-seq or deleting the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your constructive suggestion and kind recommendation. We also agree that biological replicates can provide more solid results. Therefore, we planned to perform more technical replicates using the same RNA samples returned from sequencing. We performed quality control checks on the RNA samples. In addition, considering the updates of bioinformatics analysis process in the sequencing company, we re-analyzed the original data and compared the results. However, our plan to perform technical replicates failed due to the partial degradation of the RNA samples and the impact of the alterations in the bioinformatics analysis process on the results. Due to the failure of the plan, we can only redesign and reperform the relevant experiments (including in vivo modeling, NIR treatment, sampling, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis). However, considering the long duration of the experiment, we temporarily gave up on this attempt.</p><p>We still kept the results of RNA-seq in the manuscript for the following reasons: 1. the results of RNA-seq are relatively stable across different biological replicates. 2. Many previous investigations also confirmed the reliability of RNA-seq data without replicates. (Adv. Funct. Mater. 2020, 30, 2002610. DOI:10.1002/adfm.202002610; Cancer Cell. 2018 Mar 12;33(3):368-385.e7.) 3. In this study, RNA-seq was performed on tumors from the control, NIR-III (0.5 W cm<sup>-2</sup>, 5 min), and NIR-III (1 W cm<sup>-2</sup>, 5 min) groups. We performed functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in the two treatment groups respectively. The results of the two groups were similar and consistent with those in the manuscript. Alterations in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways were both significant in the two treatment groups. (In the manuscript, the enrichment analysis was carried out on the common DETs of the two treatment groups).</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>STS26T NIR-III 1 W cm-2.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Pathway term</th><th valign="bottom">qvalue</th><th valign="bottom">Gene number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.03501825</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">68</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.01292571</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">62</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>STS26T NIR-III 0.</title><p>5 W cm-2</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Pathway term</th><th valign="bottom">qvalue</th><th valign="bottom">Gene number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.02231676</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.00044313</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">56</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Regarding the use of the 'edgeR' package for differential expression analysis, we reviewed relevant literature and discussed the issue with technical support. For samples without biological replicates, differential expression analysis of two conditions was performed using the edgeR R package (3.12.1). According to the edgeR User's Guide, differential expression analysis using edgeR R package can be performed in samples with and without replicates. edgeR proposed 4 methods for the differential expression analysis in samples without replicates. (edgeR: differential analysis of sequence read count data. User’s Guide. Chen, Y. et al. (2022))</p><p>Regarding the number of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), our previous response was that a gene may correspond to several transcripts, resulting in a large number of transcripts dysregulated. In addition, we need to state that there are many low-abundance transcripts (transcripts with low FPKM values) in our DET list. Most transcripts, especially mRNAs, with low FPKM values are not biologically significant. However, there is no standard definition of low-abundance transcripts/genes, so the treatment of these transcripts/genes varies across studies. We summarized the common treatment methods of these transcripts/genes: 1. keep all the differentially expressed genes for subsequent functional analysis. 2. perform low-expression gene filtering before differential analysis. 3. Change the threshold of the DETs in differential analysis (eg. Padj&lt;0.05, |LFC|&gt;1, FPKM&gt;1) in differential analysis. 4. No alterations in differential expression analysis and only transcripts with sufficient expression are selected for subsequent functional analysis. We used method 4 in the previous manuscript (We selected DETs with FPKM&gt;1 for enrichment analysis).</p><p>Your valuable comments made us realize that genes with low expression should be deleted in the differential expression analysis as they are not biologically meaningful, and it may be confusing to readers and other researchers. Therefore, after reviewing relevant literature and consulting bioinformatics technical support, we changed the threshold of DETs in differential analysis to padj &lt;0.05, |logFC| &gt;1, and FPKMmax &gt;1. (FPKMmax stands for the maximum expression level of a transcript from the two samples compared). (Cancer Res (2019) 79 (19): 4840–4854.; Genome Biol. 2014 Aug 13;15(8):429.; Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Dec 10;8:599494.) We reperformed subsequent analyses based on the new DET list, and the results of the Venn analysis, KEGG, and GO enrichment were updated in the manuscript and the supplementary material. The protein-protein interaction network and the top 10 upregulated genes related to hsa04141/hsa04120 were not modified because none of the DETs were deleted. The RNA-seq analysis method was also modified.</p><p>The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NIR-III laser treatment in MPNST, so the explorations of the underlying mechanisms of NIR-III treatment effects were preliminary and based only on RNA-seq. We have added a statement of this limitation to the manuscript. We also plan to explore the relevant mechanisms and combination therapy in further investigation.</p><p>All the changes made in the revised manuscript have been highlighted in yellow for your convenience.</p><p>Finally, we greatly appreciate and thank the reviewers’ kind, professional and constructive reminding, comments and suggestions for this manuscript. We have tried our best to address all these issues as possible as we can. We sincerely hope that the revised manuscript has addressed all the comments and suggestions as kindly raised by the reviewers and meet the publication standard of <italic>eLife</italic>. Thank you very much.</p></body></sub-article></article>
