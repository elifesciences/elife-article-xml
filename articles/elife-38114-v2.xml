However, the molecular pathways underlying different sleep stages remain unclear. The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, exhibits consolidated sleep during both day and night, with night sleep associated with higher arousal thresholds compared to day sleep. Here we identify a role for the neuronal calcium sensor protein Neurocalcin (NCA) in promoting sleep during the night but not the day by suppressing nocturnal arousal and hyperactivity. We show that both circadian and light-sensing pathways define the temporal window in which NCA promotes sleep. Furthermore, we find that NCA promotes sleep by suppressing synaptic release from a dispersed wake-promoting neural network and demonstrate that the mushroom bodies, a sleep-regulatory center, are a module within this network. Our results advance the understanding of how sleep stages are genetically defined.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>neuronal calcium sensor</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>light</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Synaptopathies Strategic Award, 104033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jepson</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC New Investigator Award, MR/P012256/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jepson</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship 109003/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krätschmer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R02281X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jepson</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin regulates sleep and arousal thresholds during the night in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a widely conserved behavior that influences numerous aspects of brain function, including neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kayser et al., 2014</xref>), clearance of metabolic waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xie et al., 2013</xref>), synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Havekes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and complex behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kayser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kayser et al., 2014</xref>). The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, exhibits a sleep-like state characterized by immobility, altered posture and elevated arousal threshold during both day and night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly to mammals, sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, just as human sleep can be separated into stages of differing arousal thresholds (REM and three non-REM sleep stages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rechtschaffen et al., 1966</xref>), sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also varies in intensity throughout the day/night cycle, with night sleep having a higher arousal threshold relative to day sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faville et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which sleep is partitioned into stages remain poorly understood. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutations in a select number of genes modulate either day or night sleep, suggesting that distinct genetic pathways may promote or inhibit these sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tomita et al., 2015</xref>). Yet it is still unclear which properties of sleep/wake these genes are influencing, and how the timing of when they affect sleep is controlled.</p><p>The identification of new genes selectively impacting day or night sleep will help address such questions. Previously, large-scale screens of EMS-mutagenized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stavropoulos and Young, 2011</xref>), P-element insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koh et al., 2008</xref>), or transgenic RNAi knockdown lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rogulja and Young, 2012</xref>) have been used to identify <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep mutants. However, such approaches are highly laborious, requiring screening of thousands of fly lines to identify a limited number of bona fide sleep genes. Thus, targeted screening strategies of higher efficiency may represent a useful complement to unbiased high-throughput, yet low yield, methodologies.</p><p>We uncovered a novel sleep-relevant gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using a guilt-by-association strategy. Our approach was based on comparative phenotyping of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants of homologous genes, <italic>KCTD17</italic>/<italic>insomniac</italic>, both of which encode a Cullin-3 adaptor protein involved in the ubiquination pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mencacci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stavropoulos and Young, 2011</xref>). In humans, a <italic>KCTD17</italic> mutation has been associated with myoclonus dystonia, a disorder characterized by repetitive movements, contorted postures and non-epileptic myoclonic jerks in the upper body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mencacci et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, null or hypomorphic mutations in the <italic>KCTD17</italic> homolog <italic>insomniac</italic> result in profound reductions in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfeiffenberger and Allada, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stavropoulos and Young, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Genotype-to-phenotype relationships arising from conserved cellular pathways can differ substantially between divergent species such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lehner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wangler et al., 2017</xref>). In this context, it is interesting to note that dystonia in humans and sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are linked by a common cellular mechanism: synaptic downscaling. This process occurs during sleep in both mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and is suppressed at cortico-striatal synapses in murine dystonia models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calabresi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilestro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that homologs of other human dystonia-associated genes might also influence sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we examined whether homologs of dystonia-associated genes influenced sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Through this strategy we identified a previously unappreciated role for the <italic>HPCA</italic>/Hippocalcin homolog <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> (<italic>Nca</italic>) in regulating night sleep. Hippocalcin and NCA are neuronal calcium sensors, cytoplasmic proteins that bind calcium via EF hand domains and translocate to lipid membranes via a calcium-dependent myristoylation switch. This in turn alters interactions with membrane-bound proteins such as ion channels and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braunewell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgoyne and Haynes, 2012</xref>). In murine hippocampal neurons, Hippocalcin facilitates the slow afterhyperpolarisation (a calcium-dependent potassium current) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tzingounis et al., 2007</xref>), and glutamate receptor endocytosis during LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>). In humans, rare missense and null mutations in <italic>HPCA</italic> have been linked to DYT2 primary isolated dystonia, a hyperkinetic movement disorder affecting the upper limbs, cervical and cranial regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carecchio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charlesworth et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> NCA has been shown to be expressed in synaptic regions throughout the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Teng et al., 1994</xref>). However, the neuronal and organismal functions of NCA have remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a role for NCA in suppressing nocturnal arousal and locomotor activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, thus facilitating nighttime sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of neurocalcin as a sleep-promoting factor</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> NCA is highly homologous to the mammalian neuronal calcium sensor Hippocalcin, sharing &gt;90% amino-acid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test whether <italic>Nca</italic> influences sleep or wakefulness we initially used transgenic RNAi. Using the pan-neuronal driver <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4, we found that neuronal expression of three independent RNAi lines targeting <italic>Nca</italic> mRNA (<italic>kk108825, hmj21533</italic> and <italic>jf03398</italic>; termed <italic>kk</italic>, <italic>hmj</italic> and <italic>jf</italic> respectively) reduced night sleep but not day sleep in adult male flies housed under 12 hr light: 12 hr dark conditions (12L: 12D) at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>), as measured by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Activity Monitoring (DAM) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2010</xref>). In this work we define a <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep bout as ≥5 min of inactivity, the common standard in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We performed a series of experiments to further validate a specific role of NCA in promoting night sleep. Sleep loss in flies expressing <italic>Nca</italic> RNAi correlated with significant reductions in <italic>Nca</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). In contrast, expression of the <italic>cg7646</italic> locus, which shares 5’ regulatory elements with <italic>Nca</italic> and encodes a neuronal calcium sensor more closely related to mammalian Recoverin than Hippocalcin, was unaffected by <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,G</xref>). Night-specific sleep loss following <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown was also observed in virgin adult female flies and in male flies expressing the <italic>kk Nca</italic> RNAi using other pan-neuronal or broadly expressed drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H–J</xref>), whereas knockdown of <italic>cg7646</italic> by RNAi did not impact night sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K</xref>).</p><p>Sleep architecture in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is generally studied in 12L: 12D conditions. Interestingly, we found that night sleep in <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown males appeared even further reduced under short photoperiod conditions (8L: 16D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly to 12L: 12D, in 8L: 16D day sleep was unaffected whilst night sleep was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), due to fragmentation of consolidated sleep bouts during the middle of the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Thus, light is also capable of inhibiting sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies. Consistent with this finding, under constant light (LL) conditions, in which the circadian clock becomes arrhythmic due to light-dependent degradation of Timeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunter-Ensor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peschel et al., 2006</xref>), sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies was completely suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). From the above data we draw two conclusions. Firstly, that the circadian clock is not required for NCA to regulate sleep per se, but instead defines <italic>when</italic> NCA promotes sleep. Secondly, that light-sensing pathways suppress enhanced wakefulness resulting from reduced NCA expression.</p><p>We thus sought to determine which light-sensing pathways restrict sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies to the night. We reasoned that removing relevant photoreceptive molecules, cells or transduction pathways might restore sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies during LL. Ablation of photoreceptor cells through expression of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>hid</italic> (<italic>gmr-hid</italic>) did not alter sleep in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies in LL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>). In contrast, using a loss of function allele of <italic>cry</italic> (<italic>cry</italic><sup>02</sup>), we found that loss of CRY in LL resulted in a small but significant loss of sleep in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,L</xref>). CRY is a blue-light photoreceptor and has dual roles in synchronization of the circadian clock by light and light-dependent regulation of clock cell excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fogle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stanewsky et al., 1998</xref>).

Across the day/night cycle, <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep is similarly characterized by dynamic alterations in arousal threshold, with day sleep associated with lower arousal thresholds relative to night sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faville et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). However, molecular pathways underlying distinct sleep stages are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate a role for the neuronal calcium sensor NCA as a regulator of nocturnal sleep and arousal, thus providing a novel entry point to address this issue.</p><p>Previous genetic screens have identified an array of sleep-promoting factors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>). However, despite extensive circuit analyses, the complete neural substrates in which these factors function have yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rogulja and Young, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stavropoulos and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tomita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Our results are consistent with these findings and offer a tentative explanation for the difficulties in defining circuit requirements for sleep-relevant proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We show that NCA is not required within a single cell-type or neuropil region to inhibit nighttime arousal and wakefulness. Instead, sleep-relevant NCA activity is necessary within two distinct domains of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system defined by the <italic>A05</italic>- and <italic>C01</italic>-Gal4 drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ex vivo imaging demonstrates that <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown enhances synaptic output from subsets of <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons innervating the MB αβ-lobes and the AMMC. Reversing this effect via dORKΔC2-mediated electrical silencing suppresses sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown flies, suggesting that enhanced synaptic output from <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons via drives nighttime wakefulness. We note that while dORKΔC2 expression does not grossly effect the development or axonal guidance of particular clock neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nitabach et al., 2002</xref>), prior work has shown that potassium channel overexpression can reduce the viability of mammalian hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nadeau et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we cannot entirely rule out an effect of dORKΔC2 expression that is secondary to electrical silencing. However, adult-stage excitation via heat-activated TrpA1 channels reveals a clear capacity of <italic>C01</italic>-neurons to promote wake during both day and night, whereas <italic>A05</italic>-neurons promote nighttime wakefulness only when <italic>C01</italic>-neurons are concurrently activated. Since this thermo-genetic approach avoids unforeseen effects of chronic alterations in excitability on cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011</xref>), the above data collectively support a model in which reduced NCA activity in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons causes a mild elevation in neurotransmitter release from neuronal subsets within the <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-domains. Reduced NCA activity in <italic>C01</italic>- or <italic>A05</italic>-neurons alone is insufficient to promote wakefulness. Yet when NCA expression is inhibited in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons simultaneously, the resulting enhancement of synaptic output within this wider network is sufficient to reduce night sleep.</p><p>While the precise identities of the wake-promoting circuits within the <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-domains remain enigmatic, our data suggests a role for NCA in the MB αβ-lobes in suppressing arousal during the night. The MB-KCs have been shown to exert a multifaceted influence on <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>). Recent data has shown that thermo-genetic activation of MB αβ-lobes does not affect sleep levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, we find that <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown in MB-KCs or in <italic>C01</italic>-neurons (which overlap in the MB αβ-lobes) does not impact sleep in 8L: 16D. Nonetheless, either manipulation is sufficient to reduce the arousal threshold in the context of a mechanical stimulus. Thus, NCA plays dual functions in modulating arousal and wakefulness, likely by acting in distinct circuits within the fly brain.</p><p>Two questions arise from these results. Firstly, how might NCA inhibit synaptic output? The mammalian NCA homolog Hippocalcin modulates neuronal excitability and plasticity through multiple pathways. Hippocalcin facilitates NMDA receptor endocytosis during LTD and gates the slow afterhyperpolarisation, a calcium-activated potassium current controlling spike frequency adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tzingounis et al., 2007</xref>). Recent data suggest that Hippocalcin also inhibits calcium influx through N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helassa et al., 2017</xref>). Given the strong homology between Hippocalcin and NCA, it will be intriguing to test whether NCA limits excitatory synaptic input and reduces spike frequency and/or neurotransmitter release through similar pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Indeed, cell-type-specific expression of homologous NCA-binding proteins may explain why synaptic output is enhanced in only a subset of <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons following <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown, despite previous results showing that NCA is broadly expressed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Teng et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, how is the sleep-promoting role of NCA limited to the night? Our results show that both internal and external cues regulate when NCA impacts sleep. <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown reduces sleep solely during the subjective night in DD, but throughout 24 hr in DD when the circadian clock is disrupted. Thus, our data demonstrate a role for the clock in timing when NCA promotes sleep. However, light also acts in parallel as an environmental signal capable of suppressing enhanced wakefulness when NCA activity is reduced, in part through the CRY photoreceptor. At the circuit-level, our results suggest that constant light suppresses increased neurotransmitter release from neurons in the MB αβ-lobes and AMMC following <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown, further supporting a role for the MB αβ-KCs as a component of the neural network through which NCA influences sleep and suggesting a potential contribution from neurons innervating the AMMC. Elucidating the identity of clock- and light-regulated circuits (including CRY-expressing neurons) that gate when and whether NCA promotes sleep will prove a fruitful avenue of future research. More broadly, our work provides a framework to study how complex interactions between genes, neural circuits and the environment influence a critical behavior such as sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">kk108825</td><td valign="top">Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org/reports/FBst0481000.html">FlyBase_FBst0481000</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top">y[1]v[1];

A sleep bout is defined by 5 min of inactivity (where inactivity is defined as no beam crosses during 1 min in the DAM or less than 3 mm movement in 5 s in the DART). As a readout of the arousal threshold at ZT4 and ZT16, we measured the proportion of immediate movement initiation in sleeping fly populations (flies that had been immobile for &gt;5 mins before stimulus) upon 5 s of vibration stimuli (five 200 ms 50 Hz pulses with 800 ms intervals) provided by the motors installed within DART system. The csv output files with beam crosses (DAM) or velocity data (DART) were processed by a customized Excel calculators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and R-scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/PatrickKratsch/DAM_analysR">https://github.com/PatrickKratsch/DAM_analysR</ext-link>) to calculate the following parameters for individual flies: <italic>Onset and offset of each sleep bout</italic>, <italic>sleep bout length</italic>, <italic>day and night sleep minutes</italic>, <italic>daily total sleep minutes,</italic> and <italic>daily sleep profile</italic> (30 min interval).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of circadian rhythm strength</title><p>An established MATLAB based tool, Flytoolbox, was used for circadian rhythmicity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levine et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine et al., 2002b</xref>). Flies from control and experimental genotypes developed and eclosed under 12L: 12D conditions (25°C). After 3 days of entrainment in 12L: 12D, adult males were transferred into DAM tubes, and circadian rhythmicity of locomotor activity was assessed over eleven days of constant dark (DD) following one initial day of 12L: 12D within the experimental incubator. The strength of rhythmicity (RI) was estimated using the height of the third peak coefficient in the auto-correlogram calculated for the activity time series of each fly. Rhythmic Statistics values were then obtained from the ratio of the RI value to the 95% confidence interval for the correlogram (2/√N, where N is the number of observations, which correlatively increase with the sampling frequency), in order to determine statistical significance of any identified period (RS is ≥1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy</title><p>Adult male flies were anesthetized in 70% ethanol before brains were dissected in PBT (0.1M phosphate buffer with 0.3% Triton-X100) and collected in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBT on ice. The fixation was then performed at room temperature for 15 min before washing 3 times with PBT. The brain samples were blocked using 5% goat serum/PBT for 1 hr at room temperature before incubation with primary antibodies. The samples were washed 6 times with PBT before incubated with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies in 5% goat serum/PBT at 4°C over 24 hr. After washing 6 times with PBT, the samples were mounted in SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (S36936, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on microscope slides and stored at 4°C until imaged using an inverted confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 710. Primary antibody concentrations were as follows: mouse anti-BRP (nc82, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) - 1:200; rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen) - 1:1000; rabbit anti-dsRED (Clontech) - 1:2000. Alexa Fluor secondaries (Invitrogen) were used as follows: Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG - 1:500, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG - 1:2000, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG - 1:2000. For quantification of nuclei number in <italic>C01 &gt;red</italic> stinger and <italic>A05 &gt;red</italic> stinger brains, unstained Red-Stinger fluorescence was captured via confocal microscopy. DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) was used to counterstain nuclei (at a dilution of 1:5000). The number of Red-Stinger-positive nuclei in each brain was subsequently quantified using the ImageJ 3D Objects Counter tool, with a variable threshold used to incorporate all of the visible Red-Stinger-positive nuclei. Standardized images from the Virtual Fly Brain can be found in the following files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milyaev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manton et al., 2014</xref>):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>R14A05-Gal4: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/vfb/jfrc/fl/reformatted-quant/JFRC2_GMR_14A05_AE_01_13-fA01b_C100226_20100226142935296_02_warp_m0g80c8e1e-1x26r3.nrrd">http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/vfb/jfrc/fl/reformatted-quant/JFRC2_GMR_14A05_AE_01_13-fA01b_C100226_20100226142935296_02_warp_m0g80c8e1e-1x26r3.nrrd</ext-link>. </p></list-item><list-item><p>R72C01-Gal4: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/vfb/jfrc/fl/reformatted-quant/JFRC2_GMR_72C01_AE_01_02-fA01b_C091205_20091205104559169_02_warp_m0g80c8e1e-1x26r3.nrrd">http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/vfb/jfrc/fl/reformatted-quant/JFRC2_GMR_72C01_AE_01_02-fA01b_C091205_20091205104559169_02_warp_m0g80c8e1e-1x26r3.nrrd</ext-link>. </p></list-item><list-item><p>nc82: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/DrosAdultBRAINdomains/blob/master/template/JFRCtemplate2010.nrrd"><named-content content-type="sequence">https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/DrosAdultBRAINdomains/blob/master/template/JFRCtemplate2010.nrrd</named-content>. </ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SynaptopHluorin imaging</title><p>Synaptic activity of <italic>C01/A05</italic> neurons was monitored in ex vivo fly brains using UAS- super-ecliptic synaptopHluorin construct (UAS-<italic>spH</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miesenböck, 2012</xref>).

Fly brains were transferred into 200 μl HL3 in a poly-lysine treated glass bottom dish (35 mm, 627860, Greiner Bio-One) before imaging using an inverted confocal Zeiss LSM 710 microscope (20x objective with maximum pinhole). Three to five image stacks (12 bits and 16 bits) were taken within two minutes to minimize tissue degradation and to cover the depth of all spH-positive anatomical regions. Z-projections of the image stacks of each brain were generated by ImageJ software before the fluorescent intensity of the indicated neuropil centers was quantified using freely drawn ROIs. Background fluorescence measured by the same ROIs from areas with no brain tissue was then subtracted to obtain the final fluorescent value. Mean fluorescent values of the indicated neuropil regions in each hemisphere were calculated and normalized to the average value of corresponding controls. Medians of the normalized value are compared between genotypes. The statistical difference was determined by Mann-Whitney U-test using Graphpad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Conservation of amino acid residues between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Neurocalcin and human Hippocalcin was determined using ClustalW2 software for multiple sequence alignment.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;The <italic>Drosophila</italic> dystonia gene homolog <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> facilitates sleep by inhibiting a movement-promoting neural network&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers are in agreement that more experiments need to be done in order to elucidate the role of dopamine in the circuit while one reviewer argues that the circuit is really ill defined. We suggest that you carefully read the reviewers’ comments and if you are willing to resubmit this manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> that you address many of the comments to ensure that the reviewers are satisfied. If you resubmit to <italic>eLife</italic> we will send the manuscript to the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper is well-constructed and well-written. I'm not sure about its relevance for dystonia, and therefore the overall significance and importance. However, it’s easy to read and follow the logic, and I imagine that the findings also have relevance for people interested in circuits and sleep.</p><p>My main comment is to query the importance for dystonia given that there is only a single study linking HPCA to dystonia. The relationship has not been confirmed by multiple groups and/or additional patient cohorts. This should be better explained; some of the dystonia genes mentioned in the Introduction are confirmed as causal, while for others (including HPCA) the causal relationship remains controversial.</p><p>The second issue relating to the relevance for dystonia is that it is difficult to know how this dissection of the fly circuitry that utilizes <italic>Nca</italic> relates to mammalian circuity that is relevant for dystonia. Instead, the most important finding (with respect to to dystonia) is the genetic interaction between <italic>Nca</italic> and the dopamine receptor. This is intriguing, however, I don't feel the data establish that the interaction occurs in individual neurons. Instead, it remains possible that KD of the dopamine receptor promotes sleep through a different set of neurons/ circuit – which would represent an indirect interaction rather than the interpretation implied here (genes acting in a common pathway). This issue should be discussed or (better) solved, particularly given the large number neurons/ circuits that affect sleep. Ideally the authors can test whether RNAi KD of Dop1R1 in CO1 and <italic>A05</italic> neurons is sufficient to rescue sleep defects of <italic>Nca</italic> animals. This would provide strong support for a 'direct' molecular relationship between the genes.</p><p>A final point is to better explain the relationship between the behavioral assays (that monitor frequency of movement) as a pure read out of animal sleep vs. wake. Is a primary defect in sleep the only possible explanation, or could a different primary defect increase/ cause animal movement in the dark cycle? For example, that <italic>Nca</italic> KD/KO impairs animal ability to detect light/dark, or causes an increased need to feed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In general this appears to be a well done paper. But I have two issues.</p><p>1) The genetics is not really up to standard. The authors generated mutants but then only show data from a single homozygosed allele. This is really dangerous. Even &quot;specific&quot; techniques like CRISPR or HR can generate second site mutations. They should show data from a second allele and from transheterozygotes. The fact that the single allele phenocopies RNAi allays a lot of concern, but if you have made the mutants why not use them in a rigorous manner? This is a minor fix to the paper since they report isolating multiple alleles.</p><p>2) The circuit analysis is really unsatisfying and a much bigger problem. I am not sure that there is really a &quot;circuit&quot; since the authors have not actually shown any direct connectivity of the implicated cell groups. It is ill-defined and hand-wavy.</p><p>I also think there are some other possible interpretations of these results that have not been explicated. One thing that I worry about is that they are just screwing up the brain in some non-specific way. One thing that argues against this (and perhaps bears mention in the paper) is that there are a number of very broad drivers (VGluT, GAD, Tim) that apparently do not have effects- this means that the phenotype is not directly proportional to the number of neurons expressing the RNAi. That is good.</p><p>What is less good is that there are other lines that do have phenotype and how those cell groups relate to the A and C lines is not explained. Do they overlap with one or both of these lines? How do they act in combination with these lines? C5GAL4 is a FSB line I think that this neuropil is never mentioned in the context of A and C. Are there multiple &quot;circuits&quot;? Are there hotspots for <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> function? I just am not sure this is very specific.</p><p>One thing authors mention is &quot;neurons that innervate the γ-lobes&quot;. Are these MBON? Have the authors looked at this? If the gene is required in multiple MBONs this might explain the additivity since MBONs are thought to summate. This should probably be explicitly tested.</p><p>I think that until there is a real, connected set of neurons they should not be talking about a circuit. I am not sure that holding the authors to this standard would allow publication of the paper as a revision i.e. there would be too many additional experiments required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting paper that I would be excited to see in print and to recommend to my colleagues – it uses a number of creative approaches to demonstrate a complex, multi-component circuit through which neurocalcin controls sleep. However, because of the broad scope, there are some loose ends that need to be addressed.</p><p>First, the importance of dopamine in this circuit has not been demonstrated. Although panel 2G suggests that Dop1R1 is involved in the loss of nighttime sleep, there are no results which directly show that knockdown of Dop1R1 rescues the sleep loss caused by knockdown of neurocalcin specifically in the <italic>A05/C01</italic> circuit implicated in this paper.</p><p>Second, Figure 5E and F, which test the prediction that &quot;silencing <italic>C01</italic> and <italic>A05</italic> neurons should suppress sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown in flies&quot;, requires some additional controls. The fact that the using <italic>C01/A05</italic> to drive both kk and dOrk results in a significant change from sleep from using these Gal4 drivers to drive dOrk alone suggests that there may be some dilution effects (from having two UAS sequences). To control for this, they need to simultaneously drive knockdown of kk with some other gene with a UAS (such as GFP or synaptophluorin). In addition, they do not show that rescuing neurocalcin in the <italic>A05/C01</italic> circuit alone is sufficient to restore baseline sleep activity.</p><p>Lastly, in Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, an n=3 of triplicated qPCR reactions (representing a single biological sample per timepoint) is not sufficient to draw any conclusions. In order to demonstrate that neurocalcin does not cycle, more biological samples are necessary. However, a lack of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> cycling in the wild type case seems to be tangential to their main point here, that knockdown of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> does not affect rest activity rhythms. Thus, it may be better to remove the panel altogether.</p><p>This paper also focuses extensively on dystonia on a movement disorder, but the data focus primarily on sleep – while the connection between the two is well explained in the last paragraph of the Discussion, revising the Introduction, the description of the results (subsection “NCA promotes sleep by suppressing synaptic output from a wake -promoting circuit”, second paragraph, for instance), and the first paragraph of the Introduction will be helpful for the reader. Alternately, describing locomotor activity in addition to sleep in Figures 2 through 5 (through measurements such as speed and activity counts per minute) will help emphasize locomotion, rather than sleep. In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, activity counts per waking minute should be reported, not total beam breaks.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;<italic>Neurocalcin</italic> regulates nighttime sleep and arousal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Hugo Bellen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vijay Raghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript identifies a novel function for the gene, Neurocalcin (<italic>Nca</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The data presented support a role for <italic>Nca</italic> in specifically promoting nighttime sleep and identify some neurons, predominantly in the mushroom bodies, which are required for this phenotype.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>It has been previously noted that dystonia in humans and sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> share a common molecular pathway. Therefore in an attempt to find new genes that regulate sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the authors began by looking for sleep defects in flies after disrupting the fly homolog of human dystonia associated genes. This led to the identification of <italic>Nca</italic>, as pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of <italic>Nca</italic> caused a significant decrease in the amount of nighttime sleep. This phenotype was confirmed with the use of multiple CRISPR generated alleles which knockout the entire <italic>Nca</italic> coding sequence. Furthermore, <italic>Nca</italic>'s control of sleep/arousal during the 'night' is dependent both on the circadian clock and the ability to sense light. In an attempt to identify the specific neurons that require <italic>Nca</italic> to regulate sleep, they used RNAi to screen a number of GAL4 drivers that expresses in specific neuronal subsets looking for drivers that were able to phenocopy the sleep defect seen with pan-neuronal knockdown. While they did not find a single driver that could phenocopy, they did find that co-expression with <italic>C01</italic> and <italic>A05</italic> drivers (both enhancer GAL4 lines) was able to cause a deficit in nighttime sleep. Both of these drivers are expressed in a subset of mushroom body neurons. Using Synapto-pHluorin as a measure of synaptic release suggested that there was less synaptic release in the AMMC and α/β lobes of the mushroom body with RNAi knockdown of <italic>Nca</italic>. In fact, excitation of the <italic>C01</italic> neurons, using TrpA1, alone can promote wakefulness while silencing both <italic>C01</italic> and <italic>A05</italic> neurons is necessary to suppress the loss of nighttime sleep with <italic>Nca</italic> KD. Together their model suggests that <italic>Nca</italic> regulates synaptic activity in a subset of mushroom body neurons to regulate sleep/arousal.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well written and interesting and will expand our understanding of sleep regulation. The authors have done a good job in addressing the concerns of the reviewers from the initial evaluation. However, many of the conclusions have changed from the original manuscript and therefore, we have a number of suggestions to improve this version of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The story would benefit from a more mechanistic explanation, especially linking the data in Figure 3 to the data in Figure 6. One such experiment would be to manipulate the <italic>A05, C01</italic>, and OK107 knockdowns of neurocalcin (and relevant combinations) in the arousal assay, in DD, and in LL, similar to what was done in Figure 2 and Figure 3A and G for the pan-neuronal knockdown, and possibly combining the LL treatment with some of the functional imaging presented in Figure 5.</p><p>2) While doing the experiments described in (1) would make the story more comprehensive, more detail may be necessary to link the findings related to cryptochrome to the neuronal populations described in Figure 6. Is neurocalcin's response to light also happening within the cryptochrome positive neurons, or are the responses of cryptochrome positive neurons interacting with the populations described in Figure 6 to regulate sleep?</p><p>3) The explanation for Figure 3 is somewhat confusing. Do control flies in the LL case exhibit similar quantities of sleep to neurocalcin knockdown because light inhibits neurocalcin function in the wild type case? This seems unlikely since in the presence of light, the controls do not show a reduction in sleep. The fact that the flies sleep more in constant light than in constant dark also seems extremely unusual.</p><p>4) Which neurons express <italic>Nca</italic> protein, is it really expressed by all neurons as the authors indicate is previously shown? Teng et al., 1994, which is the only report of <italic>Nca</italic> expression in the fly, simply states that <italic>Nca</italic> is expressed &quot;throughout the central nervous system&quot; but only looked at adult brain slices with images that are too low quality to make any claim that all neurons express this protein. Furthermore, do <italic>Nca</italic> protein levels vary between sleep-wake states to explain why it is only important during sleep? Rat and likely other mammalian Hippocalcin antibodies are commercially available, given that the Teng et al. paper successfully used a rat antibody to label fly brains, it would be worth trying one or more of these antibodies both for immunohistochemistry to determine expression pattern and western blots to assess if <italic>Nca</italic> cycles circadian or in response to light/dark.</p><p>5) How does <italic>Nca</italic> inhibit neuronal activity in the context of sleep/wake or light/dark? The previous manuscript suggested it was dopamine receptors, now the Discussion mentions NMDA receptor internalization. Can this be tested genetically and/or by looking at protein localization?</p><p>6) The Results and Discussion points about the distinct roles of <italic>A05</italic> and <italic>C01</italic> (pro-arousal and modulatory, respectively) feel over-interpreted.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neurocalcin regulates nighttime sleep and arousal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Please address these to the best of your ability.</p><p>1) Figure 4H: was the axis label supposed to read &quot;percentage of flies responding to night time stimulus&quot; (rather than daytime stimulus)?</p><p>2) There was a typo in an earlier review when it was requested the authors report the combinations of Gal4 drivers that did not yield negative results. This should have asked what combinations of Gal4 drivers the authors did test, since this kind of negative data is useful for interpreting how exclusive the network of neurons involved is. As it stands, the reason why the <italic>C01</italic> and <italic>A05</italic> Gal4 drivers were chosen as the specific combinations seems a little odd.</p><p>3) Results section, fifth paragraph: &quot;To test whether sleep loss caused by neuronal <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown flies was due to [...]&quot;</p><p>The authors ask if the clock is affected by NCA KD and show constant dark records. Under what light conditions were those flies entrained? It would be useful to also show the activity patterns under LD conditions, preceding release into DD.</p><p>4) The authors test a model of NCA action in <italic>A05</italic> and <italic>C01</italic> neurons in two ways. First with TrpA1 activation. Second with <italic>dORK</italic> silencing. I find the first experiment reasonable, but the second experiment much less compelling. The model postulates that <italic>A05/C01</italic> neuron activity is regulated by NCA and that more activity by those neurons promotes waking and disrupts night time sleep. However, constitutive <italic>dORK</italic> expression is known to irreversibly damage neurons. The <italic>dORK</italic> over-expression experiment shows that the loss of sleep in the <italic>Nca</italic> KD requires <italic>A05/C01</italic> neurons, but does not distinguish between suppression of neuronal activity, or a non-specific decline in neuron health. As I understand it, either outcome could produce the observed result.</p><p>5) &quot;Instead, sleep-relevant NCA activity can largely be localized to two distinct domains of the Drosophila nervous system defined by the <italic>A05</italic>- and <italic>C01</italic>-Gal4 drivers&quot;</p><p>This conclusion is based on spatially limiting the RNAi effects, thus defining brain regions that are necessary. It does not preclude involvement of other regions. Therefore this conclusion over-interprets the data.</p><p>6) Figure 1—figure supplements 2 &amp; 6: the cartoon representations of <italic>Nca</italic> and its immediate neighbor CG7646 are confusing. In supplement 2, <italic>Nca</italic> and CG7646 appear to share two 5'UT exons in common. In supplement 6, CG7646 appears to be distinct and non-overlapping. Which is true? Did the authors test the sleep/activity behaviors of flies with CG7646 KD by RNAi?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neurocalcin regulates nighttime sleep and arousal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at eLife. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are still some remaining issues that need to be addressed with before acceptance. Please make textual changes according to the suggestions of the reviewer as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have addressed all the points raised in the last round of review. For the most part, I feel the responses were appropriate. In some cases, I have continued questions.</p><p>Interpretation of <italic>dORK</italic> effects - The authors make a forceful argument against the possibility of prolonged <italic>dORK</italic> mis-expression causing irreversible developmental effects. They suggest that the lethality observed with driving hid or reaper transgenes contrasts with the viability of driving <italic>dORK</italic> and hence the neurons must be &quot;healthy&quot;. I disagree because such lethality may well result from damage to non-neuronal tissues: the fly-light lines are described for their neural expression patterns, but non-neuronal expression is not generally described or precluded. Hence this result does not bear on the question of neuronal health following prolonged <italic>dORK</italic> expression. Likewise, it is not clear why locomotor activity levels in flies would necessarily be affected if <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic> neurons were partially damaged.</p><p>The use of UAS-shi[ts] in the <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown background is more compelling because it is a conditional design and because it provides a result in line with the hypothesis. However, it is not included in the paper for technical reasons so it cannot stand as a &quot;complete&quot; result, and likewise it cannot serve as a sub-textual proxy to justify inclusion and interpretation of the prolonged <italic>dORK</italic> expression experiment.</p><p>I was wrong in stating the literature documents irreversible damage to <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons with prolonged <italic>dORK</italic> expression and so I agree with the authors in their statement to that regard. However, the literature is clear in documenting the irreversible damage to <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons with prolonged Kir expression, which as shown by White and colleagues, works in comparable fashion to <italic>dORK</italic> by imposing a hyperpolarized state. I suggest the important issue is whether prolonged hyperpolarization of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons is (beyond reasonable doubt) an effective means to exclusively affect neurotransmission. Ceriani and colleagues in 2011 showed that prolonged expression of Kir in LNv pacemaker neurons irreversibly affected molecular oscillations, structural maturation and neuropeptide content. In contrast, restricting Kir expression to adult stages, led to outcomes that were at least partially reversible. Therefore, I hold to the opinion that the present <italic>dORK</italic> experiment is not compelling, in spite of the additional observations provided. If the authors insist on its inclusion, then I think it's important to share with readers a clear caveat based on the Ceriani work.</p><p>Consideration of CG7646 - I appreciate the clarification of the complicated genomic arrangement of CG7646 and <italic>Nca</italic>. It is helpful to know they share 5'UTR sequences but different CDS exons. I think it would be useful to make this point clear in the text - for example on line 111 of the revision, CG7646 is described as a &quot;neighboring&quot; locus. I interpret &quot;neighbor&quot; as independent or free-standing. These two genes are overlapping or in some fashion &quot;compound&quot;. I recommend the text include a clear description of this genomic arrangement and be re-examined to ensure clarity on this point in all mentions. Likewise, I suggest inclusion of the RNAi knockdown results of CG7646 as supplemental information to allay concerns on this point. Regarding that experiment, one other minor point: in the response and author response images, the authors describe using two different RNAi's from NIG. However, my reading of the NIG site indicates availability of only one RNAi for CG7646, albeit offered as a II and III chromosome insertion. The figure leads the reader to think two different RNAis were tested. The text should be clear as to whether the same RNAi at different insertion sites, or different RNAi's were tested.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38114.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, the reviewers are in agreement that more experiments need to be done in order to elucidate the role of dopamine in the circuit while one reviewer argues that the circuit is really ill defined.

Collectively, these have prompted us to strengthen the focus of the paper more appropriately towards the role of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> as a novel sleep gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As noted by reviewer 1, current data suggest that Hippocalcin mutations are rare amongst dystonia patients. In our revised manuscript, we therefore place less emphasis on the potential role of the human <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> homolog Hippocalcin/<italic>HPCA</italic> in dystonia. Correspondingly, we have altered our title to underscore this change of focus, which now reads: ‘Neurocalcin regulates nighttime sleep and arousal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>’.</p><p>Nonetheless, the potential genetic links between human dystonia and <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep were in fact highly relevant to how we initially identified <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> as a sleep gene. For brevity, we initially omitted the actual screening strategy that led us to focus on <italic>Neurocalcin</italic>, but we now describe this in more detail in our Introduction as we believe this approach will be of interest to the community.</p><p>Importantly, our revised manuscript not only addresses the reviewer concerns detailed below but also contains abundant new mechanistic data regarding how Neurocalcin solely promotes night sleep.</p><p>Firstly, in our revised Figure 2, we combine video tracking with mechanical stimulation to probe daytime versus night time arousal in <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown, knockout and respective control flies. We find that knockdown or knockout of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> does not impact the probability of response to a mechanical stimulus during the day (Figure 2A-B, E), but significantly lowers the arousal threshold during the night (Figure 2C-D, F). Arousal thresholds are known to dynamically vary over 24 h in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with day sleep having a lower arousal threshold than night sleep (Faville et al., 2015; van Alphen et al., 2013). However, known genetic regulators of this day/night difference in arousal are scarce. Our identification of Neurocalcin as a specific regulator of night time arousal will therefore be of substantial interest to the sleep field.</p><p>Secondly, we have investigated how this night-specific effect is gated. We show in our revised Figure 3 that both the circadian clock and light are capable of gating <italic>when</italic> Neurocalcin promotes sleep, likely via inhibiting the wake-promoting effect of loss of Neurocalcin during the day. We also present data showing that the CRY blue-light photoreceptor is involved in this process.</p><p>Collectively, these new data combined with alterations to the manuscript significantly enhance both our mechanistic understanding of how Neurocalcin impacts night sleep and the overall robustness of our work. Below, we further respond to each individual reviewer comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper is well-constructed and well-written. I'm not sure about its relevance for dystonia, and therefore the overall significance and importance. However, it’s easy to read and follow the logic, and I imagine that the findings also have relevance for people interested in circuits and sleep.</p><p>My main comment is to query the importance for dystonia given that there is only a single study linking HPCA to dystonia. The relationship has not been confirmed by multiple groups and/or additional patient cohorts. This should be better explained; some of the dystonia genes mentioned in the Introduction are confirmed as causal, while for others (including HPCA) the causal relationship remains controversial.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer. We have therefore made the rare nature of <italic>HPCA</italic> mutations in dystonia clear in both the Introduction (subsection “Identification of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> as a sleep-promoting factor”, second paragraph) and in the Discussion (last paragraph), alongside appropriate references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second issue relating to the relevance for dystonia is that it is difficult to know how this dissection of the fly circuitry that utilizes Nca relates to mammalian circuity that is relevant for dystonia. Instead, the most important finding (wrt to dystonia) is the genetic interaction between Nca and the dopamine receptor. This is intriguing, however, I don't feel the data establish that the interaction occurs in individual neurons. Instead, it remains possible that KD of the dopamine receptor promotes sleep through a different set of neurons/ circuit – which would represent an indirect interaction rather than the interpretation implied here (genes acting in a common pathway). This issue should be discussed or (better) solved, particularly given the large number neurons/ circuits that affect sleep. Ideally the authors can test whether RNAi KD of Dop1R1 in CO1 and A05 neurons is sufficient to rescue sleep defects of Nca animals. This would provide strong support for a 'direct' molecular relationship between the genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a series of experiments to address this important question. However, before describing these, it is relevant to give a brief overview of the particular mutant lines used to examine epistatic interactions between <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> and <italic>Dop1R1.</italic> </p><p>In our initial experiments we used two transposon insertions in the <italic>Dop1R1</italic> locus (on chromosome III of <italic>Drosophila</italic>) as independent alleles that were likely loss-of-function. Due to the known importance of genetic background on sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Cirelli et al., 2005), we swapped chromosomes I and II from these mutant lines with corresponding chromosomes derived from our isogenic iso31 control strain. However, we could not outcross chromosome III itself while easily following the <italic>Dop1R1</italic> alleles themselves, as there was no visible marker within the transposons that could be observed in the iso31 background.</p><p>To both better control for genetic background and achieve cell-specific <italic>Dop1R1</italic> knockdown, we therefore used two complementary approaches. Firstly, we outcrossed a transgenic RNAi line targeting <italic>Dop1R1</italic> for 5 generations into the iso31 background. Secondly, we outcrossed a previously characterised hypomorphic allele of <italic>Dop1R1</italic> called <italic>dumb</italic><sup>2</sup> (Kim et al., 2007), also for 5 generations. However, in contrast to our previous results where heterozygosity for either <italic>Dop1R1</italic> allele rescued sleep loss in <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown flies, neither expression of outcrossed <italic>Dop1R1</italic> RNAi, nor homozygosity for the outcrossed <italic>dumb</italic><sup>2</sup> allele, suppressed the effect of pan-neuronal <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A-D</xref>; original results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1E-F</xref> for reference).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38114.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Sleep loss in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KO</sup> or <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> flies is not modified by altered expression of <italic>Dop1R1</italic>.</title><p>(A-B) Night sleep levels in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> (<italic>elav</italic> &gt; <italic>kk</italic>) adult males co-expressing control UAS<italic>GFP</italic> RNAi (GFP, dashed red lines) are significantly reduced compared to controls (grey lines).However, this profile does not differ from flies co-expressing UAS-<italic>Dop1R1</italic> and <italic>kk</italic> (<italic>Nca</italic>) RNAi (D1, purple lines).

Importantly, despite this removal the overall mechanistic strength of our paper has been strongly enhanced due to our new analyses of how Neurocalcin differentially regulates day/night arousal thresholds and how circadian/light-sensing pathways in turn gate when Neurocalcin impacts sleep, detailed above and in the revised manuscript as Figures 2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A final point is to better explain the relationship between the behavioral assays (that monitor frequency of movement) as a pure read out of animal sleep vs. wake. Is a primary defect in sleep the only possible explanation, or could a different primary defect increase/ cause animal movement in the dark cycle? For example, that Nca KD/KO impairs animal ability to detect light/dark, or causes an increased need to feed?</p></disp-quote><p>Several independent lines of evidence argue for a role for <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> in regulating sleep rather than an independent physiological variable that could cause nighttime hyperactivity.</p><p>Firstly, our new data analysing arousal thresholds in <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown and knockout flies (Figure 2 in our revised manuscript) strongly argue that <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> is acting to specifically modulate the arousal threshold during the night, providing a mechanistic basis by which <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> impacts sleep (described in the subsection “NCA suppresses nighttime arousal”).</p><p>Secondly, the fact that sleep loss in <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown flies only occurs in the subjective night of constant dark conditions (new data presented in Figure 3A in our revised manuscript) shows that loss of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> does not simply cause hyperactivity in the absence of light. Instead, sleep loss is clearly regulated by the circadian clock. This again supports a direct sleep-regulatory role of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic>, since sleep onset is gated by the circadian clock (Borbely, 1982). We have made this point clear in the first paragraph of the subsection “Light-sensing and circadian pathways define when NCA promotes sleep”.</p><p>Finally, the clear and sustained startle-responses to lights-off in <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockout males (Figure 1N, O of revised manuscript) also strongly suggests that these mutants are able to detect the absence of light.</p><p>We cannot fully rule out the possibility that <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> regulates hunger specifically during the night, but this hunger would have to be gated by the clock and light in such a way that it was suppressed during constant light conditions, as we observe no sleep loss in <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown flies under this condition (see Figure 3G, H in revised text). We consider it far more likely that <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> is indeed a bona fide sleep-promoting gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In general this appears to be a well done paper. But I have two issues.</p><p>1) The genetics is not really up to standard. The authors generated mutants but then only show data from a single homozygosed allele. This is really dangerous. Even &quot;specific&quot; techniques like CRISPR or HR can generate second site mutations. They should show data from a second allele and from transheterozygotes. The fact that the single allele phenocopies RNAi allays a lot of concern, but if you have made the mutants why not use them in a rigorous manner? This is a minor fix to the paper since they report isolating multiple alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point we have now measured sleep levels in three additional combinations of <italic>Nca</italic> knockout alleles (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). Homozygosity for the <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KO2</sup> allele or trans-heterozygous combinations between the <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KO1</sup> allele and either <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KO2</sup> or <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KO3</sup> all exhibited significant reductions in night sleep (Figure 1—figure supplement 6A, B). Thus, in total we have shown using <italic>four</italic> combinations of <italic>Nca</italic> knockout alleles and <italic>three</italic> independent <italic>Nca</italic> RNAi lines that reducing NCA expression consistently results in night-specific sleep loss. Collectively, these results robustly support a role for NCA in regulating night sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The circuit analysis is really unsatisfying and a much bigger problem. I am not sure that there is really a &quot;circuit&quot; since the authors have not actually shown any direct connectivity of the implicated cell groups. It is ill-defined and hand-wavy.</p><p>I also think there are some other possible interpretations of these results that have not been explicated. One thing that I worry about is that they are just screwing up the brain in some non-specific way. One thing that argues against this (and perhaps bears mention in the paper) is that there are a number of very broad drivers (VGluT, GAD, Tim) that apparently do not have effects- this means that the phenotype is not directly proportional to the number of neurons expressing the RNAi. That is good.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown in several broad neuronal subsets argues against a generalised neuronal dysfunction, and have made this point more explicit in the revised text (subsection “NCA acts in two neuronal subpopulations to promote night sleep”, third paragraph). The fact that we have narrowed down <italic>Neurocalcin’s</italic> sleep-relevant activity to approximately 350 neurons argues against a generalised ‘neuropathy-like’ effect of <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown/knockout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is less good is that there are other lines that do have phenotype and how those cell groups relate to the A and C lines is not explained. Do they overlap with one or both of these lines? How do they act in combination with these lines? C5GAL4 is a FSB line I think that this neuropil is never mentioned in the context of A and C. Are there multiple &quot;circuits&quot;? Are there hotspots for Neurocalcin function? I just am not sure this is very specific.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, in our mini-screen of individual neuronal subpopulations, there was no subset in which <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> knockdown resulted in night sleep loss, including <italic>C5</italic>Gal4 and two other FSB-positive driver lines (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 of revised manuscript). We believe the colour scheme in our original figure may have been slightly confusing, so we have changed the colour-coding and the text within the figure accordingly to emphasise that <italic>only Neurocalcin</italic> RNAi driven by <italic>elav</italic>-, <italic>nsyb</italic>- and <italic>inc</italic>-Gal4 yielded significant sleep loss relative to both driver and transgene alone controls.</p><p>Although we have narrowed the number of neurons in which <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> acts to impact sleep from &gt; 100000 to approximately 350, it is clear from our results that <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> is required in multiple neuronal regions. This is consistent with many studies of sleep genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including <italic>sleepless</italic>, <italic>insomniac</italic>, <italic>taranis</italic> and <italic>cyclin-A</italic>, all of which failed to identify a single neuropil region that fully accounted for sleep loss in these mutants. We note that previously studied sleep regions such as the fan-shaped body (Donlea et al., 2011), large LN<sub>v</sub> neurons (Parisky et al., 2008; Shang et al., 2008), and ellipsoid body (Liu et al., 2016), are not present in either <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05-</italic>neurons, suggesting novel sleep-regulatory circuits are present within these expression domains. Identifying these subdomains will be a fruitful avenue of future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One thing authors mention is &quot;neurons that innervate the γ-lobes&quot;. Are these MBON? Have the authors looked at this? If the gene is required in multiple MBONs this might explain the additivity since MBONs are thought to summate. This should probably be explicitly tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting question. To properly clarify the involvement of MBONs in <italic>Nca</italic><sup>KD</sup> mediated sleep loss, a detailed investigation of the overlap between MBONs (Aso et al., 2014) and <italic>R14A05</italic>- (<italic>A05-</italic>) or <italic>R72C01-</italic>positive (<italic>C01</italic>-) neurons via orthogonal labelling will be required. However, this approach is currently unavailable to us due to the lack of <italic>A05</italic>-LexA or <italic>C01</italic>-LexA driver lines that could be combined with MBON-Gal4 lines.</p><p>Nonetheless, since we observed no clear difference between our own images of <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-Gal4 expression within the MB region (Figure 4A, C) and those acquired by the Janelia Flylight team (Jenett et al., 2012), we used the standardised published images available from Virtual Fly Brain (www.virtualflybrain.org) to digitally examine the overlap between <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-Gal4 in the MB region (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A).</p><p>Using this approach, it is clear that <italic>A05</italic>- and <italic>C01</italic>-Gal4 label the α’β’ and αβ lobes of MB intrinsic Kenyon cells respectively (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). We also observed potential labelling of β’1γ3 MBONs by <italic>C01</italic>-Gal4, while β’1-2 and γ1-2 MBONs may be labelled by <italic>A05</italic>-Gal4. Finally, despite lacking their characteristic tiling pattern (Aso et al., 2014), we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>A05</italic>- and <italic>C01</italic>-Gal4 express in the α1-3 or α’1-3 MBONs (Aso et al., 2014).</p><p>In our original manuscript, we combined the pan-MB driver <italic>ok107</italic>-Gal4 with <italic>A05</italic>Gal4 to show that <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown in all MB KCs and potentially components of α’β’ and γ1-2 MBONs neurons (<italic>A05/ok107</italic> &gt; <italic>kk</italic>) causes modest but significant night sleep loss (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2C</xref>). We have now combined <italic>ok107</italic>-Gal4 with <italic>C01</italic>-Gal4 to show that <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown in all MB KCs potentially alongside β’1 γ3 MBONs (<italic>C01</italic>/<italic>ok107</italic> &gt; kk) has no impact on night sleep (Figure 5—figure supplement 2G).

These findings suggest that MB-KCs as well as parts of the α’1-3, β2’ and γ1-2 MBONs may modestly contribute to <italic>Nca</italic>-mediated sleep, while the β’1γ3 MBONs are likely not involved.</p><p>We have set out to further examine this hypothesis as a separate follow-up project by using <italic>A05</italic>-Gal4 in parallel with an array of defined MBON split-Gal4 drivers. Initially, we reduced <italic>Nca</italic> levels in β’1γ3, γ2α’1 and α2p MBONs alone.

Although panel 2G suggests that Dop1R1 is involved in the loss of nighttime sleep, there are no results which directly show that knockdown of Dop1R1 rescues the sleep loss caused by knockdown of neurocalcin specifically in the A05/C01 circuit implicated in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to perform cell-specific knockdown experiments to examine this interesting question. However, as described above and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, due to inconsistencies between different <italic>Dop1R1</italic> alleles and RNAi lines (likely due to differences in genetic background) we have decided to remove the data shown originally in Figure 2 describing a genetic interaction between <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> and <italic>Dop1R1</italic>. To compensate, we now add substantial <italic>mechanistic</italic> data revealing a specific role for Neurocalcin in regulating arousal during the night but not the day, and illustrating a dual role for circadian and light-sensing pathways in gating the timing of this effect (presented as Figures 2 and 3 in revised text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, Figure 5E and F, which test the prediction that &quot;silencing C01 and A05 neurons should suppress sleep loss in Nca knockdown in flies&quot;, requires some additional controls.

To control for this, they need to simultaneously drive knockdown of kk with some other gene with a UAS (such as GFP or synaptophluorin).</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the silencing experiment using UAS-FRT-stop-FRTCD8::GFP as an irrelevant control transgene expressed alongside <italic>Neurocalcin</italic> RNAi (Figure 8E, F).

Given that male flies exhibit more daytime sleep compared to females (i.e. sleep during the light phase), this may contribute to the difference between our work and previous studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Which neurons express Nca protein, is it really expressed by all neurons as the authors indicate is previously shown? Teng et al., 1994, which is the only report of Nca expression in the fly, simply states that Nca is expressed &quot;throughout the central nervous system&quot; but only looked at adult brain slices with images that are too low quality to make any claim that all neurons express this protein. Furthermore, do Nca protein levels vary between sleep-wake states to explain why it is only important during sleep? Rat and likely other mammalian Hippocalcin antibodies are commercially available, given that the Teng et al. paper successfully used a rat antibody to label fly brains, it would be worth trying one or more of these antibodies both for immunohistochemistry to determine expression pattern and western blots to assess if Nca cycles circadian or in response to light/dark.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the NCA immuno-staining published in Teng et al., 1994, does not provide enough resolution to accurately define the precise expression pattern of NCA in the fly brain.</p><p>We undertook several independent approaches to attempt to fill this knowledge gap. We initially combined injection of two NCA peptide fragments (KIFRQMDRNKDGKLS and KMPEDESTPEKRTDK) in rabbits to raise a new NCA antibody (antibody service, Eurogentec inc). However, using these custom antibodies we were unable to detect NCA protein in the fly brain by western blot or immuno-staining.</p><p>Since the antibody generated by Teng et al. is raised against <italic>Drosophila</italic> full-length NCA (see Teng et al., 1994, Methods), we contacted the authors to request this antibody. However, we were unable to obtain this antibody. We also followed the reviewers’ suggestion to use an antibody against full-length human Hippocalcin (ab168214, Abcam plc UK), which is suitable for Immunohistochemistry. Unfortunately, we did not detect NCA-specific signals in the fly brain with this antibody.</p><p>Because of these technical constraints, we have been unable to characterise the expression pattern of NCA in the fly brain, and have therefore amended to text to state that NCA is ‘expressed in synaptic regions throughout the fly brain’ rather than ‘expressed in all neurons’.</p><p>We are in the process of generating knock-in flies with V5-tagged NCA under the control of the endogenous <italic>Nca</italic> promoter, which will enable the cellular and sub-cellular expression of NCA to be defined in detail.

This should have asked what combinations of Gal4 drivers the authors did test, since this kind of negative data is useful for interpreting how exclusive the network of neurons involved is. As it stands, the reason why the C01 and A05 Gal4 drivers were chosen as the specific combinations seems a little odd.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added negative data from eight additional combinations of driver lines to Figure 4—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>We chose these combinations, as well as the <italic>C01/A05</italic> driver combination, in a hypothesis-based manner. Firstly, we posited that dopaminergic circuits (either dopamine-releasing (<italic>ple</italic>-Gal4) or Dop1R1-expressing (<italic>C01</italic>-Gal4 and <italic>R72B07</italic>-Gal4) neurons) might be involved in the regulation of sleep by NCA, since these circuits are known to influence sleep/wakefulness in Drosophila (Kume et al., (2005); Ueno et al., (2012); Liu et al., (2012)). Secondly, since light-sensing pathways modulates the wakefulness in <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown flies, we investigated two circuits that transmit light information: tubercular-bulbar neurons, subsets of which we and others have demonstrated are sleep promoting (Lamaze et al., (2018); Guo et al., (2018)), and cry-expressing neurons. Tubercular-bulbar neurons are labelled by the <italic>A05</italic>-Gal4 driver and additional drivers shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>Of these combinations, only expression of <italic>Nca</italic> RNAi in <italic>C01/A05</italic>-neurons reduced night sleep, suggesting that NCA expression within specific neuronal components of the <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-Gal4 domains regulate night sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results section, fifth paragraph: &quot;To test whether sleep loss caused by neuronal Nca knockdown flies was due to [...]&quot;</p><p>The authors ask if the clock is affected by NCA KD and show constant dark records.

First with TrpA1 activation. Second with dORK silencing. I find the first experiment reasonable, but the second experiment much less compelling. The model postulates that A05/C01 neuron activity is regulated by NCA and that more activity by those neurons promotes waking and disrupts night time sleep. However, constitutive dORK expression is known to irreversibly damage neurons. The dORK over-expression experiment shows that the loss of sleep in the Nca KD requires A05/C01 neurons, but does not distinguish between suppression of neuronal activity, or a non-specific decline in neuron health. As I understand it, either outcome could produce the observed result.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate the reviewer’s concerns regarding the potential of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 to damage neurons, we have been unable to find evidence in the prior literature for an irreversible damage of neurons by expression of this transgene. In contrast, multiple lines of evidence indicate that <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 does not alter neuronal development or formation of synaptic contacts. For example, Nitabach et al., (2002) showed that expression of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 in PDF-expressing clock neurons (the s-LN<sub>v</sub>s) does not alter their development or axonal path-finding. Similarly, Kremer et al., (2010) showed that expression of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 in olfactory projection neurons suppresses action potential firing but does not impact expression of the active zone protein Bruchpilot or prevent their proper synaptic innervation of the mushroom body calyx region. We further note that <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 has previously been used to study sleep circuitry in Drosophila (for example, Tabuchi et al., (2015)).</p><p>Nonetheless, we have attempted to allay the reviewer’s concerns by investigating whether the phenotypes associated with silencing of <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons with <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 are consistent with ‘irreversible damage’ to these cells.</p><p>Firstly, as a positive control to assess the impact of damaging <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>- neurons, we expressed the pro-apoptotic genes <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic> in either <italic>C01</italic>- or <italic>A05</italic>-neurons alone. Inducing cell death in either population resulted in 100% lethality prior to the adult stage. In stark contrast, expression of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 in both <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons simultaneously had no apparent impact on adult-stage viability.</p><p>Secondly, we complemented the above experiment by re-analysing our sleep data to determine whether expression of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons impacted adult locomotor patterns. Since ablation of <italic>C01</italic>- or <italic>A05</italic>-neurons is lethal, if <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 indeed resulted in partial yet irreversible damage, we would likely observe an effect on locomotor patterns despite the viability of these flies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig9">Author response image 9A-B</xref> shows activity patterns of otherwise wildtype iso31 flies expressing <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons compared to driver and transgene alone controls. Expression of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons did not impact overall activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig9">Author response image 9A</xref>) or peak activity levels at ZT8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig9">Author response image 9B</xref>). These results are inconsistent with the postulate of <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 causing irreversible damage to <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons.</p><p>Thirdly, we complemented our experiments with constitutive <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 expression by expressing a temperature-sensitive inhibitor of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (<italic>shi</italic>[ts]) in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons alongside the kk <italic>Nca</italic> RNAi construct.

Our <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 results predict that this manipulation should inhibit sleep loss due to <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown. However, if this phenotype was solely due to a non-specific decline in neuronal health rather than an inhibition of synaptic release, we would expect acute silencing of <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons to have no impact on sleep levels following <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig9">Author response image 9C-D</xref>, compared to control flies expressing an FRT-stop-FRT-GFP transgene, expression of <italic>shi</italic>[ts] alongside <italic>kk Nca</italic> RNAi significantly increases sleep levels at 31ºC, suggesting that <italic>Nca</italic> is required acutely to regulate sleep in <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons.</p><p>We note that night sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is strongly reduced at 31ºC (Lamaze et al., (2017)), likely limiting the rescuing effect <italic>shi</italic>[ts].

Ceriani and colleagues in 2011 showed that prolonged expression of Kir in LNv pacemaker neurons irreversibly affected molecular oscillations, structural maturation and neuropeptide content. In contrast, restricting Kir expression to adult stages, led to outcomes that were at least partially reversible. Therefore, I hold to the opinion that the present dORK experiment is not compelling, in spite of the additional observations provided. If the authors insist on its inclusion, then I think it's important to share with readers a clear caveat based on the Ceriani work.</p></disp-quote><p>We respect the reviewer’s concerns regarding potential detrimental effects of constitutive <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 and have endeavoured to modify the text accordingly to include such a caveat.</p><p>Regarding the work by Ceriani and colleagues (Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011), the authors of this manuscript show that prolonged (but not acute) Kir2.1 expression impacts molecular clock oscillations in PDF neurons. Yet importantly, they also show that action potential firing in adult PDF neurons constitutively expressing Kir2.1 can be acutely restored to wild-type levels by application of 200 µM Ba2+, a Kir2.1 channel blocker (see Figure 2B, Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011). From this, the authors conclude the following: “Therefore, these results demonstrate that both transient and persistent expression of kir2.1 reliably abolish firing of PDF neurons <italic>without affecting their viability</italic>” (our italics). Given this conclusion, we hope the reviewer understands that we are reticent to cite this manuscript as evidence that prolonged Kir2.1 expression impacts neuronal viability.</p><p>However, the same authors indeed later postulate that prolonged Kir2.1 expression may “ultimately impinge on cell viability” (Discussion). Yet the data shown in this manuscript solely pertains to the function of the circadian oscillator, and there is no evidence presented of an effect of Kir2.1 on noncircadian cellular processes critical for neuronal viability.</p><p>Combined with data from Nitabach et al., (2012) (see Figure 2), the current literature suggests that prolonged Kir2.1 expression in PDF neurons does not impact either their ability to fire action potentials nor their development or axon guidance. We also note that other work from the Nitabach lab (Figure 1, Wu et al., (2008)) indicates that <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 reduces the resting membrane potential of PDF neurons by ~ 16 mV while Kir2.1 reduces RMP by ~ 27 mV. Thus, the <italic>dORK</italic>-∆C2 transgene that we use has a subtler effect on neuronal excitability compared to Kir2.1.</p><p>Nonetheless, the reviewer is correct that there is evidence in the literature for a negative impact of constitutive expression of specific ion channels on the viability of certain neuronal subtypes. For example, Nadeau et al., (2000) showed that Kir1.1 expression induces apoptosis of mammalian hippocampal neurons. We have therefore inserted the following text in the Discussion that cites both Nadeau et al., and Depetris-Chauvin et al., 2011 and includes caveats regarding constitutive ion channel expression. We hope the reviewer finds this alteration acceptable.</p><p>“Ex vivo imaging demonstrates that <italic>Nca</italic> knockdown enhances synaptic output from subsets of <italic>C01</italic>- and <italic>A05</italic>-neurons innervating the MB αβ-lobes and the AMMC.

It is helpful to know they share 5'UTR sequences but different CDS exons. I think it would be useful to make this point clear in the text - for example on line 111 of the revision, CG7646 is described as a &quot;neighboring&quot; locus. I interpret &quot;neighbor&quot; as independent or free-standing. These two genes are overlapping or in some fashion &quot;compound&quot;. I recommend the text include a clear description of this genomic arrangement and be re-examined to ensure clarity on this point in all mentions. Likewise, I suggest inclusion of the RNAi knockdown results of CG7646 as supplemental information to allay concerns on this point. Regarding that experiment, one other minor point: in the response and author response images, the authors describe using two different RNAi's from NIG. However, my reading of the NIG site indicates availability of only one RNAi for CG7646, albeit offered as a II and III chromosome insertion. The figure leads the reader to think two different RNAis were tested. The text should be clear as to whether the same RNAi at different insertion sites, or different RNAi's were tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the text to emphasise that <italic>cg7646</italic> and <italic>Nca</italic> share common 5’ regulatory elements and removed any description of the two loci as ‘neighboring’.
