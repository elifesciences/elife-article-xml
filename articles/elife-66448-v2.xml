We sequenced 166 mumps virus genomes collected in Washington and other US states, and traced mumps introductions and transmission within Washington. We uncover that mumps was introduced into Washington approximately 13 times, primarily from Arkansas, sparking multiple co-circulating transmission chains. Although age and vaccination status may have impacted transmission, our data set could not quantify their precise effects. Instead, the outbreak in Washington was overwhelmingly sustained by transmission within the Marshallese community. Our findings underscore the utility of genomic data to clarify epidemiologic factors driving transmission and pinpoint contact networks as critical for mumps transmission. These results imply that contact structures and historic disparities may leave populations at increased risk for respiratory virus disease even when a vaccine is effective and widely used.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mumps virus</kwd><kwd>genomic epidemiology</kwd><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1256082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>Allison</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moncla</surname><given-names>Louise H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM119774-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ORIP S10OD028685</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social networks can be the primary risk factor for mumps infection and transmission, regardless of age and vaccination status.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2016 and 2017, mumps virus swept the United States in the country’s largest outbreak since the pre-vaccine era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">CDCMMWR, 2019</xref>). Washington State was heavily affected, reporting 889 confirmed and probable cases. Longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidkin et al., 2008</xref>), epidemiologic outbreak investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardemil et al., 2017</xref>), and epidemic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewnard and Grad, 2018</xref>) suggest that mumps vaccine-induced immunity wanes over 13–30 years, consistent with the preponderance of young adult cases in recent outbreaks. Like with other recent mumps outbreaks, most Washington cases in 2016/17 were vaccinated. Unusually though, while most US outbreaks in 2016/2017 were associated with university settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonwitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donahue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Golwalkar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iowa Mumps Outbreak Response Team et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wohl et al., 2020</xref>), incidence in Washington was highest among children aged 10–18 years, younger than expected given waning immunity. The outbreak was also peculiar in that approximately 52% of the total cases were Marshallese, an ethnic community that comprises ~0.3% of Washington’s population. These same phenomena were also observed in Arkansas. Of the 2954 confirmed and probable Arkansas cases, 57% were Marshallese, and 57% of cases were children aged 5–17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields et al., 2019</xref>). Among the infected school-aged children in Arkansas and Washington, &gt;90% had previously received two doses of MMR vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields et al., 2019</xref>). The high proportion of vaccinated cases, younger-than-expected age at infection, disproportionate impact on the Marshallese community, and epidemiologic link to Arkansas suggest that factors beyond waning immunity are necessary to explain mumps transmission during this outbreak in Washington.</p><p>The US and the Marshall Islands are closely linked through a history that continues to impact the health of US-residing Marshallese to this day. Between 1947 and 1986, the United States occupied the Republic of Marshall Islands and detonated the equivalent of &gt;7000 Hiroshima size nuclear bombs as part of its nuclear testing program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker, 2012</xref>). The effects were devastating, precipitating widespread environmental destruction, nuclear contamination, and dire health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hallgren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niedenthal, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Palafox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Simon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takahashi et al., 1997</xref>). Marshallese individuals inhabiting the targeted atolls were forcibly moved to other islands, and many were exposed to nuclear fallout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2019</xref>) that persists on the Islands today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bordner et al., 2016</xref>). Significant concern remains within the community regarding long-term health impacts of nuclear exposure and its potential impacts on immune function. Marshallese individuals living on and off the Islands experience significant health disparities including a higher burden from infectious diseases and chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yamada et al., 2004</xref>). Compounding these disparities, from 1996 to 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirono, 2019</xref>), Marshallese individuals were specifically excluded from Medicaid eligibility despite legal residency in the US permitted under the Compact of Free Association (COFA) Treaty. As a result, many US-residing Marshallese are uninsured, with poor access to healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McElfish et al., 2015</xref>). Marshallese households are more likely to be multigenerational and tend to be larger on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris and Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">US Census Bureau, 2021</xref>), potentially increasing the number and intensity of interactions among individuals. These factors combined mean that Marshallese individuals may be at increased risk of respiratory virus infection.</p><p>Clarifying the determinants of infectious disease transmission is important for prioritizing prevention and mitigation resources. However, sampling bias presents a persistent challenge for elucidating source-sink dynamics from genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Maio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frost et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kühnert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stack et al., 2010</xref>), which may undermine the utility of genomic epidemiological studies in some situations. Here, we formulate a set of genomic epidemiological approaches that are robust to sampling frame and apply them to investigate patterns of mumps transmission in Washington. We sequenced 110 mumps viral genomes obtained from specimens collected from laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in Washington State and another 56 from other US states collected between 2006 and 2018. We employ a novel application of phylogeographic methods to detailed epidemiologic data on age, vaccination status, and community membership, and develop a new statistic for quantifying transmission in the tree. By combining these phylodynamic approaches with community health advocate interviews that contextualize our results, we provide a framework for investigating viral transmission dynamics that is sensitive to community health priorities and readily applicable to other viral pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Outbreak characteristics and data set composition</title><p>We generated genome sequences for 110 PCR-positive mumps samples collected throughout Washington State during 2016/2017, and 56 samples collected in Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri, Alabama, and North Carolina between 2006 and 2018 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The Washington State outbreak began in October 2016 and peaked in winter of 2017, culminating in 889 confirmed and probable cases across Washington (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Individuals aged &lt;1 to 64 years were affected, but incidence was highest among children aged 10–14 (44.9 cases per 100,000) and 15–19 (47.0 per 100,000) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Among outbreak cases 5–19 years of age, 91% of individuals were considered up-to-date on mumps vaccine. Adults in the age group most likely to be parents of school aged children (20–39 years old) were infected at a rate of only 12.9 cases per 100,000, but comprised a significant proportion (29%) of total cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). While Marshallese individuals comprise only ~0.3% of Washington’s total population, they accounted for 52% of reported mumps cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Among Marshallese cases aged 5–19, 93% were up-to-date on vaccination, suggesting that this over-representation is not attributable to poor vaccine coverage.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genomic sampling covers the duration of the outbreak.</title><p>The first mumps case in Washington was reported on October 30, 2016, and case counts peaked in the winter of 2017.

Sequences from samples collected between 2006 and 2014 clustered with other North American mumps viruses sampled from the same times. Nine Washington sequences were highly divergent from other North American genotype G viruses, with a time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of ~22 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, blue tips with long branches clustered toward the top of the tree). To place these genomes in context, we built a divergence tree using all publicly available global full genome mumps sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Seven of these divergent Washington sequences cluster with viruses sampled from New Zealand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting they could be travel-related. The other two sequences cluster with other divergent genotype G viruses sampled from geographically disparate locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The remaining Washington sequences nest within the diversity of other North American viruses, and descend from the same mumps lineage that has circulated in North America since 2006 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We observe substantial geographic mixing along the tree. While viruses from the northeast (teal tips and branches) seeded outbreaks in the Northeast and Midwest, we also infer transmission from the Northeast to Southern US states and British Columbia. Despite the close geographic proximity between British Columbia and Washington, most British Columbia sequences form a distinct cluster on a long branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting seeding from an unsampled location. Although viruses from Washington are scattered throughout the phylogeny, most cluster within a clade of viruses sampled in Arkansas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>North American mumps outbreaks are related.</title><p>We combined all publicly available North American mumps genomes and built a time-resolved phylogeny. We inferred geographic transmission history between each US state and Canadian province using a discrete trait model, but have grouped these locations into regions for plotting purposes. A tree colored by the full geographic transmission history across all 27 locations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Here, we display the maximum clade credibility tree, where color represents geographic location. We grouped the US states by geography as follows: non-Washington West include California and Montana; Midwest USA includes North Dakota, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois; South USA includes North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana; Northeast USA includes New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Canadian provinces are also grouped by geographic area. The x-axis represents the collection date (for tips), or the inferred time to the most recent common ancestor (for internal nodes). The internal node coloring represents the sum of the posterior probabilities for each inferred geographic division within the most probable region. For example, since we group Manitoba and Ontario into the same Canadian region, if a node was inferred with highest probability to circulate in Manitoba, then the node would be colored red to represent that Canadian region. The opacity of the color then corresponds to the sum of the probabilities that the node circulated in Manitoba or that the node circulated in Ontario. The posterior probability is expressed by the color gradient, where increasingly gray tone represents decreasing certainty of the inferred geographic state. The ancestral state at the root was poorly resolved and is therefore colored mostly gray.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata1"><label>Figure 2—source data 1.</label><caption><title>XML file to run discrete trait phylogeographic analysis of North American mumps transmission shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, with combined mcc tree and output log files.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66448-fig2-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig2sdata2"><label>Figure 2—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Divergence trees with metadata for divergence trees shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66448-fig2-data2-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66448-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Mumps genomes accumulate mutations linearly over time.</title><p>We inferred a maximum likelihood phylogeny using IQTREE for all available complete mumps genomes of genotype G, sampled from North America between 2006 and 2018. We inferred the root-to-tip distance with TempEst and plot the root to tip divergence vs. sample collection date.

In addition to the nine highly divergent Washington tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), we detect one introduction from Massachusetts that descends from a long branch. Prior to being sampled in Washington, this lineage was last inferred to circulate in Massachusetts in late 2015. Thus rather than representing a direct introduction from Massachusetts to Washington, this lineage likely moved through other geographic locations that lack genomic sampling. We infer introductions from Ontario and Missouri that each lead to one to three sampled cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting limited onward transmission following these introductions. In contrast, four introductions from Arkansas account for 92/110 sequenced cases, suggesting that these introductions led to more sustained chains of transmission following introduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We refer to the largest cluster as the ‘primary outbreak clade', and infer its introduction from Arkansas to Washington around August 2016 (August 7, 2016, 95% HPD: July 11, 2016 to September 19, 2016, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), 3.5 months before Washington’s first reported case.

Phylogenetic reconstruction links the outbreaks in Washington and Arkansas, placing most sampled mumps genomes in Washington as descendant from Arkansas. We sought to investigate how mumps transmission may have differed within Marshallese and non-Marshallese communities within the same outbreak. Phylogenetic trees reflect the transmission process and can be used to quantify differences in transmission patterns among population groups. If transmission rates were distinct between Marshallese and non-Marshallese mumps cases, we would expect the following: 1. Sequences from the high-transmitting group should be more frequently detected upstream in transmission chains. 2. Introductions seeded into the high-transmitting group should result in larger and more diverse clades in the tree. 3. The internal nodes of the phylogeny should be predominantly composed by members of the high-transmitting group, while members of the low-transmitting group should primarily be found at terminal nodes, since less propagated transmission will cause the lineage to die out.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Marshallese cases are enriched upstream in transmission chains</title><p>We developed a transmission metric to quantify whether Marshallese cases were enriched at the beginnings of successful transmission chains. We traverse the full genome divergence phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) from root to tip. When we encounter a tip that lies on an internal node, we enumerate the number of tips that descend from its parent node. We then classify each tip in the phylogeny as either a ‘basal tip’ (i.e., there are tips detected downstream of that tip) or a ‘terminal tip’ (there are not tips detected downstream), and compare the proportion of basal and terminal tips among groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, see Materials and methods for more details). Given our sampling proportion (110 sequences/889 total cases, ~12%), we do not expect to have captured true parent/child infection pairs. Rather, we expect to have preferentially sampled long, successful transmission chains within the state. This allowed us to test whether community membership, vaccination status, and age were associated with sustained transmission via logistic regression (see Materials and methods for details and statistical model). While those with unknown vaccination status were more likely to be basal in the tree than those with known up-to-date vaccination, the confidence interval could not exclude a null or positive association between vaccination status and basal/terminal status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Having an age of at least 20 years predicted a mean lowered odds of being basal in the tree, but a wide range of effects is plausible given our sample. Resolving the precise effects of vaccination status and age would likely require a larger data set. However, we do find evidence for community status as a strong predictor for being basal on the phylogeny. Marshallese cases were significantly more likely to be basal than non-Marshallese cases (odds ratio = 3.2, p=0.00725, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While only 27% (14/52) of non-Marshallese tips were ancestral to downstream samples, 56% (32/57) of Marshallese tips were ancestral in lineages with sampled propagated transmission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

We inferred the number of Washington-associated clades in the tree as a function of whether sampled infections came from Marshallese or non-Marshallese individuals. Using the full North American phylogeny, we removed all Washington sequences and separated them into viruses sampled from cases noted as Marshallese or non-Marshallese. Then, separately for each group, we added sequences back into the tree one by one, until all sequences for that group had been added. For each number of sequences, we performed 10 independent trials (see Materials and methods for complete details), and at each step, we enumerated the number of inferred Washington clusters in the phylogeny. For comparison, we also grouped tips by vaccination status and repeated this analysis.</p><p>For viruses sampled from non-Marshallese individuals, the number of inferred clusters increases linearly as tips are added to the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This suggests that these infections are not closely related and are therefore not part of sustained transmission chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In contrast, the number of inferred clusters for Marshallese tips stabilizes after ~10 tips are added, even as almost 50 more sequences are added to the tree. This pattern likely arises because many Marshallese infections are part of the same long transmission chain, such that newly added tips nest within existing clusters. We do not observe similar differences among vaccination groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings are consistent with distinct patterns of transmission among Marshallese versus non-Marshallese cases: transmission among Marshallese individuals resulted in a small number of large clusters, while transmission among non-Marshallese individuals are generally the result of disparate introductions that generate shorter transmission chains.</p><p>We next separated each Washington introduction and colored each tip by community membership. Every introduction that was not seeded from Arkansas led to exclusively non-Marshallese infections, while introductions from Arkansas defined lineages that circulated for longer and were enriched with Marshallese tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The primary outbreak clade is particularly enriched, containing 43 Marshallese tips and 26 non-Marshallese tips, hinting that transmission chains are longer when Marshallese cases are present in a cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mumps transmitted efficiently within the Marshallese community</title><p>Internal nodes on a phylogeny represent ancestors to subsequently sampled tips, while terminal nodes represent viral infections that did not give rise to sampled progeny. If the mumps outbreak was primarily sustained by transmission within one group, the backbone of the phylogeny and the majority of internal nodes should be inferred as circulating in that group. We selected the four introductions that contained both Marshallese and non-Marshallese tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, the four Arkansas introductions), and reconstructed ancestral states along the phylogeny and migration/transmission rates between Marshallese and non-Marshallese groups using a structured coalescent model.</p><p>Of 88 internal nodes, 74 were inferred to circulate within the Marshallese community with posterior probability of at least 0.95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>).

This suggests that transmission was overwhelmingly maintained within the Marshallese community, and that infections seeded into the non-Marshallese community did not sustain prolonged transmission chains. We estimate substantially more transmission from Marshallese to non-Marshallese groups than the opposite: within the primary outbreak clade, we estimate 29 transmission events from Marshallese to non-Marshallese groups (95% HPD: 21, 37), and only 6 (95% HPD: 0, 14) from non-Marshallese to Marshallese groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). This strongly suggests that transmission predominantly occurred in one direction: transmission events leading to non-Marshallese infections usually died out and did not typically re-seed circulation within the Marshallese community.

We colored the tips of all Washington cases in our phylogeny to represent whether they were derived from individuals who were up-to-date, not up-to-date, or whose vaccination status was unknown.

While many studies have used phylodynamic approaches to elucidate viral patterns of geographic spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dudas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grubaugh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stapleton et al., 2019</xref>), using genomics to distinguish transmission patterns among epidemiologically distinct groups is novel. We employ a phylogenetic method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>) traditionally applied to geography that is robust to sampling bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudas et al., 2018</xref>) to investigate drivers of mumps transmission in Washington. We show that the Washington State outbreak was fueled by approximately 13 independent introductions, primarily from Arkansas, leading to multiple co-circulating transmission chains. Within Washington, transmission was more efficient within the Marshallese community. Marshallese individuals were more often sampled at the beginnings of transmission chains, contributed to longer transmission chains on average, and were overwhelmingly enriched on internal nodes within the phylogeny. We were unable to evaluate the precise effects of age and vaccination status on transmission in our outbreak. Future, larger studies will be necessary to disentangle the interplay between contact patterns, waning immunity, and vaccination status during mumps transmission. However, our data do suggest that social networks can be critical determinants of mumps transmission. Future work exploring how social and economic disparities may amplify respiratory disease transmission will be necessary for updating outbreak mitigation and prevention strategies. By combining detailed metadata, novel metrics of transmission in the tree, and robust controls for sampling, we provide a framework for investigating source-sink dynamics that is readily applicable to other viral pathogens.</p><p>Sampling bias presents a persistent problem for phylodynamic studies that can complicate inference of source-sink dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Maio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frost et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kühnert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lemey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stack et al., 2010</xref>). Sampling bias can arise from unequal case detection or from curating a data set that poorly represents the underlying outbreak. Washington State uses a passive surveillance system for mumps detection and case acquisition, which is known to result in underreporting. Because the WA Department of Health did not perform active mumps surveillance, it is difficult to assess whether different epidemiologic groups have different likelihoods of being sampled. Marshallese individuals are less likely to seek healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Towne et al., 2021</xref>), which may have resulted in particularly high rates of underreporting in this group. If the number of cases within the Marshallese community were in fact higher than reported, this would increase the magnitude of the patterns we describe, making our estimates conservative. Given a distribution of cases, composing a data set for analysis also requires sampling decisions. Uniform sampling regimes in which sampling probability is equal across groups have been shown to perform well for source-sink inferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hall et al., 2016</xref>). By selecting sequences that matched the overall attributes of the outbreak, including a near 50:50 split between Marshallese and non-Marshallese cases, we adhere to this recommendation. We then specifically employed structured coalescent approaches which have been shown to be robust to sampling differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Müller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>), rather than using other common approaches that treat sampling intensity as informative of population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>). Within this framework, we further explore the possibility that unequal sampling within Washington clades could skew internal node reconstruction by forcing the sampling within each Washington clade to be equal between Marshallese and non-Marshallese tips. In doing so, differences within each clade must necessarily be driven by differences in transmission dynamics, rather than sampling. By combining careful sample selection with overlapping approaches to evaluate sampling bias, we were able to mitigate concerns that our source-sink reconstructions are driven by sampling artifacts.</p><p>Our results highlight the utility of genomic data to clarify epidemiologic hypotheses. While genomic data and epidemiologic investigation (including case interviews and contact follow up) suggested an Arkansas introduction as the Washington outbreak’s primary origin, sequence data revealed repeated and ongoing introductions into Washington, similar to patterns observed in Massachusetts, and the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wohl et al., 2020</xref>). We also find widespread geographic mixing across the phylogeny, consistent with investigations from the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wohl et al., 2020</xref>), Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stapleton et al., 2019</xref>), and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gavilán et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouma et al., 2016</xref>). Like others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wohl et al., 2020</xref>), we confirm that SH genotyping alone is insufficient for fine-grained resolution of geographic transmission patterns. While CDC guidelines currently recommend SH-based genotyping specifically for tracking transmission pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clemmons et al., 2020</xref>), building public health capacity for full-genome sequencing may be more useful for resolving local mumps transmission patterns.</p><p>Our finding that most introductions sparked short transmission chains suggests that mumps did not transmit efficiently among the general Washington populace. We suspect that more diffuse contact patterns may help explain this. Mumps has historically caused outbreaks in communities with strong, interconnected contact patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barskey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>), and in dense housing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Snijders et al., 2012</xref>), highlighted most recently by outbreaks in US detention centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lo et al., 2021</xref>). In 2016, most outbreaks in the US were associated with university settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albertson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonwitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donahue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Golwalkar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iowa Mumps Outbreak Response Team et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wohl et al., 2020</xref>), including a separate, smaller outbreak in Washington State associated with Greek housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonwitt et al., 2017</xref>). Outside of university settings, other outbreaks in 2016 were reported within close-knit ethnic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marx et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that while waning immunity may promote outbreaks by increasing susceptibility among young adults, outbreaks in younger age groups may be possible in sufficiently high-contact settings. Provision of an outbreak dose of mumps-containing vaccine to high-risk groups may therefore be especially effective for limiting mumps transmission in future outbreaks. Others have reported success in using outbreak dose mumps vaccinations to reduce mumps transmission on college campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardemil et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iowa Mumps Outbreak Response Team et al., 2018</xref>) and in the US army (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arday et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Green, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelley et al., 1991</xref>), and the CDC currently recommends providing outbreak vaccine doses to individuals with increased risk due to an outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marlow et al., 2020</xref>). Future work to quantify the interplay between contact rates and vaccine-induced immunity among different age and risk groups should be used to guide updated vaccine recommendations.</p><p>Recent research has focused on identifying groups at risk for mumps infection due to their age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewnard and Grad, 2018</xref>), with less attention to other factors that may make populations vulnerable. While a combination of waning immunity and dense housing settings make college campuses ideal for mumps outbreaks, the Washington and Arkansas outbreaks show that populations other than young adults are at risk. Soliciting feedback from the Marshallese community allowed us to contextualize our genomic results with the lived experience of individuals most heavily affected during the outbreak and to identify reasonable hypotheses for efficient transmission. Based on these interviews and previously published studies, we speculate that within the Marshallese community, a combination of factors likely led to a high force of infection. The following paragraph outlines contributing factors that were brought to light during our interviews with a collaborating community activist, along with corroborating citations from the literature. Each of these factors were specifically cited as important and directly stem from our interviews with her.</p><p>Multigenerational living is common in the Marshallese community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fields et al., 2019</xref>), and Marshallese households tend to be larger on average (average household size = 5.28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris and Jones, 2005</xref>), average household size for entire US populace = 2.52 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">US Census Bureau, 2021</xref>). Having more household contacts may have facilitated a greater number and higher intensity of interactions among individuals, allowing the force of infection to overcome pre-existing immunity. The Marshallese community is often described as close-knit, with frequent and close interactions among individuals, a strong sense of community, and a broader sense of family than the single-family unit typical of broader American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Embassy of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the United States of America, 2021</xref>). Contacts within the community could therefore be more frequent or intense, which may facilitate transmission. It is also possible that infection intensity within the Marshallese community was exacerbated by low rates of insurance coverage and poor access to healthcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McElfish et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Towne et al., 2021</xref>), hesitancy to seek medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Williams and Hampton, 2005</xref>), and health disparities stemming from US occupation, nuclear testing, and exclusion from healthcare services. As part of reparations for US nuclear testing, the US signed the Compact of Free Association Treaty (COFA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Congress 108th United States, 2003</xref>) with the Marshall Islands in 1989, permitting Marshallese residents to live and work in the US without visas. However, eligibility for Medicaid was revoked for COFA immigrants in 1996, and US-residing Marshallese remain economically disadvantaged and under-insured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McElfish, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McElfish et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McElfish et al., 2015</xref>). The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has not ameliorated these issues. Interviews with US-residing Marshallese note confusion among ACA staff regarding the legal status of COFA recipients, leading to drawn out enrollment processes that often leave individuals uninsured, frustrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElfish et al., 2016</xref>), and far less likely to access care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Towne et al., 2021</xref>). A study of healthcare-seeking behavior among patients with diabetes showed that while multiple factors contribute to foregone care in the US populace, 77% of surveyed Marshallese individuals reported recent forgeone care and lack of insurance was the primary reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Towne et al., 2021</xref>). Marshallese trust in US medical institutions was seriously undermined by the unconsented use of Marshallese individuals for experiments on health impacts of nuclear exposure, with effects lingering today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker, 2012</xref>). Banked historical samples confirm uptake of radioactive materials in Marshallese inhabitants of affected Islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simon et al., 2010</xref>), but there has been limited published data on long-term health impacts of nuclear exposure, and significant concern remains within the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bordner et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, when Marshallese individuals do access care, they report experiencing disdain from healthcare workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duke, 2017</xref>) and sub-optimal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElfish et al., 2016</xref>). Interviews with medical workers show that blame for poor Marshallese health outcomes is sometimes placed on host genetics or cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duke, 2017</xref>), poor health literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McElfish et al., 2018</xref>), or choosing to delay care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McElfish et al., 2018</xref>), with less consideration given to how the economic and legal impacts of US occupation affect the health of Marshallese individuals. These factors compound, and Marshallese individuals report hesitation to seek medical care, even when sick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McElfish et al., 2016</xref>). Hesitancy to seek care could have contributed to mumps transmission if sick individuals were primarily cared for at home without knowledge of or the ability to implement community-isolation protocols.</p><p>Our findings highlight that social networks can be the primary risk factor for a respiratory virus outbreak, even when a vaccine is effective and widely used. This finding is especially pertinent as SARS-CoV2 continues to disproportionately impact populations who live and work in high-risk settings, including the Marshallese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Center et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McElfish et al., 2021</xref>), and for whom vaccine licensure and distribution alone may not be a panacea. Future work should explore whether nuclear exposure has impacted Marshallese immune function and susceptibility to infectious disease. The passing of federal legislation remedying the exclusion of Marshallese individuals from Medicaid access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hirono, 2019</xref>) in December 2020 marks an important step toward improving healthcare access. Future work to evaluate whether this change improves Marshallese access to healthcare and mitigates increased disease risk will be crucial follow-up. The findings of this paper demonstrate the importance of expanding our understanding of populations at risk for mumps re-emergence, so that rapid and comprehensive outbreak response strategies can be implemented to mitigate negative health impacts for all affected communities. Finally, future work to disentangle the complex interplay between healthcare access, social and economic disparity, and respiratory virus risk will be essential for mitigating health impacts of mumps and other respiratory viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (Mumps virus)</td><td valign="top">110 buccal swabs from mumps positive patients in Washington</td><td valign="top">Washington StateDepartment of Health</td><td valign="top">Sequences were deposited in Genbank under accessions MT859507-MT859672.

We conducted video and telephone interviews to directly address the impacts of mumps transmission on the Marshallese community, community healthcare goals and priorities, and the impacts of the mumps outbreak on stigmatization. This feedback informed what is being presented herein, provided crucial context for understanding mumps transmission, and allowed us to work with the community to determine how best to discuss Marshallese involvement in the outbreak.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mumps surveillance in Washington State</title><p>Mumps is a notifiable condition in Washington State. Therefore, per the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), as specified in WAC Chapter 246-101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Washington State Legislature, 2014</xref>), healthcare providers, healthcare facilities, and laboratories must report cases of mumps or possible mumps to the local health jurisdiction (LHJ) of the patient’s residence. LHJ staff initiate case investigations and facilitate optimal collection and testing of diagnostic specimens. Buccal swabs and urine are acceptable specimens for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), a preferred diagnostic test for mumps. Most mumps rRT-PCR tests for Washington State residents are performed at the Washington State Public Health Laboratories, where all positive specimens are archived.</p><p>Individuals testing positive for mumps ribonucleic acid (RNA) by qRT-PCR are classified as confirmed mumps cases if they have a clinically compatible illness (i.e., an illness involving parotitis or other salivary gland swelling lasting at least 2 days, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, hearing loss, orchitis, oophoritis, mastitis, or pancreatitis). During case investigations, case-patients or their proxies are interviewed. Information about demographics, illness characteristics, vaccination history, and potential for exposure to and transmission of mumps are solicited from each case-patient. In concordance with CDC guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019b</xref>), only vaccine doses for which there was written documentation with the date of vaccine receipt were considered valid. Individuals for whom such documentation could not be provided were classified as having an unknown vaccination status. For individuals with documented vaccine doses, they were further characterized as up-to-date or not up-to-date based on their age. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) receives, organizes, performs quality control on, and analyzes data from, LHJ case reports and supports investigations upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sample collection and IRB approval</title><p>This study was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Institutional Review Board (IR File #: 6007–944) and by the Washington State Institutional Review Board, and classified as not involving human subjects. Samples were selected for sequencing to maximize temporal and epidemiologic breadth and to ensure successful sequencing. As such, samples were chosen based on the date of sample collection, the PCR cycle threshold (Ct), case vaccination status, and community status (Marshallese or non-Marshallese). Samples were selected for sequencing in two batches. In the first, samples were selected based on covering a wide geographic range within Washington, a full range of dates covering the outbreak, and having a Ct value &lt;36. This initial sampling regime resulted in a sample set skewed slightly toward samples from Marshallese individuals. To ensure that the proportion of samples in our data closely matched the distribution of cases in the outbreak, we then selected a second batch of samples using the same criteria as above, but excluded samples from Marshallese individuals. We then randomly sampled an additional 30 samples from non-Marshallese individuals. This sampling regime resulted in a data set that closely mirrors the distribution of metadata categories in the outbreak overall. All metadata, including case vaccination status, were transferred from WA DOH to FHCRC in a de-identified form.</p><p>We also sequenced an additional set of 56 samples collected in Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri, Alabama, and North Carolina provided by the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. Ten of these samples were collected in Wisconsin during the 2006/2007 Midwestern college campus outbreaks, six samples were collected in 2014, and the rest were collected between 2016 and 2018. For these samples, we received metadata describing sample Ct value and date of collection. All metadata were received by FHCRC in de-identified form.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Viral RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and amplicon generation</title><p>Viral RNA was extracted from buccal swabs using either the QiAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) or the Roche MagNA Pure 96 DNA and viral NA small volume kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). For samples extracted with the QiAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit, 500 μl of buccal swab fluid was spun at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet host cells. The supernatant was then removed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C to pellet virions. Excess fluid was discarded, and the pelletted virions were resuspended in 150–200 μl of fluid. Resuspended viral particles were then used as input to the QiAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), following manufacturer’s instructions, and eluting in 30 μl of buffer AVE. For extraction with the MagNA Pure, we followed manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was generated with the Protoscript II First strand synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich MD, USA), using 8 μl of vRNA as input and priming with 2 μl of random hexamers. vRNA and primers were incubated at 65°C for 5 min. Following this incubation, 10 μl of Protoscript II reaction mix (2×) and 2 μl of Protoscript II enzyme mix (10×) were added to each reaction and incubated at 25°C for 5 min, then 42°C for 1 hr, followed by a final inactivation step at 80°C for 5 min.

PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel, and bands were cut out and purified using the QiAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's protocol. All optional steps were performed, and the final product was eluted in 30 µl of buffer EB.

For samples processed in our last sequencing run, several samples had higher Ct values. We therefore chose to process these samples using the standard 1× reagent volumes for the library preparation step. All libraries were purified using Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), using a 0.6× cleanup, a 1× cleanup, and a final 0.7× cleanup. At each step, beads were washed twice with 200–400 µl of 70% ethanol. The final product was eluted off the beads with 10 µl of buffer EB.

Here, ‘state’ refers to the inferred ancestral identity of an internal node, where the inferred identity could be any of the 27 geographic locations (US states and Canadian provinces) in the data set. For the prior on non-zero rates for BSSVS, we specified an exponential distribution with a mean of 26. As a prior on each pairwise migration rate, we used an exponential distribution with mean 1. All other priors were left at default values. We ran this analysis for 100 million steps, sampling every 10,000, and removed the first 10% of sampled states as burn-in.

Our aim was to develop a heuristic method that would capture patterns similar to those captured by more complex structured coalescent models. In a population with high rates of transmission and high sampling intensity, it is possible that sampled individuals may represent true ancestors to subsequent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gavryushkina et al., 2014</xref>). While this is theoretically possible in our data set, we expect this to be rare. Because viruses accumulate mutations at a constant rate over time, a tip’s branch length should correlate with its position along the underlying transmission chain, that is, a short branch length should indicate that the tip is closer to the true ancestral infection than a longer branch. Plotting the number of mutations on each branch vs. its estimated branch length in time units confirms that mutations and time-calibrated branch length are correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This suggests that on average, branches with fewer mutations also tend to represent shorter periods of time. For our data set, most tips with an estimated branch length within the mumps serial interval of ~18 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vink et al., 2014</xref> have 0 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, circles below dashed line). In a population with high rates of transmission in which true ancestral infections are not directly sampled, we therefore expect that tips that are genetically closer to the ancestral node should be closer to the true ancestral infection than tips that are genetically dissimilar.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mutations vs. estimated branch length in days.</title><p>For each Washington tip in the full North American phylogeny with an estimated branch length in time units of ≤1 year, we show the number of mutations on that branch on the x-axis vs. the mean estimated branch length in days on the y-axis. The dashed line at 18 represents the mumps serial interval.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66448-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Either time or genetic divergence could be used to categorize how close tips are to their parental node. Here, we have opted to use divergence for two main reasons. Mumps has a relatively slow substitution rate and a long serial interval, resulting in stacks of identical genomes at several points in the divergence phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In time-resolved phylogenies, branching among identical genomes is resolved by sampling date, and the x-coordinate of the internal node is inferred based on time information. Because the internal node location is based not on actual genetic information, there is variability in the estimated placement of the internal node on the tree, resulting in branch lengths that may vary among realizations of the tree. This is reflected in the 95% confidence interval of internal node dates. Plotting the estimated branch length from each Washington tip to its internal node and incorporating the 95% confidence interval of the internal node date show that a wide range of branch lengths are plausible for most tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This complicates setting a simple branch length threshold based on the serial interval. In contrast, divergence trees have branch lengths expressed in the number of mutations arising along on that branch, which is intrinsic to the sequences themselves. Second, higher transmission in one group could result in shorter serial intervals within that group, which complicates defining a branch length cutoff based on serial interval. For these reasons, we have opted to use genetic divergence as our metric of ‘closeness’ to avoid arbitrary time cutoffs and issues of uncertainty in timetree internal node placements.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Washington tip branch lengths in days.</title><p>For each Washington tip in the full North American phylogeny with an estimated branch length in time units of ≤1 year, we show the estimated branch length in days with the 95% confidence interval. The solid line at 18 represents the mump serial interval. For most tips, the estimated branch length is variable, depending on the placement of its parental internal node.

To maximize the similarity between the tip and its inferred ancestral node, we classified tips as ‘close’ to their ancestral node if no mutations occurred on the branch leading to that tip, that is, the branch length was less than 1 divided by the alignment length. This cutoff can be set to the lower bound of the tree software (for IQTree, this cutoff is ~&lt;1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) with the same results.

We collapsed very small branches (branches with no mutations) to obtain polytomies, and then classified tips as either ‘basal’ (i.e., there were tips in the tree that descended from that internal node) or ‘terminal’ (meaning that no sampled tips descended from that branch). Here, we define a ‘descendant’ tip as a tip that occurs in any downstream portion of the tree, that is, it falls within the same lineage but to the right of the parent tip. A diagram of what we classify as basal vs. terminal tips is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>.</p><p>We expect that requiring branches to have 0 mutations should be robust regardless of mutation rate and serial interval, because a branch length of 0 will always be the closest in sequence to the true ancestor. However, variation in the substitution rate will impact the power of the analysis for detecting associations. Because mumps has a low substitution rate, some internal nodes contain stacks of identical genomes that cannot be ordered in terms of their placement along the underlying transmission chain. Instead, we treat each of these nodes as basal with equal probability of being upstream in the transmission chain. A higher substitution rate would jitter these polytomies and increase resolution, while a lower substitution rate would further reduce power. Our application is therefore conservative, but likely underpowered. Future work will be necessary to define the precise interaction between mutation rate, serial interval, sampling intensity, and effect sizes in determining the power of this test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Regression model for quantifying a tip’s probability of being basal</title><p>For each Washington tip in the tree, we classified it as either being basal (coded as a 1) or being terminal (coded as 0). For each tip, we coded its corresponding age, vaccination status, and community membership as a predictor variable input into a logistic regression model. We coded these attributes as follows: For community membership, non-Marshallese tips were coded as 0 and Marshallese tips were coded as 1. For age, we split our data set into adults and children, with individuals aged &lt;20 coded with a 0 and ≥20 coded with a 1. In our data set, there were three classifications for vaccination status: up-to-date, not up-to-date, and unknown vaccination status. According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McLean, 2013</xref>), individuals aged 5–18 had to have received both recommended doses of mumps-containing vaccine, children aged 15 months to 5 years required one dose of mumps-containing vaccine, and adults over 18 had to have received at least one dose of mumps-containing vaccine to be classified as up-to-date for mumps vaccination. Individuals under 15 months are considered up-to-date without any doses of mumps-containing vaccine. Not up-to-date individuals are those with a known vaccination status who did not qualify under criteria to be classified as up-to-date. Individuals who could not provide documentation regarding their MMR vaccination history were considered to have ‘unknown’ vaccination status. Individuals with ‘known’ vaccination status could either be fully up-to-date, undervaccinated, or unvaccinated. To ensure that we measured the effect of vaccination among individuals who knew their vaccination status, we coded vaccination information using two dummy variables in our logistic regression, one signifying whether vaccination status was known or not, and one indicating whether vaccination was up-to-date or not. We then fit a logistic regression model to this data using the glm package in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/">https://www.rdocumentation.org/</ext-link>packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/glm), specifying a binomial model as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> represents 0 or one value for member of Marshallese community (not Marshallese coded as a 0, Marshallese coded as a 1), <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> represents a 0 or one value for age, where individuals were classified as adults (≥20 years of age, coded as a 1) or children (&lt;20 years of age, coded as a 0). <italic>x</italic><sub>3</sub> represents a 0 or one value for whether vaccination status is unknown (having a known vaccination status coded as a 0, having an unknown vaccination status coded as a 1), and <italic>x</italic><sub>4</sub> represents 0 or one value for whether vaccination status is up-to-date (up-to-date coded as a 0 and not up-to-date coded as a 1).

We then separated Washington sequences into Marshallese tips (57 total sequences) and non-Marshallese tips (52 total sequences). For this analysis, we excluded the genotype K sequence in our data set due to its extreme divergence from other viruses sampled in Washington, which were all genotype G. For each group (Marshallese vs. non-Marshallese), we then generated subsampled data sets comprised of a random sample of 1 to <italic>n</italic> sequences, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of total sequences available for that group. For each number of sequences, we performed 10 independent subsampling trials. Subsampling was performed without replacement. So, for community members, we generated 10 data sets in which one community member sequence was sampled, then 10 data sets in which two community members sequences were sampled, etc. up to 10 data sets in which all 57 community members sequences were sampled. For each subsampled data set, we then combined these subsampled data sets with the background North American sequences, and reran the Nextstrain pipeline. For each subsample and trial, we infer geographic transmission history across the tree and enumerate the number of introductions into Washington. Geographic transmission history was inferred using a discrete trait model in TreeTime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sagulenko et al., 2018</xref>). For each number of sequences tested, <italic>n</italic>, we report the number of trials resulting in that number of inferred introductions, and the mean number of inferred introductions across the 10 trials. Each resulting ‘cluster’ consisted of a set of sequences that are related to one another that descend from a single inferred introduction of mumps into Washington.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Inference of community transmission dynamics using a structured coalescent model</title><p>To infer the rates of migration between community and non-community members and to infer ancestral states of Washington internal nodes, we employed a structured coalescent model. Here, ‘state’ refers to the inferred ancestral identity of an internal node, where the identity could be inferred as ‘Marshallese’ or ‘not Marshallese’. The multitype tree model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>) in BEAST 2 v2.6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouckaert et al., 2019</xref>) infers the effective population sizes of each deme and the migration rates between them. Because the multitype tree model requires that all partitions contain all demes, we could only analyze four clades that circulated in Washington State and included both Marshallese and non-Marshallese tips. We generated an XML in BEAUti v2.6.2 with four partitions and linked the clock, site, and migration models. We used a strict, fixed clock, set to 4.17 × 10<sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site year and used an HKY substitution model with four gamma-distributed rate categories. This clock rate was set based on the inferred substitutions per site per year from all North American mumps genomes on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nextstrain.org/mumps/na">nextstrain.org/mumps/na</ext-link>. Migration rates were inferred with the prior specified as a truncated exponential distribution with a mean of 1 and a maximum of 50. Effective population sizes were inferred with the prior specified as a truncated exponential distribution with a mean of 1, a minimum value of 0.001, and a maximum value of 10,000. All other priors were left at default values. In order to improve convergence, we employed three heated chains using the package CoupledMCMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Müller and Bouckaert, 2019</xref>), where proposals for chains to swap were performed every 100 states. The analysis was run for 100 million steps, with states sampled every 1 million steps. We ran this analysis three independent times, and combined log and tree file output from those independent runs using LogCombiner, with the first 10% (1000 states) of each run discarded as burn-in. We then summarized these combined output log and tree files. A maximum clade credibility tree was inferred using TreeAnnotator with the mean heights option. To ensure that results were not appreciably altered by the migration rate prior, we also repeated these analyses with migration rates inferred with the prior specified as a truncated exponential distribution with a mean of 10 and a maximum of 50.</p><p>Although our complete data set contains approximately equal numbers of sequences from Marshallese and non-Marshallese cases, the four clusters analyzed above are enriched among Marshallese tips. To assess the impact of uneven sampling within these clusters on ancestral state inference, we performed a subsampling analysis. For each cluster, we subsampled down the number of Marshallese tips to be equal to the number of non-Marshallese tips, and reran the analysis as above. While the original analysis used four subclades containing both Marshallese and non-Marshallese tips, one of these subclades only has five tips. Subsampling this particular subtree would have resulted in a subtree with only two tips, thus we excluded this clade from the subsampling analysis. For this sensitivity analysis, the three subsampled data sets had the following tip composition: primary outbreak clade: 26 Marshallese and 26 non-Marshallese tips; 10-tip introduction: three Marshallese and three non-Marshallese tips; 8-tip introduction: four Marshallese and four non-Marshallese tips. We generated three randomly subsampled data sets, and for each one ran three independent chains, with each chain run for 50 million steps, sampling every 500,000. For one of the subsampled data sets, none of the chains converged after 20 days. In each of the remaining two subsampled data sets, two out of three chains converged. We combined these converged chains using LogCombiner, with the first 10% of each run discarded as burn-in. We then summarized these combined output log and tree files, and inferred a maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnnotator with the mean heights option.</p><p>The analysis as described above assumes that each introduction into Washington State is an independent observation of the same structured coalescent process, and that the data set represents a random sample of the underlying population. Additionally, this approach requires a priori definition of which sequences are part of the same Washington State transmission chain. Finally, the above analysis could only make use of the four Washington introductions with both Marshallese and non-Marshallese tips, and excludes other transmission chains. Because of these issues, we supplemented the above approach with an additional analysis using the approximate structured coalescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2017</xref>) in MASCOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). Using all of the Washington sequences, we specified three demes: Marshallese in Washington, non-Marshallese in Washington, and outside of Washington. To account for any transmission that happened outside of Washington State, the ‘outside of Washington’ deme acted as a ‘ghost deme’ from which we did not use any samples. The effective population size of this ‘outside of Washington’ deme then describes the rate at which lineages between any location outside of Washington share a common ancestor. Including specific samples from outside of Washington would bias the inferred effective population size toward the coalescent rates of the sampled locations, by incorporating local transmission dynamics of other locations. We then estimated migration rates and effective population sizes for all three demes, but fixed the migration rates such that the unsampled deme (‘outside of Washington’) could only act as a source population. This is motivated by not having observed obvious migration out of Washington State in our previous analysis here. We ran this analysis for 10 million steps, sampling every 5000, and discarded the first 10% of states as burn-in.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to extend our sincerest thanks to Jiji Jally for her help and input on the project.

An array of classic and novel phylogenetic approaches supports the conclusions that mumps was introduced several times in Washington during the outbreak, and that the Washington Marshallese community was particularly at risk of mumps infection and transmission despite high vaccination coverage. Consultation with a community health advocate from the affected communities helps contextualize the results.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Repeated introductions and intensive community transmission fueled a mumps virus outbreak in Washington State&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please rephrase conclusions regarding the role of age and vaccination to indicate the effect is inconclusive given the low power of the study/small sample size.</p><p>2. Figure 2 is difficult to read. A different color scheme may make this figure more understandable.</p><p>3. Please compare the age distribution of sampled cases vs outbreak cases in either supplementary table 2 or 3, this would help better convince readers that the sample is representative of the outbreak cases.</p><p>4. Elaborate on the decision to include tips on an internal node as the measured variable as opposed to tips with a branch length of a certain distance.</p><p>5. Rephrase heading on line 338</p><p>6. Additional contextualization of the problem of sampling bias and how this approach is different may help strengthen the methodology presented in the paper.</p><p>7. There were several other mumps outbreaks in the United States in the same 2016-2017 time period. Some discussion about Washington state particularities that prevented mumps transmission outside of the Marshallese community would be warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I cannot comment much on the sequencing and phylogenetic analyses as this is not my area of expertise, but I can comment on the epidemiological analyses:</p><p>• There is an overreliance on p-values in the interpretation of the logistic regression in Table 1. There is no consideration of the fact that the study does not have an adequate sample size to assess the effects of variables other than community status. I would recommend the authors do a post-hoc sample size power calculation, not necessarily to put in the article, but to convince themselves of whether they have the statistical power to assess the impact of vaccination and age. Basically, their logistic regression model is suggesting that in fact we cannot exclude the possibility that vaccination status and age may potentially have very strong effects on transmission (point estimate ORs of 2.21, 0.46, or 0.30, in other words over a doubling or a halving of the odds, which would be considered by many to be an important effect size). The only reason that the analysis has enough statistical power for community status is because the odds ratio is enormous and the prevalence of Marshallese samples is very high. Please read Amrhein V, Greenland S, McShane B. Nature. 2019 Mar;567(7748):305-307 for further discussion on this topic. I would suggest addressing this issue by:</p><p>– Mentioning low statistical power to assess the effects of age and vaccination as a limitation of this analysis</p><p>– When discussing the results for age and vaccination status, I would recommend using the suggestion of Amrhein et al. and to discuss the point estimate and confidence intervals rather than commenting on their non-statistical significance. (e.g. instead of &quot;Neither age nor vaccination status were significantly associated with the presence of downstream tips in the tree&quot;, say instead that while those with unknown vaccination status were more likely to have descendants in the tree than those with known up-to-date vaccination, the confidence interval could not exclude a null or positive association between vaccination status and having tree descendants).</p><p>– The conclusion the authors should reach in the abstract and discussion is not that &quot;Neither vaccination status nor age were strong determinants of transmission&quot;, but rather that while age and vaccination status might be associated with transmission, the authors did not have enough statistical power to estimate their effect (i.e. the confidence intervals are very wide and cannot exclude either no association or inverse associations).</p><p>• I find the parameterization of age very unusual, in general what is more often used for continuous variables is centering the variable around the mean or mode rather than normalizing. I am not convinced that age as a continuous variable is the best way to parameterize age for this analysis. There is no reason to believe that age would necessarily have a linear effect on transmission. Social networks and contacts do not change linearly with age but probably in a more segmented manner as individuals age into different life stages (school, workforce, retirement). Waning vaccine immunity is also possibly not linear with age. This is just a suggestion, but I think it would potentially be more fruitful and maybe yield higher statistical power in this case to categorize age dichotomously as either children (&lt;20y) or adults (&gt;=20y) based on different social networks in children vs adults. However, there may be other cutpoints that fit the data better and that could be explored. Otherwise, some justification for the parameterization of age would be nice.</p><p>• Please compare the age distribution of sampled cases vs outbreak cases in either supplementary table 2 or 3, this would help better convince readers that the sample is representative of the outbreak cases.</p><p>• Figure 2: Please make the data for Washington state more obvious, for example by restricting an entire color shade such as blue. Currently it is very difficult to distinguish between Georgia, Virginia, Manitoba, Washington, Massachusetts, and North Dakota. It is also not clear from the legend what a grey node represents.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The input from community health advocates is a strength that could be better highlighted in the discussion. It is unclear which potential causes (possibly all of them) are corroborated by the lived experiences of the individuals in the Marshallese community in WA.</p><p>The new test for descendants in the divergence tree is a useful method that is likely to be adopted in other studies. It would be nice if the authors could elaborate very briefly on the decision to include tips on an internal node as the measured variable as opposed to tips with a branch length of a certain distance. Is this decision based on the substitution rate and serial interval of Mumps and if applied by others should it be adjusted based on the pathogen and/or sampling scheme (e.g. Intensely sampling a super spreading event would show a large number of tips of one type at the base of 1 transmission chain which is different than finding many tips with descendants spread throughout the tree)?</p><p>The wording in the heading on line 338 is confusing.</p><p>Is it known, or suspected from interviews, if members of the Marshallese community are more closely connected through social contacts with each other than they are with the wider public? This seems like an implicit assumption, but very likely given the outbreaks in WA and AR.</p><p>Lines 667-668 in the methods mention 27 &quot;states&quot; were used in the phylogeographic reconstruction. The main text and Figure 1 mention 26.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66448.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have altered the following text accordingly:</p><p>In the abstract, lines 26-28 have been changed from “Neither vaccination status nor age were strong determinants of transmission” to “Although age and vaccination status may have impacted transmission, our dataset could not quantify their precise effects.”</p><p>In lines 250-271, we have rewritten the paragraph to now read:</p><p>“When we encounter a tip that lies on an internal node, we enumerate the number of tips that descend from its parent node. […] These results suggest that community membership was a significant determinant of sustained transmission while controlling for vaccination status and age.”</p><p>On lines 448-451 of the discussion, we have replaced “We found no support for age or vaccination status as critical determinants of transmission in our outbreak, consistent with epidemiologic findings” to now read “We were unable to evaluate the precise effects of age and vaccination status on transmission in our outbreak. Future, larger studies will be necessary to disentangle the interplay between contact patterns, waning immunity, and vaccination status during mumps transmission.”</p><p>We have also added an additional supplemental table (Supplementary File 1d) that lists the number of tips labeled as basal or terminal for each metadata category. This should help clarify exactly how many data points were compared for this analysis, and makes clear that the number of compared data points is indeed small for some categories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2 is difficult to read. A different color scheme may make this figure more understandable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editors for pointing this out. We have reorganized Figure 2 and its associated supplements to reduce the number of colors shown. We grouped US states and Canadian provinces together by geography into 6 groups, as suggested by reviewer 2. We grouped US states as follows: non-Washington west USA (California and Montana), south USA (North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Georgia, and Alabama), Northeast USA (New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and New Jersey), midwest USA (North Dakota, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois), British Columbia Canada, and Manitoba and Ontario Canada. We assigned Washington its own, distinct color so that it can be more easily identified. We now display a total of 7 colors instead of 27, which we hope improves readability. We have also included a new supplemental figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) that retains all 27 colors. In this version, each state/province has its own color, with that color representing a shade or tint of the overall region color shown in Figure 2. We included this as a supplement in case there were readers who were interested in the results of the full 27-state geographic reconstruction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please compare the age distribution of sampled cases vs outbreak cases in either supplementary table 2 or 3, this would help better convince readers that the sample is representative of the outbreak cases.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a helpful suggestion, and we have added the counts and percentages for age groups in our dataset to Supplementary File 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Elaborate on the decision to include tips on an internal node as the measured variable as opposed to tips with a branch length of a certain distance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for this comment. We have reorganized the portion of the methods that describe this transmission test and divided it into 2 sections: 1. “Quantifying transmission in divergence trees using basal and terminal tips: formulation and rationale” and 2. “Regression model for quantifying a tip’s probability of being basal”. Section one outlines the procedure and includes new paragraphs describing our rationale for defining the cutoff as we did, as well as how we expect this metric to fare for viruses with higher or lower mutation rates. We also include figures to help clarify our assumptions. Section 2 outlines the regression model details. The implementation here was an initial step in developing this method, and fully exploring all interactions among mutation rate, serial interval, sampling intensity and effect sizes is beyond the scope of the current work. We hope these new methods clarify our thought process and provide some intuition for others who may wish to adapt this method to their own work. This new information is written in the Methods on lines 798-877:</p><p>“Quantifying transmission in divergence trees using basal and terminal tips: formulation and rationale</p><p>To determine whether specific groups were more likely to be part of sustained, serially sampled transmission chains, we developed a statistic to quantify transmission in the tree. […] Future work will be necessary to define the precise interaction between mutation rate, serial interval, sampling intensity and effect sizes in determining the power of this test.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Rephrase heading on line 338</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this typo, and agree this was confusing. This has been changed to read, “Viruses infecting individuals in different vaccination groups are genetically similar.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Additional contextualization of the problem of sampling bias and how this approach is different may help strengthen the methodology presented in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a helpful addition, and have added a new paragraph devoted to a discussion of sampling bias to the discussion on lines 458-484. This paragraph reads:</p><p>“Sampling bias presents a persistent problem for phylodynamic studies that can complicate inference of source-sink dynamics (De Maio et al., 2015; Dudas et al., 2018; Frost et al., 2015; Kühnert et al., 2011; Lemey et al., 2020; Stack et al., 2010). […] By combining careful sample selection with overlapping approaches to evaluate sampling bias, we were able to mitigate concerns that our source-sink reconstructions are driven by sampling artifacts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. There were several other mumps outbreaks in the United States in the same 2016-2017 time period. Some discussion about Washington state particularities that prevented mumps transmission outside of the Marshallese community would be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for this comment, and agree that further contextualization would be helpful. We did not make it clear in the initial submission that in 2016/2017, the vast majority of mumps outbreaks in the US were associated with either universities or ethnic communities. We have re-organized a few paragraphs in the Discussion section and added information about other 2016/2017 outbreaks. This new paragraph is on lines 499-519, and reads:</p><p>“Our finding that most introductions sparked short transmission chains suggests that mumps did not transmit efficiently among the general Washington populace. […] Future work to quantify the interplay between contact rates and vaccine-induced immunity among different age and risk groups should be used to guide updated vaccine recommendations.”</p><p>We also amended lines 42-46 in the introduction to highlight that most other US outbreaks in 2016/2017 were university-associated:</p><p>“Like with other recent mumps outbreaks, most Washington cases in 2016/17 were vaccinated. Unusually though, while most US outbreaks in 2016/2017 were associated with university settings (Albertson et al., 2016; Bonwitt et al., 2017; Donahue et al., 2017; Golwalkar et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2018; Wohl et al., 2020), incidence in Washington was highest among children aged 10-18 years, younger than expected given waning immunity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I cannot comment much on the sequencing and phylogenetic analyses as this is not my area of expertise, but I can comment on the epidemiological analyses:</p><p>• There is an overreliance on p-values in the interpretation of the logistic regression in Table 1. There is no consideration of the fact that the study does not have an adequate sample size to assess the effects of variables other than community status. I would recommend the authors do a post-hoc sample size power calculation, not necessarily to put in the article, but to convince themselves of whether they have the statistical power to assess the impact of vaccination and age. Basically, their logistic regression model is suggesting that in fact we cannot exclude the possibility that vaccination status and age may potentially have very strong effects on transmission (point estimate ORs of 2.21, 0.46, or 0.30, in other words over a doubling or a halving of the odds, which would be considered by many to be an important effect size). The only reason that the analysis has enough statistical power for community status is because the odds ratio is enormous and the prevalence of Marshallese samples is very high. Please read Amrhein V, Greenland S, McShane B. Nature. 2019 Mar;567(7748):305-307 for further discussion on this topic. I would suggest addressing this issue by:</p><p>– Mentioning low statistical power to assess the effects of age and vaccination as a limitation of this analysis</p><p>– When discussing the results for age and vaccination status, I would recommend using the suggestion of Amrhein et al. and to discuss the point estimate and confidence intervals rather than commenting on their non-statistical significance. (e.g. instead of &quot;Neither age nor vaccination status were significantly associated with the presence of downstream tips in the tree&quot;, say instead that while those with unknown vaccination status were more likely to have descendants in the tree than those with known up-to-date vaccination, the confidence interval could not exclude a null or positive association between vaccination status and having tree descendants).</p><p>– The conclusion the authors should reach in the abstract and discussion is not that &quot;Neither vaccination status nor age were strong determinants of transmission&quot;, but rather that while age and vaccination status might be associated with transmission, the authors did not have enough statistical power to estimate their effect (i.e. the confidence intervals are very wide and cannot exclude either no association or inverse associations).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and editor for this critique, as it was a helpful set of comments. Please see point 1 under “Essential revisions” for our response to this set of critiques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• I find the parameterization of age very unusual, in general what is more often used for continuous variables is centering the variable around the mean or mode rather than normalizing. I am not convinced that age as a continuous variable is the best way to parameterize age for this analysis. There is no reason to believe that age would necessarily have a linear effect on transmission. Social networks and contacts do not change linearly with age but probably in a more segmented manner as individuals age into different life stages (school, workforce, retirement). Waning vaccine immunity is also possibly not linear with age. This is just a suggestion, but I think it would potentially be more fruitful and maybe yield higher statistical power in this case to categorize age dichotomously as either children (&lt;20y) or adults (&gt;=20y) based on different social networks in children vs adults. However, there may be other cutpoints that fit the data better and that could be explored. Otherwise, some justification for the parameterization of age would be nice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and agree that binning age makes sense. We re-coded age as a binary predictor, classifying individuals as &lt;20 years old or ≥20 years old. As suggested, this did improve statistical power: out analysis now utilizes 59 tips that are &lt;20 years of age, and 50 tips ≥20 years of age. We coded ≥20 years of age as a 1 in the regression model. The new results are shown in a revised version of Table 1. This re-coding resulted in a narrower estimated confidence interval, although it is still not sufficiently resolved to estimate the impact of age precisely. We have updated the text in the Methods and Results to reflect this re-coding and updated results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Please compare the age distribution of sampled cases vs outbreak cases in either supplementary table 2 or 3, this would help better convince readers that the sample is representative of the outbreak cases.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see point 3 under “Essential revisions” for our response to this set of critiques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 2: Please make the data for Washington state more obvious, for example by restricting an entire color shade such as blue. Currently it is very difficult to distinguish between Georgia, Virginia, Manitoba, Washington, Massachusetts, and North Dakota. It is also not clear from the legend what a grey node represents.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see point 2 under “Essential revisions” for our response to this set of critiques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The input from community health advocates is a strength that could be better highlighted in the discussion. It is unclear which potential causes (possibly all of them) are corroborated by the lived experiences of the individuals in the Marshallese community in WA.</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies for failing to make this clear the first time, and the reviewer is correct in assuming that it is all of these causes that were brought up in our interviews. To clarify this, we have added lines 530-533 of the discussion to introduce the paragraph about the factors likely contributing to high transmission efficiency within the Marshallese community. This now reads:</p><p>“The following paragraph outlines contributing factors that were brought to light during our interviews with a collaborating community activist, along with corroborating citations from the literature. Each of these factors were specifically cited as important and directly stem from our interviews with her.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The new test for descendants in the divergence tree is a useful method that is likely to be adopted in other studies. It would be nice if the authors could elaborate very briefly on the decision to include tips on an internal node as the measured variable as opposed to tips with a branch length of a certain distance. Is this decision based on the substitution rate and serial interval of Mumps and if applied by others should it be adjusted based on the pathogen and/or sampling scheme (e.g. Intensely sampling a super spreading event would show a large number of tips of one type at the base of 1 transmission chain which is different than finding many tips with descendants spread throughout the tree)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and think that providing extra contextualization has improved the manuscript. Please see point 4 under “Essential revisions” for our full response to this set of critiques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The wording in the heading on line 338 is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this typo, and agree this was confusing. This has been changed to read, “Viruses infecting individuals in different vaccination groups are genetically similar,” which we hope is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it known, or suspected from interviews, if members of the Marshallese community are more closely connected through social contacts with each other than they are with the wider public? This seems like an implicit assumption, but very likely given the outbreaks in WA and AR.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in this assumption. The Marshallese are frequently described in the literature as “close-knit” with a strong sense of community, and this notion was confirmed by our collaborating community contact as generally true. It should be noted that the advocate did not describe the community as insular; rather, that individuals within the community interact frequently and share a broader sense of family than the single-family unit typical of broader American culture. We have added the following lines to lines 540-544 of the discussion, which we hope clarify these points:</p><p>“The Marshallese community is often described as close-knit, with frequent and close interactions among individuals, a strong sense of community, and a broader sense of family than the single-family unit typical of broader American culture (Barker, 2012; Embassy of the Republic of the Marshall Islands to the United States of America, n.d.). Contacts within the community could therefore be more frequent or intense, which may facilitate transmission.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 667-668 in the methods mention 27 &quot;states&quot; were used in the phylogeographic reconstruction.

The correct number of states is 27, which has been fixed in the main text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
