A common approach is to search for natural compounds deployed by microbes to inhibit competitors. Here, we show that the iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 natural <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates used against 12 human pathogens uncovered several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of the pathogens <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverdine increased survival of infected <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Despite the wide range of available antibiotics, a majority work through a similar mechanism, which enables some bacteria to become resistant to medical treatment. This means that the effectiveness of these molecules goes down and many curable infections may no longer be treatable.</p><p>Collectively, antibiotic resistance poses a similar threat as other major diseases, such as malaria. One promising approach for discovering new antibiotics is to explore natural microbial communities for their ability to produce secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties. Such metabolites are typically secreted by bacteria to compete with other community members for essential resources including nutrients.</p><p>A well-known group of secreted metabolites are siderophores, which tightly sequester iron, a critical nutrient for bacterial growth. Each bacterial species produces its own set of specific siderophores, thus leading to a severe competition for iron.</p><p>Vollenweider et al. investigated whether a group of siderophores secreted by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria, called pyoverdines, are an effective antimicrobial agent against harmful human pathogens. Pyoverdines have a high affinity to iron and prevent competing bacteria from accessing the critical nutrient. This can inhibit their growth by starving them of iron.</p><p>Vollenweider et al. treated resistant pathogens like <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> grown in the laboratory, and found that pyoverdines significantly reduce their growth without the bacteria acquiring resistance. To test whether this treatment would work in a living infected animal, the group administered pyoverdines to moth larvae infected with the same pathogens and observed increased survival rates in the host.</p><p>As iron is also required for human metabolism and found in the haemoglobin of red blood cells, Vollenweider, et al. confirmed pyoverdines do not retrieve iron from haemoglobin. Finally, in laboratory settings, pyoverdines did not negatively affect the growth of a human and a mouse cell line at low concentrations strong enough to inhibit the growth of pathogens.</p><p>This approach is a promising example of adopting natural mechanisms that can have antimicrobial properties, and siderophores, in particular pyoverdines, may become a useful tool to treat otherwise incurable infections. Further research is needed in living mammalian models to confirm efficacy and safety of this novel antimicrobial treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pyoverdine</kwd><kwd>antibacterial treatment</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp.</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_182499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kümmerli</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_144862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polymenidou</surname><given-names>Magdalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_176966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polymenidou</surname><given-names>Magdalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Candoc</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pérez-Berlanga</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Iron-chelating pyoverdines from environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. show promising antibacterial activity against key human pathogens through the induction of iron starvation, while associated toxicity for host systems remains low.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are approximately 4.95 million fatalities associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria worldwide each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murray et al., 2022</xref>). This high mortality rate contrasts with the low development rate of new antibacterial agents for clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">WHO, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beyer and Paulin, 2020</xref>). Thus, the development of alternative therapies with higher sustainability to counteract the rapidly dwindling treatment options due to resistance evolution is imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and MacLean, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monserrat-Martinez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rezzoagli et al., 2020b</xref>). Numerous alternative approaches have been proposed, including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides and nanobodies, antivirulence treatments to disarm pathogens, treatments that capitalize on ecological competition between susceptible and resistant bacteria, and the search for new antibacterial compounds produced by environmental microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhushan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghosh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rezzoagli et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saeki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wale et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Mining natural microbial communities has become a promising endeavor in the hunt for novel antimicrobials because most microbes deploy bioactive compounds to contend with their competitors in the diverse assemblies they live in. Competition often involves the secretion of secondary metabolites with specific antimicrobial properties against other microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hug et al., 2020</xref>). The isolation, characterization, and synthesis of such secondary metabolites can result in novel prospective antibiotics for clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Imai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ling et al., 2015</xref>). Secondary metabolites that act as toxins to kill competitors are often considered promising candidates. However, microbes compete through a variety of mechanisms other than toxins. For example, there is increasing evidence that competition for iron is a main determinant of species interactions in soil and freshwater communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butaitė et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deveau et al., 2016</xref>). Competition for iron involves the secretion of siderophores, a class of secondary metabolites that scavenges environmental iron with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hider and Kong, 2010</xref>). Because siderophores are often species specific, they have two opposing effects: they make iron available for related community members possessing the matching receptor but withhold iron from competitors with non-matching receptors. Thus, siderophores can be competitive agents in inter-species interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Figueiredo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niehus et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we apply the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens. Specifically, we investigate whether siderophores from non-pathogenic environmental bacteria can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens. We focus on pyoverdines, a class of siderophores with high iron affinity that are produced and secreted by fluorescent <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. under iron-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Visca et al., 2007</xref>). Upon complexation with ferric iron, the iron-loaded pyoverdine is imported into the cell by receptors with high specificity and subsequently reduced to the bio-available ferrous iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonneau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cornelis et al., 2023</xref>). Pyoverdines show an extraordinary structural diversity with more than 70 described variants that differ in their peptide backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rehm et al., 2022</xref>) and have an extremely high affinity for iron (K<sub>a</sub> = 10<sup>32</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>, pyoverdine produced by <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> biotype B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyer and Abdallah, 1978</xref>). For these reasons, we propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains, isolated from soil and freshwater habitats, for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, we elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition. Subsequently, we assessed the efficacy of the three top pyoverdine candidates against four human opportunistic pathogens (<italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) in vitro and/or in vivo via infections of the Greater wax moth larvae (<italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>). We further assessed their toxicity in the host, toward two mammalian cell lines and red blood cells. Finally, we used experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing to study the potential of pathogens evolving resistance against pyoverdine treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pyoverdines can inhibit the growth of human opportunistic pathogens</title><p>To assess the antibacterial properties of pyoverdines, we performed a growth inhibition screen using a well-characterized collection of 320 natural <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butaitė et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butaitė et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butaitė et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>). The isolates stem from freshwater and soil communities and belong to the group of fluorescent pseudomonads (e.g., <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, <italic>P. putida</italic>, <italic>P. syringae</italic>, <italic>P. chlororaphis</italic>) that are non-pathogenic to humans and can produce and secrete pyoverdines, a group of high iron-affinity siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer, 2000</xref>). Important to note is that several isolates are likely to produce secondary siderophores in addition to pyoverdine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cornelis, 2010</xref>). Given that secondary siderophores generally have lower iron affinity than pyoverdine, we anticipate treatment effects to be primarily driven by pyoverdines.</p><p>In a first screen, we evaluated how the sterile pyoverdine-containing supernatants of the 320 isolates affect the growth of 12 human opportunistic pathogens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, we grew the pathogens in 70% fresh casamino acid medium (CAA) supplemented with 30% spent supernatant. We found high variation in the supernatant effect, ranging from complete pathogen growth inhibition to growth promotion compared to the control treatment (70% CAA supplemented with 30% sodium chloride 0.8% solution) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

As CCS values correlate with the volume of a molecule, our results suggest that inhibitory pyoverdines are larger and have more complex molecule structures than non-inhibitory pyoverdines. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two classes of pyoverdines regarding molecule polarity (F<sub>1,22</sub> = 2.00, p=0.1711, assessed by the chromatographic retention time [RT] on a reversed-phase column) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but molecule polarity was significantly higher for ferri- than for apo-pyoverdines (F<sub>1,22</sub> = 12.78, p=0.0017).

One reason for these non-standard dose–response curves could be that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> possesses two receptors (FpvA and FpvB) for pyoverdine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ghysels et al., 2004</xref>).

These results suggest that low and intermediate doses of pyoverdine are more effective than the highest concentration. This notion was further supported when analyzing the time-to-death of larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found hump-shaped relationships between pyoverdine concentrations and time-to-death in four out of six cases with two of them being significant (quadratic regression models for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> treated with pyoverdine 3G07: linear term: F<sub>1,71</sub> = 0.88, p=0.3506, quadratic term: F<sub>1,71</sub> = 6.11, p=0.0159 and s3b09: linear term: F<sub>1,73</sub> = 0.31, p=0.5806, quadratic term: F<sub>1,73</sub> = 6.16, p=0.0153).

Our screen involving 320 environmental isolates and 12 pathogen strains revealed five top pyoverdine candidates with broad-spectrum activity. These candidates could be distinguished from non-inhibitory pyoverdines by their high CCS values (standing for larger and more complex molecules) and their higher iron complexation stability. Experiments with crude- and HPLC-purified pyoverdines showed that pyoverdines completely stall the growth of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while showing intermediate activity against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. When administered as treatment to infected <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae, we observed significantly increased host survival rates in infections with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, demonstrating that pyoverdine exhibits antibacterial activity in hosts. Furthermore, we found low toxicity of pyoverdines at effective concentrations and observed low potentials for resistance evolution. Overall, our results reveal pyoverdines from non-pathogenic <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. as potent antibacterials against several human opportunistic pathogens.</p><p>Our novel treatment approach assumes that pyoverdines sequester iron and thereby induce iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. Several of our findings support this view. First, the growth-inhibiting effect of our top pyoverdine candidates exclusively occurred under iron-limited conditions, while pathogen growth was restored under iron-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, non-inhibitory ferri-pyoverdines were more prone toward CIU (collision induced unfolding) than inhibitory ferric-pyoverdines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that inhibitory pyoverdines have a higher iron-binding affinity. Third, the pyoverdine precursor ferribactin did not inhibit pathogen growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The two molecules are identical apart from one ring in the chromophore core that is not cyclized and not oxidized in ferribactin, which compromises the binding of iron. These findings suggest that pyoverdine does not target the pathogens directly, but rather indirectly via the induction of iron starvation.</p><p>We observed that pyoverdines showed pathogen-specific efficacies in curbing bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We propose that differences can be explained by the various strategies of these pathogens to cope with iron stress. <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> produce siderophores that have a much simpler chemical structures than pyoverdines and are expected to bind iron with lower affinity (<italic>A. baumannii</italic>: acinetobactin [association constant: 10<sup>26</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>], fimsbactin [10<sup>27</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>], and baumannoferrin [unknown] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohac et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shapiro and Wencewicz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sheldon and Skaar, 2020</xref>], <italic>S. aureus</italic>: staphyloferrin A+B [unknown]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hammer and Skaar, 2011</xref>) than pyoverdine (10<sup>32</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meyer and Abdallah, 1978</xref>). Hence, the growth suppression of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> most likely occurs because their siderophores are too weak to successfully compete with pyoverdine. The situation is different for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, which produces enterobactin, the siderophore with the highest known iron affinity (10<sup>52</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris et al., 1979</xref>). Consistent with the concept of iron competition, we observed that pyoverdine treatment is less effective against <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and was only potent for one out of three pyoverdines (3G07, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, pyoverdine treatment is not expected to work well against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which itself produces a version of this siderophore. The two competing pyoverdines likely have similar iron affinities and the presence of pyoverdine receptors in the pathogen might foster the uptake of the supplemented pyoverdine. Our results indeed support the view that pyoverdine treatment is not effective against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Taken together, we predict that pyoverdine treatment could be highly potent against certain pathogens like <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> that have less efficient siderophores and are unable to use the pyoverdine as iron source.</p><p>For every new treatment, it is important to consider whether it has unintentional consequences for the targeted pathogen. Because our approach does not kill pathogens directly, there are multiple ways of how pathogens may react to pyoverdine treatment. For example, pathogens could increase the production of their own siderophores in response to the severe iron limitation induced by pyoverdines. Alternatively, siderophores can serve as signaling molecules in certain species like <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, regulating the expression of additional virulence factors like proteases and toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lamont et al., 2002</xref>). While pyoverdine treatment may affect such signaling cascades in other pathogens as well, and thus potentially increase virulence factor production, we observed the opposite in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which showed a loss of virulence genes. Similarly, iron limitation can increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) or decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang and Kirienko, 2018</xref>) the formation of biofilms, depending on the species or strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gentile et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliveira et al., 2021</xref>), and it is well possible that pyoverdine treatment thus affects the propensity of pathogens to form biofilms. Finally, pyoverdines may have differential effects on the various members of the microbiota or the different pathogens in polymicrobial infections and thereby induces shifts in species composition due to the unequal suppression of community members. In complex communities, the inhibitory effect of pyoverdine on the pathogen may get diluted as the burden of increased iron limitation is shared across community members. All these considerations show that it will be crucial to assess the consequences of pyoverdine treatments in more complex settings including hosts.</p><p>Not only bacteria but also host cells need iron. Consequently, pyoverdine treatment could negatively affect host iron homeostasis. Our toxicity assays reveal that there is a range of pyoverdine concentrations for which only mild adverse effects against cell lines and <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae are observed and no hemolysis occurs. Especially the finding that pyoverdines have no negative effects on the survival of non-replicating NSC-34 cells is encouraging, as this cell line is representative of intact host tissue, in which iron is bound to strong chelators such as transferrin, lactoferrin, or ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassat and Skaar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Skaar, 2010</xref>). Additionally, recent research has demonstrated that purified pyoverdine remains non-toxic even after 72 hr of treatment at concentrations up to 200 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2024</xref>). The result that pyoverdines are unable to obtain iron from hemoglobin is encouraging, too. Previous work showed that the pyoverdine of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can retrieve iron from human transferrin when working in concert with proteases (proteolytically degrading transferrin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Döring et al., 1988</xref>) or phenazines (spontaneously reducing ferric to ferrous iron) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox, 1986</xref>). However, these <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> specific mechanisms require the presence of this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wolz et al., 1994</xref>), which is not the case when purified pyoverdines are used as a treatment against other pathogens like <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Nonetheless, we found that pyoverdines can have certain adverse effects, especially for the rapidly proliferating HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These cells represent a regenerating tissue and thus have high iron demands. Similarly, we observed mild adverse effects for some pyoverdines (3G07) when administered at high concentrations to <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings corroborate the results from previous studies on <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, where pyoverdines were found to interfere with host iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang and Kirienko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kirienko et al., 2013</xref>). These considerations highlight that finding the right pyoverdine concentration will be key to meet the fine line between maximizing pathogen inhibition and minimizing tissue damage. By contrast, the adverse host effects of pyoverdines might come with additional opportunities, for instance, in cancer therapy, where siderophores reduce iron levels in tumors and slow tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pita-Grisanti et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We propose that pyoverdine treatment could synergistically interact with the host innate immune system. Mammalian neutrophils produce siderocalin to sequester bacterial siderophore-iron complexes, rendering them non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassat and Skaar, 2013</xref>). While this strategy is efficient against many siderophores, some bacteria have evolved so-called stealth siderophores that no longer bind to siderocalin. Pyoverdines are such stealth siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peek et al., 2012</xref>). Regarding pyoverdine treatment, this means that pathogens with regular siderophores will hit a double wall: their siderophores are immobilized by siderocalins, while pyoverdines lock away the remaining iron.</p><p>Another promising finding of our work is that the potential for resistance evolution against pyoverdines seems low. Conceptually, one reason for low-resistance evolution could be that pyoverdines, unlike many antibiotics, are not internalized into bacterial cells. Thus, classic resistance mechanisms such as reduced drug influx, increased drug efflux, and intracellular target modification cannot operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rezzoagli et al., 2018</xref>). We initially expected that resistance evolution would involve mechanisms that improve the pathogen’s iron acquisition. This could include the upregulation of the pathogen’s own siderophores or switching from siderophore-based ferric iron acquisition to the use of reductases that foster ferrous iron uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rezzoagli et al., 2018</xref>). However, our sequencing analysis did not reveal mutations in genes associated with iron uptake systems. One explanation is that such mutations (albeit beneficial) might not reach high frequencies in populations because increased siderophore production and secretion would increase the iron acquisition of resistant and non-resistant cells alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rezzoagli et al., 2018</xref>). We instead observed an overrepresentation of mutations in regulatory, biofilm and motility, and metabolic genes. While we do not know the phenotypes of these mutations, one possibility is that increased biofilm formation could offer some protection against pyoverdine treatment, for example, by restricting pyoverdine from chelating free iron. Important to note is also that patterns of resistance evolution may differ between in vitro and in vivo settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and MacLean, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sommer et al., 2017</xref>). For example, our experimental evolution setup did not allow for horizontal transfer of siderophore receptors, a scenario that might occur in the context of polymicrobial infections and confer resistance to pyoverdine therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, our treatment approach using pyoverdine is based on the principle of paying like with like. Pathogens secrete siderophores to scavenge iron for their growth. We add a strong heterologous siderophore as treatment to withhold iron from pathogens to curb their growth. The concept of targeting bacterial infections with both natural and synthetic iron-chelators has been highlighted in the literature for quite some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kontoghiorghes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ribeiro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coraça-Huber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hatcher et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, the siderophore desferoxamine (produced by <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species) is used in clinical settings to treat iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mobarra et al., 2016</xref>). However, its efficacy as antibacterial is limited because of its low iron affinity (10<sup>27</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>, compared to pyoverdine and enterobactin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elalfy et al., 2023</xref>) and several pathogens have receptors for deferoxamine uptake and can thus use it as an iron source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eto et al., 2013</xref>). Synthetic iron chelators like deferiprone and deferasirox have been proposed as alternatives to overcome these limitations. However, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of deferiprone needed to inhibit <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was found to be up to 36.7 times higher than the plasma levels in human therapy, raising concerns about its cytotoxicity and clinical viability for treating bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Visca et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, at sub-MIC levels, deferiprone only partially suppressed the growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>A. baumannii,</italic> indicating insufficient iron sequestration from these pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Visca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Léséleuc et al., 2012</xref>). Our approach offers a distinct advantage by utilizing naturally evolved iron chelators from non-pathogenic species, which possess unique chemical structures and exceptionally high iron affinities. These properties reduce the likelihood of their exploitation as iron sources by pathogens and provide a competitive advantage over siderophores with lower iron affinities. Combined with low toxicity to hosts at therapeutically effective concentrations and minimal potential for resistance evolution, these natural chelators hold promise as a new class of effective antibacterials, either as standalone treatments or in combination with conventional antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p>We used a strain collection of 320 natural isolates, originating from soil and pond habitats.

Particularly, we used 315 isolates where sequencing of the rpoD housekeeping gene confirmed that they belong to the group of fluorescent pseudomonads that are non-pathogenic to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butaitė et al., 2017</xref>). For the remaining five isolates, the rpoD gene could not be amplified, yet they were still included in our study. Moreover, siderophore screens previously revealed that a large proportion of the isolates can produce and secrete pyoverdines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butaitė et al., 2017</xref>), the high-iron affinity siderophores we focus on in our study.

Following two washing steps with 0.8% NaCl, we adjusted the overnight cultures to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 1. For overnights of environmental isolates, we followed the same procedure when working with low sample sizes, with the only difference being that culturing occurred at 28°C. For the large-scale screening experiments, we grew environmental isolates in 200 µL LB in 96-well plates shaken at 170 rpm. Cultures from plates were then directly used for experiments. For all main experiments (screen for bioactive pyoverdines and dose–response curves), we used CAA medium (1% casamino acids, 5 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> * 3H<sub>2</sub>O,1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>*7 H<sub>2</sub>O, 25 mM HEPES buffer).

Growth was measured as OD<sub>600</sub> after 24 hr using a Tecan Infinite M-200 plate reader (Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland). We then scaled the growth of pathogens in the supernatant relative to their growth in the control treatment.

For this purpose, we have developed a new protocol that allows structure elucidation from low-volume supernatants using UHPLC-HR-MS/MS. The methodological details are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rehm et al., 2022</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rehm et al., 2023</xref>. Afterward, we assessed whether growth-inhibiting pyoverdines can be distinguished from non-inhibiting pyoverdines by their chemical properties. We focussed on polarity, CCS values, and stability upon CIU or fragmentation. To analyze chemical properties of pyoverdines, we first purified them from the supernatants using solid-phase extraction. Next, we ran the samples through an HSS C18 column of the Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) using formic acid (0.1%) as an eluent additive and MeCN as the organic phase and recorded the RTs (as a measure for polarity). We also measured the CCS values of pyoverdines and ferri-pyoverdines on a trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)-TOF-MS instrument (timsTOF Pro, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) at a Δ6 voltage of 100 V. Finally, we assessed the stability of ferri-pyoverdines with two approaches. First, we investigated the proneness of ferri-pyoverdines to undergo CIU. For this, we determined the difference in CCS values of the ferri-pyoverdines (ΔCCS) at a Δ6 voltage of 50 V (no structural unfolding is stimulated) and of 150 V (structural unfolding takes place depending on the stability of the iron complex). Second, we measured the NCE necessary to fragment 50% of ferri-pyoverdine ions (CE50). This experiment was conducted on a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ferri-pyoverdine ions were isolated and fragmented at increasing NCE using parallel reaction monitoring, while the ion intensity of the intact ion precursor was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Crude pyoverdine purification</title><p>To test the efficacy of the pyoverdines against the four focal human opportunistic pathogens (<italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [PAO1], and <italic>S. aureus</italic> [JE2]), and to assess their cytotoxicity against human cell lines, we crude-purified three pyoverdines (3A06, 3G07, s3b09). The three pyoverdines were among the five most potent ones identified in our supernatant screening assay. We adapted the method for pyoverdine purification from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butaitė et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyer et al., 1997</xref>). To stimulate pyoverdine production, 500 mL CAA medium was supplemented with 250 µM of the synthetic iron chelator 2,2’-bipyridyl to create an iron-limited environment and inoculated with 2 mL of washed overnight <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> cultures. We incubated the cultures at 28°C for 120 hr with agitation (170 rpm). Cultures were then centrifuged at 15,049 × <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. We then harvested the supernatant and adjusted its pH to 6 using 1 M HCl. We ran the supernatants over Amberlite XAD-16N resin (Sigma-Aldrich, Switzerland) columns at a rate of two drops per second and cleared the column of any salts using 500 mL Milli-Q water. Pyoverdines were then eluted with 50% methanol and fractions of 50 mL were collected. Fractions containing the highest amount of pyoverdine (measured by fluorescence, excitation: 400 nm and emission: 460 nm), were pooled. After evaporation of the methanol, we lyophilized the samples for 24 hr and stored them at –20°C. As the crude purified extracts may contain small impurities, the exact pyoverdine concentration is unknown. For the figures, concentrations were divided by 6 mg/mL (highest concentration used) and expressed as relative concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>HPLC purification of pyoverdine and ferribactin</title><p>To further validate that pyoverdines are the compounds that induce pathogen growth inhibition, we purified the most common pyoverdine (s3b09) among the most potent pyoverdines from our screens using reversed-phase HPLC. For this, we first crudely purified the pyoverdine from 9 L supernatant as described above. The crude extract was then dissolved in water and fractionated by preparative HPLC at room temperature (Agilent 1260 Infinity System, equipped with a Phenomenex Luna 5 µm C18 21.2 × 250 mm column). Ultraviolet (UV) detection was carried out at λ = 210 nm, 230 nm, 280 nm, 350 nm, 400 nm, and 460 nm. Deionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore) (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) were used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 15 mL/min. We eluted with a gradient of 5–100% solvent B in 40 min, followed by isocratic conditions at 100% solvent B for 10 min. The fractions containing pyoverdine were identified based on the HR-ESI-MS data acquired on a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (scan range 100–2500 <italic>m/z</italic>, capillary voltage 4500 V, dry temperature 200°C) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Dionex, equipped with a Kinetex 2.6 µm XB-C18 150 × 4.6 mm column; solvent A: deionized water; solvent B: acetonitrile; gradient, 5% B for 30 s increasing to 100% B in 15.5 min and then maintaining 100% B for 5 min; flow rate 0.6 mL/minute; UV–Vis detection 200–600 nm). The fractions containing pyoverdine eluting at a RT of 3.84 min in the LC-MS chromatogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) were further purified on a semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC at room temperature (Agilent 1260 Infinity System, equipped with a Phenomenex Luna 5 µm Phenyl-Hexyl 10 × 250 mm column, λ = 210 nm, 230 nm, 280 nm, 350 nm, 400 nm, and 460 nm monitored by UV detection). The elution gradient was increased from 5% to 15% solvent B for 30 min followed by a gradient shift from 15% to 100% in 5 min, and finally isocratic condition at 100% solvent B for 5 min. During the pyoverdine purification, we noted high amounts of the precursor molecule ferribactin (RT of 2.42 min in the LC-MS chromatogram; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We thus purified it alongside pyoverdine using the same method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Dose–response curves</title><p>To determine the inhibition potential of crude- and HPLC-purified pyoverdines, as well as ferribactin, we subjected <italic>A. baumannii. K. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> to serially diluted extracts. For this, the extracts were dissolved in CAA medium, filter sterilized, and diluted in the same medium. Bacterial overnight cultures were grown and prepared as described above and added to a total of 200 µL medium on a 96-well plate with four replicates per extract dilution. As positive control where growth inhibition is expected, we subjected all three pathogens to a dilution series of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (highest concentration 4 µg/mL) in the exact same way as for the extracts. We incubated the plates at 37°C statically in the plate reader and measured the OD<sub>600</sub> every 15 min for 24 hr. Before each measurement, plates were shaken for 15 s. We repeated the experiment up to five times with different initial extract starting concentrations. This was done to ensure that the full dose response to pyoverdine was captured. Thus, sample size per individual extract concentration varied between 4 and 20 replicates. We subtracted the blank values and the background values caused by the treatment of the respective extract concentration from the measured growth data and calculated the integral (area under the growth curve) using the R package Growthcurver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sprouffske and Wagner, 2016</xref>). We then expressed growth relative to the control medium, where bacteria grew in CAA without extract or antibiotic addition. Finally, we plotted extract/antibiotic concentration vs. relative growth and fitted dose–response curves (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cytotoxicity assays</title><p>To determine the cytotoxicity of pyoverdine treatments against mammalian cells, we subjected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293; Invitrogen R78007, authenticated) and mouse motor neuron-like neuroblastoma-spinal cord hybrid (NSC-34; Cedarlane CLU140, authenticated) cells to the crude extract of the three most potent pyoverdines (3A06, 3G07, s3b09). HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma, D5671) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, 10270-106), 1× GlutaMAX (Gibco, 35050-061), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122). NSC-34 cells were proliferated on Matrigel (Corning, 354234)-coated dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× GlutaMAX, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. For experiments, differentiation was induced by switching to DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco, 21331-020) supplemented with 1× GlutaMAX, 1× B27+ supplement (Gibco, 17504-044), 1× N2 supplement (Gibco, 17502-048), 20 ng/mL BDNF (PeproTech, 450-02), 20 ng/mL GDNF (PeptroTech, 450-10), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37°C with saturated humidity and an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination every 1–2 months using a PCR detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MP0035).</p><p>For the assay, 10,500 cells/well were plated on 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, 655090) and, after 48 hr, the culture medium was replaced and the pyoverdines were added at the appropriate concentrations. For this, pyoverdine stocks at 240 mg/mL were diluted in Milli-Q water such that the addition of 5 µL of the pyoverdine solution to 195 µL of the culture medium resulted in final relative concentrations between 1 and 0.016. As the exact pyoverdine concentration in the crude extracts is unknown, the above concentrations were divided by the highest concentration used (6 mg/mL) and expressed as relative concentrations in the figure. After further 48 hr, the pyoverdine-containing culture medium was removed, and cells were incubated with 1 µg/mL thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (Sigma, D5655) in 100 µL of fresh medium for 1.5 hr (NSC-34) or 40 min (HEK-293). The reaction was stopped, and formazan crystals simultaneously solubilized with the addition of 100 µL of a solution containing 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, 05030) and 0.03% HCl (Supelco, 100319). Finally, the absorbance of cell debris and other contaminants at 630 nm were subtracted from the absorbance of the solubilized formazan at 570 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Hemolysis assay</title><p>To determine the hemolytic activity of pyoverdines, we quantified sheep erythrocyte hemolysis at different pyoverdine concentrations.

Plasma was then gently aspirated, replaced by PBS, and tubes were gently inverted to mix. This washing procedure was repeated three times. Pyoverdines were diluted in PBS to final relative concentrations of 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.2, 0.02, and 0.002. PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) served as negative and positive control, respectively. 100 µL erythrocyte solution was mixed with either 100 µL pyoverdine solution or the controls in a 96-well plate in triplicates. Following an incubation at 37°C and 120 rpm for 1 hr, the plate was centrifuged at 1036 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. Subsequently, 100 µL of the supernatant were transferred to a new 96-well plate.

In a first step, we determined the mean weight of 336 final instar <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae (mean = 435 mg). For all subsequent experiments, we weighed the larvae and only used individuals with a mean weight ±20% (range: 340–530 mg). Larvae were immobilized on ice for 15 min, surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol, and randomly distributed to individual wells on 24-well plates. Ten larvae were used per infection–treatment combination. To inject bacteria and administer treatments, we used sterile needles (Sterican 26G, 0.45 × 12 mm [Braun]) and syringes (1 mL injekt-F [Braun]) attached to a syringe pump (New Era Pump Systems Inc, model NE-300) set to a flow rate of 5 mL/hr.

For this, we prepared stocks of 60 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL, and 6 mg/mL of crude pyoverdines. Since the injected treatment volume was 10 µL per larvae, the final pyoverdine concentrations were 0.6 mg, 0.3 mg, and 0.06 mg per larvae, respectively. When scaling theses concentrations to the doses used for the in vivo dose–response curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the relative pyoverdine concentrations were 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01. Pyoverdine treatments were administered 4 hr after the infection through injections. Prior to treatment, larvae were immobilized on ice for 15 min. We also applied treatments to larvae infected with sterile PBS to quantify potential negative effects of the treatment in the absence of an infection. Following treatment, larvae were put back to their allocated well of the 24-well plate and kept at 37°C in the dark.</p><p>From the 12th hour post infection (hpi) onward, we regularly checked the survival of all larvae for a total of 48 hpi. Specifically, larvae were poked with a pipette tip and individuals not responding to the physical stimulation were considered dead. We conducted three independent experiments per pathogen–treatment combination with 10 larvae per experiment, resulting in a total of 30 larvae per pathogen–treatment combination.

We used these IC50 values as treatment concentrations during experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). We also mixed different pyoverdines in double and triple combo treatments. In combo treatments, pyoverdine concentrations were equivalent to those of the single treatments, meaning that we divided the single-treatment concentrations by two or three. The experimental evolution experiment included (i) three single pyoverdine treatments (3A06, 3G07, s3b09), (ii) three double pyoverdine treatments (3A06 and 3G07, 3A06 and s3b09, 3G07, and s3b09), (iii) one triple pyoverdine treatment (3A06, 3G07, and s3b09), and (iv) one ciprofloxacin treatment for <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

Specifically, all treatments were prepared in CAA medium, then aliquoted into the respective wells of 96-well plates, and all plates were stored at –20°C. At the start, we grew the pathogens overnight, washed and diluted them as described in the ‘Materials and methods’, and transferred 2 µL of the diluted pathogens into 200 µL medium in 96-well plates. Subsequently, the plates were incubated at 37°C for 22 hr, shaken at 170 rpm. After incubation, we measured growth (OD<sub>600</sub>) of all evolving lineages with the plate reader. We then diluted the evolving cultures 1:1000 in CAA medium and added them to a fresh treatment plate thawed from the freezer. After the transfer, the new plates were again incubated at 37°C and 170 rpm agitation for 22 hr. We added glycerol to the old plates to a final concentration of 25% and stored them at –80°C. We observed a steady decrease in growth in all <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations, suggesting that we overdiluted these cultures. Consequently, we reduced the dilution to 1:10 from day 4 onward. Conversely, we observed a steady increase in growth for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> populations, suggesting that these cultures were not diluted enough.

We further included ancestor cultures of all four species. After incubation for 18 hr at 37°C and 170 rpm, we diluted overnights 1:1000 with 0.8% NaCl and subjected all evolved populations to the conditions they had evolved in. Ancestors were simultaneously exposed to the respective treatment conditions. The culturing volume and conditions matched those used during experimental evolution, but this time we incubated the plates in a plate reader, measuring OD<sub>600</sub> every 15 min to obtain growth kinetics. The population screen was repeated twice independently. From the growth kinetics, we first calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for each growth curve. AUC values were then scaled relative to the growth of the ancestor in the untreated CAA control medium. For each evolved population, we then calculated the difference in growth in comparison to the mean growth of the ancestor subjected to the same treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Phenotypic screening of evolved clones</title><p>To screen for resistant clones within populations, we selected the pathogen populations with the lowest and highest growth difference for each single treatment and for one combination treatment and picked eight random colonies.

For normally distributed data sets, we used linear models and two-sided tests for all analyses. For non-normally distributed data sets, we used nonparametric rank tests. We used ANOVA to test whether chemical properties differ between growth-inhibiting and non-inhibiting pyoverdines, in their ferri- versus apo-pyoverdine state. For the in vitro dose–response and cytotoxicity experiments, we fitted dose–response curves with either four- or five-parameter logistic regressions using the nplr package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Commo and Bot, 2016</xref>). Survival analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model or the log-rank test (adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm method) from the survival package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Therneau, 2022</xref>). We used two-sided <italic>t</italic>-tests, Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-tests, or Wilcoxon tests to compare growth differences between the ancestor and the evolved populations under treatment. To compare growth differences between the ancestor and the evolved clones under treatment, we used one- and two-way ANOVAs. To construct the cladogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, we followed the procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kramer et al., 2020</xref> using partial <italic>rpoD</italic> gene sequences with lengths ≥600 bp. We used iTOL tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Letunic and Bork, 2016</xref>) for the graphic presentation of the cladogram and to link phylogeny to the supernatant effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables a-e.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-92493-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-92493-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The raw data underlying the figures are available from the Figshare depository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26388565">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26388565</ext-link>).

Through the purification of 320 environmental isolates, 25 potential candidates were identified based on inhibition assays and further screened. The structural information and chemical composition of these candidates were determined. Using a series of well-described and standard assays, the authors show that three compounds have some effect in reducing mortality in a simple in vivo model.</p><p>The paper is well-structured and thorough; targeting virulence factors in this manner is an excellent approach. However, my enthusiasm is dampened by the mediocre effects of the compounds. A reduction in the hazard ratio is reported, indicating that the compounds are having an effect, but without comparison to other iron-chelating molecules or current standards of care, it is difficult to contextualize the significance of these reductions.</p><p>I am less convinced by a claim from the abstract: &quot;Furthermore, experimental evolution combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed reduced potentials for resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic.&quot; Perhaps this is a semantic issue, but what is meant by &quot;potential for resistance evolution&quot;? My understanding is that this refers to mutations or sets of mutations that would be favored under selective pressure, allowing the bacteria to more easily climb a fitness landscape peak. However, the authors present a different result: the bacteria did not grow better after selection in different conditions (except for the positive control using ciprofloxacin). They correctly suggest that there may be individuals in the populations that have developed resistance and recommend isolating 8 from each treatment for testing. However, they then use the mean value of these individuals to conclude that there is no difference from the ancestor. This seems incorrect-surely the point of using individuals is not to compare them as a group but to determine if any one has a growth rate outside the expected distribution. In short, Figure S10 does not seem to support the findings reported in line 417.</p><p>A final consideration for the evolution experiment is the choice of a bactericidal antibiotic. It might have been more appropriate to use a bacteriostatic drug as a control. However, I feel that additional work on this topic is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p>Similarly, it would be interesting to consider how evolving the isolates in iron-limited media would affect resistance levels. Currently, I think the difference in growth rate is attributed to the iron-scavenging nature of the siderophores. In future work, this could be tested, and an evolution experiment in which iron availability is measured could provide valuable insights. To clarify, I believe this work is not necessary for the current paper, but it would be an interesting avenue for future research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92493.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vollenweider</surname><given-names>Vera</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rehm</surname><given-names>Karoline</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chepkirui</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pérez-Berlanga</surname><given-names>Manuela</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Polymenidou</surname><given-names>Magdalini</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Piel</surname><given-names>Joern</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bigler</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kümmerli</surname><given-names>Rolf</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In an era of increasing antibiotic resistance, there is a pressing need for the development of novel sustainable therapies to tackle problematic pathogens.

The work is clearly written and the findings are supported by high-quality figures.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I do not think there are any 'weaknesses' as such. However, it is well known that siderophore production is highly plastic, typically being upregulated in response to metal limitation (as well as toxic metal stress). Did the authors quantify whether pyoverdine supplementation altered siderophore production in the focal pathogens (either through phenotypic assays / transcriptomics)? Could such a phenotypic plastic response result in an increased capacity to scavenge iron from the environment? Importantly, increased expression of siderophores has been shown to enhance pathogen virulence (e.g. Lear et al 2023: increased pyoverdine production is linked with increased virulence in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>). I really appreciate the amount of work the authors have put into this study, but I would suggest expanding the discussion a bit to include a few sentences on</p><p>(1) unintentional consequences of pyoverdine treatment (e.g. changes in gene expression and non-siderophore-related mutations (e.g. biofilm formation)) on disease dynamics/pathogen virulence:</p><p>(2) the efficacy of siderophore treatment under more natural conditions, i.e. when the pathogens have to compete with other species in the resident community (i.e. any other effects than resistance evolution through HGT of pyoverdine receptors as mentioned).</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1: We would like to thank reviewer # 1 for the positive and constructive assessment. We agree that discussing the above points is important. We have added new paragraphs in the discussion, in which we elaborate on unintentional consequences (lines 532-551) and HGT of receptors (lines 599-607).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I only have minor comments/suggestions for the authors, all listed below:</p><p>• The authors' findings show that the antibacterial activity of pyoverdine is highly context-dependent. As such, I would suggest somewhat toning down the quite general statement in the Abstract: 'Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strain could become new sustainable antibacterials against human pathogens'</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2: We agree that the pyoverdine treatment is especially potent against <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, but less so against <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The treatment success is pathogen-dependent, and we have thus modified the phrase in the abstract (lines 32-34). The new sentence now reads: 'Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.' Also in other parts of the manuscript (Results and Discussion), we emphasize that the pyoverdine treatment will likely be effective against specific pathogens (e.g., those with lower-iron affinity siderophores).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Bacteria often produce more than one type of siderophore. Do you know whether the 320 natural isolates used in this study produce any non-pyoverdine siderophores? Previous work has shown that pyochelin production is suppressed in PAO1 under a wider range of lab conditions. Do you know whether this is the case for the natural isolates used here (and rule out a potential role of non-pyoverdines in iron starvation as observed in Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3: This is a valid question. Our own bioinformatic and phenotypic assays reveal that a certain fraction of strains (~ 40%) can produce secondary siderophores (unpublished data). We now mention the existence of secondary siderophores on lines 97-100 and 123. However, we do not think that their contribution to the supernatant assay results is large since the expression of pyoverdine typically suppresses the expression of the secondary siderophores (Cornelis 2010 <italic>Appl Microbiol Biotechnol</italic>; Dumas et al. 2013 <italic>Proc B</italic>) under stringent iron limitation. Furthermore, secondary siderophores have lower iron-binding affinities than pyoverdine. Finally, both the semi-pure and ultra-pure pyoverdine extracts showed strong pathogen inhibition (Fig. 3), and we are thus confident that pyoverdine is responsible for the observed growth inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Upon first mentioning the 'mock control' in the Results section in the main text, please state what the actual treatment is.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 4: Thank you for noticing this. We now explain in more detail the actual treatment conditions used on lines 103-107 and in the caption of Figure 1. We have further removed the term 'mock' as it is confusing in this context and simple refer to the 'control treatment' in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Please mention what the different colours mean in the legend of growth recovery in Figure 1B</p></disp-quote><p>Response 5: We have clarified the colour scheme in the legend of Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Please clarify whether you used 12 or 14 strains of human pathogens (the latter number is mentioned in the results section)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 6: In the methods (lines 647-650), we now clearly specify that we used 12 strains of human pathogens in the initial supernatant screen (Figure 1). For all subsequent analyses (dose-response curves and infection experiments), we included the ESKAPE pathogens <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Please explain whether ferribactin can be used in any other way than iron chelation (e.g. can this precursor be recycled to form pyoverdine)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 7: We apologize for not having properly explained the role of ferribactin. Under natural conditions, ferribactin is not secreted. It is kept in the periplasmic space, where it matures to pyoverdine. We most likely recovered ferribactin in the supernatant because of the vigorous shaking and centrifugation involved in the pyoverdine purification protocol. We now explain this on lines 216-218. Thus, there is no ferribactin secretion and recycling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Have the authors looked at whether there is a relationship between the degree of growth arrest and phylogenetic distance? Would you expect there to be one?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 8: This is an interesting question. We have now constructed a phylogenetic tree to explore this relationship (new Figure S2). We found that strains with inhibitory supernatants were scattered across the phylogenetic tree (described on lines 129-135). However, we also found two branches on the tree on which strains with inhibitory supernatant effects were overrepresented. This matches well our previous analysis that closely related species can produce similar pyoverdine types, but that the same pyoverdine can also be produced by completely different species (Gu et al. 2024 <italic>eLife</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the Methods section, please mention you used pyoverdine-only controls in the infection assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 9: We now mention the use of pyoverdine-only controls in the Methods section (lines 788-790). Overall, we have improved the infection procedure section (starting on line 770). Thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Did you confirm whether the addition of pyoverdine resulted in lower bacterial loads in Galleria? In other words, were the observed changes in mortality solely related to changes in bacterial density?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 10: Thank you for this valid question. No, we did not test whether pyoverdine treatment reduces the bacterial load. However, we did this in the past in two studies with a similar set of pathogens (Weigert et al. 2017 <italic>Evol Appl</italic>; Schmitz et al. 2023 <italic>Proc B</italic>) and found strong correlations between <italic>G. mellonella</italic> survival and bacterial loads. We agree that it is important to understand how pyoverdine affects pathogen load in the host and we will address this point in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In your infection assay, were Galleria (n = 10) for each treatment housed in the same environment/container? If so, can you treat these as independent observations or should you use some sort of grouping variable in your survival analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 11: Thank you for pointing this out. We forgot to clarify this in the Methods section and now do so on lines 777-779. All larvae were individually housed in separate wells of a 24-well plate. There was no physical contact between larvae and no opportunity for pathogen exchange. As such, we treat each individual larvae as an independent observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this work, Vollenweider et al. examine the effectiveness of using natural products, specifically molecules that chelate iron, to treat infectious agents.

My enthusiasm is dampened by the mediocre effects of the compounds. The lack of a dose-response curve in the survivability assays suggests a limited scope for these molecules. While it is encouraging that the best survivability occurred at the lowest toxicity level, it opens questions as to how effective such molecules can be. Either the reduction in mortality was offset by using higher concentrations, which was not observed in the compound-alone test, or there is no dose-response curve. The latter would suggest to me that the variation in survivability is not due to the addition of siderophores.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 12: Thank you very much for the overall positive assessment. We understand your concern regarding the effectiveness of pyoverdines in the host. However, we wish to emphasize that hazard risks were reduced by more than 50% when treating <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Moreover, it was not so surprising to us that the treatment worked best at intermediate pyoverdine concentrations. We anticipated that pyoverdines could have negative effects for the host at relatively high concentrations because siderophore can interfere with host iron stocks (see discussion starting on line 552). Finally, dose-response curves do not necessarily need to be linear or sigmoid, they can also be hump-shaped. To better illustrate this aspect, we have now plotted the time to death for all the deceased larvae against the pyoverdine concentration gradient and fitted polynomial regression (new Fig. S6). For the above two pathogens, we found humped-shaped dose-response curves in four out of the six comparisons. We present this new analysis on lines 351-362.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also like to see how these molecules compare to other iron-chelating molecules. Desferoxamine is a bacteria-derived siderophore that is FDA-approved. However, it is not used to treat infections. Would the author consider comparing their candidate molecules to well-studied molecules? This also raises questions about the novelty of this work; I think the authors could rephrase the discussion to better reflect that bioprospecting for iron-chelating molecules has previously occurred and been successful.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 13: Thank you for the comment. The initial version of our manuscript already featured a brief discussion on other iron-chelation therapies. We have now changed the narrative to better reflect the differences of our approach to already existing iron-chelating molecules such as deferoxamine (lines 608-632).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I am concerned about the few mutations reported in the resistance study. Looking at the SI, it appears that very few mutations were seen. It is unclear what filtering the authors used to arrive at such a low number of mutations. Even filtering against mutations that were selected by adaptation to the media, it seems low that only a handful of clones had distinct mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 14: We apologise for the unclear explanations and data analysis. When reanalysing the data we indeed detected a mistake: we originally treated all genomes as clonal origin, despite the fact that we sequenced entire populations for the control treatments. We have now completely re-done the mutational analysis using the breseq pipeline as newly described in the Methods (lines 861-866) and presented in the Results (lines 421-451). We have improved the filtering process and indeed found many more mutations, including the loss of mobile genetic elements. However, it is important to note that it is not uncommon to only find a few beneficial mutations. Especially, in cases where there are selective sweeps often only a few mutations fix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper has a lot of strengths. The workflow is logical and well-executed; the only significant weakness is the effect of the molecules and the lack of an explanation for a dose-response curve in the survivability assay, especially when compared to the data reported in Figure 3. As the authors describe in lines 214-217.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 15: Thank you for this overall positive assessment. As discussed in our response 12, the effect of the molecule in the host was not weak as it decreased hazard risks by more than 50% for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Moreover, we explain that the benefit of the pyoverdine treatment (in terms of treating the infection) can be offset by adverse effects on the host, especially at high pyoverdine concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>• Compare these compounds to well-studied iron chelating molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 16: We have addressed this comment in our response 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Considering adding time of death to the analysis for the survivability. While the reduction in mortality was not large perhaps the time to death increased.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 17: This is an excellent suggestion. We have now analysed the time-to-death as a function of pyoverdine concentration (new Figure S6). Time-to-death was highly variable and sample size was fairly low for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> as many larvae survived. Nonetheless, we found hump-shaped dose-response curves in four out of six comparisons and a linear dose-response curve in one case. We now report the new analyses on lines 351-362. Finally, we like to stress once more that reduction in mortality was considerable (hazard risk reduction by more than 50%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• I would also like to see the actual growth curves of the pathogens in the SI to accompany Fig 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 18: This is a good point. We have now included the actual growth curves of the pathogens in the Supporting Information to accompany Figure 6 (new Figures S9 and S10).</p></body></sub-article></article>
