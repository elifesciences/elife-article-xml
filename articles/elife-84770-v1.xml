learning. Identifying such plasticity from neural recording data can be challenging due to feedback pathways that impede reasoning about cause and effect. We studied interactions between feedback, neural activity, and plasticity in the context of a closed-loop motor learning task for which there is disagreement about the loci and directions of plasticity: vestibulo-ocular reflex learning. We constructed a set of circuit models that differed in the strength of their recurrent feedback, from no feedback to very strong feedback. Despite these differences, each model successfully fit a large set of neural and behavioral data. However, the patterns of plasticity predicted by the models fundamentally differed, with the direction of plasticity at a key site changing from depression to potentiation as feedback strength increased. Guided by our analysis, we suggest how such models can be experimentally disambiguated. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding cerebellum-dependent motor learning, suggesting a reconciliation in which learning-related changes in the strength of synaptic inputs to Purkinje cells are compatible with seemingly oppositely directed changes in Purkinje cell spiking activity. More broadly, these results demonstrate how changes in neural activity over learning can appear to contradict the sign of the underlying plasticity when either internal feedback or feedback through the environment is present.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>feedback</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS072406</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC004154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship DGE-114747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>Hannah L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0801700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>Hannah L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>Hannah L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive modeling approach reconciles experimental observations with classic plasticity mechanisms in the cerebellar cortex, demonstrating how learning-related changes in neural activity can appear to contradict the sign of the underlying plasticity when feedback is present.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic plasticity distributed across multiple sites of a circuit is thought to underlie changes in behavior. To understand how such plasticity supports learning, it is necessary to identify sites of plasticity, determine how plasticity at these sites produces changes in neural activity, and link these changes to behavior. Thus far, such characterization has proven difficult in the vertebrate brain.</p><p>A key challenge is the ubiquity of feedback loops in neural systems. Feedback loops can be internal to the brain — as in the recurrent circuits thought to underlie short-term memory, predictive coding, and gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Constantinidis and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Douglas and Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fang et al., 2023</xref>) — or partially external to the brain, arising whenever a behavior influences sensory input from the environment that, in turn, influences subsequent behavior, such as during control of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robinson, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950</xref>). Such feedback loops make it challenging to identify the sites of plasticity that underlie learning. Because direct measurement of synaptic strength is extremely difficult in intact behaving animals, a common approach is to instead infer changes in synaptic strength from observed changes in neural firing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gilbert and Thach, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yao and Dan, 2001</xref>). As a simplifying assumption, neural systems are commonly treated as if they are feedforward circuits, with changes in neural activity at a particular site attributed to plasticity somewhere upstream of that site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in systems with feedback loops, the distinction between upstream and downstream is ill-defined, so that changes in the activity of a neuron after learning do not necessarily reflect plasticity in its nominally upstream inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, feedback loops can confound the inference of changes in synaptic strength from observed changes in neural activity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Feedback can obscure plasticity in neural systems.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Purely feedforward circuit. A decreased neural response to a stimulus after learning can be attributed to LTD of excitatory synapses (or equivalently, LTP of inhibitory synapses) upstream of the recorded neuron. <italic>Triangles</italic>, plastic synapses. (<bold>B</bold>) Recurrent circuit, with both internal and external feedback. The same decreased neural response can no longer be definitively attributed to plasticity at nominally upstream sites. Instead, plasticity at inputs to a second site that is a postsynaptic target of the recorded neuron, and thus appears to be downstream, may feed back to affect the recorded neuron’s activity. Such ‘downstream’ plasticity may mask the effects of ‘upstream’ plasticity. (<bold>C</bold>) Feedforward circuit proposed by the Marr-Albus-Ito model to support cerebellum-dependent motor learning. Before learning, vestibular (head velocity) inputs to the brainstem drive compensatory eye movements that are directed opposite to rotation of the head. After learning, LTD of vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells reduces inhibition onto brainstem neurons, increasing eye movement amplitude. (<bold>D</bold>) Simplified version of the feedback circuit proposed by the Miles-Lisberger model. After learning, LTP of vestibular inputs to the brainstem drives larger contraversive eye movements during the VOR in the dark. Efference copy of these eye velocity commands (<italic>red pathway</italic>) leads to decreased Purkinje cell activity, despite LTP of the vestibular input to Purkinje cells.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84770-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Such interactions between circuit feedback and plasticity are at the heart of a decades-long debate about how the cerebellum implements motor learning. The classic Marr-Albus-Ito model assumes a feedforward architecture in which errors are reduced through changes in the synaptic inputs to Purkinje cells, the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>). This is consistent with a large number of studies suggesting that long-term depression (LTD) occurs at the excitatory parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells in response to error signals carried by climbing fiber inputs, effectively implementing reinforcement learning through error-driven plasticity (‘parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coesmans et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gilbert and Thach, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kimpo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sakurai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Silva et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang and Lisberger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yang and Lisberger, 2014</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, later experimental observations raised the possibility that the learning-related changes in Purkinje cell firing could instead be due to feedback of changes occurring <italic>outside</italic> of the cerebellar cortex (‘Miles-Lisberger model’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hirata and Highstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisberger, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lisberger et al., 1994c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miles and Lisberger, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, these experiments were interpreted as evidence that parallel fiber-Purkinje cell plasticity within the cerebellar cortex was in the opposite direction (long-term potentiation, LTP) from the LTD predicted by the Marr-Albus-Ito model. These opposing conclusions about the sites and directions of plasticity underlying cerebellum-dependent motor learning have remained unreconciled for decades. In particular, it was not clear whether a model consistent with parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD could also explain the full suite of experimental observations that motivated the Miles-Lisberger model.</p><p>Here, we use a data-driven, computational approach to determine how the strength of feedback in a circuit determines the sites and directions of synaptic plasticity required to accomplish a given change in neural output and behavior. We aggregated neural and behavioral data from a large set of experiments testing oculomotor performance and learning, and fit a series of computational models that systematically differed in the strength of internal feedback. We find that models with weak or no internal feedback are consistent with climbing fiber-driven LTD at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and explain all experimental observations, including paradoxical changes in neural activity during a closed-loop visual task that appear to contradict the underlying plasticity. Our results provide a solution to a longstanding debate in the cerebellar field, and more broadly demonstrate how, in closed-loop systems, synaptic strength and neural activity at a given site can, counter-intuitively, change in opposite directions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oculomotor learning circuit and closed-loop modeling strategy</title><p>We perform our studies within the context of the learned control of eye movements. Oculomotor learning provides a powerful experimental system because it regulates a relatively simple transformation from sensory inputs to motor output in a circuit whose anatomy and physiology have been extensively characterized. The oculomotor system generates eye movements to stabilize visual images on the retina during both motion of the body and motion of visual objects in the world. Vestibularly driven eye movements, known as the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), stabilize gaze by counter-rotating the eyes in response to head movement and occur even in complete darkness. Visually driven eye movements, including ‘smooth pursuit’ eye movements that track a moving target, stabilize images on the retina in response to visual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Noda and Suzuki, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rambold et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Both the visual and vestibular functions of the oculomotor system are remarkably linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagnall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">du Lac and Lisberger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lisberger and Fuchs, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McElvain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Payne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Walter and Khodakhah, 2006</xref>). Hence, we modeled this circuit with a network of linear temporal filters, <italic>k</italic><sub>XY</sub>, each representing the transformation of a signal over a (mono- or multi-synaptic) anatomical neural pathway to node X from node Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since a given pathway may contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the net contribution of the excitatory and inhibitory synapses within each pathway is represented by a single linear filter that can have positive or negative value at any given time point. Vestibular sensory input encoding angular head velocity (H) drives eye movements (E) via a ‘direct pathway’ through brainstem nuclei (<italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>black</italic>), and an indirect side loop through Purkinje cells (P) in the floccular complex of the cerebellar cortex (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>black</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Voogd et al., 2012</xref>).

The visual pathway is subdivided into a ‘retinal slip’ (R) pathway conveying motion of images across the retina with a delay (<italic>k</italic><sub>PR</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>orange</italic>), and a ‘visual prediction’ (T) pathway providing non-delayed information about predictable target motion (<italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <italic>orange</italic>). While not needed to explain the main qualitative results of our paper, the visual prediction pathway was included to model oculomotor tracking of predictable visual targets with no delay or in the absence of sustained retinal slip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker and Fuchs, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kowler and Steinman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leung and Kettner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Stone and Lisberger, 1990</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kowler et al., 2019</xref>).

Some filters did not depend on feedback strength: the filters conveying vestibular input and Purkinje cell activity to the brainstem, <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>, were nearly identical in all models, indicating that these pathways are well constrained by the data regardless of the strength of efference copy feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, the filters carrying vestibular and visual inputs to Purkinje cells did vary with feedback strength. The vestibular input filter to Purkinje cells, <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>, changed from small and net negative in the No Feedback model to large and net positive in the Strong Feedback model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Here, a positive filter weight indicates a net excitatory effect from an ipsiversive stimulus (e.g. increased excitation of a Purkinje cell in the right cerebellar hemisphere during head rotation to the right) and an inhibitory effect of a contraversive stimulus, whereas a negative filter weight indicates the opposite. The small net amplitude of the <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> filter in the No Feedback model, evidenced by the small steady state step response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), directly reflects the experimental observation that Purkinje cells have minimal modulation of firing rate during the VOR. By contrast, in the Strong Feedback model, the same minimal modulation is achieved by a net positive <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> filter that offsets the negative efference copy input through <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>.

This is visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for the steady-state component of the response by plotting the model cost function as the relevant filter parameters were varied. Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the two brainstem pathways, <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>, were fully constrained, as illustrated by the single minimum in the cost function landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

However, our analysis shows that the degeneracy is actually between all three (vestibular, efference copy, and visual) pathways rather than just the vestibular and efference copy feedback pathways. Ultimately, this degeneracy reflects that there are only two independently controllable variables, the vestibular and visual target stimuli, yet three unknown input filters. Eye velocity is not an independent variable, because it is determined by how these stimuli are processed by the circuit. In contrast, there are only two unknown input filters to the brainstem, and thus they are both fully constrained. The practical implication of this analysis is that the vestibular, visual, and efference copy feedback filters to Purkinje cells cannot be fully determined using neural recording and behavioral data alone, but require an additional experimental strategy.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cost function landscape illustrates degeneracy of input pathways to Purkinje cells, but not to the brainstem.</title><p>Degeneracy in the VOR circuit model fits, illustrated using a simplified model with merged retinal slip and visual prediction pathways (see Materials and methods).

Whereas these changes in behavior and neural activity are well established, longstanding controversy concerns the sites and directions of plasticity underlying these changes.</p><p>The Marr-Albus-Ito model proposes that the observed decrease in Purkinje cell firing is caused by a decrease in the strength of vestibular input to Purkinje cells via LTD of vestibular parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ito and Kano, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Marr, 1969</xref>). However, the Marr-Albus-Ito model does not consider the implications of a potential efference copy feedback pathway to Purkinje cells. In particular, efference copy signals encoding altered eye movements might drive altered Purkinje cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisberger, 1994a</xref>).</p><p>Later studies by Miles and Lisberger attempted to isolate the contribution of vestibular input to Purkinje cell firing from any influence of efference copy signaling. They used a behavioral paradigm known as VOR cancellation, in which the eyes track a visual stimulus that moves exactly with the head, thus canceling the normal VOR eye movement response. During this paradigm, eye velocity in the orbit is close to zero — along with, presumably, any associated efference copy signals. Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation was thus attributed to vestibular input alone. Surprisingly, Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation <italic>increases</italic> after learning — opposite to the <italic>decrease</italic> in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) observed during an identical vestibular stimulus presented in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisberger, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miles and Lisberger, 1981</xref>). This increase in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation was interpreted as evidence that the vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells must undergo potentiation, rather than depression, during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miles and Lisberger, 1981</xref>). The decrease in Purkinje cell activity observed during the VOR in the dark was then attributed to plasticity in the brainstem (<italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>) that is relayed to the cerebellar cortex via efference copy feedback (<italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), rather than to LTD of vestibular parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>). The Marr-Albus-Ito and Miles-Lisberger models therefore differ fundamentally in the plastic changes that they infer in both the cerebellar cortex (vestibular pathway undergoes LTD vs. LTP, respectively) and in the brainstem (no plasticity vs. plasticity).</p><p>To assess these seemingly contradictory hypotheses, we examined the linear filters in our models before and after learning (Materials and methods).

A limitation of this hypothesis is its implicit assumption that visual input to the Purkinje cells was negligible during VOR cancellation because retinal slip velocity was close to zero. However, for an animal to ‘cancel the VOR’, it must use visual input to keep its eyes on the target; therefore, even retinal slip that is small but nonzero must have a significant influence somewhere in the oculomotor circuitry and cannot be discounted.</p><p>To determine whether such potentiation of the vestibular input to Purkinje cells is necessary to account for the responses of Purkinje cells during VOR cancellation, we examined the response of each model after learning. Note that the models were fit to reproduce learned changes in Purkinje cell activity only during the VOR in the dark, leaving changes in firing during VOR cancellation as a prediction of the model. In contrast to the previous interpretation, we found that all models — both those with potentiation and those with depression of the vestibular input to Purkinje cells, <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> — successfully replicated this increase in Purkinje cell activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Explanation for changes in neural activity during VOR cancellation after learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Response of a population of simulated Purkinje cells during VOR cancellation compared to response during visual pursuit before (Pre) and after (Post) VOR learning for the No Feedback model.

Because eye velocity was small during VOR cancellation and, consistent with experiments, did not change substantially following learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo and Raymond, 2010</xref>; Materials and methods), efference copy feedback to Purkinje cells made essentially no contribution to the increase in Purkinje cell activity after learning.</p><p>More surprisingly, the No Feedback model could also reproduce the observed increase in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation after learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), despite net <italic>depression</italic> of the vestibular input to Purkinje cells (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This was accomplished by the second feedback pathway in the circuit: external negative feedback of visual error, which drives corrective motor commands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). The visual feedback loop allowed the VOR to be nearly completely canceled, despite plasticity in the brainstem (<italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>) and cerebellar cortex (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>) that would otherwise drive larger-than-normal eye movement commands in response to vestibular input. In essence, the visual feedback loop ‘works harder’ by increasing its input to Purkinje cells after learning. This results in more suppression of the brainstem, thereby counteracting the learned increase in the VOR.</p><p>Note that the visual pathways in our model do not undergo plasticity (but see Discussion for implications of considering plasticity in the visual pathways). Thus, consistent with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisberger, 1994a</xref>), we do not predict any change in visual pursuit behavior after learning. How do the visual pathways ‘work harder’ if they do not undergo plasticity? In the simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the visual prediction pathway adjusts its contribution to the eye movement command on the fly in order to maintain cancellation performance. While inclusion of the visual prediction pathways provided a closer quantitative match to the full dataset (see Materials and methods), the qualitative results did not depend upon visual prediction. Specifically, in separate simulations that did not contain a prediction pathway and thus only relied on retinal slip, Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation also increased after learning in all models. In this case, Purkinje cell activity increased because VOR cancellation performance became slightly worse over learning, leading to more retinal slip, and thus increased retinal slip feedback to Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, this analysis demonstrates that visual negative feedback, regardless of the exact implementation, can cause Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation to change in the opposite direction to that expected from the underlying plasticity of vestibular inputs.</p><p>In both the No Feedback and Strong Feedback models, the learned increases in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation depended on the existence of plasticity in the direct pathway through the brainstem. When the vestibular input to the brainstem (<italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>) was held fixed during learning, motor learning was still successful at the level of the eye movement output during the VOR in the dark, but the learned increase in Purkinje cell firing during VOR cancellation no longer occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and F</xref><italic>, dashed lines</italic>). This is because eye velocity responses during VOR cancellation do not change substantially after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo and Raymond, 2010</xref>). Thus, when brainstem plasticity is intact, Purkinje cell firing must increase to offset the potentiated brainstem pathway. However, if brainstem plasticity is removed, Purkinje cell firing must not change if eye velocity responses are to remain unchanged. Therefore, in each model, two sites of plasticity—in the brainstem and in the cerebellar cortex—were required to explain the apparent paradox that learning decreases Purkinje cell firing measured during the VOR in the dark but increases firing measured during VOR cancellation. Note, however, that while both sites of plasticity are required to fit the current dataset, they are not both required for VOR learning in general (see Discussion, ‘Implications for systems consolidation of cerebellar learning’). Overall, this analysis shows that weak feedback models, which predict depression in the vestibular pathway as observed experimentally, are also compatible with the counterintuitive changes in neural activity during VOR cancellation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Transient perturbation of activity distinguishes weak and strong feedback</title><p>The above results demonstrate that circuit feedback and circuit plasticity are interdependent — knowledge of one constrains the other. Here we use an additional, orthogonal approach to functionally assess circuit feedback by directly perturbing neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tsodyks et al., 1997</xref>). A purely feedforward system should only respond briefly to transient stimulation, with a time course dominated by the intrinsic time constants of its neurons and synapses. In contrast, a system dominated by strong positive feedback should instead integrate transient stimulation, resulting in a prolonged response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Robinson, 1989</xref>). Mathematically, the response to such a perturbation of activity represents an independent constraint in addition to those provided by sensory-driven changes in activity. As a result, sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the previously observed degeneracy in the strengths of Purkinje cell inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is eliminated when a ‘Purkinje cell stimulation’ condition is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). To leverage this constraint and quantitatively probe the strength of circuit feedback, model simulations were compared to the results of a previous study in which eye movements were evoked by electrical stimulation of floccular Purkinje cells in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisberger, 1994a</xref>). In this experiment, brief stimulus trains (5 pulses at 200 Hz) applied in the absence of visual or vestibular stimulation evoked smooth eye velocity responses that decayed rapidly after stimulus offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We mimicked this experiment in our models by increasing Purkinje cell firing rate for 25 ms in the absence of vestibular or visual input. Models with weak or intermediate feedback produced brief eye velocity responses, akin to the data, whereas models with strong feedback produced prolonged eye velocity responses, unlike the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Although the precise strength of the efference copy feedback is difficult to ascertain because the time constant of decay of responses changes only gradually until the gain of the feedback loop approaches one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), this suggests that feedback in this circuit is relatively weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>; see Discussion).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Circuit perturbations suggest functionally weak efference copy feedback.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cost function landscape for the simplified model when a Purkinje cell stimulation condition is added.

We show how this increase in activity can instead be explained by visual feedback. However, our results also support the presence of a site of plasticity in the brainstem pathway, as proposed in the Miles-Lisberger model. We thus suggest a resolution of a longstanding debate about how the cerebellum implements motor learning, and exemplify more broadly how feedback can obscure underlying plasticity in even a relatively simple closed-loop system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Compatibility of weak and strong efference copy feedback models with error-driven parallel fiber-Purkinje cell plasticity</title><p>A primary motivation for this study was the question of whether we could identify models in which the inferred changes over learning were consistent with error-driven plasticity in the cerebellar cortex weakening synaptic inputs that are correlated with error. In the classic model of cerebellar learning, climbing fiber activity encoding motor errors drives LTD of parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells that were recently active and hence could have contributed to the error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Raymond and Medina, 2018</xref>). In this study, we found that only models with weak or no efference copy feedback were compatible with depression of parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells, and thus with error-driven plasticity in the cerebellar cortex (see discussion below about alternate implementations of error-driven plasticity that are functionally equivalent). Our study therefore reconciles results from VOR learning with other cerebellum-dependent motor learning paradigms, such as eye blink and smooth pursuit learning, where climbing fiber activity has been less controversially associated with depression of active parallel fiber inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lisberger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Raymond et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Raymond and Medina, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, models with strong efference copy feedback predict net potentiation rather than depression of vestibular input to the cerebellar cortex, and make additional predictions that are difficult to reconcile with biology. First, the response to transient stimulation of models with relatively strong feedback was incompatible with the experimentally observed response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Second, the Strong Feedback model with feedback gain equal to 1 is on the brink of instability and thus requires that any change in the strength of the vestibular input to the Purkinje cells (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>) must be precisely offset by a change in the strength of the vestibular inputs to the brainstem (<italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>) to avoid runaway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lisberger and Sejnowski, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Despite this evidence against models with strong efference copy feedback, there is almost certainly some efference copy input to the cerebellum. Signals related to motor output have been identified as inputs to the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Person, 2019</xref>). Anatomically, the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi and the medial vestibular nucleus provide eye movement-related mossy fiber afferents to the cerebellar flocculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Escudero et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Escudero et al., 1996a</xref>). These pathways could reflect true loops, or they could involve ‘spiraling’ connections between the cerebellum and other regions rather than closed feedback loops onto the same cells, in which case they would be functionally identical to the feedforward model. For example, one population of cells in the medial vestibular nucleus could receive input from Purkinje cells, while a separate population sends output to the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). To the extent that true feedback loops are present, our analysis suggests that their functional feedback strength is weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the present results increase our understanding of VOR learning by predicting the range of efference copy feedback strengths that are compatible with error-driven plasticity at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse. More generally, a similar strategy could be applied to other learning paradigms in order to determine the quantitative relationship between circuit feedback and plasticity of specific input pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for systems consolidation of cerebellar learning</title><p>Studies of cerebellar learning suggest that memories rapidly form in the cerebellar cortex before being gradually transferred to the brainstem or cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kassardjian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shutoh et al., 2006</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Zeeuw et al., 2021</xref>). Such consolidation from a faster-learning site to a slower-learning site is known as systems consolidation and has been shown theoretically to mitigate the ‘stability-plasticity dilemma’ of allowing fast learning without over-writing old memories. The model presented here represents a single time point of learning, with most of the post-learning experimental data coming from animals that were trained on previous days as well as the day of recording (Materials and methods). Due to this previous training, some consolidation of learning would be expected, consistent with the brainstem plasticity that we inferred. However, a different distribution of plasticity between the cerebellar and brainstem sites would be expected at other times. Before consolidation, learning-related decreases in Purkinje cell firing during the VOR may be supported solely by plasticity in the cerebellar cortex. If this is the case, then our model predicts that ‘paradoxical’ increases in Purkinje cell responses occurring during VOR cancellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) would not be observed at the earliest stages of learning before brainstem plasticity has occurred. Following consolidation, if learning becomes fully independent of the cerebellar cortex, then this has interesting implications for the final sign of plasticity of the vestibular input to Purkinje cells (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>): for the cerebellar cortex to return to its original, pre-learning output, either (1) if there is no efference copy feedback, the vestibular pathway onto Purkinje cells needs to reset to its original strength, resulting in zero net plasticity, or (2) if there is efference copy feedback, the vestibular and efference copy pathways need to provide exactly canceling inputs during performance of the VOR. In the latter case, in the absence of plasticity in the efference copy pathway, potentiation in the vestibular pathway (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>) would be required to offset changes in input from the efference copy pathway due to brainstem plasticity. This provides the possibility that the net sign of plasticity in vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells could be depression at early stages of learning and potentiation after complete consolidation of learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relation to other sloppy models</title><p>In complex biological circuits, many different configurations of biological parameters can enable a circuit to accomplish the same task.

Such studies used only a single frequency sinusoidal stimulus, making position and negative acceleration predictors strongly correlated, and delays and phase shifts difficult to distinguish.

However, it is reasonable to expect that the efference copy and visual inputs to Purkinje cells may be governed by the same correlational plasticity rule thought to control plasticity at the vestibular parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, in which elevated climbing fiber activity drives depression of recently active parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells. We did not include plasticity of these inputs because they were not needed to fit the available data. However, we can make qualitative predictions about the effects of applying the correlational plasticity rule to these inputs.</p><p>We first consider the correlational plasticity rule applied to the efference copy pathway. This pathway (<italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>) is driven by ipsiversive eye velocity, whereas climbing fiber activity in the flocculus is driven by contraversive retinal slip and suppressed by ipsiversive slip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Raymond and Lisberger, 1998</xref>). During learning to increase the VOR, ipsiversive eye movements are accompanied by ipsiversive retinal slip. Hence, activation of parallel fibers carrying efference copy signals should be accompanied by little or no climbing fiber activity, which <italic>in vitro</italic> has been shown to induce potentiation of the parallel fibers inputs to Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crepel and Jaillard, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Suvrathan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we predict net potentiation of <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub> for learned increases in the VOR. Applying similar logic to learned decreases in the VOR predicts net depression of <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>. However, since the amplitude of eye movements is small during training to decrease the VOR, the plastic changes may be smaller in this case. In both cases, the changes in <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub> are in the correct direction to support learning of amplified or attenuated eye movements, respectively. Changes in <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub> would also lead to alterations of VOR dynamics, as well as amplitude, due to changing the strength of the efference copy feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lisberger and Sejnowski, 1992</xref>).</p><p>For the visual pathway, the correlational learning rule predicts potentiation of <italic>k</italic><sub>PR</sub> during both learned increases and decreases in the VOR, because visual error simultaneously drives climbing fiber and parallel fiber input in the same direction, so parallel fiber-climbing fiber correlations are independent of the sign of visual error. This may explain the increase in Purkinje cell firing during smooth pursuit that is observed after <italic>both</italic> directions of VOR learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blazquez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miles et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>We note that the correlational learning rule discussed here involves another type of feedback in the VOR circuit: motor errors are fed back to the cerebellar cortex from the external world via climbing fibers. Such feedback for learning operates on a slower timescale than the feedback of the efference copy and visual pathways in our model, which affect circuit dynamics on the fast timescale of behavior. Thus, our conclusions that efference copy feedback is likely not strong in this circuit does not preclude an important role for other types of feedback, including feedback for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boven et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-2"><title>Implementation of error-driven plasticity in cerebellar cortex</title><p>Our model is agnostic to the biological mechanism by which the vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells undergo net ‘depression’. For example, instead of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse undergoing LTD, the parallel fiber-interneuron synapse or the interneuron-Purkinje cell synapse could undergo LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jörntell et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, instead of ipsiversive vestibular inputs undergoing LTD, contraversive vestibular inputs could undergo LTP, since there are two cerebellar flocculi located bilaterally which converge to move the eyes. Therefore, our models with weak efference copy feedback are consistent with multiple plasticity mechanisms, including a contribution to VOR learning from LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boyden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">du Lac et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Titley et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4-3"><title>Visual input</title><p>We modeled visual input only to the cerebellar cortex, motivated by studies that show large decreases in the amplitude of smooth pursuit eye movements following lesions of the floccular complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belton and McCrea, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burde et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Estanol et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rambold et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Westheimer and Blair, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zee et al., 1981</xref>). There is some anatomical evidence for direct visual input to the brainstem as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaban, 1983</xref>), and our model could be extended to implement this. This additional visual pathway would make the inputs to the brainstem site degenerate when fitting to neural and behavioral data alone, similar to the degeneracy demonstrated among the three pathways onto the Purkinje cells. Models fit to data collected after complete lesions of the floccular complex, or synaptic blockade of synaptic input to Purkinje cells, could provide an additional constraint to resolve this degeneracy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Experiments to further test the strength of efference copy feedback</title><p>Our two lines of evidence for weak efference copy feedback—compatibility with climbing fiber driven LTD in the cerebellar cortex, and brief responses to transient stimulation—are both consistent with a range of weak to moderate efference copy feedback strengths. The functional impact of such feedback to Purkinje cells could be more directly assessed by comparing the motor response to Purkinje cell stimulation in the presence versus absence of parallel fiber input. One study in mice did just that by blocking granule cell activity, which appeared to have little effect on the dynamics of the motor response to Purkinje cell stimulation, supportive of a weak feedback model in mice, although this was not quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wada et al., 2014</xref>). If efference copy pathways can be anatomically identified, a direct experimental test of strong versus weak feedback would be to measure the impact of eliminating those inputs. Finally, as described above, our weak feedback models predict that if VOR cancellation is measured immediately after training, before consolidation has occurred, then paradoxical increases in Purkinje cell activity will no longer be observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data set</title><p>Four datasets were used to capture neural and behavioral dynamics before and after learning. First, neural and behavioral data before learning (‘Dataset 1’; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were obtained from two male rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) trained to perform a visual fixation task. A subset of this dataset has been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kimpo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Raymond and Lisberger, 1998</xref>). Briefly, neural responses were recorded extracellularly from Purkinje cells in the floccular complex of the cerebellar cortex while the monkeys made horizontal eye movements in response to various combinations of visual and vestibular stimuli. Vestibular stimuli consisted of passive whole-body rotation in the horizontal plane. Visual stimuli consisted of a horizontally moving target subtending 0.5° of visual angle, which was accompanied by a larger black-and-white pattern subtending 20° to 30° of visual angle for all stimulus conditions except for smooth pursuit. Four combinations of visual and vestibular stimuli were delivered: head movements in the dark (‘Vestibular only’, which elicits the VOR), visual target motion with the head stationary (‘Visual only’, which elicits smooth pursuit eye movements), visual target and head motion at the same speed but in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, ‘Vestibular + visual’, also referred to as ×2 because accurate tracking requires compensatory eye movements that are twice as large as normal), and visual target and head motion at the same speed and in the same direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, ‘Vestibular – visual’, also referred to as ×0 because accurate tracking requires <italic>no</italic> rotation of the eyes in their sockets, and also known as ‘VOR cancellation’ since normal VOR eye movements are suppressed). These combinations were delivered as sine waves in stimulus velocity with frequencies of 0.5 Hz, 2 Hz, 5 Hz, and 10 Hz at ±10 °/s, or as steps in stimulus velocity with durations of 80 ms, 150 ms, 250 ms, and 500 ms at 15 °/s. Smooth pursuit data were only available for 0.5 Hz sine waves (delivered at ±31.4 °/s), resulting in a total of 25 distinct conditions. Eye position (angle of the eye relative to the head) was measured using the scleral search coil method.</p><p>Eye velocity and neural activity from Dataset 1 were further processed as follows. Eye velocity was calculated by differentiating eye position. Saccades were removed from eye velocity traces using an automatic threshold algorithm with a threshold of 30 °/s. To allow comparison across datasets and with previous studies, we analyzed horizontal gaze velocity Purkinje cells (HGVPs), which are the largest subpopulation of floccular Purkinje cells and are widely considered to be important for horizontal gaze control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Katoh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref>). Purkinje cells were considered HGVPs if (1) during smooth pursuit, firing rate was modulated by at least ± 10 sp/s and the phase difference between peak firing rate and peak ipsiversive eye velocity was less than 45°; (2) during VOR cancellation, firing rate was modulated by at least ± 10 sp/s and the phase difference between peak firing rate and peak ipsiversive head velocity was less than 45°; and (3) firing rate modulation was greater during horizontal than during vertical smooth pursuit. Purkinje cell firing rates were calculated by convolving raw simple spikes times with a 10 ms standard deviation Gaussian filter. Baseline firing rates were removed by subtracting a moving average calculated over an 11 s window. Eye velocity and Purkinje cell firing rates were then averaged across stimulus cycles for each cell. Neurons were only recorded on one side of the brain, so to account for the corresponding population in the opposite hemisphere, Purkinje cell responses to ipsiversive stimulation were averaged together with the inverted response to contraversive stimulation. Finally, data were averaged across all cells to create mean Purkinje cell firing rate and mean eye velocity traces for each stimulus condition.</p><p>The remaining datasets were used to fit changes that occurred after learning. Dataset 2 was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ramachandran and Lisberger, 2005</xref> and consisted of VOR <italic>behavior only</italic> in <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> before and after learning. In that study, the VOR was tested at 15 different frequencies from 0.5 to 50 Hz in three monkeys, both before learning and after several days of training to increase or decrease the gain of the VOR. We averaged the reported gain and phase of the eye movement response across all three monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Note that ‘VOR gain’ is a normalized measure of eye movement amplitude during the VOR, not to be confused with efference copy feedback gain. The 12.5 Hz point was excluded as an outlier since it was reported to likely be influenced by a mechanical issue and it was not seen in the one monkey tested using a more reliable vestibular stimulation technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ramachandran and Lisberger, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Datasets 3 and 4 consisted of changes in <italic>Purkinje cell activity</italic> after learning from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Watanabe, 1985</xref>. Both of these studies characterized the amplitude of Purkinje cell activity during the VOR before and after learning in monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> and <italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>, respectively), using low frequency 0.3 Hz sine waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Watanabe, 1985</xref>) or steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref>) in vestibular stimulus velocity. Both the steady-state changes (averaged 100–200 ms after step onset) and transient changes (peak firing rate measured 0–50 ms after step onset) after learning reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref> were included in the cost function. Learning-related changes in neural activity at higher sinusoidal frequencies have not been reported. To account for different amounts of behavioral learning (change in VOR gain) in different studies, we normalized the change in Purkinje cell modulation by the change in VOR performance. The resulting experimentally reported changes were: for the 0.3 Hz sine waves experiments, 0.72 sp/s per °/s head velocity per fractional change in VOR gain for VOR-decrease learning and −0.55 for VOR-increase learning during 0.3 Hz sine waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Watanabe, 1985</xref>); and for the step response experiments, 1.36 for VOR-decrease learning and −0.75 for VOR-increase learning for the sustained component, and 1.62 for VOR-increase learning and –1.01 for VOR-decrease learning for the transient component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref>). The low-frequency results from the two studies were averaged to yield target changes of 1.04 sp/s per °/s head velocity per fractional change in VOR gain during VOR-decrease learning, and −0.65 during VOR-increase learning. A large penalty was applied for deviations from the desired change in steady state Purkinje cell modulation. This led to the desired changes being achieved after learning (1.04 sp/s per °/s and −0.65 sp/s per °/s during VOR-decrease and VOR-increase learning, respectively). A change in behavior of 60% (e.g. VOR gain increase from 1.0 to 1.6) was simulated, comparable to the changes achieved in these studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Model implementation</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Model structure</title><p>The model architecture was constrained by anatomy, similar to previous models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clopath et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dean and Porrill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisberger, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lisberger and Sejnowski, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miles and Lisberger, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tabata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yamazaki and Nagao, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Anatomically, in the direct pathway, vestibular signals (<italic>H</italic>) from the semicircular canals travel through Scarpa’s ganglion to excite the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei, which directly inhibit motor neurons in the oculomotor nuclei to produce contraversive eye movements (<italic>E</italic>). The motor output from this direct pathway is modified by the indirect pathway through the cerebellum, in which the vestibular signals travel through the cerebellar cortex via granule cells and Purkinje cells, before reuniting in the vestibular nucleus. In addition to vestibular signals, Purkinje cells in the floccular complex of the cerebellar cortex also receive visual and eye velocity-related signals as described in the main text.</p><p>Note that Purkinje cells have an unusually high baseline firing rate (~50–100 Hz); in our model, this baseline is subtracted, and bidirectional modulation of firing rate is represented by values above and below zero. In the biological circuit, both Purkinje cells and their target neurons in the vestibular nuclei are tonically active, due to intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagnall et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, decreases in Purkinje cell firing release the target neuron from inhibition, causing the target neuron to fire more.

The absolute minimum latency of each temporal filter was set to 5 ms for <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>, and 1 ms for <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>, which resulted in similar latencies to the peak of the first basis vector of 7 ms for <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub> and 7.5 ms for <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>, with latencies to the half-max of the first basis vector of 6 ms for <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub> and 4 ms for <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>, generally consistent with reported latencies in the VOR circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">du Lac et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lisberger, 1984</xref>). The minimum latency of <italic>k</italic><sub>PR</sub> was set to 60 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krauzlis and Lisberger, 1994</xref>).</p><p>For the temporal filter conveying efference copy feedback to Purkinje cells, <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>, the temporal dynamics were represented by an exponential filter with a time constant of 3 ms, approximating a fast monosynaptic connection in order to allow the full range of frequencies of the VOR stimulus to be well-fit by the Strong Feedback model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The amplitude of this filter was set to make the total steady-state gain of the efference copy feedback loop vary from zero (‘No Feedback’) to one (‘Strong Feedback’) in steps of 0.1 to create a series of otherwise identical models. The total steady-state feedback gain corresponded to the time integral (or, in discretized time, sum) of the convolution of the two filters comprising the feedback loop, <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. For each model, the relative strength of <italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub> could vary, but the total steady-state gain <italic>g</italic> was held fixed. Note that the gain of this feedback loop is positive: the Purkinje cell to brainstem pathway is inhibitory (because Purkinje cells are inhibitory), the brainstem to eye velocity command pathway is inhibitory (to achieve counter-rotation of the eyes in response to head turns), and the feedback of this eye velocity command back to Purkinje cells (<italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>) is positive. Thus, the loop overall represents positive feedback, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miles and Lisberger, 1981</xref>.</p><p>For the visual prediction pathway <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub>, which represents visual prediction signals, sometimes referred to as ‘extraretinal’ signals, we parameterized the filter as follows. For the experimental paradigms using sinusoidal visual stimuli, we fit the amplitude and phase of <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub> separately for each frequency in the data (0.5 Hz, 2 Hz, 5 Hz, and 10 Hz). For the paradigms using steps in visual stimulus velocity, <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub> was a single exponential filter with time constant 25 ms and a delay of 60 ms to account for the unpredictable nature of the step onset, and with amplitude as a free parameter that we fit. We note that the visual prediction filters for the sinusoidal and step stimuli are different from each other and were allowed to have different values before and after learning—this reflects our assumption that the visual prediction mechanism is able to nonlinearly adjust in order to account for different behavioral demands.</p><p>Inclusion of the visual prediction pathway, and our assumption that it is flexible, is motivated by several behaviors that cannot be explained by retinal slip alone. First, during smooth pursuit, primates can follow complex yet predictable visual stimuli with small (~10 ms) or even negative (anticipatory) latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leung and Kettner, 1997</xref>). Second, during smooth pursuit of a visual target that goes behind an occluder, eye velocity can change in anticipation of target reappearance, even anticipating expected changes in target velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker and Fuchs, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Barnes, 2004</xref>). Finally, anticipatory smooth eye movements can even occur in response to audio cues or stationary visual cues that predict upcoming target movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boman and Hotson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jarrett and Barnes, 2005</xref>). Additionally, there is evidence that such signals exist in the brain: visual prediction signals have been observed at several sites that provide input to the floccular complex: in the medial superior temporal area (MST), a higher order region of motion processing in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawano et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Newsome et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sakata et al., 1983</xref>), in the dorsolateral pontine nucleus (DLPN), a brainstem nucleus that projects to the flocculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mustari et al., 1988</xref>), and at mossy fiber inputs within the flocculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Noda, 1986</xref>). The visual prediction pathway was therefore included to explain the behaviors above, and to provide the best quantitative fits to visual stimuli before learning, particularly at higher frequencies. Our main conclusions did not depend on this pathway, however. If the visual prediction pathway is excluded, then the inferred plasticity in the vestibular pathways and the explanation for the paradoxical changes in Purkinje cell activity are both unchanged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Model fitting</title><p>Model fitting was performed in two steps. First, the filters were initialized either using linear optimization with the model in open-loop configuration (i.e. with separate fits of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2 equ3">Equations 1 and 2</xref>) or using the results of the fit to a model with a similar level of efference copy feedback (i.e. in the Figures, the final fits for the model with g = 0 were used to initialize the fits to the model with g = 0.1, the results from g = 0.1 were used to initialize the fits for g = 0.2, etc.). Note that model fits were similar for both initializations, differing only in high-frequency components that are not well-constrained by the data. Second, the filters were fine-tuned using nonlinear optimization with the model in closed-loop configuration (i.e. with both <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2 equ3">Equations 1 and 2</xref> operating simultaneously).</p><p>In the open-loop initialization step, we first performed two separate linear regressions corresponding to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2 equ3">Equations 1 and 2</xref> to provide initial estimates of the filters <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub><italic>, k</italic><sub>EH</sub><italic>, k</italic><sub>PR</sub><italic>, k</italic><sub>PT</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>, using only data before learning. (Note that the open loop initialization step requires both eye and neural data for each condition. Since Dataset 1 contains both eye and neural data only for frequencies ≤10 Hz, whereas Dataset 2 contains frequencies up to 50 Hz but only consists of behavioral data, we only included the subset of Dataset 2 ≤10 Hz in this initialization step. The full dataset was used for the final closed loop model fits.) We then performed an additional pair of linear regressions corresponding to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2 equ3">Equations 1 and 2</xref> to provide initial estimates of the changes in the filters <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub> after learning.</p><p>To keep the fit coefficients on a similar scale, each signal type used to fit the model (head velocity, target velocity, eye velocity, retinal slip velocity, and Purkinje cell firing rate) was normalized before fitting by dividing by its standard deviation, calculated across all 25 conditions before learning. Because the mean Purkinje cell firing rate was already subtracted, and the velocity signals were centered on zero, mean subtraction was not needed before normalization. The learned filters were converted back to real-world units after the fit was complete.</p><p>To discourage overfitting of limited data coming from multiple animals and datasets, regularization was applied using Tikhonov matrices to minimize both the amplitude of the weights and the second derivative of the weights, with the following parameters. The regularization penalty for the first basis vector before learning equaled 1 for <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub>; 6 for <italic>k</italic><sub>PR</sub>; 40 for <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub>; and 0.25 for <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub>. These values were chosen empirically by increasing penalties for <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>PR</sub> until the resulting filters were reasonably smooth. The resulting range in regularization penalties was likely due to the large differences in the final filter weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) and timescales (maximum time ranging from 50 to 500 ms). To encourage filters to be brief, the regularization penalties for <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub><italic>,</italic> and <italic>k</italic><sub>PR</sub> increased with the square of the basis index, so that longer timescale basis vectors were penalized more heavily than shorter timescale basis vectors.</p><p>Since neural data was not available for the full range of VOR frequencies after learning, the high-frequency components of the post-learning linear filters were under-constrained. To discourage this flexibility from leading to artifactual differences between filters before versus after learning, we used a separate regularization penalty to encourage filter weights after learning to be similar to those before learning. This regularization penalty was applied to the differences between the before-learning weights and the after-learning weights using the same Tikhonov matrices described above, but with all regularization penalties scaled ×12 to encourage relatively small changes in filter coefficients compared to the baseline values of the filter coefficients.</p><p>In the second, closed-loop fitting step, the filter coefficients were initialized as described above and then, as described below, fine-tuned through a nonlinear fitting procedure conducted with the model in closed-loop configuration. The non-visual filters were fine-tuned separately from the visual filters to reduce the number of parameters that needed to be optimized simultaneously.</p><p>To fine-tune the non-visual filters, the filters <italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>, <italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub>, and <italic>k</italic><sub>EP</sub> before learning and the change in the filters Δ<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub> and Δ<italic>k</italic><sub>EH</sub> after learning were simultaneously fine-tuned in a single step using the MATLAB function <italic>fmincon</italic>, which optimizes nonlinear constrained problems using the Interior Point Algorithm. Only stimulus conditions in the dark were included at this stage.

The visual parameters were fine-tuned in this separate step to allow faster optimization, since increasing the number of parameters that must be tuned in a single optimization step greatly increases the time required. The vestibular-only conditions were enough to constrain the strengths of the non-visual weights, since the strength of positive feedback was fixed in each model, and thus the process could be split into these two steps.</p><p>The models were fit to reproduce learned changes in Purkinje cell firing rate over learning only during the VOR in the dark, leaving changes in firing rate during cancellation as a prediction of the model. Previous studies show that the amplitude of eye movements during VOR cancellation at low frequencies (0.5 Hz) is unchanged after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo and Raymond, 2010</xref>). To replicate this observation and ensure that the motor performance during VOR cancellation at low frequencies did not change after learning, we assumed that the visual prediction pathway <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub> contributed to maintenance of constant VOR cancellation performance after learning. This was enforced by adjusting <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub> after learning to minimize the cost function:<disp-formula id="equ9"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>E</italic> represents the eye velocity during VOR cancellation (×0 condition, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) for 0.5 Hz sinusoidal stimuli before (pre) or after (post) learning. We emphasize that allowing different values for <italic>k</italic><sub>PT</sub> after learning does not imply that plasticity is required in the visual pathway. Instead, the changes in the visual prediction signal reflect the ability of primates to accurately anticipate the visual tracking command required to follow motion of a repeatable stimulus, even after learned changes in the VOR. For example, after VOR-increase learning, larger visually driven eye movement commands are required to cancel the VOR during VOR cancellation, but smaller visually driven eye movement commands are required to track the ‘×2’ stimulus delivered during training. Conceptually, this switch does not require additional training or plasticity of the visual prediction pathway. Instead, it reflects the ability of the visual system to make online predictions to guide behavior.</p><p>Simulations were run by calculating the convolutions in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2 equ3">Equations 1 and 2</xref> numerically with 0.5 ms time steps.

All biological filters were then convolved with a step function to produce the ‘biological’ step response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model analysis</title><p>To mathematically illustrate the degeneracy of the VOR circuit, we analyzed a slightly simplified version of the model with no explicit visual prediction pathway or explicit consideration of delays (which would provide a linear delay element), so that the filter components at all complex frequencies <italic>s</italic> obey the same equations in the Laplace domain:<disp-formula id="equ10"><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ11"><mml:math id="m11"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This allowed us to solve for the model parameters analytically in closed form.

This observation motivated our strategy of fixing the efference copy pathway at different levels of feedback, and observing the requirements this imposes upon the other two pathways.</p><p>We give more intuition for this analysis here. As described in the main text, the degenerate direction illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> indicates that the small Purkinje cell responses observed during the VOR in the dark could reflect either a small vestibular input (<italic>k</italic><sub>PH</sub>) alone, or a large vestibular input offset by a large efference copy feedback (<italic>k</italic><sub>PE</sub>). However, the full analysis here shows that the degeneracy is actually between all three input pathways to Purkinje cells (vestibular, efference copy, and visual). This degeneracy arises because there are three ‘unknowns’ (the three input filters to Purkinje cells) but only two independently controllable variables: the vestibular and visual target stimuli. Eye velocity is determined by how these inputs are processed through the circuit; thus, it is not an independently controllable variable. In contrast, there are only two unknown input filters to the brainstem, and thus they are fully constrained by the two independently controllable variables alone.</p><p>We also analyzed the model with a Purkinje cell ‘stimulation’ condition conducted with the head stationary in the dark to mimic experiments in which Purkinje cells were electrically stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

In preparing this manuscript, we made a conscious effort to address citation bias. Following the approach outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>, we used open source code to assess the gender and racial balance of our citations based on the first names of the first and last authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper, our references contain: 8.82% woman (first author)/woman (last author), 7.13% man/woman, 15.69% woman/man, and 68.36% man/man; and 9.75% author of color /author of color, 17.36% white author/author of color, 24.48% author of color/white author, and 48.41% white author/white author.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. We apologize for the extraordinary delay in completing the review process.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the concerns from all 3 reviewers center around the strength of evidence for weak feedback, which is a fundamental conclusion of the paper. Please pay particular attention to the questions and comments below relating to this point.</p><p>2) The reviewers have suggested a number of ways that the paper's claims should be placed more appropriately within the existing literature.</p><p>3) Questions were raised about how the model performance might change after learning, which should be addressed.</p><p>4) Some clarification of 'feedback' as carried by mossy/ parallel fiber pathways vs. climbing fiber pathways will be important for a general audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The paper seems to be written as a refutation of Miles and Lisberger (1981), but what is really striking here are actually the similarities with that paper. The main proposal by Miles and Lisberger was that plasticity in the brainstem (under control of Purkinje cell input from the flocculus) was primarily responsible for VOR learning. In the current manuscript, learning is always associated with exactly the kind of brainstem plasticity proposed by Miles and Lisberger (shown in Figure 6D and stated explicitly in lines 349-351, &quot;the correct learned increases in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation depended on the existence of plasticity in the direct pathway through the brainstem&quot;). In that sense, a fundamental conclusion of both papers is that brainstem plasticity is key for VOR adaptation. I am concerned that as written, the paper may give the erroneous impression that it is overturning the Miles and Lisberger model, when really, it seems to be solidly consistent with it. The more generalizable conclusion here would seem to be that feedback gain can lead to counterintuitive effects on the relationship between plasticity, neural activity, and behavior – which of course, is exactly the point of both Miles and Lisberger and the Lisberger 1994 papers, even if the current manuscript extends this idea and tests some aspects of it more explicitly.</p><p>If I'm not mistaken, it was only later that the Lisberger models (1992 and 1994) incorporated an additional site of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex, which is where the question of the directionality of potentiation/ depression of vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells that the current manuscript focuses on became an issue. Clarification of this point would be important, to make it more clear what aspects of the previous models are being explored/ refuted here. Again, in my view, the data are generally strikingly consistent with those earlier models and in fact the results of the Lisberger 1994 model are reproduced several times here. (As a side note, there are 4 Lisberger 1994 J Neurophys papers but only one is cited in the reference list – please check whether some of the references are meant to be to the other papers, for example when cited as Lisberger et al. rather than single author.)</p><p>2. Figure 3 nicely shows the model fits to data for Purkinje cell and eye velocity traces across a range of tracking conditions. However, I had two issues with this.</p><p>a. Why are the fits to data shown only before learning? Fits to the data after learning would seem to be just as crucial.</p><p>b. As I understand it, a key argument provided by the current model is that the strength of efference copy feedback can't be inferred from neural recordings and behavior alone, when visual inputs (retinal and target) to Purkinje cells are considered in addition to vestibular and eye velocity inputs. The inclusion of the retinal slip, and especially, the target prediction signal, are the fundamental difference from the Lisberger 1994 model. The effects of these differences on behavioral and neural responses to pursuit stimuli, which are currently limited to sinusoidal tracking, should be more carefully explored, both before and after learning. In particular, eye acceleration responses to step-ramp pursuit stimuli are crucial. For instance, it would seem to me that the explanation provided by the authors, that the visual feedback loop &quot;works harder&quot; after learning (Line 324) might bring with it some changes in step-ramp pursuit after learning. This should be tested in the model.</p><p>3. The main evidence for low levels of feedback is presented in Figure 8, but the models are plotted separately from the experimental data, and there is no quantitative comparison, making it hard to judge/compare the goodness of fits. In particular it appears that the model is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data within a range of feedback strengths, including some that are higher (up to at least 0.6, and possibly up to 0.8, which is not shown) than the switch from net depression to net potentiation shown in Figure 6C (net change).</p><p>4. There is other evidence besides the VOR work cited here that argues for the existence of substantial efference copy inputs to the cerebellum on the mossy fiber pathway, for example Giovannucci et al., Nature Neuroscience 2017 for eyeblink conditioning. This should be addressed.</p><p>5. The Lisberger 1994 papers focus extensively on altered dynamics of VOR responses following learning in low and high gain conditions. From Figure 6. Supp 1 it appears that those are not explored/ reproduced here. Is that correct? If so it should be mentioned as a potential caveat.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The model performs best when feedback to the cerebellar cortex is weak. This conclusion is supported by the evidence presented in Figure 8 which was obtained in animals that hadn't undergone VOR learning. Is it possible that feedback strength changes during learning? If so, how would this effect model performance?</p><p>Is weak feedback to the cerebellar cortex a universal principle of the cerebellar function? Are there learning regimes – either in the oculomotor system or not- where potentiation occurs because feedback is strong? Said another way, is the strength of feedback a determinate whether PC firing is increased or decreased as a result of leaning-induced plasticity. Without a wider scope to the context of this finding, the authors seem to be studying a somewhat esoteric problem.</p><p>The results are aimed at explaining the results of Miles and Lisberger (1981) regarding potentiation vs depression at vestibular inputs onto PCs. However, more recently, and perhaps more controversially, the De Zeeuw group has proposed that LTP, not LTD, at parallel fiber to PC synapses explains gain-increase learning because floccular PCs are &quot;upward-bound&quot;. Does the model similarly rule out these findings of the De Zeeuw group as well?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. (Expanded from weakness 1) It would be important to make the distinction between feedback for dynamics (as in the current model) and feedback for learning (as would be mediated by climbing fibers) clear and discuss what it means for the conclusions drawn in this study. Indeed, a role of feedback in learning is already implicitly assumed by the authors when jointly fitting the model before and after learning. I think it would help the reader to make this clear from the outset -- maybe adding distinct but related schematics for the two feedback conditions would help. Indeed the general conclusion that feedback (in general) is weak may only apply to the first view (i.e. dynamics). This distinction has also been recently studied in the context of cerebrum-cerebellar models (feedback for learning: Boven et al. Nature Comms 2023 and for dynamics: Pemberton et al. bioRxiv 2022), would be useful to discuss how your conclusions contrast with these studies.</p><p>2. (Expanded from weakness 2) There are some potential limitations of the conclusions drawn due to the model inference methods used. The methods used (fmincon) can easily get stuck in local minima and more importantly they do not provide an overview of the likelihood of parameters given the data. A few studies have now shown that it is important to apply more powerful inference techniques both to infer plasticity (Costa et al. Frontiers 2013, Bykowska et al. Frontiers 2019) and neural dynamics (Gonçalves et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). As highlighted by Costa et al. Frontiers 2013 using more standard fitting methods can easily lead to misleading &quot;best parameters&quot;. Maybe this is not an issue with the present model, but it would be important to discuss why and ideally show that irrespective of the initial conditions of the model parameters (i.e. before fitting) the fitting method always produces very similar best-fit parameters.</p><p>3. There is a lack of clarity on how to best interpret inhibitory/excitatory pathways. For example, should we interpret the efference copy feedback as inhibiting or exciting PC activity? How would this pathway be implemented in the brain? The pathway is only briefly described in section 2.1 amongst the other filters; more emphasis should be placed on it to help guide the reader. You could also mention k_{pe} at the start of section 2.2 to make it clear what it is.</p><p>4. The closed-form analysis in section 8.4 is useful but super intuitive to me. Why is there a degeneracy in how the Purkinje cell inputs are shaped and not in the brainstem inputs? Would it be possible to provide a more accessible explanation in the text? For example, I find the right plot in figure 6D surprising.</p><p>5. It is unclear to me *why* feedback might be important for the brain from a functional point of view (i.e. what are the advantages of no feedback vs strong feedback)? I think the paper would benefit from more discussion on this point, even if only from a more speculative angle.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84770.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the concerns from all 3 reviewers center around the strength of evidence for weak feedback, which is a fundamental conclusion of the paper. Please pay particular attention to the questions and comments below relating to this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly revised the text to clarify the evidence for weak feedback. We now emphasize that the strongest evidence for weak efference copy feedback comes from comparing the model results to previous experimental evidence for error-driven plasticity in the cerebellar cortex (e.g. LTD of parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells that are coactive with climbing fibers). This work was motivated by the puzzle that previous experimental evidence for such plasticity was incompatible with a leading circuit model of VOR learning, the Miles-Lisberger model. Our results show that only models with weak or no efference copy feedback predicted synaptic changes compatible with error-driven plasticity in the cerebellar cortex. Additionally, we show that these models explain all other available data, including paradoxical changes in neural activity during closed-loop behavioral paradigms. The perturbation analysis in Figure 8 is an orthogonal test of circuit feedback strength that complements this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers have suggested a number of ways that the paper's claims should be placed more appropriately within the existing literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to better situate the results in the existing literature. We now discuss how a similar strategy could be applied to other systems with feedback, both within and outside of the cerebellum. The exact implications of feedback for inferring plasticity from neural activity recordings will depend on the specifics of each circuit. In fact, even within the VOR circuit, we discuss how the distribution of plasticity between the cerebellar cortex and in the brainstem could vary over the time course of learning as memories are consolidated.</p><p>Connecting to other cerebellar-dependent learning paradigms, we note that there has been a seeming disconnect between the plasticity mechanisms suggested for VOR learning and other learning paradigms such as eye-blink conditioning. We now clarify how our model reconciles these different paradigms, suggesting that similar cerebellar plasticity mechanisms may be operating across different tasks and cerebellar subregions. We also situate the result in the context of other work that supports specific plasticity mechanisms other than parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD, such as LTP of parallel fibers carrying oppositely directed vestibular input, and we discuss the functional equivalence of these mechanistic variations.</p><p>We also now clarify, and include additional, references to key experimental studies by Lisberger (1994), and to other approaches for analyzing “sloppy” model parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Questions were raised about how the model performance might change after learning, which should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified and expanded the discussion of several points related to how model performance might change after learning. First, we clarify that the dataset fit after learning includes a wide range of behavioral data, and a more restricted set of neural data due to limited data availability. Overall, a key strength of this study is that it pulls together data from many studies in order to capture circuit dynamics both before and after learning. Second, we discuss the implications of plasticity in the efference copy feedback pathway, which was held fixed in the model.

The paper seems to be written as a refutation of Miles and Lisberger (1981), but what is really striking here are actually the similarities with that paper. The main proposal by Miles and Lisberger was that plasticity in the brainstem (under control of Purkinje cell input from the flocculus) was primarily responsible for VOR learning. In the current manuscript, learning is always associated with exactly the kind of brainstem plasticity proposed by Miles and Lisberger (shown in Figure 6D and stated explicitly in lines 349-351, &quot;the correct learned increases in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation depended on the existence of plasticity in the direct pathway through the brainstem&quot;). In that sense, a fundamental conclusion of both papers is that brainstem plasticity is key for VOR adaptation. I am concerned that as written, the paper may give the erroneous impression that it is overturning the Miles and Lisberger model, when really, it seems to be solidly consistent with it. The more generalizable conclusion here would seem to be that feedback gain can lead to counterintuitive effects on the relationship between plasticity, neural activity, and behavior – which of course, is exactly the point of both Miles and Lisberger and the Lisberger 1994 papers, even if the current manuscript extends this idea and tests some aspects of it more explicitly.</p><p>If I'm not mistaken, it was only later that the Lisberger models (1992 and 1994) incorporated an additional site of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex, which is where the question of the directionality of potentiation/ depression of vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells that the current manuscript focuses on became an issue. Clarification of this point would be important, to make it more clear what aspects of the previous models are being explored/ refuted here. Again, in my view, the data are generally strikingly consistent with those earlier models and in fact the results of the Lisberger 1994 model are reproduced several times here. (As a side note, there are 4 Lisberger 1994 J Neurophys papers but only one is cited in the reference list – please check whether some of the references are meant to be to the other papers, for example when cited as Lisberger et al. rather than single author.)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and agree that our conclusions do not refute the Miles and Lisberger hypothesis in its entirety. Indeed, we find that a site of plasticity in the brainstem is critical to explain the “paradoxical” increase in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation after learning. Thus our results corroborate the existence of brainstem plasticity in the Miles and Lisberger hypothesis, although in our model this site was required regardless of the strength of efference copy feedback.</p><p>However, while we found that brainstem plasticity was necessary to explain Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation, we disagree that brainstem plasticity is key for VOR adaptation in general. In particular, we predict that at different stages of systems consolidation, different distributions of plasticity between the cerebellar and brainstem sites would be expected—including potentially no plasticity in the brainstem early in learning. We have added a note pointing the reader to the relevant section of the Discussion (“Implications for systems consolidation of cerebellar learning”) on line 388.</p><p>We also feel that the site of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex is critical to the debate. In contrast to the Miles-Lisberger hypothesis (see clarification below), we find that the observed increase in Purkinje cell activity during VOR cancellation is fully compatible with net depression of vestibular inputs to the cerebellar cortex. We thus frame this work as a reconciliation of the Lisberger model, which was motivated by extensive neural and behavioral data, with elements of the earlier Marr-Albus-Ito model and—most importantly—with evidence that plasticity in the cerebellar cortex is guided by error signals (i.e. retinal slip). The Lisberger model, and our implementation of it (the Strong Feedback model) is incompatible with this error-driven plasticity mechanism, which is our main evidence for a model with weaker positive feedback. Additionally, even though we reproduce the results of Lisberger (1994) in several figures, we ultimately find that this model is additionally incompatible with the response to transient perturbation, discussed further in Point 3 below. We agree that the similarities and differences with the Miles and Lisberger model should be more explicit in the manuscript, and have now incorporated this in Section 3.0 lines 440-457<italic>.</italic></p><p>Regarding the question of whether Miles and Lisberger (1981) incorporated a site of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex: they conclude that the strength of vestibular input to Purkinje cells increases with learning, opposite to the decrease predicted by the Ito hypothesis. They remain agnostic as to whether the increase in this vestibular input is due to plasticity at a single site, presynaptic to both the flocculus and the brainstem (site C in their Figure 3), or at two separate sites, one in the brainstem and one in the flocculus (sites A and D in their Figure 3), but both possibilities result in a net increase in the strength of vestibular input to the cerebellar cortex. This interpretation is supported by their theoretical argument: “…any changes in the &quot;gain&quot; of the brainstem vestibular signal should be matched by corresponding changes in the &quot;gain&quot; of the flocculus vestibular signal” (Miles and Lisberger 1981), and their interpretation of experimental results using the VOR cancellation paradigm: “Single unit recordings in the primate flocculus have revealed that the average strength of the head velocity (vestibular) signals carried by the P-cells varies with the gain of the VOR” (Miles and Lisberger 1981).</p><p>To clarify which of the four Lisberger 1994 papers are cited, we originally cited two relevant Lisberger 1994 papers: (1) Lisberger, Pavelko, Bronte-Stewart, and Stone 1994, “Neural basis for motor learning in the vestibuloocular reflex of primates. II. Changes in the responses of horizontal gaze velocity Purkinje cells in the cerebellar flocculus and ventral paraflocculus” and (2) Lisberger 1994, “Neural basis for motor learning in the vestibuloocular reflex of primates. III. Computational and behavioral analysis of the sites of learning”. Note that (2) appears several items before (1) in the manuscript reference list, which is sorted according to APA style such that among references with the same first author, those with a single author are listed before those with multiple authors regardless of year. For completeness, we have now additionally included a reference to Lisberger, Pavelko, Broussard 1994, “Neural basis for motor learning in the vestibuloocular reflex of primates. I. Changes in the responses of brain stem neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 3 nicely shows the model fits to data for Purkinje cell and eye velocity traces across a range of tracking conditions. However, I had two issues with this.</p><p>a. Why are the fits to data shown only before learning? Fits to the data after learning would seem to be just as crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question about why the model fits before learning shown in Figure 3 are not replicated after learning. Figure 3 includes both neural and behavioral data before learning. Unfortunately, neural data for the full range of stimulus conditions shown before learning do not exist after learning, to our knowledge. Therefore, the neural data used to constrain the model after learning were restricted to the steady state and transient changes in Purkinje cell modulation during steps (Lisberger, Pavelko, Bronte-Stewart, and Stone 1994) and the amplitude during low-frequency sines waves (Watanabe 1985) in vestibular input alone (see Section 8.1 Materials and methods, Data set). The model Purkinje cell response during the VOR after learning is shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 4A,D. Since the models merely had to replicate a scalar change in Purkinje cell activity, which they each did perfectly, we did not feel that this result merited inclusion in a main figure.</p><p>However, we do show the model fits to <italic>behavioral data</italic> after learning for the wide range of VOR frequencies (0.5 to 50 Hz) tested by Lisberger and Ramachandran 2005 in Figure 6A,B. Since our model is linear, this wide frequency range is sufficient to construct the predicted response to other arbitrary stimuli, such as the steps in head velocity input shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We have modified the titles in Figure 6A,B to emphasize that we are comparing the dynamics of VOR behavior after learning between models and data. Additionally, we modified Section 2.3 to clarify the limitation of the data: “Each model was fit to learned changes in behavior during the VOR in the dark across a broad range of stimulus frequencies from 0.5 Hz to 50 Hz (data from Ramachandran and Lisberger, 2005; Figure 6A) as well as to learned changes in Purkinje cell activity during the VOR at low frequencies (data from Lisberger et al., 1994; Watanabe, 1985). We note that we were limited to analyzing only low frequency neural data, since neural data for the full range of stimulus conditions analyzed before learning does not exist for after learning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. As I understand it, a key argument provided by the current model is that the strength of efference copy feedback can't be inferred from neural recordings and behavior alone, when visual inputs (retinal and target) to Purkinje cells are considered in addition to vestibular and eye velocity inputs. The inclusion of the retinal slip, and especially, the target prediction signal, are the fundamental difference from the Lisberger 1994 model. The effects of these differences on behavioral and neural responses to pursuit stimuli, which are currently limited to sinusoidal tracking, should be more carefully explored, both before and after learning. In particular, eye acceleration responses to step-ramp pursuit stimuli are crucial. For instance, it would seem to me that the explanation provided by the authors, that the visual feedback loop &quot;works harder&quot; after learning (Line 324) might bring with it some changes in step-ramp pursuit after learning. This should be tested in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>A key difference from the Miles-Lisberger model is that we include a retinal slip pathway that is flexibly fit to data. The Lisberger 1994 model did include a retinal slip pathway, but this pathway was assumed to represent the command for eye acceleration during pursuit and was not fit in the full model. We demonstrate that when the retinal slip pathway is fit in the context of the closed-loop circuit model, it changes from acceleration-like to velocity-like as the strength of efference copy feedback decreases. This allowed models with weak or no efference copy feedback to explain all available data.</p><p>As the reviewer points out, an additional difference is our inclusion of a visual target prediction signal. This signal was required (1) to obtain the best quantitative fits to the data before learning, (2) to account for the observation that smooth pursuit eye movements continue even if an object disappears behind an occluder, and (3) to account for the observation that the gain of eye movements during low-frequency visual-vestibular stimuli (e.g. VOR cancellation) after learning is unchanged (Guo and Raymond 2010). However, note that without this visual prediction signal, the main results -- the sites and signs of plasticity in each model, and the paradoxical increases in</p><p>Purkinje cell firing during VOR cancellation -- were unchanged (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Thus, the target prediction pathway was necessary to explain all the experimental details, but the retinal slip pathway alone was sufficient to understand how plasticity and internal feedback interact in the circuit.</p><p>We also have clarified our confusing wording about the visual pathways “working harder”, by which we mean that there is more input to Purkinje cells from this pathway after learning. Given that these visual pathways “work harder” to cancel the VOR after learning, the reviewer raises an interesting question about how learning affects smooth pursuit. Lisberger (1994) tested the effect of VOR learning on the initiation of pursuit, and concluded that there is “little to no consistent effect on pursuit eye movements” after VOR learning. Accordingly, we did not include plasticity in either visual pathway in our model, and thus there is no change in smooth pursuit performance after learning.</p><p>How do the visual pathways “work harder” if they do not undergo plasticity? There are two ways in which the visual pathways can work harder to cancel the VOR, depending on whether or not the visual target prediction pathway is included:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>If only retinal slip is included, then the performance of VOR cancellation will worsen after learning, since it is harder to reduce/cancel the gain of the VOR after having just learned to increase it. This worsened performance leads to increased retinal slip, thus increasing the activity of the visual pathway, which increases Purkinje cell firing during ipsiversive head turns, counteracting the reduction in firing due to LTD of vestibular inputs. In effect, the retinal slip works to partially reduce visual error through negative feedback via Purkinje cells, which produces the observed “paradoxical” increase in Purkinje cell firing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If a visual prediction pathway is included, this pathway adjusts its contribution to the eye movement command “on-the-fly” in order to increase Purkinje cell firing and achieve correct cancellation. We assume that this adjustment can occur through cortical mechanisms that do not require plasticity.</p></list-item></list><p>In either case, even though the visual pathways increase their activity during VOR cancellation after learning, they do not undergo plasticity in our model, thus there is no change in smooth pursuit performance, whether to sinusoidal or step-ramp stimuli, after learning. Note that we discuss the possibility of plasticity of the visual pathways in the Discussion. Clarification of the fact that there is no plasticity in the visual pathways and this more extensive discussion has now been incorporated into the text (Section 2.4, lines 362-375).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The main evidence for low levels of feedback is presented in Figure 8, but the models are plotted separately from the experimental data, and there is no quantitative comparison, making it hard to judge/compare the goodness of fits. In particular it appears that the model is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data within a range of feedback strengths, including some that are higher (up to at least 0.6, and possibly up to 0.8, which is not shown) than the switch from net depression to net potentiation shown in Figure 6C (net change).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the model responses to transient stimulation are not quantitatively compared to the data in Figure 8. This was done intentionally: first, since the time course of data from Lisberger 1994 was only available for a single monkey, and is from a different study than those used to fit our model, we did not want to overstep the quantitative conclusions that can be drawn. Second, we note that the relationship between feedback strength and the time constant (“<italic>τ</italic>”) of eye velocity decay following perturbation is nonlinear. The relationship is given by <italic>τ</italic> ∝ 1/(1-feedback), which we now show in an additional panel (Figure 8D). Thus, large changes in time constant only appear for feedback strengths approaching unity, and the minor changes in <italic>τ</italic> for weaker feedback strengths make it impossible to quantitatively disambiguate between weak feedback models. However, the model of Miles and Lisberger 1981 requires a net positive feedback strength of 1, which is inconsistent with the simulations in Figure 8. We have also updated Figure 8C to now show the model prediction for feedback = 0.8, which also appears inconsistent. This being said, overall, we agree with the reviewer that Figure 8 is consistent with a range of feedback strengths up to approximately 0.6. We indicate the uncertainty around this measurement as follows: “Although the precise strength of the efference copy feedback is difficult to ascertain because the time constant of decay of responses changes only gradually until the gain of the feedback loop approaches one (Figure 8D), this suggests that feedback in this circuit is relatively weak (Figure 8E; see Discussion).”</p><p>Regardless of the exact match between data and model in Figure 8, however, we emphasize that the primary evidence for weak feedback strength comes from comparing our results with other studies suggesting net depression at this site during learned increases in the VOR. Our results show a strict relationship between feedback strength and the direction of plasticity at the vestibular inputs to the cerebellar cortex (kPH) (Figure 6C), and reconcile net depression at this site with the surprising increases in Purkinje cell response observed during VOR cancellation after VOR-increase learning (Figure 7). We have updated the text to indicate that the perturbation analysis complements the main evidence for relatively weak feedback, namely that only models with weak feedback were compatible with error-driven plasticity in the cerebellar cortex (Section 2.5)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There is other evidence besides the VOR work cited here that argues for the existence of substantial efference copy inputs to the cerebellum on the mossy fiber pathway, for example Giovannucci et al., Nature Neuroscience 2017 for eyeblink conditioning. This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is substantial evidence for efference copy inputs to the cerebellum, and thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to Giovannucci et al. 2017. This study finds that granule cell activity matches the temporal dynamics of learned eyeblink responses, consistent with an efference copy of the learned motor response being present in granule cells. However, there is a critical distinction between an efference copy input, and efference copy input configured specifically as a positive feedback loop through the cerebellar cortex. An efference copy pathway may be present (indeed, there is substantial anatomical evidence for regions that both affect eye movements and send input to the cerebellar flocculus), but that does not mean that this input must be configured as a positive feedback loop where eye movement commands driven by Purkinje cells feed back to affect the same Purkinje cells, as proposed in the Miles-Lisberger hypothesis. Additionally, the functional strength of feedback is impossible to determine from anatomy alone. We illustrate this in Figure 8F, but have now also expanded and emphasized this point in the text and included the reference to Giovannucci et al. 2007 (Discussion, Section 3.1, lines 480-490).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The Lisberger 1994 papers focus extensively on altered dynamics of VOR responses following learning in low and high gain conditions. From Figure 6. Supp 1 it appears that those are not explored/ reproduced here. Is that correct? If so it should be mentioned as a potential caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>Our model reproduced the altered dynamics of VOR behavioral responses following learning, as quantified by the gain and phase of the VOR before and after learning across a wide range of frequencies (Figure 6A,B). Since our model is linear, this wide frequency range is sufficient to construct the predicted response to other arbitrary stimuli including steps (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), which do indeed show changes in steady state and transient components in the same direction as measured by Lisberger and Pavelko (1986). This transient component was not quantitatively compared since it depends on the exact dynamics of the imperfect step stimulus and on the method of quantification (max taken for each cell individually v. for the population). We have now updated the labels and the color scheme in Figure 6A,B to clarify that these panels show that the model reproduces experimentally observed changes in VOR dynamics after learning, and have clarified the relationship to the main figure and previous work in the legend of Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Regarding changes in neural dynamics, we also considered the change in the transient Purkinje cell response to steps in head velocity input after VOR learning reported in Lisberger, Pavelko, Bronte-Stewart and Stone 1994. In that study, the transient response was measured as “the peak firing rate in the first 50 ms after the onset of head motion”. This is described in Materials and methods, Section 8.1: “Both the steady-state changes (averaged 100-200 ms after step onset) and transient changes (peak firing rate measured 0-50 ms after step onset) after learning reported by Lisberger et al. were included in the cost function.” The term capturing this transient response was included in the cost function C <sub>PostLearn</sub> in Section 8.2 as <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>trans</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>post</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>trans</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>post</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> , which “encourages the transient Purkinje cell responses to steps (P_trans^post) to mimic the transient responses after learning reported in Dataset 3 (Lisberger, Pavelko, Bronte-Stewart, et al., 1994).” For the same reasons given above for behavioral transients, this was only a weak constraint and thus we do not quantitatively compare the transient amplitudes of the Purkinje cell step response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The model performs best when feedback to the cerebellar cortex is weak. This conclusion is supported by the evidence presented in Figure 8 which was obtained in animals that hadn't undergone VOR learning. Is it possible that feedback strength changes during learning? If so, how would this effect model performance?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up the interesting possibility that the strength of efference copy feedback may itself change with learning. We did not include plasticity at this synapse in the model because it was not necessary to explain the available data, but it is likely that plasticity does in fact occur. We briefly mentioned this possibility in the Discussion, but have now expanded that section (3.4.1, “Model Assumptions: Pathways Undergoing Plasticity”) to clarify the qualitative predictions the model would make if a plasticity rule compatible with the observed plasticity at k <sub>PH</sub> (i.e., correlated activity of climbing fibers and parallel fibers induces synaptic depression of those parallel fibers) was applied to the efference copy feedback pathway.</p><p>The relevant paragraph is copied here: “We first consider the correlational plasticity rule applied to the efference copy pathway. This pathway (kPE) is driven by ipsiversive eye velocity, whereas climbing fiber activity in the flocculus is driven by contraversive retinal slip and suppressed by ipsiversive slip (Raymond and Lisberger, 1998). During learning to increase the VOR, ipsiversive eye movements are accompanied by ipsiversive retinal slip. Hence, activation of parallel fibers carrying efference copy signals should be accompanied by little or no climbing fiber activity, which in vitro has been shown to induce potentiation of the parallel fibers inputs to Purkinje cells (Crepel and Jaillard, 1991; Suvrathan et al., 2016). Thus, we predict net potentiation of kPE for learned increases in the VOR. Applying similar logic to learned decreases in the VOR predicts net depression of kPE. However, since the amplitude of eye movements is small during training to decrease the VOR, the plastic changes may be smaller in this case. In both cases, the changes in kPE are in the correct direction to support learning of amplified or attenuated eye movements, respectively. Changes in kPE would also lead to alterations of VOR dynamics, as well as amplitude, due to changing the strength of the efference copy feedback loop (Lisberger and Sejnowski, 1992).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is weak feedback to the cerebellar cortex a universal principle of the cerebellar function? Are there learning regimes – either in the oculomotor system or not- where potentiation occurs because feedback is strong? Said another way, is the strength of feedback a determinate whether PC firing is increased or decreased as a result of leaning-induced plasticity. Without a wider scope to the context of this finding, the authors seem to be studying a somewhat esoteric problem.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is raising the important question of whether our results generalize across the cerebellum. We note first that we are studying the cerebellum to illustrate a core problem in modeling systems throughout the brain: how to disambiguate plasticity in the face of ubiquitous feedback loops, both within the brain and between the brain and the environment. Within the cerebellum, we illustrate a general approach to determine how plasticity is distributed between the cerebellar cortex and the brainstem or deep cerebellar nuclei in the face of potential feedback loops.</p><p>The question about how the results generalize across the cerebellum can be split into two parts: (1) Does feedback strength always determine the direction of plasticity in the cerebellar cortex, such that stronger feedback causes a switch from depression to potentiation? (2) If so, are there instances where feedback is strong and sensory inputs therefore potentiate?</p><p>Regarding the first question: while there is an anatomical basis for feedback in other cerebellar circuits, such as for eye blink conditioning, the specific effect of feedback will depend on the details of each circuit. The broader implications of this work are not the exact numerical details of the model fits, but the strategy for fitting a closed-loop model to data, in order to analyze the interactions between model architecture and plasticity. The extensive data available from the VOR system allowed us to identify the regime of possible feedback strengths that are compatible with parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTD. The same strategy could be applied to other cerebellar learning paradigms in order to determine the quantitative relationship between circuit feedback and plasticity of specific input pathways. We have added a short paragraph to the Discussion to emphasize this point (last paragraph of Section 3.1).</p><p>Within the oculomotor system, we can speculate about the second question raised above: are there instances where feedback is strong and vestibular sensory inputs potentiate? Our model represents a single time point during learning, but other studies indicate that memory transfers from the cerebellar cortex to the brainstem over time. Taken to the extreme, for the cerebellar cortex to return exactly to its original, pre-learning output, if there is some efference copy input, we actually conclude that some net potentiation of the vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells would actually be required. This is now more fully addressed in the Discussion (Section 3.2, Implications for systems consolidation of cerebellar learning), which concludes: “This provides the possibility that the net sign of plasticity in vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells could be depression at early stages of learning and potentiation after complete consolidation of learning.” More generally, there may be learning regimes, either within the VOR system or elsewhere, where there is sufficiently strong feedback of large changes elsewhere in the circuit to produce potentiation of sensory inputs that would otherwise be expected to depress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results are aimed at explaining the results of Miles and Lisberger (1981) regarding potentiation vs depression at vestibular inputs onto PCs. However, more recently, and perhaps more controversially, the De Zeeuw group has proposed that LTP, not LTD, at parallel fiber to PC synapses explains gain-increase learning because floccular PCs are &quot;upward-bound&quot;. Does the model similarly rule out these findings of the De Zeeuw group as well?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is referring to a proposal by the de Zeeuw group in which adaptive changes in Purkinje cell activity during VOR learning are driven by LTP of parallel fiber inputs that are active during contraversive head motion, rather than LTD of ipsiversive inputs as originally proposed by Ito and Kano (de Zeeuw 2021; Schonewille et al. 2011). This is motivated in the context of cerebellar “microzones” with either lower or higher spontaneous firing rates, which are proposed to achieve learning primarily through LTP-driven increases or LTD-driven decreases in firing rate, respectively.</p><p>Our findings do not fundamentally contradict the de Zeeuw proposal. Our model is agnostic to the biological mechanism by which the vestibular inputs to Purkinje cells undergo net “depression”, defined in our paper as a net reduction in the postsynaptic response to ipsiversive vestibular input. Specifically, instead of requiring LTD of the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapse during ipsiversive head turns, such depression could require LTP of the parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron synapse, or LTP of the interneuron-Purkinje cell synapse.</p><p>Additionally, for the eye movement response, the net impact of LTD of ipsiversive vestibular inputs should be identical to the impact of LTP of contraversive vestibular inputs. There is one cerebellar flocculus in each hemisphere, with each receiving the appropriate copy of vestibular input, and each affecting eye movements. Motor output depends on the difference in output between the two hemispheres, relative to their baselines. To give a concrete example: a decrease in activity in the right hemisphere during rightward head turns (LTD of ipsiversive inputs) would cause the eyes to move faster to the left, identical to an increase in activity in the left hemisphere during the same rightward head turns (LTP of contraversive inputs).</p><p>This question has now been addressed in the text in a new section of the Discussion, Section 3.4.2, “Implementation of error-driven plasticity in cerebellar cortex”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It would be important to make the distinction between feedback for dynamics (as in the current model) and feedback for learning (as would be mediated by climbing fibers) clear and discuss what it means for the conclusions drawn in this study. Indeed, a role of feedback in learning is already implicitly assumed by the authors when jointly fitting the model before and after learning. I think it would help the reader to make this clear from the outset -- maybe adding distinct but related schematics for the two feedback conditions would help. Indeed the general conclusion that feedback (in general) is weak may only apply to the first view (i.e. dynamics). This distinction has also been recently studied in the context of cerebrum-cerebellar models (feedback for learning: Boven et al. Nature Comms 2023 and for dynamics: Pemberton et al. bioRxiv 2022), would be useful to discuss how your conclusions contrast with these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that our conclusions do not preclude an important role for many other types of feedback, including as an instructive signal for learning. Instead of explicitly considering feedback for learning in our model, we consider static snapshots before and after learning to infer plasticity, while remaining agnostic to the neural algorithm used to achieve such plasticity. A widely held hypothesis is that motor error signals carried by climbing fibers instruct LTD at co-active parallel fiber inputs to Purkinje cells; this is indeed a form of feedback, operating on a slower timescale than “feedback for dynamics.” This “feedback for learning” is not modeled here but is fully consistent with our results, as discussed in a new paragraph of our Discussion (end of Section 3.4.1 “Pathways undergoing plasticity”).</p><p>Note that even within the category of “feedback for dynamics”, our specific conclusion that strong feedback is unnecessary only applies to the efference copy feedback loop during VOR learning. In fact, one of our conclusions is that it is critical to consider external feedback of visual motion from the environment in order to explain the “paradoxical” changes in Purkinje cell firing during VOR cancellation. Thus the internal efference copy feedback can be weak when there is visual feedback through the environment that helps to maintain appropriate eye movements to stabilize the visual target.</p><p>With respect to the additional cited papers above, we note that we do not explicitly model either climbing fiber-mediated plasticity, i.e. feedback for learning, in this paper (which is the form of cerebellar plasticity described in the above models), nor feedback from the cerebellum to the cortex, which aids in motor learning and dynamics, respectively, in Boven et al. 2023 and Pemberton et al. 2022. We have added a section addressing this to the Discussion, last paragraph of section 3.4.1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are some potential limitations of the conclusions drawn due to the model inference methods used. The methods used (fmincon) can easily get stuck in local minima and more importantly they do not provide an overview of the likelihood of parameters given the data. A few studies have now shown that it is important to apply more powerful inference techniques both to infer plasticity (Costa et al. Frontiers 2013, Bykowska et al. Frontiers 2019) and neural dynamics (Gonçalves et al. eLife 2020). As highlighted by Costa et al. Frontiers 2013 using more standard fitting methods can easily lead to misleading &quot;best parameters&quot;. Maybe this is not an issue with the present model, but it would be important to discuss why and ideally show that irrespective of the initial conditions of the model parameters (i.e. before fitting) the fitting method always produces very similar best-fit parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that we used a deterministic model-fitting procedure. To address this concern, we complemented the full dynamic model with a simple analytic model (Figure 5) for which we could fully derive the cost function landscape and analytically show that there is a line of parameters corresponding to a perfect degeneracy in the model. Thus, the challenge in the model we analyze is that there are too many solutions, rather than it being difficult to find a solution. Given this degeneracy, we chose to fix the level of efference copy feedback and then find the (now non-degenerate) solutions, and to then compare these different solutions with regards to their implications for the correlated strengths and changes in strengths of different pathways. We have edited the relevant section of the Discussion for clarity on this topic, and have added references to the additional strategies for model inference mentioned above, in Section 3.3 “Relation to other sloppy models”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is a lack of clarity on how to best interpret inhibitory/excitatory pathways. For example, should we interpret the efference copy feedback as inhibiting or exciting PC activity? How would this pathway be implemented in the brain? The pathway is only briefly described in section 2.1 amongst the other filters; more emphasis should be placed on it to help guide the reader.

We address these below.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Feedback for learning was discussed in point 1 above.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anatomical implementation of efference copy pathway: We have edited the Discussion to clarify that there is anatomical evidence for efference copy input to the cerebellum, but that a key aspect of ‘feedback’ is that activity functionally loops back onto itself. Instead, neurons carrying eye movement commands (such as in the vestibular nucleus) could send signals to the cerebellum, without receiving output from the same cerebellar neurons – this would correspond to a ‘spiraling’ pathway that does not form a closed feedback loop (Figure 8). Thus we argue that the existence of the gross anatomical pathways does not necessitate a role for strong, functional, efference copy feedback (Discussion, Section 3.1, lines 481-491).</p></list-item></list><p>Anatomical implementation of visual pathway: The visual feedback pathways considered here are those that would receive visual motion information from the environment. This visual feedback is itself changed by eye movements, thus providing a net overall negative feedback loop that helps to stabilize gaze. This pathway has been proposed to involve cortical regions such as MST (discussed in Materials and methods, Model Implementation, lines 769-774).</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Interpretation of positive feedback loop: In our model, the efference copy feedback filter, k <sub>PE</sub> , has positive weight. This corresponds to the positive net sign of the Purkinje cell to brainstem to Purkinje cell feedback loop. Specifically, the Purkinje cell to brainstem pathway is inhibitory (because Purkinje cells are inhibitory), the brainstem to eye velocity command pathway is inhibitory (to achieve counter-rotation of the eyes in response to head turns), and the feedback of this eye velocity command back to Purkinje cells (k <sub>PE</sub>) is positive. Thus this loop in our model represents positive feedback. This is now clarified in Materials and methods, Model Implementation, lines 748.</p></list-item></list><p>The efference copy feedback is a net positive feedback loop in which ipsiversive head velocity excites Purkinje cells. And thank you for pointing out our lack of clarity: we have now added explicit references to k <sub>PE</sub> at the end of Section 2.1 (line 138) and the start of Section 2.2 (line 153) to clarify the fact that the efference copy feedback strength was controlled in the model by setting the strength of this pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The closed-form analysis in section 8.4 is useful but super intuitive to me. Why is there a degeneracy in how the Purkinje cell inputs are shaped and not in the brainstem inputs? Would it be possible to provide a more accessible explanation in the text? For example, I find the right plot in figure 6D surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the description of the model analysis in Materials and methods, Section 8.4 “Model Analysis”, with an additional paragraph to give more intuition for why there is a degeneracy in the Purkinje cell inputs but not the brainstem:</p><p>“We give more intuition for this analysis here. As described in the main text, the degenerate direction illustrated in Figure 5B indicates that the small Purkinje cell responses observed during the VOR in the dark could reflect either a small vestibular input (kPH) alone, or a large vestibular input offset by a large efference copy feedback (kPE). However, the full analysis here shows that the degeneracy is actually between all three input pathways to Purkinje cells (vestibular, efference copy, and visual). This degeneracy arises because there are three “unknowns” (the three input filters to Purkinje cells) but only two independently controllable variables: the vestibular and visual target stimuli. Eye velocity is determined by how these inputs are processed through the circuit; thus, it is not an independently controllable variable. In contrast, there are only two unknown input filters to the brainstem, and thus they are fully constrained by the two independently controllable variables alone.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is unclear to me *why* feedback might be important for the brain from a functional point of view (i.e. what are the advantages of no feedback vs strong feedback)? I think the paper would benefit from more discussion on this point, even if only from a more speculative angle.</p></disp-quote><p>Related to point 1 above, it is certainly the case that feedback is necessary for learning. We do not explicitly model the climbing fiber feedback thought to be involved in learning/plasticity of the parallel fiber pathway.</p><p>We instead focus on the role of efference copy feedback, and how it functionally impacts the required sites and signs of plasticity in the circuit. As shown in the paper, if the efference copy pathway is strong, then this is most consistent with learned changes in eye movements being driven primarily by plasticity in the brainstem pathway (as in the Miles-Lisberger hypothesis), whereas if the efference copy pathway is weak, then this is most consistent with learned changes in eye movements being driven by net depression in the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell pathway (as in the classic Marr-Albus-Ito model and as suggested by most cellular and molecular studies of parallel fiber-Purkinje cell plasticity), in addition to a role of plasticity in the brainstem pathway. We also note that, in the ‘Strong Feedback’ model, the feedback is so strong that the system is on the brink of instability – this has been argued to have the functional benefit of providing ‘inertia’ to eye movements that could help to maintain eye movements during smooth pursuit when a target goes behind an occluder, but it also has the disadvantage of placing the system at a level of positive feedback near the brink of instability. We also note that the visual feedback pathway through the environment, emphasized in this work, serves as a negative feedback loop that reduces deviations between the eye and target velocity. We have extensively re-written the first section of the Discussion (Section 3.1), in order to more clearly lay out the implications of each model for circuit plasticity and feedback.</p></body></sub-article></article>
