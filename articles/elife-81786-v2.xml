transient break in a second duplex. How DNA strands are chosen and selectively passed to yield appropriate topological outcomes – for example, decatenation vs. catenation – is poorly understood. Here, we show that at physiological enzyme concentrations, eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerases (topo IIs) readily coalesce into condensed bodies. DNA stimulates condensation and fluidizes these assemblies to impart liquid-like behavior. Condensation induces both budding yeast and human topo IIs to switch from DNA unlinking to active DNA catenation, and depends on an unstructured C-terminal region, the loss of which leads to high levels of knotting and reduced catenation. Our findings establish that local protein concentration and phase separation can regulate how topo II creates or dissolves DNA links, behaviors that can account for the varied roles of the enzyme in supporting transcription, replication, and chromosome compaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>liquid-liquid phase separation</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase</kwd><kwd>DNA knots</kwd><kwd>catenanes</kwd><kwd>DNA topology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM7445-43</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-CA263778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability of eukaryotic topoisomerase IIs to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation is a novel process for this class of enzymes and may provide answers to many unexplained observations found in both in vitro and in vivo studies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type II topoisomerases resolve DNA supercoiling and entanglements that arise naturally from the action of transcription, replication, and repair machineries on chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Enzymes of this family modulate DNA topology by an ATP-dependent strand passage mechanism in which one duplex segment is physically passed through a transient, protein-mediated break in a second double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Cozzarelli, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang, 1998</xref>). Two classes of type II topoisomerases have been identified to date: type IIA, which comprise proteins such as eukaryotic topo II, prokaryotic topo IV and DNA gyrase, and type IIB, which include two isoforms, topo VI and topo VIII, which are found in plants, archaeal organisms, and some viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forterre et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Due to its double-helical nature, a closed DNA circle or anchored DNA loop can adopt several distinct topological states, such as becoming over- or under-wound to form a supercoiled species, becoming self-entangled to form a knot, or becoming linked with another DNA loop to form a catenane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Resolution of these structures requires DNA strand breakage and the physical movement of DNA segments through one another. Apart from gyrase, which adds negative supercoils to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gellert et al., 1976</xref>), all other type II topoisomerases tend to ‘simplify’ DNA topology – for example, relaxing supercoiled DNA, untying DNA knots, or unlinking catenated loops – in accord with a lowering of the torsional or entropic energy of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rybenkov et al., 1997</xref>). However, type II topoisomerases can also actively form complicated DNA structures such as knots and catenanes, depending on conditions. For example, knotted DNAs can be formed in vitro using high concentrations of bacteriophage T4 topo II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wasserman and Cozzarelli, 1991</xref>). Catenated DNAs can be generated by type II topoisomerases through the addition of proteinaceous or chemical DNA condensing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krasnow and Cozzarelli, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Riou et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tse et al., 1984</xref>). Both DNA knots and catenanes can be created in vitro when high concentrations of eukaryotic topo II are present relative to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hsieh, 1983</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Topo IIs alter DNA topology.</title><p>(<italic>Left</italic>) Schematic of how topo IIs transform DNA from one topological state to another.

In cells, DNA is maintained at a high concentration (millimolar base pairs) compared to that of the topoisomerase (e.g., human topo II is present at low-to-sub micromolar levels in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Padget et al., 2000</xref>]), yet the enzyme is capable of altering its catalytic output to suit specific needs. For example, during transcription and replication, positive DNA supercoils generated by RNA polymerases or replisomes are recognized and relaxed by type II topoisomerases to prevent stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu and Wang, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lockshon and Morris, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pruss, 1985</xref>). Similarly, following replication, interlinked chromosomes are decatenated by enzymes like topo II and topo IV to prevent DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cebrián et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hiasa and Marians, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lucas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peter et al., 1998</xref>). However, some type II topoisomerases can also create knots, such as the action of topo II in regions with high transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Valdés et al., 2018</xref>), a function that can locally compact DNA. Topo II has also been proposed to actively catenate DNA as a means of promoting chromosome condensation and/or cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Roberge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ishida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tavormina et al., 2002</xref>). How type II topoisomerases selectively toggle between DNA linking <italic>vs</italic>. unlinking depending on chromosomal context has been a long-standing question in the field.</p><p>One clue to understanding the disparate topological outcomes mediated by type II topoisomerases can be found in vertebrates, which express two different topo II isoforms – Top2α and Top2β – that have specific cellular roles. Top2α is essential in dividing cells where it assists in cell-cycle functions such as chromosome condensation and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Spence et al., 2007</xref>). By comparison, Top2β plays a role in supporting transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edmond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haffner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lyu et al., 2006</xref>). Evidence suggests that functional differences between Top2α and Top2β derive in part from a variable, intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) appended to an evolutionarily conserved catalytic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Linka et al., 2007</xref>). The CTD is subject to extensive post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cardenas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grozav et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mao et al., 2000</xref>), has been shown to mediate interactions with different partner proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nakano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Niimi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yamane et al., 1997</xref>) and, specifically for Top2α, appears to help localize the enzyme to specialized chromosomal regions such as centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pandey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yoshida et al., 2016</xref>). How the topo II CTD manifests its varied activities has yet to be established. Interestingly, some proteins known to associate with topo IIs and some genetic loci where the enzyme is enriched have been proposed to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming assemblies that distinguish them from general chromatin areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cebrián et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frattini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Trivedi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yamane et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zamudio et al., 2019</xref>). During LLPS, macromolecules locally concentrate to form a new fluid phase that demixes from the bulk solution to establish a dynamic, membraneless compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Whether and how topo II might interface and cluster with such elements is unknown.</p><p>Here, we report that budding yeast topo II (<italic>Sc</italic>Top2) and both human TOP2α (<italic>Hs</italic>TOP2α) and TOP2β (<italic>Hs</italic>TOP2β) can phase separate to form condensed bodies. Condensation occurs at physiological protein concentrations and is stimulated by DNA, which also fluidizes the condensates. The CTD of <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 is shown to be both necessary and sufficient to drive condensation in the presence of DNA, and its phosphorylation status impacts the fluidity of condensates formed with the full-length enzyme and DNA. Unexpectedly, condensation is found to markedly change the catalytic output of not only <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 but also both human topo IIs, shifting from the simplification of topological complexity (e.g. supercoil relaxation) to the robust formation of more complex DNA structures (catenanes); by contrast, removal of the topo II CTD in <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 not only prevents LLPS but also shifts enzyme output primarily to the production of DNA knots at enzyme concentrations where condensates would otherwise form. Collectively, our findings define a molecular role for the enigmatic CTD of topo II, showing that the enzyme uses this element to promote inter-topoisomerase interactions, locally concentrate distal DNA segments, and modulate topological complexity. These properties help explain how the strand passage mechanism of topo II can be selectively controlled to support chromosomal transactions that occur in specific chromosomal contexts and require distinct topological outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Budding yeast topo II forms higher-order collectives in solution</title><p>Limited proteolysis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austin et al., 1995</xref>), as well as primary sequence analysis using the disordered protein prediction algorithm IUPRed2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erdős and Dosztányi, 2020</xref>), indicate that the CTDs of eukaryotic topo IIs are long, intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). IDRs have been shown to facilitate the self-assembly of macromolecules into liquid-like condensates through phase separation in a variety of protein systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lyon et al., 2021</xref>). Many proteins that undergo phase separation possess IDRs that exhibit low amino acid sequence complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Franzmann and Alberti, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Uversky, 2017</xref>); exceptions include factors that support the initiation of DNA replication in metazoans, which have an IDR sequence complexity similar to that of folded proteins except for a lack of aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Parker et al., 2019</xref>), and the Nephrin Intracellular Domain (NICD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pak et al., 2016</xref>). Analysis of the relative amino-acid composition of topo II CTDs shows that despite having relatively sparse sequence homology to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the elements generally have a high lysine content (≥15%), a moderately high amount of serine (~10%), aspartate, and glutamate (10%), and a very low percentage of each aromatic amino acid (&lt;5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Despite these similarities, eukaryotic topo II CTDs can have different compositions of positively and negatively charged amino acids and varied isoelectric points (pI = 5.5–9.6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Overall, the compositional properties of the topo II CTDs are more similar to those of the eukaryotic replication initiators, as opposed to low-complexity sequences found in representative LLPS-forming proteins such as human FUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>) or DDX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Eukaryotic topo IIs possess long IDRs and form higher order assemblies</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General schematic of eukaryotic topo II with color coded domains on right.

To address this question, we first focused on budding yeast topo II (<italic>Sc</italic>Top2). We purified <italic>Sc</italic>Top2, N-terminally labeled the protein with a Cy3 fluorophore, buffer exchanged the sample into high salt (600mM), and diluted the labeled protein to physiological salt concentrations (150mM) to induce phase separation. Potassium acetate (KOAc) was chosen as a salt for these and other subsequent experiments, as K<sup>+</sup> is the predominant monovalent cation and acetate is a high abundance anion in both human and yeast cells (internal Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> concentrations are negligible in these systems) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ince et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rimareva et al., 2017</xref>). After dilution, samples were imaged using fluorescence confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). At the lowest concentration of <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 tested (50nM), no visible bodies were seen. However, at moderate protein concentrations (375nM), small circular fluorescent bodies became apparent. These bodies (referred to hereafter as ‘puncta’) grew in size and number as protein concentration increased. While conducting these experiments, we noted that the formation of puncta was time-dependent, with puncta appearing within 10min of mixing and plateauing in number and size after~60min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). To ensure we were operating under a relatively equilibrated regime, the subsequent experiments were analyzed 1.5hr after condensation was induced.</p><p>Because topo IIs are DNA-binding proteins, we next assessed whether the observed puncta could incorporate DNA. Cy3-<italic>Sc</italic>Top2 was mixed with a Cy5-labeled 200bp DNA duplex and samples were again imaged by confocal microscopy. Imaging at Cy3 and Cy5 excitation wavelengths showed that both protein and DNA co-localize in the puncta; the labeled DNA on its own did not form such bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). DNA-dependent stimulation of puncta formation was also observed when Cy3-<italic>Sc</italic>Top2 was mixed with an unlabeled negatively supercoiled 2.9kb plasmid (pSG483) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, puncta formed in the presence of DNA were noticeably larger compared to those formed without (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Collectively, these data show that budding yeast topo II can form higher-order spherical assemblies at protein concentrations greater than 250nM and that DNA both stimulates the formation of and is integrated into these bodies.</p><p>To further probe the mechanism by which DNA promotes condensation of topo II, we next conducted a concentration- and length-dependent titration of DNA against 500nM Cy3-<italic>Sc</italic>Top2 and imaged the samples by fluorescence confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The shortest DNA tested (50bp, roughly the binding site size of the catalytic region) did not increase the number nor the size of condensates at any concentration tested. By comparison, the 100bp, 200bp, and pSG483 DNA substrates all enhanced condensate formation at intermediate mass concentrations (5–20ng/µL). To determine whether the stimulation of condensation was dependent on DNA, a titration was also conducted with another polyanionic substrate, heparin. Interestingly, heparin failed to stimulate DNA condensation at the observed concentrations. Together, these findings establish that condensate formation by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 is aided by extended DNA segments and is not stimulated simply by the presence of a poly-anionic substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ScTop2-DNA assemblies possess fluid-like characteristics</title><p>We next sought to determine whether puncta formed by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 display liquid-like properties.

In reactions lacking DNA, the intensity of the Cy3-<italic>Sc</italic>Top2 puncta did not recover following photobleaching, suggesting that these bodies possess more gel-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jawerth et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, in the presence of 5nM unlabeled pSG483, a fraction of the Cy3-<italic>Sc</italic>Top2 intensity (roughly one-third) had recovered by the same 15minute mark. As the pSG483 concentration increased, the mobile protein fraction inside the puncta appeared to decrease, with the fibrillar bodies (25–50nM DNA) showing somewhat less fluidity than the spherical droplets (5–10nM DNA). Time-lapse microscopy of puncta containing <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 and 5nM pSG483 also revealed fusion events between puncta on the order of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, while the smaller puncta formed by ScTop2 on its own are relatively static, the protein in both the spherical and fibrillar structures formed by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 in the presence of DNA is dynamic, exhibiting the defining attributes of condensates formed by LLPS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ionic coacervation by the CTD constitutes the multivalent interactions that drive LLPS by ScTop2</title><p>We next sought to determine whether the CTD of topo II, owing to its intrinsically disordered nature, is responsible for supporting LLPS.

To test this assumption, 500nM Cy3-<italic>Sc</italic>Top2 was titrated with varying concentrations of pSG483 across four different salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the absence of DNA, the small puncta formed by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 alone at the control potassium acetate concentration (150mM) disappeared as soon as salt levels were increased to 200mM. By comparison, in the presence of pSG483, the large condensates seen at 150mM salt persisted until potassium acetate levels reached 400mM. Interestingly, the intermediate salt concentrations still supported solubilization of <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 condensates by elevated levels of plasmid DNA. To determine whether aromatic contacts might contribute to promoting phase separation by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2, we added 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD), an aliphatic alcohol frequently used to disrupt such interactions, to condensation reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, 1,6-HD strongly promoted the aggregation of <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 into large, irregular bodies in both the presence and absence of DNA while also preventing the resolubilization of the bodies when pSG483 concentrations were increased. The addition of higher levels of 1,6-HD (e.g. 10%) also severely disrupted DNA supercoil relaxation by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the agent has a detrimental effect on the protein.</p><p>To isolate any effects that salt or 1,6-HD might have on the topo II catalytic core as compared to the CTD, we next assessed the action of both additives on the <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 CTD alone. As seen previously, the CTD was unable to form condensates in the absence of DNA, even when the salt concentration was lowered to 50mM potassium acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, robust CTD-DNA interactions were seen at this lower salt concentration, as evidenced not only by the presence of large numbers of large puncta, but also by the co-localization of DNA inside the CTD bodies; as salt concentration was increased, puncta became more diffuse. By comparison, 1,6-hexanediol had little effect on condensate formation by the CTD. Overall, our data indicate that condensate formation by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 is primarily reliant on ionic protein-DNA interactions and, consistent with its Tyr-, Phe-, and Trp-poor amino acid composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), not on contacts involving aromatic amino acids.</p><p>The propensity of IDRs to form condensates can be fine-tuned by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Since topo II CTDs are modified by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bedez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cardenas et al., 1992</xref>), we asked whether phosphorylation status might impact the enzyme’s ability to undergo LLPS. To do this, <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 was purified and treated with lambda phosphatase; the phosphatase and non-phosphatase treated proteins were then mixed with varying concentrations of pSG483 and imaged by fluorescence confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In the absence of DNA, the phosphatase-treated and untreated (control) enzymes both had the same condensate-forming propensity. However, as pSG483 was first added (5nM), phosphatase treated <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 produced a larger number of small puncta as compared to the smaller number of large droplets formed with the control reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As pSG483 concentration was further increased (25nM), the phosphatase-treated sample produced more elongated fibrillar bodies than the control. At still higher DNA levels, puncta were no longer apparent, indicating that solubilization had occurred. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the phosphatase stripped phosphates off from all amino acids in the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Reasoning that the observed difference in behavior between native and phosphatase-treated ScTop2 at lower DNA concentrations might be due to differences in the fluidic properties of the bodies formed by the dephosphorylated protein, we conducted FRAP studies of the puncta present in the phosphatase-treated reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly to the native phosphorylated samples, phosphatase- treated protein produced assemblies that failed to recover fluorescence intensity in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, in contrast to the untreated protein, adding DNA did not increase the fluidity of the bodies formed by the phosphatase-treated protein.

The activity assay protocol was modified such that after the addition of ATP under condensing conditions, either: (1) the buffer was adjusted to a higher salt concentration (400mM) to dissolve the condensates and the reaction was quenched, or (2) restriction enzymes with a single cutting or nicking site in the plasmid were added directly to condensates (formed in 150mM KOac) to facilitate DNA linearization. Electrophoresis of the products revealed that the addition of salt results in the disappearance of the well-shifted species and the appearance of relaxed plasmid topoisomers, including what appear to be subsets of relaxed dimeric and trimeric catenanes. By comparison, treating the samples with a nicking enzyme resulted in the retention of most of the well-shifted species, while treating the samples with a restriction enzyme that linearizes pSG483 caused the disappearance of the well-shifted species and the appearance of a single band in the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Nearly complete supercoil relaxation was observed at 100nM of this enzyme but now as protein levels were increased, extensive DNA streaking was seen, forming not just high but also low molecular-weight products, particularly at the highest enzyme concentration tested. Previous studies of the topological products formed by DNA topoisomerases suggested that some of these products might correspond to knotted DNAs. To test this hypothesis, the products of reactions using 250nM, 500nM, and 1000nM <italic>Sc</italic>Top2<sup>ΔCTD</sup> were either nicked (to remove any remaining supercoils) or linearized and then separated by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). At 250nM <italic>Sc</italic>Top2<sup>ΔCTD</sup>, the major products were a nicked circle and a well-resolved ladder of bands visible below this species. As the protein concentration increased to 500 and 1000nM, the abundance of the nicked circle product decreased while bands in the lower part of the ladder became more pronounced (linearization of the products collapsed all species into a single band that co-migrated with the control linear band across all three samples). The pattern seen in the nicked samples is typical of that produced by DNA knotting reactions, in which each band corresponds to a different knot species with a characteristic number of crossovers or nodes (knots with more crossovers are more compact and hence migrate more quickly in the gel) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hsieh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wasserman and Cozzarelli, 1991</xref>). A repeat of the nicking experiment using full-length ScTop2 shows that this enzyme also forms knots, but that catenanes are again the principal product produced when condensation is permitted to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

An analysis of the activity of TOP2β as a function of LLPS showed a similar trend as with TOP2β, albeit with puncta and catenated species appearing at a slightly lower protein concentration (250nM), consistent with its enhanced condensation properties.

Although type IIA topoisomerases regulate these topological transitions, how the enzymes selectively pass DNA strands to achieve desired outcomes (e.g. supercoil relaxation vs. decatenation) in an environment where duplex segments are densely packed is unknown. Here, we provide new insights into this question by showing that the catalytic core of eukaryotic topo II tends to form knots when acting on DNA at physiologic protein concentrations. We further show that at these same protein concentrations, the full-length protein – which bears an unstructured C-terminal element – efficiently forms phase-separated assemblies that locally concentrate DNA and promote DNA catenation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein-DNA interactions drive LLPS by ScTop2</title><p>Many proteins that undergo phase separation possess intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that facilitate multivalent interactions between themselves and other macromolecules to drive condensation. Consistent with this trend, we found that the C-terminal IDR of budding yeast topo II is necessary to promote LLPS by the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, the CTDs of eukaryotic topo IIs in general display relatively sparse sequence conservation between one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), but they nonetheless share certain chemical features such as a high fraction of charged residues and low aromatic amino-acid composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We found that the isolated <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 CTD was unable to form condensates on its own but could do so in the presence of DNA or a crowding agent such as PEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also found that higher salt levels blocked this phase transition. This behavior indicates that the topo II CTD can interact with itself and that DNA can serve as a scaffold to further increase local protein concentration through coacervation, a well-studied phenomenon by which charged polymers associate with each other to form condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aumiller and Keating, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Full-length <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 also formed condensed bodies in the absence of DNA, as well as in the absence of PEG, at physiological salt (150mM KOAc) and protein concentrations (0.5–1.5µM protein, the reported concentration in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Padget et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These DNA-free assemblies did not recover after photobleaching, indicating that they correspond to a gel-like state, but they dissolved readily if salt levels were increased (200mM KOAc and above), demonstrating that they are not irreversible or insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Condensates were not visible when the <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 CTD was deleted, further indicating that this region can participate in protein-protein interactions to promote coalescence. Condensate-forming behavior seen in the absence of DNA may also be aided by dimerization of the topo II catalytic core, which generates a holoenzyme with two CTDs capable of facilitating multivalent interactions.</p><p>When DNA was present, the assemblies formed by full-length <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 became larger and fluid.

The difference in salt and DNA sensitivities between the isolated <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 CTD and the full-length enzyme is likely due to additional contacts with DNA that occur through the cleavage core of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong and Berger, 2007</xref>) and the ATPase region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Laponogov et al., 2018</xref>).

However, when superphysiological amounts of topo II are used in such experiments (5–10µM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Padget et al., 2000</xref>]), it has been shown that circular DNAs can now become catenated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hsieh, 1983</xref>), even if the concentration of the nucleic acid substrate is maintained at a relatively low level (e.g., 25–75µM•bp, a value 100- to 1000-fold lower than present in a human nucleus). The mechanism underlying this switch in activity, which drives a topological outcome against what would otherwise be expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium, has been unclear. DNA catenation with low levels of topo II can be induced in vitro by the addition of proteinaceous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Riou et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tse et al., 1984</xref>) or chemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krasnow and Cozzarelli, 1982</xref>) DNA condensing agents, which increase the close proximity of DNA strands to favor linking; the ability of moderate concentrations of enzyme to do the same implies that topo II can directly condense DNA strands, a concept validated here. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of topo II has proven necessary for observing catenation in both the presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>) and absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shintomi and Hirano, 2021</xref>) of exogenous DNA condensing agents. We now show that this element is directly responsible for facilitating DNA and enzyme coalescence.</p><p>Our biochemical studies show that condensates formed by <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 integrate DNA to promote catenation and that the dissolution of these condensates drives decatenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This behavior is shared by both human topo II isoforms, TOP2α and TOP2β, suggesting it is general to the eukaryotic type IIA topoisomerase family. Interestingly, removal of the <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 CTD not only disrupted LLPS, but also greatly impeded catenation and instead revealed robust knotting activity by the enzyme, even at sub-physiologic protein concentrations (250nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Populations of DNA knots have been previously reported when treating supercoiled plasmid with highly elevated levels of eukaryotic topo II (at≥20:1 enzyme:DNA molar ratios) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hirose et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hsieh, 1983</xref>). DNA knots are also known to be created by the action of T4 bacteriophage topo II, which is composed of three subunits homologous to the ATPase domain and cleavage core of eukaryotic topo II but naturally lacks a C-terminal IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huang, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huang, 1986b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Seasholtz and Greenberg, 1983</xref>). Indeed, high concentrations of T4 topo II lead to the production of knot ladders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wasserman and Cozzarelli, 1991</xref>) similar to what is observed here for <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 in the absence of its CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Why should elevated topo II levels lead to knotting and catenation? The Top2 core does not possess an inherent ability to distinguish crossovers within the same plasmid or between different plasmids. Despite this indiscriminate activity, a likely factor contributing to the ability of type II topoisomerases that lack an IDR to form knots, such as T4 topo II or <italic>Sc</italic>Top2<sup>∆CTD</sup>, is the sharp DNA bend introduced by the cleavage region of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dong and Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Vologodskii et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). At low protein concentrations, any given plasmid should have only a few enzymes bound at a time, which favors the binding and resolution of crossovers already present in the substrate, such as those arising from plectonemic supercoils (the affinity of topo II for supercoiled DNA is at least 10 fold greater than for relaxed substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Osheroff, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Osheroff, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Zechiedrich and Osheroff, 1990</xref>]). However, as the relative protein to DNA concentration increases, more DNA bends will be introduced by topo II binding, leading to increased compaction of the DNA and an increased likelihood of crossovers forming between different segments of the same plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When these crossovers are acted upon by another molecule of topo II, they will generate a knotted link. This model predicts that the density of knot crossovers should be proportional to the level of plasmid compaction facilitated by topo II, which is in turn dependent on the local relative ratio of topo II to DNA. Such a pattern is borne out by our data and of others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hsieh, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wasserman and Cozzarelli, 1991</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for multivalent interactions that drive topo II LLPS and how phase separation affects the steady state of topological states in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Low concentrations of topo II favor supercoil relaxation.

Here, DNA condensation will facilitate the formation of crossovers between two DNA molecules, such that the action of topo II will lead to plasmid interlinking and the formation of catenanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We note that CTD-less <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 initially formed some catenated products in addition to knots at intermediate concentrations (250–500nM), but that the level of these products was relatively low compared to full-length topo II and that only knots were formed at the highest concentration of the CTD-less ScTop2 tested here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We attribute this difference in behavior to the relative ability of topo II to pass strands between DNA loops formed <italic>within</italic> a plasmid as compared to <italic>between</italic> plasmids: as protein concentration increases, DNA will become sufficiently compacted such that strand passage in cis (forming knots) outcompetes passage in trans (forming catenanes) unless some mitigating factor is present to favor the formation of inter-DNA links (e.g., increasing local DNA concentration through condensation mediated by the topo II CTD). We note that at intermediate protein concentrations where condensate formation is inefficient (full-length topo II) or blocked (as when the CTD is missing), mixtures of knots, catenanes, and relaxed topoisomers also can be observed (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), reflecting that the decision to form or dissolve links reflects an equilibrium balance between local enzyme/DNA concentration and the relative access to <italic>cis vs. trans</italic> crossovers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>); however, as protein concentrations further increase, the presence of the topo II IDR strongly shifts this equilibrium toward catenation (when starting from supercoiled DNA), whereas its absence favors knotting. The observation that both knotting and catenation, but not supercoil relaxation, are abolished by high salt comports with this schema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>): elevated ionic strength serves to both prevent the CTD from facilitating LLPS and weakens the primary interactions of DNA with the topo II catalytic core, antagonizing loop formation, and shifting enzyme activity toward favoring the passage of pre-existing crossovers, such as those found in plectonemically supercoiled substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications of activity switching for topo II function in vivo</title><p>Although type II topoisomerases are known for their ability to dissolve topological problems such as supercoils, knots, and catenanes, there is growing evidence that the enzymes may also selectively bring distant DNA segments in proximity to one another in cells. For example, topo II has been proposed to directly modulate DNA condensation, as depletion of the protein leads to perturbations in chromosomal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bower et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirano and Mitchison, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sakaguchi and Kikuchi, 2004</xref>). Topo II has also been found to be enriched at centromeres of condensed mitotic chromosomes and has been proposed to play a role in creating or stabilizing catenanes between sister chromatids both within these elements and in other chromosomal loci prior to metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgerton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Floridia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rattner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tavormina et al., 2002</xref>).

Our observation that topo II uses its C-terminal IDR elements to promote self-association and form enriched regions of high local protein concentration that facilitate DNA entanglement provides a molecular rationale for this collection of findings.</p><p>Interestingly, in vivo fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments with human TOP2α have previously led to the suggestion that the enzyme could adopt a condensed liquid phase state when associated with mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tavormina et al., 2002</xref>).

Moreover, both <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cardenas et al., 1992</xref>) and TOP2α are known to be differentially phosphorylated over the course of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burden and Sullivan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wells and Hickson, 1995</xref>), and disruption of a hyper-phosphorylated region in the TOP2α CTD has been shown to slow recovery following bleaching in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2019</xref>). These data comport with our findings showing that hypophosphorylation of <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 substantially lowers the fluidity of its condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E&amp;F</xref>), suggesting that phosphorylation status could be used to fine-tune the dynamics of higher order structures formed by topo II in vivo.

TOP2β has been directly linked to the proper progression of certain transcriptional programs, such as the activation of estrogen response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ju et al., 2006</xref>) and the expression of neuronal early-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Madabhushi et al., 2015</xref>) previous studies have additionally reported that the estrogen receptor can integrate into and enhance mediator condensates in the presence of estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boija et al., 2018</xref>). Although the relevance of condensate formation to transcription in vivo is still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>), the ability of Top2β to undergo LLPS could allow the enzyme to associate with transcription factories that are also part of a locally coalesced body. Indeed, the capacity for topo II and DNA to form an LLPS state could be useful for bringing spatially distant DNA segments such as promoters and enhancer elements together into a common locus, a localizing function that has been proposed for eukaryotic topo IIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pommier et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Under condensate-forming conditions, each of the eukaryotic topo IIs tested here created physical interlinks between DNA segments that led to an increase of knots and catenanes. In vivo, topo IIs have been shown to facilitate the formation of knots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Valdés et al., 2019</xref>), and work from the Marko lab and others have shown that catenanes are present in mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kawamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Valdés et al., 2018</xref>). Such topological intermediates – which are typically considered detrimental if allowed to persist – require either dissolution or some means to regulate their formation. In this regard, condensin has recently been reported to serve as a factor that can both promote catenation and antagonize knot formation by topo II in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dyson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shintomi and Hirano, 2021</xref>). We now show that topo IIs also have an intrinsic capacity to actively switch between DNA linking and unlinking modes. Catenation can be promoted by phase separation, whereas knotting occurs when local protein concentrations are high and decatenation predominates when protein concentrations are low or DNA binding is weakened. This behavior provides a potential mechanism by which topo IIs could alternate between producing distinct topological products in response to specific contextual needs. Future studies will be needed to probe the extent to which topo II manifests LLPS at a biophysical level, and to define the extent to which this property aids in partner protein selection and biological function in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maria Spies as a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nancy Kleckner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is an interesting and important paper and that the results justify the conclusions. Reviewers 1 and 2, however, raised several points that need to be addressed by either additional explanations or data (if the authors chose so). Specifically, clarification of the data shown in Figure 5. Biological repeats and the resultant quantification of the data shown in panels A and C, along with critical discussions on this issue, would help further strengthen the key conclusion of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3A: at pSG483 concentrations of 25 nm and above the morphology of the condensates changes dramatically and from figure 3B it appears that the fluidity or exchange also decreases. Slightly for these condensates at 25 nm, the highest concentration of plasmid measured in 3B. Since the conditions under which the dramatically different morphology form are used in subsequent experiments, e.g. Figure 5, it would be good to verify that the altered morphology does not result in an entirely different LLPS phase or behavior. It is an interesting question whether these structures are physiological or represent artificial aggregation. Based on the legend of Figure 4B increasing salt or DNA concentration in the buffer inhibits the formation of these structures. Have the authors assessed the reversibility of these structures by adding additional salt or DNA after first forming them in low salt conditions?</p><p>In a similar line of questioning, the distinct morphology occurs only with the supercoiled DNA substrate. Have the authors repeated these measurements with relaxed and/or linearized pSG483? The topology of the DNA could in principle alter the condensate behavior by altering the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate, and by altering the local concentration of DNA, which may alter binding of CTDs to DNA substrates in cis versus in trans. In yet another related question, it would be worth understanding how the presence of ATP alters the process of phase condensation. Not only would the ATP result in the relaxation of the supercoiled substrate, but the ATPase cycle could alter the conformations and affinity of the enzyme for the substrate DNA.</p><p>Figure 5 Supplement 1 B – The supertitle should be changed, since it indicates that the protein concentration is 1000 nm, whereas the protein concentration is increasing as indicated below the top title.

Do these structures mature in time into other forms?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Line 186: The authors use potassium acetate buffers in most of the experiments reported here presumably because this buffer system is most suitable to access the propensity for topo II-mediated LLPS. It would be helpful for the readers to state whether they can see LLPS in other buffer systems that have been commonly used in the study of topo II enzymology (e.g., Tris- and NaCl<sup>-</sup>based buffer).</p><p>2) Line 213: The authors state that &quot;budding yeast topo II can form higher-order spherical assemblies at protein concentrations greater than 250 nM…&quot;. What is the intracellular concentration of topo II in budding yeast cells? Of course, the effective, local concentration on chromatin and chromosomes would be different from the bulk concentrations in the cell, but such an estimate would help readers' understanding of to what extent the topo II concentrations used in the experiments are physiologically relevant.</p><p>3) Line 277: Although the observation that the addition of DNA makes structures formed by topo II more dynamic and fluid is potentially interesting, no clear discussion about why this happens is provided.</p><p>4) Line 327: The observation that 1,6-HD promotes the fibril aggregation of topo II is striking. Is this commonly observed when IDRs with a similar amino-acid composition to that of the topo II CTD (highly charged and poorly aromatic) are exposed to 1,6-HD?</p><p>5) Figure 4C-F: The set of experiments studying the effect of phosphatase treatments on the propensity for LLPS is weak. It is not clear to what extent the phosphorylation status of the topo II fractions purified from overexpressing cells reflects its physiological phosphorylation status. Treatment of the phosphatase-treated fractions with protein kinases known to phosphorylate topo II would help substantiate the authors' conclusion.</p><p>6) Figure 5: Topo II lacking the CTD forms catenanes rather than knots at intermediate concentrations (250-500 nM). This observation somehow contradicts the model shown in Figure 7. The authors' discussion regarding this point (line 623-) is not very convincing. This issue needs to be clarified. To do so, quantification of the results shown in Figures 5A and 5C, along with experimental repeats, would be required.</p><p>7) Figure 6: The observation that human topo IIa and topo IIb also undergo LLPS is an important addition to the current study, but unfortunately this part is very weak.

It would be fair to cite this recent work with a similar conclusion more explicitly.</p><p>9) Line 664-666: Citations here may not be appropriate: the Kleckner lab is not the first to show that topo II is enriched along chromosome axes. The authors may want to cite original papers such as those from the Laemmli and Earnshaw labs, especially, if it is the authors' policy to cite very original papers, like those on topo II enzymology.</p><p>10) Line 701-702: The discussion here by citing Dyson et al.

As noted in the paper, we avoid Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> because these are non-physiological ions for intracellular proteins, and we have seen that the specific activity of many of the enzymes we study improves in K-Glu/OAc buffers. However, historically, the reviewer is correct to note that many topoisomerase studies still use Na<sup>+</sup> and/or Cl<sup>-</sup>. We repeated the salt titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>) with 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5 and varying concentrations of NaCl. Samples were incubated for the same amount of time as with the K-OAc buffer conditions and imaged in the same manner. As can be seen, <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 LLPS still occurs in the presence of NaCl and follows trends similar to our K-OAc measurements in terms of being stimulated by DNA, solubilized by high DNA concentrations, and inhibited at 400 mM salt.

We arrived at this value by taking mass spectrometry data compiled in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> Genome Database (SGD, https://www.yeastgenome.org/), where the median abundance appears to be roughly 4000 molecules/cell. According to a paper by Jorgensen <italic>et al.</italic> (https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e06-10-0973), the volume of an average yeast nuclei is 3 µM<sup>3</sup>, so this gives us an approximation of 2 µM <italic>Sc</italic>Top2. We note that when estimating the concentration of human topo IIs (using data from (Padget, Pearson, and Austin, 2000)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 277: Although the observation that the addition of DNA makes structures formed by topo II more dynamic and fluid is potentially interesting, no clear discussion about why this happens is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that this is an interesting question; however, we do not have a good explanation for change in fluidity currently. It could be that, in the absence of DNA, interactions vis-à-vis the C-terminal domains somehow predominate to make the assemblies more gel-like, and that these contacts are weakened/interrupted by interactions with DNA. Alternatively, perhaps DNA simply acts as a spacer to keep topo IIs from packing too closely together. As part of our planned future studies, we intend to address such questions by using mutagenesis to investigate how changes to the amino acid composition and/or order of the C-terminal domain impact condensate behavior. However, given that our current ideas are speculative at best, we feel it best to avoid commenting on the behavior in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Line 327: The observation that 1,6-HD promotes the fibril aggregation of topo II is striking. Is this commonly observed when IDRs with a similar amino-acid composition to that of the topo II CTD (highly charged and poorly aromatic) are exposed to 1,6-HD?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the aggregation of Topo II with 1,6-HD is due to the Topo II core being denatured by 1,6-HD. This is supported by decreased activity of the enzyme in (Figure 4figure supplement 2B). When we explored this with the purified <italic>Sc</italic>Top2 CTD, we saw no effect on CTD phase separation from the addition 1,6-HD. As these data did not add significantly to or change the primary conclusions of the paper, we did not include them</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4C-F: The set of experiments studying the effect of phosphatase treatments on the propensity for LLPS is weak. It is not clear to what extent the phosphorylation status of the topo II fractions purified from overexpressing cells reflects its physiological phosphorylation status. Treatment of the phosphatase-treated fractions with protein kinases known to phosphorylate topo II would help substantiate the authors' conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that questions involving the phosphorylation status of purified proteins can be fraught with uncertainties, particularly when proteins are overexpressed regardless of cell cycle status. Since a large and variable number of post-translational marks have been reported for the C-terminal domain of topo IIs (e.g., see (Bedez et al., 2018; Cardenas, Dang, Glover, and Gasser, 1992)), we did not seek to make any particular connections between phosphorylation status <italic>per se</italic> as in might pertain in vivo. Rather, given that the topo II CTD <italic>is</italic> phosphorylated, we set out simply to test whether removing those phosphates might impact condensate fluidity (it did). This change is consistent with observations in other LLPS systems (such as eukaryotic replication initiators and Pgranule proteins (Wang et al., 2014) (https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.04591)), where altering post-translational modifications also has been reported to regulate condensate properties or propensity. Unfortunately, there is no one kinase that is known to have a particularly dominant impact on the phosphorylation state of topo II, so re-phosphorylating the protein to test this effect as requested is not presently feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5: Topo II lacking the CTD forms catenanes rather than knots at intermediate concentrations (250-500 nM). This observation somehow contradicts the model shown in Figure 7. The authors' discussion regarding this point (line 623-) is not very convincing. This issue needs to be clarified. To do so, quantification of the results shown in Figures 5A and 5C, along with experimental repeats, would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We did not intend for the figure or text to imply that catenation never occurs in the absence the CTD or that knotting never happens when the CTD is present. Rather, our data indicate that the CTD strongly shifts the equilibrium between the two modes of product formation. We have clarified this point in the text (Lines 634-646) and by adding an additional figure panel to Figure 7.</p><p>Regarding quantification, while this is possible for single circle knots (which form discrete bands), this is not possible for catenanes, which only partially migrate into the gel and tend to show degrees of enrichment around the gel wells that vary considerably depending on gel thickness, comb size, running conditions, staining time, temperature, and the degree of catenation. In addition, there are many intermediate topological products formed in these reactions (e.g., catenated dimers or trimers of knots with varying numbers of nodes in each DNA circle) that give rise to a certain level of persistent smearing, even after nicking. As a consequence, attempts to measure the catenanes and knots in 5A and 5C will be misleading, as the final concentration of each product cannot be accurately boxed and scanned for densitometric analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6: The observation that human topo IIa and topo IIb also undergo LLPS is an important addition to the current study, but unfortunately this part is very weak. It is not shown whether the observed LLPS depends on the CTD of each enzyme. The discussion about the difference between topo IIa and topo IIb (lines 671-692) is too speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that studying the effects of the CTD on LLPS by human Top2a and Top2b is important; however, repeating all the studies reported here for the yeast enzyme with both human proteins is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. We are currently working toward obtaining data for a second paper that will more thoroughly examine LLPS by Top2a and Top2b. Regarding the discussion concerning Top2a and Top2b, we felt it important to acknowledge previous models and observations by others that our work potentially helps to explain. We have attempted to tighten this part of the Discussion but respectfully prefer to leave much of the gist of the original work in place as a means of stimulating discussion in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 7: The model proposed here largely overlaps with that proposed by Shintomi and Hirano (2021).
