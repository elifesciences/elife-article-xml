kinase. Classic allosteric activation is in play where either activation loop phosphorylation or TPX2 binding to a conserved hydrophobic groove shifts the equilibrium far towards the active conformation. We resolve the controversy about the mechanism of autophosphorylation by demonstrating intermolecular autophosphorylation in a long-lived dimer by combining X-ray crystallography with functional assays. We then address the allosteric activation by TPX2 through activity assays and the crystal structure of a domain-swapped dimer of dephosphorylated Aurora A and TPX2<sup>1−25</sup>. While autophosphorylation is the key regulatory mechanism in the centrosomes in the early stages of mitosis, allosteric activation by TPX2 of dephosphorylated Aurora A could be at play in the spindle microtubules. The mechanistic insights into autophosphorylation and allosteric activation by TPX2 binding proposed here, may have implications for understanding regulation of other protein kinases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02667.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02667.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02667.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The kinase, Aurora A, is a human protein that is needed for cells to divide normally. Kinases are enzymes that control other proteins by adding phosphate groups to these proteins; however, like other kinases, Aurora A must first be activated or ‘switched on’ before it can do this. Aurora A kinase can be switched on in two ways: by having a phosphate group added to its ‘activation loop’; or by binding to another protein called TPX2.</p><p>Also like other kinases, Aurora A can self-activate, but the details of this process are not understood. Does a single Aurora A kinase add a phosphate group to its own activation loop, or does one Aurora A kinase activate a second? Furthermore, it is not clear how binding to TPX2 can activate an Aurora A kinase without adding a phosphate group to the activation loop.</p><p>Zorba, Buosi et al. now show that Aurora A kinases that have been activated in different ways—via the addition of a phosphate group or binding to TPX2—are equally good at adding phosphate groups to other proteins. Zorba, Buosi et al. also worked out the three-dimensional shapes of the kinases activated in these two ways—since many proteins change shape when they are switched on—and found that they were also the same. Finally, it was shown that self-activation involves two Aurora A kinases binding to each other, and one kinase adding a phosphate group to the other, rather than a single kinase adding a phosphate group to itself.</p><p>Since other protein kinases can be activated in similar ways to Aurora A, the findings of Zorba, Buosi et al. might also help us to understand how other protein kinases can be switched ‘on’ or ‘off’. And, as mutations in Aurora A have been linked to the development of cancer, uncovering how this kinase is controlled could help efforts to design new drugs to treat this disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02667.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02667.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>activation</kwd><kwd>mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM100966-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Catalyst Science Program, DE-FG02-05ER15699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aurora A kinase, an anti-cancer drug target, can be activated by two independent mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolution of more than 500 human protein kinases from a few protein kinases in unicellular organisms allowed for the development of complexity via differential regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Manning et al., 2002</xref>). Such regulation can be achieved by autophosphorylation or interactions with other domains or binding partners. While many of the signaling cascades and their in vivo biological effectors have been well characterized, and a wealth of structural information is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Johnson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Manning et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tyson et al., 2003</xref>), the molecular mechanism whereby kinase activity is modulated is a topic of controversial debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al., 2013</xref>). Here we investigate two fundamentally distinct regulation mechanisms by characterizing autophosphorylation of Aurora A as well as activation by TPX2 (Targeting Protein for Xklp2). Aurora A, a Ser/Thr kinase, is a key regulator of mitotic events, including mitotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Macurek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Seki et al., 2008</xref>), centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glover et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hannak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Toji et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mori et al., 2007</xref>), and spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Giet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsai and Zheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Koffa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Venoux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).

TPX2 recruits Aurora A to the spindle microtubules, an event that is essential in spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Giubettini et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Autophosphorylation of T288 in the activation loop increases the catalytic activity of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Walter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Littlepage et al., 2002</xref>). Intramolecular autophosphorylation has recently been suggested for Aurora A and Chk2 based on indirect kinetic measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al., 2013</xref>) adding to the controversy by disagreeing with the intermolecular mechanism proposed for other protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A second puzzling result has also been reported recently. It was shown that in vivo during mitosis, TPX2-bound Aurora A at the spindle microtubules is dephosphorylated at the crucial T288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Toya et al., 2011</xref>). Since T288-dephosphorylated Aurora A exhibits very low kinase activity, a second kinase-independent function of Aurora A was postulated (Littlepage, 2002). There is evidence suggesting that TPX2 also plays an active role in upregulating Aurora A activity, however the interplay between the two distinct activation mechanisms, phosphorylation and TPX2-binding, is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kufer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carmena and Earnshaw, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Eyers and Maller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Eyers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kufer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Trieselmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayliss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brunet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eyers and Maller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ozlu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsai and Zheng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2007</xref>).

Realization of this thought experiment is challenging because most of the intermolecular interactions for the dimer are present as corresponding intramolecular contacts in the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We rationalized that a C290A mutation could work because C290 of one monomer contacts Y334 of the αG-helix of the other monomer, while in phosphorylated monomeric Aurora A, C290 contacts K143, W277, L289, and G291 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The C290A mutation indeed results in a primarily monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) that also has severely impaired autophosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, once phosphorylated, C290A has nearly normal catalytic activity towards the AP substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), buttressing the functional role of the swapped WT dimer for autophosphorylation. Particularly striking is the observation that in a 1:1 mixture of dephosphorylated WT and C290A mutant, WT autophosphorylation precedes C290A phosphorylation in the early reaction time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right and inset) but phosphorylation kinetics are identical at later time points. Such kinetic behavior is expected for a model of initial autophosphorylation between two dephosphorylated molecules within the swapped dimer and the subsequent taking over of intermolecular autophosphorylation by newly phosphorylated enzyme molecules. This latter reaction is much faster, suggesting atomistic differences in comparison to the swapped dimer reaction. The C290A mutant is incapable of forming a hybrid swapped dimer between one molecule each of dephosphorylated C290A and WT protein, explaining the lag in its phosphorylation kinetics relative to WT.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02667.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A mutant at the dimer interface (C290A) disrupts the swapped-dimer formation and autophosphorylation without affecting the activity of the phosphorylated Aurora A C290A monomer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) C290 of monomer I (light pink spheres) packs against Y334 of the αG-helix of monomer II.

This specific interaction between a hydrophobic groove at the junction of the αB/αC-helices in the N-lobe of kinases and a short sequence called ‘the hydrophobic motif’ (Tyr/Phe-X(X)-Tyr/Phe) from either another partner or from its own C-terminal tail, seems to be a conserved regulatory mechanism across the AGC family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>).

Because of the controversy about the autophosphorylation mechanism of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pike et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lochhead, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), we felt the need for multiple lines of evidence. Our aim was to determine the structure of a dephosphorylated enzyme/substrate complex ‘ready for autophosphorylation’. The swapped dimer is indeed asymmetric, with one monomer playing the role of the enzyme and the other that of the substrate. In the substrate molecule, the hydroxyl group of T288 is in principle capable of reaching the γ-phosphate of AMPPCP bound to the enzyme monomer as shown by TMD simulations. Domain-swapped dimers have been solved for a number of protein kinases and questioned for their relevance or crystal artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al., 2013</xref>). To address such a critique directly, we showed a long-lived dimer in solution. Importantly, using three biochemical tricks of (i) a mixture between wild type and dead mutant and (ii) a serial dilution, and (iii) a C290A mutant with severely impaired dimer formation and autophosporylation but nearly normal peptide phosphorylation activity in its phosphorylated monomeric state, we could directly demonstrate an intermolecular autophosphorylation mechanism within this long-lived dimer.</p><p>Our combined biochemical, thermodynamic, structural, and computational data resolve the controversy about the molecular mechanism(s) of autophosphorylation in Aurora A by directly <italic>measuring the process of autophosphorylation</italic> and linking it to a long-lived functional dimer of dephosphorylated Aurora A. This is in sharp contrast to the mechanism of intramolecular autophosphorylation put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al. (2013)</xref> based on <italic>measuring the kinetics of peptide phosphorylation</italic> using an automated microchip assay as indirect readout, and not by monitoring autophosphorylation. While the experiments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al. (2013)</xref> are conceptually correct, there are a number of errors in the experimental setup and data analysis. Michaelis–Menten equations applied to analyze all data cannot be used because Michaelis–Menten conditions are not met, since the peptide concentration of 3 μM is not much higher than the enzyme concentrations used. Competition of free enzyme for the peptide versus another enzyme molecule is not included in the scheme. The peptide concentration is far below its K<sub>M</sub> and ATP hydrolysis is faster under these conditions than peptide phosphorylation producing ADP concentrations that cause significant and time-dependent enzyme inhibition (DK, unpublished). Finally, knowledge of the slow dissociation of the dimer and its consequences for the measured kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) exposes another source for incorrect data interpretation since the experiments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al. (2013)</xref> were started by serial dilutions from a high enzyme stock solution. The ongoing discussions on a large collection of functional, structural, and computational data on autophosphorylation in protein kinases underscore both the evolution of differential regulation mechanisms and the difficulty of elucidating these complex biological mechanisms.</p><p>Our findings may have more general implications for the family of eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinases. A number of swapped dimer structures have been solved from this enzyme class, and while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dodson et al. (2013)</xref> argued that these dimers are crystallographic artifacts (such as Chk2), our correlation between a domain-swapped dimer and its functional relevance would instead suggest that the reported structures are mechanistically meaningful. For direct evidence the functional relevance of these dimer structures would need to be assessed, as has been reported by elegant experiments for Chk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pike et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, most of the known swapped dimers sit in an inactive conformation (using all structural hallmarks for an active kinase discussed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). However, a few dimers capture all active-state structural signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, LOK and Chk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oliver et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pike et al., 2008</xref>]). All previously reported Aurora A dimers are in inactive conformations (PDB IDs 2BMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fancelli et al., 2005</xref>], 3DJ5, and 3DJ6), while in our new structure both Aurora A molecules are in the active conformation with one monomer serving as the enzyme molecule and the other as the substrate.</p><p>The functional effect of autophosphorylation is a 100-fold increase in the catalytic activity of Aurora A. While this catalytic boost is comparable to other Ser/Thr kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hagopian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Prowse and Lew, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams, 2003</xref>), the more surprising result has been our finding that TPX2 binding activates dephosphorylated Aurora A to similar levels. This is again in contrast to previous reports of additive effects from the two distinct activation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dodson and Bayliss, 2012</xref>). Our results point to a classic allosteric regulation mechanism where either phosphorylation in the activation loop or TPX2 binding in the conserved remote hydrophobic groove shifts the equilibrium far towards the active state.</p><p>While the work here has only been concerned with in vitro experiments, it may provide insight into the regulatory roles of Aurora A in the cellular context. Immunofluorescence data have shown that the centrosome-associated Aurora A pool is mainly phosphorylated, whereas the spindle-associated and TPX2-bound Aurora A is dephosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tyler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Scutt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sloane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>). In parallel, a recent study on the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homologue of Aurora A kinase, AIR-1, showed that spindle-microtubule associated Aurora A was not phosphorylated and could nonetheless carry on centrosome-independent microtubule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Toya et al., 2011</xref>). In light of our new findings that TPX2 fully activates dephosphorylated Aurora A, the previous in vivo experiments can be re-interpreted as kinase-activity dependent functions of spindle-microtubule associated Aurora A, and not a kinase-independent function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Toya et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro data together with previous in vivo results suggest that nature has evolved two distinct regulation mechanisms for Aurora A in different locations within the cell: autophosphorylation as activation in the centrosomes to promote phosphorylation of downstream targets, and TPX2-mediated activation at the spindle microtubules promoting Aurora A activity to another subset of downstream targets. This hypothesis is supported by the differential timing of Aurora A and TPX2 availability. Aurora A kinase levels are available as early as S-phase and peak in the G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dutertre et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu and Ruderman, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, TPX2 levels peak in the prometaphase/spindle formation stage that follows the G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gruss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eckerdt and Maller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Macurek et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings help shed light on an elegant strategy for fine-tuning cellular kinetics that provides more complex regulation in higher organisms.</p><p>We finally want to raise the question whether Aurora A autophosphorylation is physiologically relevant in cells or whether phosphorylation-mediated activation is primarily accomplished by upstream kinases. While we do not have a conclusive answer to this challenging question, which has been tackled for a number of other protein kinases, we discuss several conjectures. Although the upstream PAK1 kinase can phosphorylate Aurora A at T288, autophosphorylation appears to be the essential mode of activation because PAK1 inhibition does not abolish cell division but Aurora A inhibitors do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu and Ruderman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>). Are the in vitro autophosphorylation kinetics reported here compatible with the known phosphorylation kinetics of Aurora A during the cell cycle? Our data imply that the initial rate of Aurora A autophosphorylation is very slow because this reaction occurs via the long-lived swapped dimer between two dephosphoryated Aurora A molecules. Further autophosphorylation displays a strong sigmoidal character revealing much faster kinetics of Aurora A phosphorylation by an already phosphorylated Aurora A molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>). In light of the increased local concentration of Aurora A in the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Glover et al., 1995</xref>) (although the exact concentration is not known), our measured autophosphorylation kinetics is qualitatively in line with the progression of Aurora A T288 phosphorylation during the 3–4 h of G2/M duration in HeLa cells at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crosio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Littlepage and Ruderman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ohashi et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning and purification of Aurora A kinase</title><p>TEV-cleavable, His6-tagged Aurora A kinase, either long (122–403) or short (125–392) constructs, were cloned into pET28a and expressed in Rosetta 2 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Stratagene) for 13–15 h at 21°C.

Then 5 μl time points were collected, resuspended in 10 μl 6% (vol/vol) trichloroacetic acid (in water) to quench the reaction, and neutralized with 50 μl 100 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0 to provide the appropriate pH for nucleotide separation. The mixture was then passed through a 0.22 μm SpinX column to remove any protein precipitation. Reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and an ACE 5 C18-AR, 100 Å pore size column, were used to separate nucleotides as well as peptides. For nucleotide runs, 2 μl of the aforementioned mixture was sufficient for analysis, whereas for the peptide runs the optimal injection volume was 20 μl. Nucleotide runs were routinely performed to ensure no unproductive hydrolysis was occurring during the experiment. An isocratic elution run in 100 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.0 was performed for this purpose. For the peptide runs, a gradient of 0–30% of elution buffer lasting 10 min at 0.4 mL/min was sufficient to separate phosphorylated from non-phosphorylated species. The running buffer was 0.1% TFA (vol/vol) in water, while the elution buffer was 100% acetonitrile. Representative peptide RP-HPLC traces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref>. Lastly, to ensure full saturation of Aurora A by TPX2 and test these proteins were well behaved, a dose-dependence curve of the effect of TPX2 on Aurora A as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 6</xref> was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>All titrations were carried out using Nano ITC (TA Instruments) and analyzed via the NanoAnalyze software using the independent fit model.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Philip Cole is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Zorba et al is a multifaceted study aimed at clarifying the roles of autophosphorylation and TPX2 mechanisms of activation of the Aurora A kinase (AAK) as well as the molecularity of autophosphorylation of AAK. Several key findings include:</p><p>1) The stimulation by AAK autophosphorylation of Thr288 (by 100-fold) is roughly matched by TPX2 stimulation of unphosphorylated AAK (by 40-fold)</p><p>2) The domain swapped dimer of the unphosphorylated AAK in the presence of TPX2 represents a possible interaction of intermolecular autohosphorylation.</p><p>3) The solution phase assays especially with a dead mutant as substrate demonstrate the kinetic competence of intermolecular autophosphorylation.</p><p>Additional bolstering data include molecular modeling showing how the disordered loop in monomer II of AAK could be positioned for phosphoryl transfer in the active site of monomer I of AAK, analytical ultracentrifugation and SAXS showing the presence of a minor population of solution phase dimer in AAK, and ITC and enzymatic experiments demonstrating that aa1-25 of TPX2 are necessary and sufficient for high affinity binding (ca 2 uM) and activation. The careful use of Abs and mass spec really help to provide quantitative information about the state of Thr288 phosphorylation in the various enzyme forms. Importantly, the results here fill gaps in the literature about AAK regulation and contradict those from a recent study from Dodson et al reporting that AAK autophosphorylation is intramolecular. Zorba et al point out several limitations in Dodson et al that can account for the differing conclusions. Overall, Zorba et al is carefully executed, well-written, and makes a set of significant findings that should interest a broad readership. We ask the authors to address the issues below.</p><p>1) A missing piece that if added would significantly enhance this study relates to the structural basis of AAK autophosphorylation. The domain swapped AAK dimer shows surfaces of interaction in the C-lobes that one assumes are important for intermolecular autophosphorylation if the authors' model is correct. It would be very useful to mutagenize these contacting residues to ascertain their contributions to the kinetics of AAK autophosphorylation. A hypothesis to be tested would be that once autophosphorylation is completed (even if slower in such contact mutants), activity of such AAK mutants with peptide substrates would be near normal.</p><p>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> at 1 µM AAK suggests a half-life of at least 400 seconds. This would predict a half-life of at least 4000 seconds (67 minutes) at 100 nM. These slow rates invite concerns about the physiologic significance of autophosphorylation as an activation mechanism of AAK rather than its activation by an upstream kinase such as PAK1 or CDK11. On the other hand, it appears that the assays were carried out at 25°C, which could slow things down. Moreover, the local effective concentration of AAK may be higher than its total cellular concentration. We hope that the authors can provide a perspective on whether the preponderance of existing evidence supports that AAK autophosphorylation is relevant to AAK's normal cellular function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02667.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A missing piece that if added would significantly enhance this study relates to the structural basis of AAK autophosphorylation.

We had originally thought about this experiment but were discouraged by the fact that most of the intermolecular interactions for the dimer are present as corresponding intramolecular contacts in the monomer and by our pervious failure to disrupt a dimer interface in another kinase. Challenged by the reviewers, we gave this experiment a try and to our pleasant surprise it worked quite cleanly with the C290A mutation. Residue C290 makes different contacts in the swapped dimer relative to the monomer, and we therefore speculated that a mutation in this position might not be too disruptive to the monomer fold and activity.</p><p>The C209A mutant is predominantly monomeric (by AUC) and indeed severely hampered in its autophosphorylation. As logically reasoned by the referees, the activity of the phosphorylated C290A mutant towards peptide substrates is comparable to the WT protein. We added these new data and the interpretation to the manuscript (in the Results and Discussion section of the manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref> <italic>at 1 µM AAK suggests a half-life of at least 400 seconds.

Although we do not have a definite answer to this challenging but crucial question, we have added one paragraph to the end of the Conclusion rationalizing that autophosphorylation could conceivably be a major mechanism in vivo.</p><p>A) Pak1 inhibition only delays the cell cycle, but does not arrest it and does not lead to cell death, in contrast to specific Aurora A kinase inhibitors that do.</p><p>B) As rationalized by the referees, the increased local concentration of Aurora A and the increased cellular temperature conjectures that our in vitro-measured autophosphorylation kinetics at 25°C are compatible with known Aurora A T288 phosphorylation kinetics during the 3 to 4 hours of G2/M duration in HeLa cells.</p><p>Furthermore we discuss the strong sigmoidal phosphorylation kinetics measured in our manuscript as additional evidence.</p></body></sub-article></article>
