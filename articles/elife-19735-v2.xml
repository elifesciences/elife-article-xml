However, very little is known about the extrinsic signals that act on planarian stem cells to modulate rates of neurogenesis. We have identified two planarian homeobox transcription factors, <italic>Smed-nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>Smed-arx</italic>, which are required for the maintenance of cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons in the planarian CNS. These very same neurons also produce the planarian <italic>hedgehog</italic> ligand (<italic>Smed-hh</italic>), which appears to communicate with brain-adjacent stem cells to promote normal levels of neurogenesis. Planarian stem cells nearby the brain express core <italic>hh</italic> signal transduction genes, and consistent <italic>hh</italic> signaling levels are required to maintain normal production of neural progenitor cells and new mature cholinergic neurons, revealing an important mitogenic role for the planarian <italic>hh</italic> signaling molecule in the adult CNS.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19735.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19735.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19735.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most animals can continue to generate and add new neurons in their nervous system into adulthood, though the process is often tightly regulated. In adult humans, only a small number of neurons are made or lost, such that the fewer than 2% of the neurons in the nervous will change over, or “turnover”, the course of a year.</p><p>The turnover of neurons in some other animals is much higher than it is in humans. A freshwater flatworm, called <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>, is one example of such an animal that can even regenerate an entirely new brain if its head is decapitated. These flatworms have a large population of adult stem cells, which makes these high rates of neuron production and regeneration possible. However, it is largely unknown if this population contains stem cells that can only become new neurons, in other words “dedicated neuronal stem cells”. Moreover, it is also not clear what kinds of signals communicate with these stem cells to promote the production of new neurons.</p><p>In animals from flies to humans, a signaling molecule encoded by a gene called <italic>hedgehog</italic> forms part of a signaling pathway that can promote neuron production during development. Therefore, Currie et al. asked if the <italic>hedgehog</italic> signaling molecule might communicate with the stem cells in adult flatworms to control how many new neurons they produce.</p><p>The experiments revealed that the <italic>hedgehog</italic> signaling molecule is almost exclusively produced by the flatworm’s brain and the pair of nerve cords that run the length of the flatworm. Currie et al. then found a smaller group of cells close to the flatworm’s brain that looked like dedicated neural stem cells. These cells can receive the <italic>hedgehog</italic> signals, and further experiments showed that flatworm’s brain requires <italic>hedgehog</italic> signaling to be able to produce new neurons at its normal level.</p><p>The <italic>hedgehog</italic> signaling molecule is likely only one of many signaling molecules that regulate the production of new neurons in flatworms. It will be important to uncover these additional signals and understand how they work in concert. In the future, a better understanding of this process will help efforts to devise ways to induce humans to replace neurons that are lost following injury or neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19735.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19735.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>planarians</kwd><kwd><italic>schmidtea mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>flatworms</kwd><kwd>triclads</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2016-06354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Currie</surname><given-names>Ko W</given-names></name><name><surname>Molinaro</surname><given-names>Alyssa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004203</institution-id><institution>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Bret J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Planarian brain neurons modulate their turnover by signaling to nearby stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Once thought to be a non-existent phenomenon, homeostatic adult neurogenesis is a common trait shared by many disparate organisms including rodents, birds, flies, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman, 1962</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doetsch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldman and Nottebohm, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eriksson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernández-Hernández et al., 2013</xref>). However, levels of neuronal turnover are tightly limited in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Obernier et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, the highest known site of adult homeostatic neurogenesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) is the hippocampus, where annual neuronal turnover rates are estimated to be only 1.75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spalding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergmann et al., 2012</xref>). Adult neurogenesis in most animals depends on the action of ectodermally derived neural stem cells, which have radial-glial character and are integrated into a stable niche microenvironment. Extrinsic signals such as wingless (Wnt), sonic hedgehog (Shh), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act to finely control neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva-Vargas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehtinen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The asexual strain of the freshwater planarian, <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea (S. mediterranea)</italic>, is a constitutive adult flatworm (Lophotrochozoan) that challenges the dogma of low rates of adult neurogenesis. Not only does <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> constantly turnover its brain, but also it is capable of complete brain regeneration within only two weeks following decapitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cebria, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2002</xref>). In addition, the uninjured planarian CNS is known to be a highly dynamic organ, which can adjust its size through the addition or subtraction of mature neurons to maintain consistent proportions with the rest of the body as it grows and shrinks, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baguñá and Romero, 1981</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>). Amazingly, these regenerative feats and high levels of homeostatic neurogenesis are accomplished in the absence of a recognizable neuroepithelium, and without any definitive neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, brain-derived Wnt signals have been shown to influence the neurogenic output of planarian stem cells (neoblasts) during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>). However, little is known about the specific extracellular signals and transcription factors that modulate neoblast activity within this body region to balance cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, which undoubtedly involves many overlapping regulatory systems.</p><p>Here, we have identified two planarian homeodomain transcription factors, <italic>Smed-nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>Smed-arx</italic> (henceforth referred to as <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic>), which act to specify cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons within the ventral-medial (VM) region of the planarian CNS. Interestingly, these very same VM neural cell types are a major source of the planarian hedgehog ligand (<italic>Smed-hh;</italic> henceforth referred to as <italic>hh</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yazawa et al., 2009</xref>). We also describe a novel neoblast population, which are <italic>nkx2.1</italic><sup>+</sup> or <italic>arx</italic><sup>+</sup>, express the core machinery for the reception of <italic>hh</italic> and Wnt signals, and are located adjacent to <italic>hh</italic><sup>+</sup> VM neurons. Finally, we present evidence that consistent <italic>hh</italic> signaling within this neoblast microenvironment is required to promote normal homeostatic neurogenesis of the VM neuronal population. In total, we identify a <italic>hh</italic> signaling axis that positively modulates VM neurogenesis through distinct progenitor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> are expressed in ventral-medial neural cell types</title><p><italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> were originally cloned and isolated during an RNAi screen aimed at identifying planarian transcription factors with potential roles in neuronal specification.

This work has demonstrated that two planarian homeodomain transcription factor homologs, <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic>, function in the long-term maintenance of cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons in the VM region of the planarian CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Surprisingly, these same three VM neural cell types were also found to express the <italic>hh</italic> signaling molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Neuronal <italic>hh</italic> expression was also confirmed by using a scRNAseq dataset that included mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>), and additionally revealed that all four of the sequenced <italic>hh</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons co-expressed a planarian Wnt ligand, <italic>Smed-wnt11-6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Specialized <italic>nkx2.1</italic><sup>+</sup> or <italic>arx</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts were also identified, which were typically localized adjacent to the VM region of the planarian CNS, and express key members of the <italic>hh</italic> and Wnt signal transduction machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Finally, the planarian <italic>hh</italic> pathway was found to be required to maintain steady levels of neurogenesis in the intact brain, as a reduction in <italic>hh</italic> signaling activity, led to decreased production of neural stem/progenitor cells and newly generated cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Similar to planarian muscle cells, many of which express important signaling molecules that maintain positional control along the body axis and during regeneration events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scimone et al., 2016</xref>), mature planarian neurons express <italic>hh</italic> and Wnt ligands which regulate neurogenesis levels and maintain patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the Wnt ligand <italic>Smed-wnt11-6</italic> and Wnt antagonist <italic>Smed-notum</italic> are expressed by cholinergic neurons, and that this Wnt signal acts on planarian stem cells to repress neuron production and prevent posterior expansion of brain tissue during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hill and Petersen, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we show that several planarian neurons simultaneously express this repressive Wnt ligand as well as the <italic>hh</italic> signaling molecule, which promotes the production of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>). Conceptually, it makes sense that signals originating from the mature CNS, would act to repress neurogenesis programs. This would help to establish a steady-state system, which modulates neurogenesis levels depending on the size of the existing CNS. However, our observations suggest that contrary to this model, neuronal sources of <italic>hh</italic> actively promote neurogenesis levels in both the brain and of eye photoreceptors neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>).</p><p>It is unclear, exactly how the planarian <italic>hh</italic> signaling pathway achieves rates of neuronal homeostasis, whether it acts as a permissive cue, influencing neoblasts adjacent to the brain to produce neural cell types, or as a mitogenic signal, to control proliferation levels of neural-biased stem cells. Similar to mechanisms of Hh action in other systems, the regulatory loops are likely to be complex in planarians due to the fact that long-term <italic>hh(RNAi)</italic>, surprisingly, did not produce robust neural deficits over a span of five weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).

In support of this idea, the role of <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> in the maintenance of planarian cholinergic and GABAergic neurons was particularly noteworthy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as their mammalian counterparts (Nkx2.1 and Arx) are known to fulfill similar roles and also be under the control of <italic>sonic hedgehog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jessell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colasante et al., 2008</xref>). In the embryonic rodent ventral telencephalon, Nkx2.1 acts in upstream neural progenitor cells to produce both cortical GABAergic interneurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sussel et al., 1999</xref>), whereas Arx functions downstream in the terminal differentiation and migration of cortical GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). Notwithstanding this slight deviation in cell fate determinism, it appears that these two transcription factors have retained a remarkable degree of functional conservation across this significant evolutionary gap.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p><italic>Smed-nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>Smed-arx</italic> were found by homology to mammalian orthologs in the sequenced and assembled planarian genome and transcriptomes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Currie and Pearson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robb et al., 2008</xref>).

All RNAi food was fed to 7-day starved experimental worms every third day for six total feedings, and fixed 10–14 after the final RNAi feeding.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review summary:</p><p>Adult neurogenesis in the brain is an intriguing phenomenon that is widespread among animal systems, but its regulation is currently not well understood. Planarians are an accessible model with a high rate of adult neuronal cell turnover, and therefore are an excellent model to study the regulation adult neurogenesis in vivo. This manuscript addresses the contribution of hedgehog signaling to the regulation of several neuronal cell populations in the planarian brain. The text is well written, the work is elegant and well executed, and the images look clear. Its findings should be of interest to a wide audience interested in neurogenesis.</p><p>These authors investigate mechanisms controlling neurogenesis in regeneration and characterize two transcription factors (<italic>arx</italic> and <italic>nkx2.1</italic>) important for neural differentiation in the planarian brain. <italic>nkx2.1</italic> was expressed in both octopaminergic and GABAergic neurons whereas <italic>arx</italic> was expressed mainly in octopaminergic neurons within a ventromedial (VM) region. <italic>nkx2.1</italic> RNAi eliminated VM GABAergic neurons and strongly reduced numbers of octopaminergic neurons. <italic>arx</italic> RNAi animals had reduced numbers of VM-resident cholinergic and octopaminergic neurons. Searching for signals originating in this ventromedial brain domain that could regulate neurogenesis, they find that hedgehog is expressed within VM neurons. The authors analyze a prior single-cell RNAseq study to identify <italic>hedgehog<sup>+</sup></italic> cells as being mainly neuronal, with the feedback target patched expressed in several populations of neoblasts including brain progenitors. Furthermore, <italic>hh</italic> RNAi animals had reduced numbers of brain progenitors within the neoblast population, including <italic>nkx2.1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>arx</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts, and also these animals had reduced incorporation of new <italic>chat</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons into the brain, arguing for a direct function for <italic>hh</italic> signaling in promoting neurogenesis. Finally, this differentiation program has importance for CNS function as <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> inhibited animals present with behavioral abnormalities.</p><p>As you can see in the specific comments provided below, the reviewers agreed that there are a few gaps in the manuscript.

New experiments using double FISH provide convincing evidence to confirm the RNA-seq observations of co-expression of <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> in <italic>hh<sup>+</sup></italic> cells. The authors also now convincingly demonstrate that effects of <italic>hh</italic> RNAi and <italic>ptc</italic> RNAi on BrdU incorporation and progenitor numbers is specific to the CNS (and eye) and not pharynx, epidermis and gut. Therefore, the influence of <italic>hh</italic> and <italic>ptc</italic> on brain progenitors are not likely to be due to a global alteration of neoblast proliferation or differentiation rates. Finally, text changes have improved the flow of the paper, including the change to the discussion/presentation of the Wnt data which has improved the focus of the paper. Therefore, I believe the authors have satisfactorily addressed the issues initially raised, and the manuscript is ready for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>I think most issues raised in the decision letter have been addressed and this has definitely improved the manuscript. The manuscript is fine, but unfortunately the authors still leave me with the impression that something is being held back.

It just keeps me less enthusiastic than I would wish to be.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The single cell data remains unconvincing as before as it involves too few relevant cells. In addition, when looking into the now declared <italic>nkx2.1</italic> contig in the Wurtzel data its expression seems to be all over the place, and not enriched in neuronal cells. <italic>Arx</italic> seems hardly detectable in the dataset. This is not a fault in the dataset, but it is just not intended for this type of detailed analysis scrutinising expression data of single genes in such low numbers of cells.

There is no clear data showing that these cells are enriched close to the CNS as the scRNAseq data is not uniquely from head regions.

Specifically, we have looked at any possible changes after <italic>hh</italic> or <italic>ptc</italic> RNAi to progenitor levels for other planarian tissue types (eyes, pharynx, epidermis, and gut). In addition, we performed new experiments to examine BrdU incorporation into these same mature tissues after <italic>hh</italic> or <italic>ptc</italic> RNAi. We have found that these RNAi conditions do not reduce the production of progenitors nor BrdU incorporation for the pharynx, epidermis, or gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). However, for the eyes, we do observe a decrease in the production of eye progenitors after <italic>hh</italic> RNAi, and an increase in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the mature eye after <italic>ptc</italic> RNAi. It should be noted that the marker used to identify the eyes, <italic>Smed-ovo</italic>, largely marks the photoreceptor neurons of the visual system (Lapan and Reddien, 2012). Therefore, it appears that <italic>hh</italic> signaling also affects the production of neurons of the visual system in addition to modulating neurogenesis in the CNS. This is now addressed in the Discussion as well.</p><p><italic>2) There is no solid co-expression data for arx/nkx2.1 and ptc, as well as for arx /nkx2.1 and hh. As this is what the paper hinges on, it should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>Another good point. We have addressed these points, by performing dFISH experiments to show co-expression of <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> within <italic>hh</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons in the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As well we have performed dFISH combined with immunolabelling against a PIWI-1 antibody (which labels stem cells and immediate post-mitotic progenitors), to observe <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> expression within <italic>ptc</italic><sup>+</sup>/PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells in between the brain lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

If the authors have a compelling reason to keep it in, they may be able to write that more clearly.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the Wnt signaling components may be interfering with the overall clarity of the manuscript. As such, we have dropped a lot of this data from the main figures and the text. Specifically, we have removed all of the WISH and dFISH images for the planarian Frizzled receptors from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, but have kept them as a supplemental figure, and have significantly cut down their emphasis in the manuscript text. However, we have kept the in silico sequencing data showing that planarian neurons can co-express both the <italic>hh</italic> ligand as well as the <italic>wnt5</italic> and <italic>wnt11-6</italic> ligands, as this is an interesting biological phenomenon where mature neurons express multiple important signaling molecules.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[…] As you can see in the reviewers' comments, they have agreed that you have mostly addressed the concerns raised during the first round of the review.

Even with only 39 neurons, <italic>arx<sup>+</sup>hh<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>nkx2.1+hh</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are detected. The reviewer’s comment regarding broad <italic>nkx2.1</italic> detection in the Wurtzel data simply describes its broad expression pattern shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and it is not relevant whether it is neuronally “enriched”. It is also not surprising to detect few <italic>arx</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons given the very narrow expression of this gene shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Our recently published stem cell and progenitor, single-cell sequencing from heads (~200 cells total) could have been used on the stem cell side of <italic>arx</italic> and <italic>nkx2.1</italic> expression, but it did not make sense to us as to why we now chose to use a different dataset for stem cells than we used for neurons (where we had no choice). In addition, using data generated by a different group seemed more robust. However, now based on this reviewer’s comment, we have switched out the Wurtzel data for our own data that was exclusively head stem/progenitors (Molinaro and Pearson, 2016). As expected, we detect many more <italic>nkx2.1</italic><sup>+</sup> or <italic>arx</italic><sup>+</sup> stem/progenitor cells, supporting all of our same conclusions at the Wurtzel data. The accompanying text now reflects not needing to describe σ, zeta, or γ neoblasts (from old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but now must introduce X1/Χ2 terminology where appropriate. The Wurtzel heatmaps from our previous version are still included but now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We strongly disagree with the assessment that these datasets are “not intended for this type of detailed analysis” and actually argue the opposite.</p><p><italic>For the mature neurons, the newly added double FISH clearly shows that there is some overlap between arx and hh, but also that both are largely non-overlapping in the same region. nkx2.1 only shows overlap when hh signal is oversaturated in the image.

This also translates to dFISH experiments, where <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>arx</italic> are technically challenging to detect with standard tyramide amplification. The same is true of <italic>hh</italic> by sequencing and FISH. Therefore, we know that both the sequencing and dFISH are an underestimation of the overlap of these various gene expression patterns due to being near the limits of detection for both methods. We did not, of course, expect much overlap between <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>hh</italic> in <italic>chat</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons due to only ~36% of VM <italic>chat</italic>+ cells express <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and only ~23% express <italic>hh</italic>, in addition to the lack of phenotype in <italic>nkx2.1(RNAi)</italic> on <italic>hh<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We do expect <italic>nkx2.1</italic> and <italic>hh</italic> expression to overlap in GABAergic and Octopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).
