In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, growth ceases in response to a peak of the molting hormone ecdysone that coincides with a nutrition-dependent checkpoint, critical weight. Previous studies indicate that insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in the prothoracic glands (PGs) regulates ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight. Here we elucidate a mechanism through which this occurs. We show that Forkhead Box class O (FoxO), a negative regulator of IIS/TOR, directly interacts with Ultraspiracle (Usp), part of the ecdysone receptor. While overexpressing FoxO in the PGs delays ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight, disrupting FoxO–Usp binding reduces these delays. Further, feeding ecdysone to larvae eliminates the effects of critical weight. Thus, nutrition controls ecdysone biosynthesis partially via FoxO–Usp prior to critical weight, ensuring that growth only stops once larvae have achieved a target nutritional status.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03091.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03091.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03091.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The development of many of an animal's traits and characteristics are sensitive to the conditions of its environment. The conditions experienced early on in life, in particular, can alter how an animal grows and develops. The availability of food during development, for example, affects the final body size of many animals—including the larvae of fruit flies, which must reach a so-called ‘critical weight’ before they can change into adults.</p><p>A hormone called ecdysone controls when a larva turns into an adult insect. This hormone's levels peak when a fruit fly larva has reached its critical weight, and this peak triggers a cascade of events that ultimately will cause the larva to stop growing and to change into an adult fly. A signaling pathway involving insulin is also known to help regulate body size in response to nutrition. But it was unclear how the timing, and size, of the ecdysone peak is altered to match the larva's diet—and how the insulin-related pathway exerts its effect on body size.</p><p>Now, Koyama et al. have found a molecular link between this signaling pathway and the ecdysone hormone that can explain how nutrition can regulate the growth of the flies. First, Koyama et al. found that the ecdysone peak is delayed when young fruit fly larvae were starved before they had reached the critical weight. On the other hand, feeding these starved larvae the ecdysone hormone prevented this delay; and many of these larvae developed into underweight adults that were about three-quarters the size of a typical fully-grown adult.</p><p>The ecdysone hormone is made by cells within certain glands in the larvae. Koyama et al. also found that a protein called FoxO, which inhibits the insulin-related pathway, is transported out of the nuclei of these gland cells when growing larvae gain weight. But when larvae that had not reached their critical weight were starved, the FoxO protein was kept within the cell nuclei. Koyama et al. found that, in the nucleus, the FoxO protein blocks the production of ecdysone by interacting with a protein that forms part of the ecdysone receptor. This protein complex delays the expression of genes that are involved in making the hormone. When larvae were fed, the FoxO protein began to leave the nucleus, which allowed ecdysone production to resume.</p><p>Future studies could now test whether FoxO controls other traits that are affected by the insect's diet (such as lifespan), and if growth-related hormones in other animals are affected by a similar mechanism.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03091.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03091.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ecdysone</kwd><kwd>nutrition-dependent signaling</kwd><kwd>insulin/insulin-like growth factor</kwd><kwd>target of rapamycin</kwd><kwd>critical weight</kwd><kwd>body size</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/74313/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koyama</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000348</institution-id><institution>Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mirth</surname><given-names>Christen K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, nutrition controls body size by acting through the Forkhead Box class O (FoxO)/Ultraspiracle complex to regulate nutrition-sensitive ecdysone biosynthesis, thereby controlling the switch to stop growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Environmental conditions mould the developmental programs of many organisms to produce dramatic differences in body size and shape, in developmental time and in pigmentation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beldade et al., 2011</xref>). In insects, environmental cues often mediate their effects by regulating the timing and amount of hormone biosynthesis at specific points in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>). These changes in hormone production have been associated with a wide variety of environmentally induced changes in morphology, including the dramatic reshaping of the body in honeybee castes and seasonal wing pattern polyphenisms in butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beldade et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding the molecular underpinnings through which environmental conditions modify hormone production would provide valuable insight into our understanding of developmental plasticity.</p><p>Larvae of the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> provide a tractable model to address this question. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae regulate their body size and developmental timing in response to nutritional conditions, similar to many other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shingleton, 2011</xref>). Early in the third (final) larval instar (L3), a small peak of the steroid hormone ecdysone has been proposed to induce a developmental transition known as critical weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mirth and Riddiford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</xref>). The critical weight ecdysone peak responds to both environmental cues and internal developmental processes. Environmental cues including nutrition, temperature and oxygen levels affect the timing of the critical weight ecdysone peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the neuropeptide important for inducing all ecdysone peaks, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), stimulates ecdysone biosynthesis at critical weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McBrayer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ou et al., 2011</xref>). The combination of environmental and developmental regulation of this ecdysone peak ensures that developmental timing can be altered with changes in environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibbens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Critical weight itself determines the duration of the growth period, and therefore final body size, in response to environmental conditions including nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beadle et al., 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nijhout and Williams, 1974b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shingleton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stieper et al., 2008</xref>). Before larvae reach critical weight, starvation delays the onset of metamorphosis. After critical weight, larvae initiate metamorphosis without any developmental delay even when starved. Feeding ecdysone to larvae with genetically-induced delays in critical weight rescues the timing of the onset of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stieper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parker and Shingleton, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Nutrition regulates size in organisms ranging from flies to humans via the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS)/Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grewal, 2009</xref>). The IIS/TOR pathway controls body size by regulating growth rate, and also by regulating the timing of critical weight to determine the duration of the growth period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nijhout, 2003</xref>). At critical weight, the IIS/TOR pathway acts directly on the glands that synthesize ecdysone, the prothoracic glands (PGs), to alter the timing of the expression of several cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes necessary for ecdysone biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Layalle et al., 2008</xref>). Increasing IIS/TOR activity in the PGs causes precocious ecdysone biosynthesis, precocious critical weight transitions, precocious metamorphosis and dramatic reductions in body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Layalle et al., 2008</xref>). Reducing IIS/TOR activity in the PGs induces the opposite effects. However, the mechanisms through which the IIS/TOR pathway mediates these effects have been unclear.</p><p>Under well-fed conditions, insulin-like peptides (ILPs) are secreted into the insect blood or hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masumura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geminard et al., 2009</xref>). By binding to the Insulin Receptor (InR), ILPs activate IIS/TOR signaling in the target tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>). Activating IIS/TOR signaling regulates a series of phosphokinases, including Akt. Akt, in turn, phosphorylates a negative regulator of growth, Forkhead Box class O transcription factor (FoxO), displacing it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junger et al., 2003</xref>). In starved larvae, FoxO localizes in the nucleus where it acts on its targets, such as 4E-binding protein (4E-BP, also known as Thor), to suppress cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puig et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, FoxO binds to several nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs), such as constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), to regulate CYP450 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kodama et al., 2004</xref>). The functional ecdysone receptor is composed of two NHRs, Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) and Ultraspiracle (Usp). Since many CYP450 enzymes are involved in ecdysone biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2002</xref>), this led us to the hypothesis that the effect of IIS/TOR signaling on ecdysone biosynthesis is mediated by the interaction between FoxO and either EcR or Usp.</p><p>Here, we provide definitive evidence that critical weight results from the small nutrition-sensitive ecdysone peak early in the L3. Further, we report that IIS/TOR regulates the timing of ecdysone biosynthesis at critical weight via a novel mechanism, the direct association of FoxO and Usp. With these findings, we have constructed a detailed model of the molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-sensitive ecdysone biosynthesis during critical weight, an event that ultimately determines the duration of the growth period and accordingly final body size.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Starvation delays ecdysone biosynthesis and critical weight</title><p>Previous studies have shown that activating IIS/TOR signaling in the PGs induces early critical weight transitions, precocious ecdysone biosynthesis at wandering, and precocious metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldwell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Layalle et al., 2008</xref>). This has led authors to propose that the small pulse of ecdysone early in the L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warren et al., 2006</xref>) is nutrition-sensitive and induces critical weight in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mirth and Riddiford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mirth et al., 2014</xref>). However, these studies have not measured ecdysone concentrations with sufficient resolution early in the instar to show that ecdysone biosynthesis was delayed in starved pre-critical weight larvae. Therefore, we first examined whether this early ecdysone peak is delayed in starved larvae. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found that the small ecdysone peak that occurs around 10 hr after L3 ecdysis (AL3E) in well-fed larvae is suppressed in starved larvae, at least until 18 hr AL3E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To determine when wild type larvae reach critical weight, we starved carefully staged larvae of defined age classes on non-nutritive agar and measured the time it takes for them to reach pupariation from the onset of starvation. A hallmark of critical weight is that before it is attained starvation delays the onset of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beadle et al., 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nijhout and Williams, 1974b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shingleton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stieper et al., 2008</xref>), whereas after critical weight larvae metamorphose early when starved. We estimate the age at critical weight using breakpoint analysis, which fits a bi-segmental linear regression to the relationship between age at starvation and time to pupariation, and calculates the age at critical weight as the inflection point where this relationship changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stieper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Testa et al., 2013</xref>). We then use the linear relationship between larval weight and larval age to convert the age at which larvae reach critical weight to the size at which larvae reach critical weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, we repeated the analysis on 1000 bootstrap datasets to generate 95% confidence intervals for the age and size of larvae when they reach critical weight. Data and scripts for the analysis of size and age at critical weight, including the growth rate data, for all genotypes and treatments are available from the Dryad Digital Repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.75940">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.75940</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Wild type larvae reached critical weight at 8.66 hr AL3E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), correlating with the time when well-fed, wild type larvae show a peak of ecdysone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When we added the active form of ecdysone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), to the medium even the youngest larvae no longer delayed their onset of metamorphosis when starved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Instead, larvae starved on 20E-supplemented agar between the ages 0–8 hr AL3E pupariated 32 hr after the onset of starvation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Finally, larvae fed 20E-supplemented fly medium throughout the L3 were more than 25% smaller than control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results demonstrate that this early peak of ecdysone is nutrition sensitive and that it induces critical weight.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The IIS/TOR and ecdysone pathways interact via FoxO–Usp association</title><p>We next sought to understand how nutrition regulated the timing of the critical weight ecdysone peak. We hypothesized that IIS/TOR signaling controlled the timing of this ecdysone peak, and therefore critical weight, via FoxO. We reasoned that if FoxO was involved in regulating ecdysone biosynthesis, FoxO would be present in the PG nuclei immediately after the molt to the L3 and would become progressively excluded from the nucleus as the larvae fed and approached critical weight. We found that FoxO was localized primarily in the nuclei of the PG cells of newly ecdysed L3 larvae (0 hr AL3E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As the larvae fed, FoxO was gradually transported out of the nuclei into the cytoplasm.

To discern between these two possibilities, we developed a genetic tool to manipulate the FoxO–Usp interaction.</p><p>First, we identified the Usp binding site in the FoxO protein using GST-pulldown assays. We created overlapping GST-tagged FoxO fragments and, using increasingly smaller overlapping fragments, we narrowed down the Usp binding region to a 35 amino acid region overlapping with 5 amino acids in the C-terminal end of the forkhead (DNA binding) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This motif is well conserved across arthropod species including ticks and water fleas, but is not conserved in FoxO proteins in other ecdysozoans or vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, this Usp binding motif is different from the well-known ‘LXXLL’-type NHR binding motif identified in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heery et al., 1997</xref>). Next, we identified eighteen candidate amino acids by comparing the crystal structure of mammalian FoxO3a to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> FoxO sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai et al., 2007</xref>) and selecting residues that occupied positions permissive for protein–protein interactions. We mutated each of these to alanine. At least 4 of the 18 amino acid residues appeared to be involved in FoxO–Usp binding (residues W172, N175, R202 and K204). When we introduced these single point mutations into the full length FoxO protein, they showed only mild reductions in FoxO–Usp binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then tested four double–mutant combinations (W172-R202, W172-K204, N175-R202, and N175-K204) all of which were sufficient to dramatically reduce FoxO–Usp interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Two of these double–mutant combinations partially reduced the FoxO activity (W172-R202 and W172-K204) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), as determined by the expression of known FoxO targets InR and 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Puig et al., 2003</xref>). Because our aim was to disrupt FoxO–Usp binding, but not FoxO function, these were excluded from further analyses. The remaining two double–mutant combinations (N175-R202 or FoxO NR, and N175-K204 or FoxO NK) showed normal translocation to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) and did not affect FoxO's ability to regulate InR and 4E-BP promoter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>, respectively).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03091.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The Usp binding site in FoxO protein was identified and FoxO NK mutation showed reduced binding affinity to Usp.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Point mutations were induced in the FoxO protein at site of the amino acids indicated in bold.

We have found that interactions between FoxO and Usp regulate ecdysone biosynthesis, critical weight and body size. This allows us to propose a model for nutrition-sensitive ecdysone biosynthesis during critical weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). During the molt to the L3, larvae undergo a period of starvation while they expel their mouthparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2003</xref>). As a consequence, IIS/TOR signaling activity in the PGs is reduced and FoxO remains in the nucleus and forms a complex with Usp. The FoxO/Usp complex suppresses ecdysone biosynthesis at least in part by repressing transcription of <italic>phm</italic> and <italic>dib,</italic> although we do not know whether this repression is direct. Once larvae start feeding, increasing IIS/TOR activity in the PGs results in the phosphorylation of FoxO, causing the dissociation FoxO/Usp complexes as FoxO moves out of the nucleus. This progressive dissociation of FoxO/Usp complexes results in a gradual rise in ecdysone biosynthesis. Once ecdysone reaches a threshold, it triggers critical weight. Afterwards, the time to metamorphosis is set and can no longer be delayed by starvation. For other ecdysone peaks, a negative feedback loop induced by ecdysone signaling itself down-regulates ecdysone biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sakurai and Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takaki and Sakurai, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moeller et al., 2013</xref>).

After critical weight, ecdysone reduces its own biosynthesis through a negative-feedback loop. In starved conditions, the IIS/TOR signaling activity in the PGs remains low, thereby unphosphorylated FoxO remains inside of nuclei forming complexes with Usp (lower right).

In other insects, traits such as seasonal wing morphs in butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch and Bückmann, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oostra et al., 2011</xref>) or horn length in male dung beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emlen and Nijhout, 1999</xref>) arise from differential regulation of ecdysone biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>). Horn length in dung beetles is highly nutrition-dependent, with small, poorly-fed males bearing small horns and large, well-fed males having disproportionately larger horns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emlen, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">1997</xref>). Small-horned males have a characteristic peak of ecdysone in their final instar absent in their well-fed, larger conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emlen and Nijhout, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2001</xref>). Our data propose a mechanism through which nutrition, via FoxO–Usp interactions, might regulate this peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>FoxO is also known to form complexes with many vertebrate NHRs, including thyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>), androgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2007</xref>) and estrogen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schuur et al., 2001</xref>). The steroid sex hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, are important for initiating puberty and the development of adult characters in humans. In girls, reaching a body mass of 48 kg determines the timing of first menses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frisch and Revelle, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freedman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gluckman and Hanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2009</xref>). Obese girls reach this mass faster, resulting in earlier onset of puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freedman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gluckman and Hanson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2009</xref>) possibly due to higher levels of insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Codner and Cassorla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lombardo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">von Berghes et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that IIS/TOR activity regulates the production of the steroid sex hormones to regulate developmental timing in vertebrates. Furthermore, two mammalian NHRs, CAR and PXR, associate with FoxO1 to regulate the expression of the CYP450 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kodama et al., 2004</xref>). The similarity in the roles of FoxO/NHR complexes between mammals and insects provides a testable model that FoxO-NHR complexes regulate environmentally-sensitive development in a wide range of organisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> Strains</title><p>Wild type FoxO and FoxO NK were amplified by RT-PCR using cDNA made from whole body extract of post-feeding (wandering) w[1118] larvae.

Newly molted L3 larvae were collected every 2 hr. Collected larvae were raised in a normal cornmeal/molasses medium without additional yeast until the appropriate time point. For starvation treatments, we used 1% non-nutritional agar. To determine the duration of the L3, pupariation time was observed every 2 hr until all treated larvae pupariated or died. We defined pupariation as cessation of movement with evaginated spiracles. All treatments were performed at 25°C under constant light to avoid the effect of circadian rhythm on PTTH secretion.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, all of the reviewers felt that the manuscript was interesting, largely well done, and addressed the important issue of the achievement of “critical weight”. The proposal that FoxO binds to Usp to form a novel complex to inhibit a peak of ecdysone, thus regulating the critical weight transition is intriguing, and in general the experiments demonstrating FoxO's involvement in CW are convincing. However the reviewers agreed that additional experiments were needed to support the main conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>1) Show that FOXO and Usp interact in Co-IPs in fed wildtype L3 larvae. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is shown that FoxO binds Usp in Co-IPs of extracts from starved but not fed larvae. For this interaction to be relevant to the regulation of the critical weight transition, the authors need to show that the dFoxO-Usp interaction also occurs in fed early L3 larvae (pre-critical weight). While the GST pulldowns with recombinant proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5">Figures 1 and 5</xref> provide convincing evidence that FoxO and Usp have the potential to bind in vitro, the westerns are less convincing. The westerns show a weak Co-IPed band above the background smear that we are told corresponds to FoxO in . Given that demonstrating this point is so essential for the main conclusion of the paper about a molecular FoxO-Usp interaction, further controls need to be shown. One suggestion is to show that the FoxO band (co-IPed from larval extracts with anti-Usp) present in wild type animals is missing in FoxO null mutants.</p><p>2) Demonstrate the effects of feeding ecdysone at precritical weight times. If the model is correct then one would expect that feeding 20E just after ecdysis to L3 will lead to a smaller critical weight and precocious metamorphosis.</p><p>3) Concerns were raised about the specificity of the Gal4 drivers used. The P0206 driver used as a driver to express UAS-FoxO in the PG is also expressed in the CA and in oenocytes, which are known to regulate larval growth. The reviewers felt that it was important to use other drivers (Aug21 for the CA and the oenocyte 'specific” driver PromE-GAL4 from Joel Levine) as additional controls. Although the P0206-GAL4 driver has been used in similar studies of critical weight, the authors note that phm-GAL4 driven expression of UAS-FoxO is lethal in FoxO mutants but not in control animals. This observation may indicate that the presence of FoxO in the peripheral tissues of control animals is modifying the phenotypic effects of PG-specific FoxO over-expression. Although the authors suggest that animals expressing P0206-FoxO are viable due to the moderate levels of FoxO expression, these animals could be surviving due to the presence of FoxO in oenocytes. Therefore, the observations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> could result from FoxO activity in either the oenocytes and not the PG or a synergistic interaction between these two tissues. The authors may address these problems with two simple experiments. Does oenocyte-specific expression of UAS-FoxO in a FoxO mutant delay the onset of pupariation? And, if so, is this delay 20E dependent? Finally, both of these Figures lack the necessary P0206-GAL4 negative control.</p><p>4) The authors' interpretations of the in vivo effects of UAS-FoxO NK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> onwards) as a way of specifically impeding the FoxO-Usp interaction are not necessarily correct. The experiments have been done very thoroughly (and often sensibly using a FoxO null background) but the main result is that the effects of UAS-FoxO NK upon critical age/weight, pupal weight, gene expression (e74B, dib, phm) and ecdysone tend to be INTERMEDIATE between controls and UAS-FoxO animals. This indicates that, at best, the FoxO-Usp interaction only makes a partial contribution towards the overall FoxO activity relevant to ecdysone gene repression. At worst, if general FoxO functions are compromised in the NK protein then the authors would not be demonstrating any specific in vivo role for Usp-FoxO interactions, simply that partially reducing the general activity of FoxO gives a hypomorphic phenotype. Therefore, the authors should examine the effects of FoxONK overexpression while simultaneously over expressing Usp. If the complex is truly important then coexpression of foxONK together with Usp should look just like foxONK. If however, Usp coexpression still augments the delay to critical weight, the result is more consistent for a role of Usp in CW determination that is independent of complex formation.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>1) The presence of ecdysone receptor (EcR) is shown to reduce the Usp-FoxO interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) but there is no follow up of the in vivo functional significance of EcR in this context. This issue is left hanging and so adds little to the paper. At present, the reader is left wondering whether or not EcR directly regulates ecdysone biosynthetic gene expression in the prothoracic gland and whether or not this regulation is antagonized by FoxO.

In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, it is shown that FoxO binds Usp in Co-IPs of extracts from starved but not fed larvae. For this interaction to be relevant to the regulation of the critical weight transition, the authors need to show that the dFoxO-Usp interaction also occurs in fed early L3 larvae (pre-critical weight). While the GST pulldowns with recombinant proteins in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5"><italic>Figures 1 and 5</italic></xref> <italic>provide convincing evidence that FoxO and Usp have the potential to bind</italic> in vitro<italic>, the westerns are less convincing. The westerns show a weak Co-IPed band above the background smear that we are told corresponds to FoxO in . Given that demonstrating this point is so essential for the main conclusion of the paper about a molecular FoxO-Usp interaction, further controls need to be shown. One suggestion is to show that the FoxO band (co-IPed from larval extracts with anti-Usp) present in wild type animals is missing in FoxO null mutants</italic>.</p><p>We have performed a new Co-IP experiment examining FoxO-Usp interactions in: 1) fed pre-critical weight wild-type larvae (0-5 h AL3E), 2) fed pre-critical weight FoxO null larvae, 2) starved pre-critical weight wild-type larvae and 4) fed, post-critical weight, wild-type larvae. This experiment is now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. This experiment shows that FoxO and Usp do indeed form complexes in fed pre-critical weight larvae as well as in protein-starved, pre-critical weight larvae. In contrast, we do not see FoxO-Usp complexes in FoxO mutant larvae and fed, post-critical weight larvae.</p><p><italic>2) Demonstrate the effects of feeding ecdysone at precritical weight times. If the model is correct then one would expect that feeding 20E just after ecdysis to L3 will lead to a smaller critical weight and precocious metamorphosis</italic>.</p><p>We have created a new Figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) showing that starving larvae on 20E-supplemented agar eliminated the developmental delays seen in pre-critical weight larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found that larvae fed 20E supplemented fly media become smaller in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we quantified ecdysone concentrations in starved and fed wild-type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that in starved larvae ecdysone concentrations remain low for the first 18 hours after the moult. In fed larvae, ecdysone concentrations peak at 10 hours after the moult. These data demonstrate that the ecdysone peak itself is suppressed in starved pre-critical weight larvae and that feeding ecdysone to pre-critical weight larvae is sufficient to rescue the developmental delays induced by starvation. We hope this new data will make the experiments that follow easier to understand.</p><p><italic>3) Concerns were raised about the specificity of the Gal4 drivers used. The P0206 driver used as a driver to express UAS-FoxO in the PG is also expressed in the CA and in oenocytes, which are known to regulate larval growth. The reviewers felt that it was important to use other drivers (Aug21 for the CA and the oenocyte 'specific” driver PromE-GAL4 from Joel Levine) as additional controls. Although the P0206-GAL4 driver has been used in similar studies of critical weight, the authors note that phm-GAL4 driven expression of UAS-FoxO is lethal in FoxO mutants but not in control animals. This observation may indicate that the presence of FoxO in the peripheral tissues of control animals is modifying the phenotypic effects of PG-specific FoxO over-expression. Although the authors suggest that animals expressing P0206-FoxO are viable due to the moderate levels of FoxO expression, these animals could be surviving due to the presence of FoxO in oenocytes. Therefore, the observations described in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>could result from FoxO activity in either the oenocytes and not the PG or a synergistic interaction between these two tissues. The authors may address these problems with two simple experiments. Does oenocyte-specific expression of UAS-FoxO in a FoxO mutant delay the onset of pupariation? And, if so, is this delay 20E dependent? Finally, both of these Figures lack the necessary P0206-GAL4 negative control</italic>.</p><p>We have used both Aug21- and PromE(800)-Gal4 to drive FoxO expression in the CA and oenocytes of FoxO mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>).

In the first version of this manuscript, we addressed whether FoxO NK may simply be a hypomorph of FoxO through several means. First, we found that FoxO NK induced the expression of known FoxO target, InR and 4E-BP, to the same levels as FoxO. Secondly, we explored whether FoxO NK overexpression reduced the size of tissues to the same extent as FoxO. FoxO NK significantly reduced the size of wings, and eyes, although not as much as FoxO. Importantly, FoxO NK and FoxO both reduced the size of the prothoracic gland to the same extent.</p><p>Further, because overexpressing Usp in the prothoracic gland on its own did not significantly change either CW or critical age, we concluded that Usp did not play an independent role in CW. However, overexpressing both FoxO NK and Usp would provide better evidence that Usp is not acting on its own to regulate CW. We found that co-overexpressing Usp and FoxO NK did not affect the size and the age at critical weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we did not see significant difference in body size between P0206&gt;FoxO NK animals and P0206&gt;FoxO NK, Usp animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that FoxO NK bears proper Usp-independent transcriptional activity with strongly reduced FoxO-Usp affinity.</p><p><italic>Additional comments: Reviewer #1: 1) The presence of ecdysone receptor (EcR) is shown to reduce the Usp-FoxO interaction</italic> in vitro <italic>(</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref><italic>) but there is no follow up of the</italic> in vivo <italic>functional significance of EcR in this context.
