Bacteria (and another group of single-celled organisms called archaea) also have an adaptive immune system, known as CRISPR-Cas, that combats viral invaders. This system is based on sections of the microbes' DNA called CRISPRs, which contain repetitive DNA sequences that are separated by short segments of ‘spacer’ DNA. When a virus invades the cell, some viral DNA is incorporated into the CRISPR as a spacer. This process is known as adaptation. CRISPR-associated proteins (or ‘Cas’ proteins) then use this spacer to recognize and mount an attack on any matching invader DNA that is later encountered.</p><p>Exactly how a spacer is inserted into the correct position in the CRISPR array during adaptation remains poorly understood. However, it is known that two CRISPR proteins called Cas1 and Cas2 play essential roles in this process.</p><p>Rollie et al. took Cas1 proteins from a bacterial cell (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) and an archaeal species (<italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>) and added them to branched DNA structures in the laboratory. These experiments revealed that Cas1 from both organisms can break the DNA down into smaller pieces. Cas2, on the other hand, is not required for this process. This ‘disintegration’ reaction is the reverse process of the ‘integration’ step of adaptation where the CRISPR proteins insert the invader DNA into the CRISPR array.</p><p>Rollie et al. also found that the disintegration reaction performed by Cas1 takes place on specific DNA sequences, which are also the sites where Cas1 inserts the spacer DNA during adaptation. Therefore, by examining the disintegration reaction, many of the details of the integration step can be deduced.</p><p>Overall, Rollie et al. show that selection by Cas1 plays an important role in restricting the adaptation process to particular DNA sites. The next step will be to use the disintegration reaction to examine the DNA binding and manipulation steps performed by Cas1 as part of its role in the adaptation of the CRISPR system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08716.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08716.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic></kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>integrase</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M000400/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Malcolm F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The acquisition of new foreign DNA by the prokaryotic adaptive immune system CRISPR-Cas is shown to depend on the fundamental sequence specificity of the Cas1 integrase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system present in many archaeal and bacterial species. It provides immunity against viruses and other mobile genetic elements mediated through sequence homology-directed detection and destruction of foreign nucleic acid species (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sorek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou and Marraffini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van der Oost et al., 2014</xref>). Organisms with an active CRISPR-Cas system encode one or more CRISPR loci in their genomes. These comprise a leader sequence followed by an array of short, direct, often palindromic repeats interspersed by short ‘spacer’ sequences, together with a variable number of CRISPR associated (<italic>cas</italic>) genes. Spacers are derived from mobile genetic elements and constitute a ‘memory’ of past infections. The CRISPR locus is transcribed from the leader, generating pre-CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA) that is subsequently processed into unit length crRNA species and loaded into large ribonucleoprotein complexes. These complexes, known as ‘Interference’, ‘Effector’ or ‘Surveillance’ complexes, utilize crRNA to detect and degrade cognate invading genetic entities, providing immunity against previously encountered viruses and plasmids.</p><p>The process of foreign DNA capture and integration into the CRISPR locus is known as ‘Acquisition’ or ‘Adaptation’ (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fineran and Charpentier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heler et al., 2014</xref>). This process underpins the whole CRISPR-Cas system, but is the least well understood aspect. Fundamentally, acquisition can be separated into two steps: the capture of new DNA sequences from mobile genetic elements, followed by the integration of that DNA into the host genome. New spacers are incorporated proximal to the leader sequence and result in the duplication of the first repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>). The leader sequence proximal to the repeat is important for integration, but transcription of the locus is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>). New spacers are frequently incorporated in both possible orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shmakov et al., 2014</xref>). The integration process in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> results in staggered cleavage of the first CRISPR repeat, where the 3′-end of one strand of the incoming DNA is joined to the end of the CRISPR repeat in a trans-esterification (TES) reaction, with another TES reaction occurring on the other strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diez-Villasenor et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, numbered yellow arrows). Intermediates in this reaction have been observed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the sequence of the leader-repeat1 junction is important for the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arslan et al., 2014</xref>). The order of the two integration steps shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not yet known, although it has been suggested that the reaction on the minus strand (site 2) occurs first in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). The sequence at site 2 is flanked by the end of the first repeat and the first spacer, and is therefore inherently less well conserved. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the last nucleotide of the newly copied repeat is derived from the first nucleotide of the incoming spacer, which imposes further sequence requirements on that system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Swarts et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08716.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPR spacer acquisition and Cas1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, 1) The 3′-end of an incoming protospacer attacks the chromosomal CRISPR locus at the boundary between the leader sequence and repeat 1. A trans-esterification (TES) reaction (yellow arrow 1) catalyzed by Cas1 joins the protospacer to the 5′ end of repeat 1. For many integrases a (reverse) disintegration reaction can be observed in vitro. (2) Another TES reaction (yellow arrow 2) joins the other strand of the protospacer to the 5′ end of repeat 1 on the bottom (minus) strand, resulting in the formation of a gapped DNA duplex. (3) The gapped duplex is repaired by the host cell DNA replication machinery, resulting in the addition of a new spacer at position 1 and replication of CRISPR repeat 1.

Recent work by Sorek and colleagues has shown that the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecBCD helicase–nuclease complex, which processes DNA double-strand breaks for recombination and degrades foreign DNA, is implicated in the generation of viral DNA fragments captured by Cas1 and incorporated into the CRISPR locus as new spacers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy et al., 2015</xref>). This confirms previous observations linking Cas1 with RecBCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2011</xref>) and raises some intriguing questions as RecBCD generates ssDNA fragments asymmetrically, generating fragments tens to hundreds of nucleotides long from the 3′ terminated strand and much longer fragments from the 5′ terminated strand (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</xref>). The Cas4 enzyme, which is a 5′ to 3′ ssDNA exonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lemak et al., 2013</xref>), may provide ssDNA fragments for Cas1 in systems lacking RecBCD. However, it is difficult to see how two integration reactions could occur without two 3′ hydroxyl termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and half-site integration is not observed with a ssDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). Potentially, the ssDNA fragments generated by these nucleases may re-anneal and experience further processing to generate partially duplex molecules of defined size prior to integration by Cas1.</p><p>Adaptation requires the products of the <italic>cas1</italic> and <italic>cas2</italic> genes in vivo and these are the most universally conserved of all the <italic>cas</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Makarova et al., 2006</xref>). Cas1 is a homodimeric enzyme with a two-domain structure and a canonical metal dependent nuclease active site in the large domain formed by a cluster of highly conserved residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wiedenheft et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 has nuclease activity in vitro, with activity observed against double- and single-stranded DNA and RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2011</xref>). Some specificity was observed for branched DNA substrates, in particular for DNA constructs resembling replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2011</xref>). Initial biochemical analyses of a panel of archaeal Cas2 enzymes revealed an endonucleolytic activity against ssRNA substrates that could be abrogated by mutation of conserved residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beloglazova et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, Cas2 from <italic>Bacillus halodurans</italic> has been shown to be specific for cleavage of dsDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nam et al., 2012</xref>). Recently however, Doudna and colleagues demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 and Cas2 form a stable complex in vitro and that the ‘active site’ of Cas2 was not required for spacer acquisition, suggesting that Cas2 may not have a catalytic role in spacer acquisition in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nuñez et al., 2014</xref>). It is probable that Cas2 acts as an adaptor protein, either bringing two Cas1 dimers together or mediating interactions with other components necessary for spacer acquisition. Recently, Nunez et al. demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 can integrate a protospacer into a supercoiled plasmid in vitro, in a reaction stimulated by Cas2. Integration events were observed at the boundaries of most CRISPR repeats and in other areas of the DNA close to palindromic regions, implicating a role for palindromic DNA structure in the adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In order to further mechanistic understanding of the spacer acquisition process, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the underlying biochemistry. We demonstrate that Cas1 catalyses TES of branched DNA substrates efficiently in vitro in a reaction that represents the reverse- or disintegration of an incoming spacer from the CRISPR locus. The disintegration reactions catalysed by diverse integrases have proven a powerful model system for the understanding of the mechanism of integration. For Cas1, the reaction is strongly sequence dependent with the specificity matching the predicted integration site 1 for both <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic> Cas1, and does not require Cas2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cas1 catalyzes a TES reaction on branched DNA substrates</title><p>The Cas1 and Cas2 proteins from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> (CRISPR-Cas subtype IA) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (CRISPR-Cas subtype IE) were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with N-terminal polyhistidine tags and purified to homogeneity by metal affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Previously, it was demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 (EcoCas1) cleaved branched DNA substrates preferentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2011</xref>). We investigated the activity of <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> Cas1 (SsoCas1) against a DNA substrate with a 5′-flap structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). By labelling the single-stranded 5′-flap of the downstream duplex at the 5′-end with radioactive phosphorus, we observed cleavage of the flap by SsoCas1, releasing an 18 nt product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A variant of SsoCas1 where the active site metal ligand glutamic acid 142 was changed to an alanine (E142A) was inactive, implicating the canonical nuclease active site of Cas1 in the reaction. This result appeared consistent with the earlier studies for EcoCas1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2011</xref>) and suggested that the ssDNA flap was removed at or close to the branch point. The activity was independent of the presence or absence of SsoCas2, suggesting that Cas2 is not involved in this nuclease activity in vitro.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08716.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Disintegration of a branched DNA substrate by SsoCas1.</title><p>Denaturing gel electrophoresis was used to analyse the products generated by SsoCas1 with a branched DNA substrate (Substrate 1).

The continuous (black) strand was not cleaved by SsoCas1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, when the 23 nt (green) strand of the upstream duplex presenting a 3′-hydroxyl end at the junction point was labelled we observed the formation of a new, larger DNA species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This observation was consistent with a joining or TES of the upstream DNA to the downstream DNA strand by Cas1. By switching to a label at the 3′ end of the downstream duplex we confirmed that the reaction catalyzed by Cas1 involved the joining of the upstream and downstream DNA duplexes with concomitant loss of the 5′-flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The lack of evidence for any shorter DNA species in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> was consistent with the conclusion that we were observing a TES rather than a nuclease reaction. Again, the TES reaction was unaffected by the presence or absence of Cas2 and was dependent on the wild-type active site of Cas1, as the E142A variant was inactive.</p><p>In order to define the product of the TES reaction in more detail, we modified the sequence of the branch point to introduce an interrupted site for the restriction enzyme <italic>SacI</italic> across the junction. A precise TES reaction at the branch point to generate duplex DNA would result in the ‘repair’ of the restriction site, generating a substrate for <italic>SacI</italic>. SsoCas1 processed this substrate generating the 53 bp TES reaction product. On addition of the <italic>SacI</italic> restriction enzyme, the 53 bp species was converted to a 25 bp product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This confirmed that the Cas1-mediated reaction resulted in the formation of a functional <italic>SacI</italic> site in vitro, consistent with a precise TES reaction at the branch point.</p><p>It is likely that the TES reaction catalyzed by Cas1 with branched DNA substrates in vitro represents the reverse or disintegration of an integration intermediate, as observed recently for EcoCas1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore tested EcoCas1 with the same set of branched substrates, showing that manganese, magnesium and cobalt all supported the same robust disintegration activity in the absence of Cas2, with no nuclease activity observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Given that Eco and SsoCas1 are divergent members of the Cas1 family, this suggests that the disintegration activity is likely to be a general property of Cas1 enzymes. Experiments where the concentration of Cas1 was titrated against a fixed concentration of substrate (50 nM), showed that maximal activity plateaued above 250 nM for EcoCas1 and was maximal from 100 to 500 nM for SsoCas1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08716.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>TES activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> Cas1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 also catalyses an efficient metal dependent disintegration reaction.

SsoCas1 was indifferent to the presence of duplex or single-stranded DNA in the 5′-flap, processing a nicked 3-way junction with a similar efficiency to the 5′-flap substrate. The disintegration reaction required the presence of the 3′-hydroxyl moiety at the branch point as a three-way (or Y) junction was not a substrate for Cas1. To confirm this observation we studied a 5′-flap substrate with a phosphate moiety at the 3′ end of the upstream strand in place of a hydroxyl group. As expected, this substrate did not support disintegration activity for either Sso or EcoCas1, with no larger TES product detected (right hand lanes). Tellingly, neither enzyme cleaved the 5′-flap of this substrate to generate shorter products (left hand lanes), confirming that Cas1 catalyses a concerted TES reaction rather than a sequential ‘cut and join’ activity.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08716.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Importance of flap and 3′ terminus structure.</title><p>The importance of the released 25 nt 5′-flap structure was investigated by varying the length of duplex DNA in that arm from 0 (canonical 5′-flap) to a full 25 bp (nicked 3-way junction) (left hand panel, all based on substrate 19).

We therefore designed a family of related disintegration substrates by systematically varying the nucleotides flanking the TES site and tested how efficiently Cas1 could disintegrate these substrates.

Consequently we still do not have a clear understanding of the roles of Cas1, Cas2 and host proteins in the acquisition mechanism. In this study we investigated the integration reaction by focusing on the biochemistry of the Cas1 protein from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>. Efficient TES of branched DNA substrates with a 5′-flap or duplex arm is clearly possible for both <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 in vitro. This is a very precise reaction requiring attack by a 3′-hydroxyl at the branch point, generating a perfect DNA duplex. The reaction almost certainly represents the disintegration reaction that is the reverse of the spacer integration step, as observed for many integrases and transposases where it represents a very useful means to study the underlying integration mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerton et al., 1999</xref>). Evidence for a disintegration activity was recently described by Doudna and colleagues for EcoCas1, but the activity observed was relatively weak, most likely because the branched substrate studied had a non-optimal DNA sequence around the branch point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For the CRISPR adaptation process in vivo, integration occurs at the junction between the first repeat and the leader sequence, which immediately suggests a role for sequence specificity in the reaction. It has also been suggested that CRISPR repeat sequences, which are often palindromic, form four-way DNA junctions in supercoiled DNA, acting as a recognition signal for Cas1, a possibility that is supported by the observation that EcoCas1 can cut four-way DNA junctions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2011</xref>), and the finding that spacer integration in a plasmid lacking a CRISPR locus occurs preferentially next to a palindromic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). However, a palindrome alone is not sufficient to support spacer insertion in <italic>E. coli</italic> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arslan et al., 2014</xref>), and this also holds for the type II CRISPR system of <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wei et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that local sequence helps determine the integration site. Furthermore, some CRISPR repeat families, including many in archaea, have little or no palindromic nature and thus cannot form stable hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kunin et al., 2007</xref>). Cas1 therefore might be expected to act as a sequence specific integrase, although local DNA structure could also play a part.</p><p>In support of this hypothesis, both <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 catalyse a disintegration reaction with distinct, sequence specific properties. In particular, there is a clear preference for a guanine at position +1, corresponding to the first nucleotide of the repeat, suggesting that this residue is recognised specifically in the active site of Cas1. The specificity is particularly strong for EcoCas1, consistent with the presence of a guanine in the repeat sequence at the +1 site in both plus and minus strands. Preference for a guanine at the +1 nucleotide for EcoCas1 catalysed integration events has also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). For SsoCas1, a guanine at this position was preferred over a cytosine, which is the nucleotide present at the +1′ position on the minus strand, by a factor of five. Although the −1 position might also be expected to play a role in the selection of integration sites, deep sequencing data for integration catalysed by EcoCas1 revealed no sequence preference at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with this finding, we observed little evidence for sequence discrimination at the −1 position for the disintegration reactions catalysed by either enzyme, with the exception that EcoCas1 disfavours cytosine at this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). A cytosine at position −1 is the expected residue on the minus strand, suggesting that the disintegration reaction may better reflect the reversal of integration at site 1 in the leader-repeat junction. Deep sequencing data for integration reactions catalysed by EcoCas1 in vitro did reveal a marked preference for a guanine at position −2 in the integration site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). This corresponds well with the −2 position in the plus strand, which is part of the leader sequence and is a guanine in <italic>E. coli,</italic> but cannot hold for the minus strand where the −2′ position is inherently variable in nature. Disintegration of substrates mimicking the integration intermediates relevant for the integration of spacer 3 into the <italic>E. coli</italic> CRISPR array reinforce these conclusions, with site 1 on the plus strand processed significantly more quickly than site 2 on the bottom strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Taken together, both the disintegration specificity and the deep sequencing data for integration support the hypothesis that integration is targeted to the leader-repeat 1 junction on the plus strand at least in part by the inherent sequence specificity of Cas1, which presumably involves specific recognition of these bases within the active site of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08716.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Reaction scheme for spacer integration and disintegration by <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1.</title><p>The Cas 1-2 complex integrates new spacers via two joining reactions (1 and 2) at either end of the first CRISPR repeat, which differ in their sequence context.

This means that the two ends of a viral genome of several kilobases can be looped around and brought close together relatively easily, but a new spacer of 30–40 base pairs of dsDNA cannot be manipulated in the same way. Considering the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the molecular origami required to achieve the second TES reaction looks challenging. Several related enzymes, including Mu transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Savilahti et al., 1995</xref>), V(D)J recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramsden et al., 1996</xref>) and HIV integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerton et al., 1999</xref>) are known to disrupt base pairing of DNA substrates and make sequence-specific contacts during the integration reaction. It is likely that Cas1 also manipulates the local DNA duplex structure, which may help in positioning the DNA strands correctly for the TES reaction. The observation that the incoming DNA (the 5′-flap in the disintegration reaction) can be single stranded, partially or fully duplex in nature suggests that there is some flexibility in the recognition of the incoming spacer. This is also consistent with the recent observation of a link between RecBCD, which generates ssDNA products, and Cas1 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy et al., 2015</xref>). There is no formal requirement that the protospacer should be fully duplex in nature, although current understanding of the integration reaction requires that new spacers have two intact 3′-ends for the two integration reactions so must be at least partially duplex in nature. Many integrases process the ends of the integrated DNA using a nuclease activity, which occurs at the same active site as the integrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gerton et al., 1999</xref>). There is no reason to expect that Cas1 will differ in that regard, and indeed the reaction products of the RecBCD nuclease are on average much longer than the DNA molecules integrated by Cas1, suggesting the requirement for further processing.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that Cas1 from both <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> have robust TES activities in vitro which reflect the reversal, or disintegration, of the integration reaction. Disintegration is strongly sequence specific, and the specificity fits with the expected sequence for the plus strand at the leader-repeat junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This site is the logical place for the initiation of integration, as it has a unique, defined sequence, in contrast to the repetitive and more variable sequence found at the second integration site on the minus strand. Doudna and colleagues recently proposed a model based on an initial attack at site 2 on the minus strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nuñez et al., 2015</xref>). However, this preference was only significant for spacers with a cytosine at the 3′ terminus, and does not explain the marked preference observed by the authors for a guanine at position +2, which is a feature of the positive strand. Future studies of both the forward and reverse integration reactions catalyzed by Cas1 will help to address these issues and delineate the mechanism of spacer integration in the CRISPR system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, gene expression and protein purification</title><p>The <italic>sso1450</italic> (<italic>cas1</italic>) gene and <italic>sso1450a</italic> (<italic>cas2</italic>) genes were amplified from <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> P2 genomic DNA by PCR using primer pairs (5′-ATATAACCATGGCAAGCGTGAGGACTT; 5′-TATTGGATCCTCACATCACCAACTTGAAACCC) and (5′-GCGCCATGGTTACACTAACCATTCCTCTAATC; 5′-GGCCGGATCCTTGAAATTATTGGTAGTATATGAC), respectively.

Cas1 or Cas2 expressing cells were harvested for re-suspension in buffer H (20 mM Tris.HCl pH7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C until required. The first purification step was identical for both Cas1 and Cas2: sonicated biomass was clarified by centrifugation (90,000×<italic>g</italic>, 25 min) and soluble extract was passed into a 5 ml Hi-Trap Nickel chelating column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer H. Cas1 or Cas2 eluted at 70–100 mM imidazole in a linear imidazole gradient. Sodium chloride was reduced to 50 mM by dialysis against buffer S (20 mM Tris.HCl pH7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol). Cas1 was loaded onto a 5 ml Hi-Trap heparin column and eluted in a gradient of NaCl at 200–300 mM in buffer S. Pooled Cas1 fractions were loaded directly onto a S300 size exclusion column equilibrated in buffer S with 250 mM NaCl. Cas1 fractions were pooled for storage at −80°C in buffer S containing 250 mM NaCl and 40% glycerol. Desalted Cas2 eluted from Ni-NTA was dialyzed into buffer S containing 1.5 M NaCl and applied to a 5 ml Hi-Trap butyl-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), eluting in the flow through. Cas2 fractions were pooled and loaded directly onto a S300 size exclusion column equilibrated in buffer S with 250 mM NaCl.

The authors define an activity that is an apparent reversal (disintegration) of the natural integration pathway, with a 5'-flap substrate undergoing a transesterification reaction that releases that single-stranded 5'-flap in concert with the joining of the two flanking base-paired segments. This reaction has previously been used to study the activities of other integrases and recombinases, and also of <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1/Cas2 in the work of Nunez et al. (Nature, 2015). The appearance of the latter study partly stole a march on the current work, with the primary contributions of this manuscript (i.e. above and beyond the results presented by Nunez et al.) being the inclusion of a separate, distinct Cas1 (SsoCas1) and the more detailed analysis of the sequence preferences of the reactions catalyzed by both Eco and SsoCas1. These contributions are significant, in part because the leader and repeat DNA sequences (where the reactions occur) differ between the relevant strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, allowing comparative tests of substrate specificity, and of the roles of Cas1 in establishing that specificity. The authors do in fact establish such differences, and overall the reaction data that is presented is compelling.</p><p>A critical question is the degree to which the requirements for disintegration reflect those of the presumptive integration. As an example, the initial protospacer attack (forward) reaction described by Nunez et al. requires a double-stranded protospacer, whereas the disintegration liberates single-stranded (as well as double-stranded) flaps; similarly, the inclusion of Cas2 is far more important for integration than for disintegration. Overall, the history of integrase/transposase research suggests that the reverse reaction can be a useful and convenient proxy for the forward reaction, but this nonetheless calls for some caution in interpretation.</p><p>One other potential concern is that the authors used enzyme concentrations that were rather high – 2 micromolar, according to the Materials and methods section. This is more than twenty-five-fold higher than those used by Nunez et al. Is there a reason for this? The higher concentrations could drive enzyme/substrate interactions that might not occur at concentrations that are probably closer to physiological, and could therefore obviously bear on questions of specificity. This concern is particularly meaningful in light of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, which shows good activity in the low- to mid-nanomolar range. In fact, in light of the SsoCas1 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, 2-micromolar reactions should not work at all for that protein. Can the authors explain this discrepancy?</p><p>Perhaps the most meaningful question is about the degree to which the results described in this manuscript move the field forward, relative to expectations for this journal. My initial reaction is that the differences in substrate specificity, and the roles of these divergent Cas1 orthologs in conferring that specificity, represent a reasonably significant advance, though this is a somewhat close call.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>It could be useful for the authors to tell the reader the CRISPR-Cas subtypes from which these particular Cas1/Cas2 orthologs were derived.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Genetic studies have shown that Cas1 is critical for novel spacer integration at CRISPR loci. Recent work with recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1 by the Doudna group (Nunez et al., Nature Structural Biology, 2014, 21:528-534 and Nunez et al., Nature, 2015, 519:193-198) provided strong evidence that Cas1 functions as the integrase and that its dual transeserification activity displays sequence specificity and is strongly dependent upon association with the Cas2 protein. Furthermore, Nunez et al. demonstrated that 33 bp double-stranded DNA fragments can be integrated into CRISPR repeats by the Cas1 and Cas2 proteins and both the forward (integration) and reverse (disintegration) reactions were observed and characterized. Here, Rollie et al. report that Cas1 alone (from <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. solfataricus</italic> sources) can catalyze a single transesterification reaction on 5' flap DNA substrates that possibly (but not definitively) mimics a disintegration reaction. The main claim in this paper is that Cas1 shows a clear sequence preference for nucleotides at the leader-repeat boundary but this is not true for both sites of integration.</p><p>The current study suffers in that it does not significantly expand our mechanistic understanding of Cas1 function or spacer acquisition beyond that reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nunez et al., 2015</xref>; Babu et al., Mol. Micro., 2011, 79:484-502). Indeed, much of the analysis reaches the conclusion that Cas1 can carry out transesterification reactions on certain branched DNA substrates–the novelty of this observation is undermined, since a transesterification mechanism was already clearly demonstrated by the recent work by Doudna and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nunez et al., 2015</xref>). Another weakness of the paper is that it examines only the putative reverse (disintegration) reaction and the validity of the conclusion that the reaction being studied is reflective of the integration event must await reconstitution of the forward (integration) reaction. Moreover, the claim of clear sequence specificity that coincides with the in vivo integration site is not clear from the data shown. The order of sequential transesterifications resulting in spacer acquisition differs between this work and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nunez et al., 2015</xref>. Indeed, by systematically varying the nucleotides flanking each transesterification site, it was concluded that there is no obvious sequence specificity for site 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Curiously, site 2 described in the paper is equivalent to the site 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nunez et al. (2015)</xref>, which was the main site used where sequence-specificity was observed and which accounts for the in vivo observation that newly acquired spacers have a 5' G as the first nt. flanking the leader-repeat junction that is derived from the upstream PAM. In general, the data in the paper is of high quality and the observed nucleotide specificity at +1 position of site 1 seems solid. However, it is unclear if the reaction under investigation provides a strong model for learning how the spacer acquisition reaction occurs in vivo.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>A relevant reference showing that nucleotides at the leader-repeat boundary are critical for new spacer acquisition was omitted and should be cited at the appropriate locations within the Introduction and Discussion. The reference is: Wei et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 2015, 43:1749-58.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Rollie and co-workers have characterized the sequence specificity of Cas1 from <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. solfataricus</italic>, which has been shown to be involved in the integration of spacers in the CRISPR memory locus. The authors show that these enzymes display efficient transesterification reactions, which may be considered the reversal of the integration of spacers. The manuscript is interesting, important, well written, and biochemically thorough, but would benefit from some improvements described below.</p><p>One key experiment seems to be missing. It remains unclear whether EcoCas1 prefers the disintegration reactions at site 1 or site 2. Although the authors state that the disintegration reaction occurs at site 2 as well, the design of the substrates for the disintegration reaction seems to be based on site 1, which is the leader-repeat boundary. Because a Cas1-Cas2 complex has recently been shown to start integrating spacers from site 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nunez et al., 2015</xref>), it would be good to directly compare the kinetics of both disintegration reactions using the exact substrates that are now thought to be representing site 1 (leader - repeat), and other substrates representing site 2 (repeat - spacer 1), for both EcoCas1 and EcoCas1-Cas2. Has this been done? This will help understand the order of events leading to spacer integration, and take this paper to a next level.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The model in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> could be expanded to include more details (e.g. numbering of positions) and more steps, even if they are hypothetical.

The apparent discrepancy for the 2 µM SsoCas1 reactions is explained by the fact that the inhibition observed at high concentrations for SsoCas1 is dependent on the ratio of substrate DNA to protein.
