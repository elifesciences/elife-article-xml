measles mortality. India implemented a mass second-dose measles immunization campaign in 2010. We used interrupted time series and multilevel regression to quantify the campaign’s impact on measles mortality using the nationally representative Million Death Study (including 27,000 child deaths in 1.3 million households surveyed from 2005 to 2013). 1–59 month measles mortality rates fell more in the campaign states following launch (27%) versus non-campaign states (11%). Declines were steeper in girls than boys and were specific to measles deaths. Measles mortality risk was lower for children living in a campaign district (OR 0.6, 99% CI 0.4–0.8) or born in 2009 or later (OR 0.8, 99% CI 0.7–0.9). The campaign averted up to 41,000–56,000 deaths during 2010–13, or 39–57% of the expected deaths nationally. Elimination of measles deaths in India is feasible.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43290.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s led to large reductions in measles deaths in many countries. Yet, measles remains a major killer of children younger than age five worldwide, particularly among children living in Africa and Asia, where fewer children are immunized. India has been particularly hard hit, with annual child measles deaths exceeding 60,000 in 2005.</p><p>In the 1990s, India’s national vaccination program made one dose of the measles vaccine part of routine vaccinations through much of the country to help reduce the numbers of measles deaths. However, it was one of the last countries to add a second dose of measles vaccine as recommended by the World Health Organization, which has been shown to prevent infection and death in 90-95% of vaccinated children.</p><p>In 2008, the Indian government announced it would introduce a second dose of measles vaccine to its routine vaccine schedule for children from 2010 onwards. Prior to the introduction of a second-dose measles vaccine, campaigns were launched to increase immunization rates in regions where few children were being vaccinated. But how many young children’s lives were saved by these campaigns was unknown.</p><p>Now, Wong et al. show that India’s measles immunization campaigns saved the lives of 41,000 to 56,000 children between 2010 and 2013. This averted between 39-57% of the expected measles deaths nationally during that time period. Wong et al. used data from the Million Death Study, which used household surveys to capture information on the cause of 27,000 child deaths in India between 2005 and 2013, to assess the affects of the state vaccination campaigns on measles deaths. Changes in measles deaths were compared to changes in unrelated child deaths to make sure any differences were related to the vaccination campaigns and not other improvements in children’s health care.</p><p>Indian states with measles immunization campaigns saw larger decreases in measles deaths among children younger than five than states without such a campaign (27% vs 11%). Similar decreases were not seen in child deaths from other causes. Girls, who are disproportionately affected by measles in India, benefited from larger reductions in deaths than boys in states with immunization campaigns. The success of two-dose measles vaccination campaigns at reducing young children’s deaths in India may help to boost vaccination rates and help combat parents’ hesitance to immunize their children.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>measles</kwd><kwd>India</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd><kwd>child</kwd><kwd>immunization</kwd><kwd>interrupted time series</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN154277</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jha</surname><given-names>Prabhat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jha</surname><given-names>Prabhat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01TW05991-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jha</surname><given-names>Prabhat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Measles immunization campaigns in India accelerated declines in child measles mortality rates and averted 41,000-56,000 child measles deaths during 2010 to 2013.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Measles remains an important cause of death among under-five children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moss, 2017</xref>). Much of this persisting global burden of measles is located in Africa and Asia, notably in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Black et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dabbagh et al., 2017</xref>). Direct estimation of cause-specific mortality documented a 90% decline in 1–59 month measles mortality rates in India from 2000 to 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of national intervention strategies in explaining the decline in measles deaths in India is unknown. In 2005, the Government of India launched the National Rural Health Mission – a program geared towards improving public health infrastructure and reducing child mortality in priority states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2005</xref>). In 2008, the Government of India announced a policy change to introduce second-dose measles vaccine through the routine immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2010</xref>). District-level mass immunization campaigns (termed supplementary immunization activities) for second-dose measles vaccine were launched in 2010 in 14 target states where first-dose measles vaccination coverage was below 80% (hereafter referred to as campaign states). The campaign prioritized immunization of children aged 9 months to 10 years in the 14 campaign states, after which second-dose measles vaccine was provided through routine immunization. The remaining 21 states with higher coverage added only second-dose measles vaccine through routine immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ideal method of evaluation, a randomized trial, was not practical in the rollout of the national campaign. Mathematical models estimate an 84% decline in measles deaths globally during 2000–2016, but are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dabbagh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jha, 2014</xref>). In these scenarios, interrupted time series is considered a robust quasi-experimental evaluation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care, 2017</xref>). Here, we apply interrupted time series supplemented with multilevel regression analysis to provide the first direct quantification of the impact of the national mass measles immunization campaign on childhood measles mortality in India. These analyses have the additional advantage of using the Million Death Study (MDS), a nationally representative sample of all deaths in India, including 27,000 child deaths from 1.3 million households surveyed from 2005 to 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gomes et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characteristics of subjects</title><p>From 2005 to 2013, the MDS captured deaths for 13,490 girls and 13,007 boys aged 1–59 months after excluding children missing cause of death (2.8%). Of the 1,638 measles deaths using the definition of one or more physician coding or the family reported a measles history for the deceased, 79% occurred in rural areas, 73% in campaign states, 59% at ages 12–59 months, and 57% in girls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). 76% of families reporting a measles death noted the child to have a history of measles (using the local language term), but only 39% of the deceased children received at least one dose of measles vaccine. The proportion of measles deaths at 1–59 months in campaign states reporting at least one dose of measles vaccine rose modestly (34% to 47%) from 2005–2009 to 2010–2013, but was mostly unchanged in non-campaign states (48% to 51%). Despite inherent misclassification that can be expected from verbal autopsies, we observed that the proportion vaccinated against measles did not differ across case definitions, suggesting that physician assignment of deaths was not unduly biased by a history of measles vaccination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap

However, direct data are a far more robust form of evidence. We document 24,000 measles deaths in 2013 using a broad case definition that included family reporting of history of measles. WHO estimated 49,000 measles deaths in 2015 using a definition of either clinician-suspected measles infection or a diagnosis of fever with rash and cough, runny nose, or red eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">World Health Organization, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). The addition of possible measles deaths with rash and fever to our original case definition raised the estimate of measles deaths in 2013 from 24,000 to 46,000. At our observed rate of decline, we would expect 35,000 deaths in 2015 using the WHO definition. Further investigation of the reasons for these differences in total deaths from measles, particularly at the subnational level, is required. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadel et al. (2017)</xref> documented 7,000 measles deaths in 2015 using a narrower case definition that excluded a history of measles and where all deaths were so assigned by dual physician coding with final adjudication by a third senior physician if needed. Thus, substantial downward revisions of WHO modeled estimates are likely needed. The relationship between measles cases and deaths in India is also uncertain, given that WHO incidence estimates are inconsistent with documented case fatality rates in India which range from 0.8–1.4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sudfeld and Halsey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Verguet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolfson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">World Health Organization, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murhekar et al., 2014</xref>). Our direct data should help to redefine current estimates of measles mortality and number of infections in India.</p><p>Could measles transmission or, at a minimum, measles deaths be eliminated in India? Drastic declines in child measles mortality suggest that elimination of measles deaths in India is feasible, albeit difficult. Measles elimination is challenging due to its high infectivity – each infected child can infect an additional 4–26 children in South-east Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guerra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holzmann et al., 2016</xref>). The WHO estimated the coverage of first-dose vaccine in South-east Asia (which includes India) to be below the levels that would achieve herd immunity (85% in 2012) and stagnation of coverage in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dabbagh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moss, 2017</xref>). Documented measles outbreaks indicate that India remains endemic to measles given suboptimal coverage, with about 3 million infants not receiving first-dose measles vaccination in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dabbagh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jamir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh and Garg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vaidya et al., 2016</xref>). India’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Program reported a decline in annual measles outbreaks during 2011–2013 but gradual increases since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 2018</xref>). The Global Vaccine Action Plan for 2012–2020 and the Government of India recommend second-dose measles vaccine to achieve herd immunity at 95% coverage to eliminate measles transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dabbagh et al., 2017</xref>). Supplementary immunization activities must be regularly scheduled to reach herd immunity and to combat resurgence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Verguet et al., 2017</xref>). Though herd immunity may be difficult to achieve, efforts to improve vaccine coverage will curtail mortality, as evident by our findings. The observed reduction in under-five measles mortality may show herd immunity in cohorts born within nine months of the campaign launch. Since 2013, 11 states in India have implemented laboratory-confirmed measles surveillance. This infrastructure provides sero-epidemiological data to facilitate diagnoses of measles, detect suspected cases, and sequence circulating measles genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vaidya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vaidya and Chowdhury, 2017</xref>). High quality measles surveillance through case-based detection and direct mortality statistics such as the MDS provide valuable data to monitor measles elimination programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vaidya, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The measles campaign was particularly successful for girls, which saw greater absolute declines in measles mortality than boys. Though the girl-boy gap in measles mortality rates narrowed, mortality remains higher in girls, as is the case for other infectious causes of death at ages 1–59 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadel et al., 2017</xref>). Persisting higher mortality rates among girls than boys may be due to lower vaccination coverage, social preference for boys, and lower levels of breastfeeding and health care access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corsi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guilmoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jha et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ram et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The interrupted time series design addresses potential confounding by the effects of different policies occurring at the same time as the measles campaign launch. Given that the majority of child causes of death were declining from 2000 onward, we selected unbiased control deaths comparable with the pre-intervention trends of measles, pneumonia, and diarrhoea deaths. The addition of control deaths allows for evaluation of post-intervention differences rather than single-group mean or slope differences. In stratified analysis, we tested alternate intervention time points and measles case definitions, all of which reported a consistent effect. We did not observe a change in <italic>slope</italic> when moving the intervention forward to 2010, likely due to fewer time points in the post-intervention trend. The observed decreased in level of measles mortality when using 2010 as the intervention year might reflect greater actual vaccine delivery.</p><p>The MDS verbal autopsy form is designed to identify all major causes of death in children with low levels of misclassification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksandrowicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadel et al., 2017</xref>). The verbal autopsy form contains specific questions relating to measles (e.g. presence of rash, cough, whether the respondent reported history of measles) but cannot ascertain exposure and timing of symptoms. Thus, we tested alternate case definitions, one including family-reporting of a history of measles to capture measles-associated deaths of pneumonia or diarrhoea, and the other using only physician coding of measles deaths. We observed declines specific to the campaign, in each case definition, as opposed to no additional declines in pneumonia or diarrhoea deaths. The lack of effect in pneumonia deaths may be due to measles contributing a smaller etiologic fraction than other viral, bacterial, or fungal agents (Farrar et al., submitted). The success of the measles campaign is the increase in vaccination in campaign states to levels comparable with non-campaign states. Though the effect was smaller in non-campaign states, the introduction of second-dose measles through routine immunization in these non-campaign states also contributed to the declines in measles mortality nationally. Continued diligence in mass immunization and direct mortality monitoring are both needed to achieve elimination of measles deaths in India.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Most deaths in India as in most low- and middle-income countries occur at home and without medical attention, precluding complete death registration and certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Registrar General of India, 2016</xref>). Starting in 2001, the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the Centre for Global Health Research implemented the MDS in 1.3 million households within its Sample Registration System (SRS), an ongoing demographic surveillance system. Following each census, the RGI partitions India into 1 million small areas comprising 150–300 homes in either rural villages or urban census enumeration blocks.

We use area-level variances, median odds ratios, and intra-class correlations as measures of variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larsen and Merlo, 2005</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43290.024</object-id><label>Table 6.</label><caption><title>Multilevel models for measles mortality among 1–59-month children, India, 2005–2013.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">N = 26,505</th><th valign="top">Model 1</th><th valign="top">Model 2</th><th valign="top">Model 3</th><th valign="top">Model 4</th><th valign="top">Model 5</th><th valign="top">Model 6</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><bold>Level 1 (Individual/Child)</bold></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">12–59 months (v. 1–11 months)</td><td valign="top">---</td><td valign="top">1.50 (1.34, 1.69)</td><td valign="top">---</td><td valign="top">---</td><td valign="top">1.56 (1.38, 1.75)</td><td valign="top">1.48 (1.33, 1.42)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Female (v.

We extrapolated the expected rates using the pre-intervention trend from campaign launch to the end of the time series. We applied UN live births to their respective year and summed for the 2010–2013 period, then calculated deaths averted and percent averted between the observed deaths and the expected deaths. We report upper and lower bounds using the broad case definition, which captures one physician coding measles or family reporting of a history of measles, and the narrow case definitions, which captures only one physician coding measles. We used Stata version 15 for statistical analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Prabhat Jha is a Reviewing Editor at <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Ethics approval for the MDS was obtained from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research, St. John's Research Institute and St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The impact of measles immunization campaigns in India using a nationally representative sample of 27,000 child deaths&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mark Jit as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Eduardo Franco as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity:; Narendra Arora (Reviewer #2); Anindya Bose (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that this is an important paper, using a large and rich dataset to demonstrate the strong impact of measles SIAs in India, as well as yielding a lot of valuable insights about measles epidemiology in that country. Overall, we would like to see this paper published, but there are a few aspects of the analysis and results that need some explanation.</p><p>1) The analysis was limited to measles in children under 5 years. Some commentary on the appropriateness of this would be useful, since the target age range for the SIAs was up to 10 years. What% of measles deaths are in &gt;5s – these might be particularly important in better performing states and hence may make the highest burden states look worse than they are in comparison.</p><p>2) Figure 2: The interrupted time-series with non-measles controls is not very convincing because even the non-campaign states experience a much faster decline in measles deaths than control deaths. This suggests that measles mortality is decreasing faster overall than mortality due to the control diseases, and a difference-in-difference analysis is more reliable.</p><p>3) Given the temporary and likely artifactual rise in measles mortality reported in 2009 (subsection” Interrupted Time Series Analysis”: believed due to an increase in reporting rather than actual deaths), was this year also be taken out of the other analyses e.g. those in Table 1, Table 2 and Figure 1? Otherwise it may cause the downward slope of the pre-SIA trend to be underestimated. This is particularly important in the analysis in Table 2 which is used to calculate the overall measles deaths prevented.</p><p>4) The Discussion section shows that WHO estimates of measles mortality in India are much higher than those estimated from MDS data. This is quite an important statement and if true may imply that there are shortcomings in the WHO methodology that may require revisiting measles mortality estimates in other countries also. Could this be explored a bit further e.g. what are the differences in WHO methodology that may have led to this difference?</p><p>5) In Table 2, figures indicating the pre and post campaign state would be useful in interpretation at state level.</p><p>6) In subsection “Coverage of Measles Immunization and Related Health Indicators”, source of the measles coverage data and whether for one dose or two doses needs to be specified.</p><p>7) The MSL campaign starting 2010 targeted 9 months -10 years age group. This article purports to show that the campaign had an impact on measles deaths in 1-59 month old children in 2009/2010 to 2013. However, the cohort that was &lt;9 months old in 2010, 1 year old in 2011, &lt;2 years old in 2012, &lt;3 years old in 2013 etc. would not have received any vaccination though SIA. So the effects of the campaign observed in this age group would be the indirect effect of the campaign by reducing transmission through sudden increase of herd immunity in cohorts born from 9 months before start of campaign. This indirect effect should be mentioned when we ascribe impact on mortality to immunization delivered through the campaign. This could also be the key underlying epidemiological mechanism in campaign states vs. non-campaign states where no such sudden increase in herd immunity occurred.</p><p>8) Cause of death ascertainment from measles should not have taken MCV vaccination status into account. This should be mentioned explicitly as this can introduce a bias in the results.</p><p>One of the reviewers pointed out that there is now a measles technical advisory group in India. Hence it may be appropriate to share this paper with them, with the Ministry of Health India and with WHO SEARO office, given the interest in the subject by these groups.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43290.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The analysis was limited to measles in children under 5 years.

This proportion did not differ greatly between states. We have added the following to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Though the campaign targeted children up to 10 years of age, our analysis focuses on children aged 1-59 months who comprised 84% (1638/1958) of these deaths.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2: The interrupted time-series with non-measles controls is not very convincing because even the non-campaign states experience a much faster decline in measles deaths than control deaths. This suggests that measles mortality is decreasing faster overall than mortality due to the control diseases, and a difference-in-difference analysis is more reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, visually, the measles mortality rate appears to decline faster than control mortality rates in non-campaign states. Using the interrupted time series model, we adjusted for differences in the baseline mean and time trends between measles and control mortality. Measles mortality in campaign states saw a significant decline after campaign launch (P = 0.040), whereas measles mortality in non-campaign states did not change after campaign launch (P = 0.157).</p><p>We agree that to evaluate change in measles mortality following the intervention, the trends in measles and control mortality prior to the intervention must be parallel. For all models, we compared the pre-intervention trends in measles deaths to that of control deaths and found no significant differences. We have added the results of the pre-intervention trend comparisons to the footnotes in Figure 2 and Figure 4.</p><p>Figure 2: “We observed no significant difference when comparing pre-intervention trends for the control deaths to the deaths from measles, pneumonia, or diarrhoea in the campaign states, or to measles deaths in the non-campaign states (P &gt; 0.1 for all four comparisons).”</p><p>Figure 4: “We observed no significant difference when comparing pre-intervention trends for the control deaths to those for case deaths based on the narrower definitions of at least one physician coding measles and both physicians coding measles (P &gt; 0.4 for both comparisons).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the temporary and likely artifactual rise in measles mortality reported in 2009 (subsection” Interrupted Time Series Analysis”: believed due to an increase in reporting rather than actual deaths), was this year also be taken out of the other analyses e.g. those in Table 1, Table 2 and Figure 1? Otherwise it may cause the downward slope of the pre-SIA trend to be underestimated. This is particularly important in the analysis in Table 2 which is used to calculate the overall measles deaths prevented.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern for potential underestimation of the pre-intervention trends. We were cautious to ensure the estimates are conservative. We tested removal of the temporary rise in measles mortality in 2009 and saw no difference in pre-intervention slopes (P = 0.891). The narrower case definitions did not show a rise in measles mortality in 2009 as they did not include family-reporting of measles history. For these more narrow definitions, pre-intervention trends in measles deaths and control deaths did not differ significantly (see reply to Comment #2 above). We updated the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“The pre-intervention trends excluding 2009 deaths did not differ from control deaths (P = 0.9).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion section shows that WHO estimates of measles mortality in India are much higher than those estimated from MDS data.

Could this be explored a bit further e.g. what are the differences in WHO methodology that may have led to this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. Our measles case definition differs from the WHO definition which relies on either clinician-suspected measles infection or a diagnosis of fever with rash and cough, runny nose, or red eyes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R2.pdf">https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R2.pdf</ext-link>). We updated the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“WHO estimated 49,000 measles deaths in 2015 using a definition of either clinician-suspected measles infection or a diagnosis of fever with rash and cough, runny nose, or red eyes (World Health Organization, 2018a, 2016). The addition of possible measles deaths with rash and fever to our original case definition raised the estimate of measles deaths in 2013 from 24,000 to 46,000. At our observed rate of decline, we would expect 35,000 deaths in 2015 using the WHO definition. Further investigation of the reasons for these differences in total deaths from measles, particularly at the subnational level, is required.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Table 2, figures indicating the pre and post campaign state would be useful in interpretation at state level.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not able to reliably estimate AARR by pre- and post-intervention time periods by state due to low numbers. We updated now Table 2 to include AARR estimates for large states in India and by campaign/non-campaign states. We also added pre-intervention and post-intervention AARRs by campaign and non-campaign states to the footnotes. We updated Figure 1 to include pre- and post-intervention AARRs by sex, campaign states, and urban/rural residence, and India overall.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In subsection “Coverage of Measles Immunization and Related Health Indicators”, source of the measles coverage data and whether for one dose or two doses needs to be specified.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the data sources and measles coverage definition in the <italic>eLife</italic> format, we added the definition of measles vaccination coverage to the Results section, Materials and methods section and relevant figures as follows:</p><p>Results section: “National measles immunization coverage (defined as the percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months receiving any dose of measles vaccine) improved from 2002–2014, particularly in campaign states (Figure 5).”</p><p>Materials and methods section: “We also adjusted for state-level coverage estimates of measles vaccination (defined in the National Family Health Survey and the District Level Household and Facility Survey as the percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months receiving any measles vaccine), vitamin A supplementation, oral rehydration supplementation, maternal literacy, and treatment-seeking for diarrhoea and pneumonia.”</p><p>Figure 5: “Estimates were obtained from the National Family Health Survey and the District Level Household and Facility Survey through 2002 to 2014. Measles vaccination coverage was defined as the percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months receiving any measles vaccine.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The MSL campaign starting 2010 targeted 9 months -10 years age group.

This should be mentioned explicitly as this can introduce a bias in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The proportion of respondents reporting no measles vaccination when both physicians assigned measles as the cause of death was 50% and did not differ greatly with the broader case definitions and controls (Table 1—source data 1). We updated the Results section as follows:</p><p>“Despite inherent misclassification that can be expected from verbal autopsies, we observed that the proportion vaccinated against measles did not differ across case definitions, suggesting that physician assignment of deaths was not unduly biased by a history of measles vaccination (See source data for Table 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the reviewers pointed out that there is now a measles technical advisory group in India. Hence it may be appropriate to share this paper with them, with the Ministry of Health India and with WHO SEARO office, given the interest in the subject by these groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We are in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and have shared preliminary results. We will be holding dissemination sessions with collaborators and relevant organizations, in addition to working with the WHO on validation of national and subnational estimates.</p></body></sub-article></article>
