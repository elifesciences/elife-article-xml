The anterior posterior (ap) alpha′/beta′ (α′/β′) neurons of the mushroom body (MB) are required for sleep-dependent memory consolidation in flies fed after training. These neurons are also involved in the increase of sleep after training, suggesting a coupling of sleep and memory. To better understand the mechanisms underlying sleep and memory consolidation initiation, we analyzed the transcriptome of ap α′/β′ neurons 1 hr after appetitive memory conditioning. A small number of genes, enriched in RNA processing functions, were differentially expressed in flies fed after training relative to trained and starved flies or untrained flies. Knockdown of each of these differentially expressed genes in the ap α′/β′ neurons revealed notable sleep phenotypes for Polr1F and Regnase-1, both of which decrease in expression after conditioning. Knockdown of Polr1F, a regulator of ribosome RNA transcription, in adult flies promotes sleep and increases pre-ribosome RNA expression as well as overall translation, supporting a function for Polr1F downregulation in sleep-dependent memory. Conversely, while constitutive knockdown of Regnase-1, an mRNA decay protein localized to the ribosome, reduces sleep, adult specific knockdown suggests that effects of Regnase-1 on sleep are developmental in nature. We further tested the role of each gene in memory consolidation. Knockdown of Polr1F does not affect memory, which may be expected from its downregulation during memory consolidation. Regnase-1 knockdown in ap α′/β′ neurons impairs all memory, including short-term, implicating Regnase-1 in memory, but leaving open the question of why it is downregulated during sleep-dependent memory. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the expression of RNA processing genes is modulated during sleep-dependent memory and, in the case of Polr1F, this modulation likely contributes to increased sleep.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sehgal</surname><given-names>Amita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA processing genes regulated during sleep-dependent memory may contribute to sleep and memory.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is an optimized state for memory consolidation compared to wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). Indeed, sleep is thought to reorganize and strengthen the neural connections required for novel memory formation and long-term memory consolidation, and sleep disruption leads to impaired memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roselli et al., 2021</xref>). Beneficial effects of sleep on memory have also been attributed to post-learning neuronal reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dag et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We recently demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> switch between sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory consolidation based on food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chouhan et al., 2021</xref>). Flies that are fed after appetitive conditioning show sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which is mediated by the anterior posterior (ap) α'/β' neurons of the mushroom body. On the other hand, flies starved after training display sleep-independent memory mediated by medial (m) neurons of the α'/β' lobes. Neurotransmission from ap α′/β′ neurons in the first 4 hr after training in the fed flies is not only required for long-term memory but also increased sleep post-training. Indeed, activation of ap α′/β′ neurons promotes baseline sleep, supporting the idea that post training sleep is triggered by the same neurons that are required for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. However, how sleep and memory consolidation are coordinated in ap α′/β′ neurons in this time window is not understood.</p><p>Since both post-training sleep and memory consolidation occur rapidly within a few hours after training, we investigated transient gene expression changes in the ap α′/β′ neurons after training to elucidate the interplay of sleep and memory consolidation. Here, we profiled the transcriptome of ap α′/β′ neurons 1 hr after flies were fed and trained, as well as under control conditions in which flies were starved and trained or fed and untrained. We knocked down the differentially expressed genes in trained and fed flies and identified two RNA processing genes that affect sleep. Knockdown of one of these, Polr1F, a regulator of ribosomal RNA synthesis, promotes sleep and translation, both of which are required for consolidation of memory in trained and fed flies. Knockdown of Polr1F does not affect memory, which is consistent with downregulation of this gene during memory consolidation. Knockdown of Regnase-1, an mRNA decay protein, reduces sleep and disrupts post-training sleep, and also impairs both short- and long-term memory. While the relevance of Regnase-1 downregulation during sleep-dependent memory is unclear, overall we propose that RNA processing is modulated during sleep-dependent memory, likely to regulate sleep and memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transient transcriptome profiling of ap α′/β′ neurons after training</title><p>We previously demonstrated that flies fed after appetitive memory training exhibit increased sleep and form sleep-dependent memory, which is mediated by ap α′/β′ neurons of the mushroom body (MB) α'/β' lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chouhan et al., 2021</xref>).

We used the ap α′/β′ neuron constitutive driver R35B12-Gal4 line to drive the RNAi constructs and compared the sleep patterns of knockdown flies with those of R35B12-Gal4 and UAS-RNAi control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Using a cutoff of a 200 min change in sleep relative to each control group, we identified two genes, Polr1F and Regnase-1, that showed significant effects on baseline sleep. Knockdown of Polr1F, a component of RNA polymerase I complex, led to an increase in sleep. Although Polr1F has not been extensively studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marygold et al., 2020</xref>), its human ortholog hRPA43 is part of the multi-subunit protein complex Pol I that regulates the transcription of ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckouët et al., 2011</xref>). Knockdown of Regnase-1, an RNA-binding protein that binds to mRNA undergoing active translation and promotes mRNA decay via its ribonuclease activity, in ap α′/β′ neurons resulted in a reduction of both nighttime and daytime sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). Further analysis of sleep architecture revealed that knockdown of Polr1F and Regnase-1 did not significantly impact the total activity of flies, while knockdown of either Polr1F and Regnase-1 resulted in increased and decreased average length of sleep episodes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The sleep screen of differentially expressed genes identifies Polr1F and Regnase-1 as sleep-regulating genes.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Flies carrying the ap α′/β′ neuron driver R35B12-Gal4 were crossed with flies carrying UAS-RNAi constructs targeting DEGs identified from RNA-seq analysis. 5–7 days old female F1 progeny were loaded onto Trikinetics DAM monitors to measure their sleep in a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark (12:12 LD) cycle.

Knockdown of Polr1F resulted in immediate inactivity and sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). However, with knockdown of Regnase-1, immediate changes in sleep were not noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). This could be due to potential leakiness of the nSyb-GS, such that it reduced sleep even without RU486 treatment, coupled with the fact that sleep before dusk is already quite low, potentially hindering detection of further sleep reduction. We also analyzed sleep for the next 3 consecutive days from day 3 to day 5 and found that constitutive pan-neuronal Polr1F knockdown increased sleep while Regnase-1 knockdown seemed to have no effect, again perhaps due to the leakiness of <italic>nSyb-GS</italic>.

As Regnase-1 is thought to promote decay of mRNAs undergoing translation, its knockdown, or its downregulation following training, might also be expected to promote translation, or at least the translation of its target mRNAs. The role of protein synthesis in long-term memory consolidation is well-established across organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</xref>), and nascent rRNA synthesis was also shown to be induced by training and required for memory consolidation in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>). We thus used real-time qPCR of total RNA extracted from vehicle control and RU-treated fly brains to measure how precursor ribosomal RNA (Pre-rRNA) is affected by knockdown of Polr1F.

Two RNA processing genes Polr1F and Regnase-1 are prominently downregulated during memory consolidation in trained and fed flies, respectively. Polr1F is involved in regulating ribosomal RNA synthesis, and its decrease in levels in trained and fed flies promotes sleep and translation.

To address this gap, we conducted transcriptomic analysis of ap α′/β′ neurons from trained and fed flies to identify genes that change rapidly under conditions that drive sleep-dependent memory. Our transcriptome profiling of ap α′/β′ neurons suggests that genes regulating rRNA transcription and translation are altered in the context of sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>RNA processing genes mediate sleep-dependent memory consolidation and sleep</title><p>Many of the 59 DEGs we identified are implicated in RNA processing.

More importantly, our findings here indicate that alterations of some of RNA processing genes impact sleep as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Polr1F regulates ribosome RNA synthesis and sleep</title><p>Learning-induced changes in gene expression in memory-related neurons are often critical for long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavallaro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoedjes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tadi et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings with Polr1F implicate changes in Pol I transcription during sleep-dependent memory. Polr1F(Rpa43) is predicted to be part of the RNA polymerase I complex and is involved in DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity/rDNA transcription in yeast, especially for the initiation of ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckouët et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marygold et al., 2020</xref>). As suggested by our data, Polr1F has an inhibitory role in the RNA polymerase I complex, which is also consistent with the aforementioned study that found a 22 amino acid peptide within Polr1F can inhibit rDNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rothblum et al., 2014</xref>). Based upon our finding that inducible knockdown of Polr1F rapidly promotes translation, it is likely that the rapid and dramatic decline of Polr1F after training in fed flies serves to increase de novo ribosome RNA synthesis. This supports the report that ribosomal RNA is induced by learning and required for memory consolidation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>). While we do not know how knockdown of Polr1F promotes sleep, an attractive possibility is that higher translation is a result of elevated sleep. Sleep is thought to promote translation and its role in memory consolidation in fed flies could be related to its effect on translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seibt and Frank, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chouhan et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, increased translation or rRNA synthesis could promote sleep. However, translation is typically thought of as a consequence of sleep rather than a cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zimmerman et al., 2006</xref>). Also, rRNA transcription rates remain constant throughout the day in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sinturel et al., 2017</xref>), but it is still possible that these rates vary in particular regions of the brain and affect sleep. The role of rRNA synthesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> learning and memory has barely been explored, but our work, together with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2018</xref>, indicates that the well-known requirement for de novo protein synthesis during long-term memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jarome and Helmstetter, 2014</xref>) includes increased synthesis of ribosomal RNA and protein.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Novel neuronal role of Regnase-1 in sleep and memory</title><p>The role of RNA binding protein Regnase-1 in the innate immune response has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wei et al., 2019</xref>).

It localizes to the ribosomes on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and binds to translationally active mRNAs with specialized stem-loop structures at the 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uehata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mino et al., 2015</xref>). When phosphorylated, Regnase-1 is released from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka et al., 2019</xref>). Because functional Regnase-1 binds and degrades its bound mRNA, Regnase-1 inactivation leads to an increase of its target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uehata et al., 2013</xref>). The target mRNAs of Regnase-1 in immune cells encode proinflammatory cytokines, which can then be expressed when Regnase-1 is inactivated. However, Regnase-1 has also been reported to modulate cytokines and neuronal injury in the microglia in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Regulation of Regnase-1 is usually rapid and transient, and its rapid response to microenvironmental changes, different pathological states and stress is critical for cellular adaption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our study reveals that the expression of Regnase-1 changes after training, and constitutive downregulation of Regnase-1 in ap α′/β′ neurons reduces sleep and causes deficits in learning and memory consolidation. Whether acute downregulation of Regnase-1 is necessary for sleep-dependent memory remains unclear, but it could play a role by promoting the translation of specific transcripts. For instance, post-training downregulation of Regnase-1 could release mRNAs that are usually targeted for decay but are critical for memory consolidation. Constitutive loss of Regnase-1 impairs sleep-independent memory and short-term memory, although the mechanisms are not known. We note that ap α′/β′ neurons have a role in several aspects of memory consolidation as well as short-term appetitive memory retrieval. Interestingly, constitutive knockdown of Regnase-1 also reduces sleep developmentally and prevents sleep increase after training in adult. While these could be independent effects, it is also possible that loss of Regnase-1 affects the development of the relevant MB neurons, thereby impacting all behaviors regulated by these neurons.</p><p>Our study of local molecular changes in ap α′/β′ neurons after training suggests that ribosomal RNA transcription and mRNA translation might work in concert during the consolidation of sleep-dependent memory. How sleep is involved in this boosted protein synthesis process is unclear, but we suggest that RNA processing changes induce sleep, which promotes translation necessary for consolidation of long-term memory. However, these processes need to be teased apart experimentally. Overall, our findings demonstrate a role of RNA processing in sleep and memory, providing a foundation for future exploration of the mechanisms involved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, 5–7 days old female flies were loaded into 60/90 mm glass locomotor tubes for behavior tests, using DAM2/5 H <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitors from Trikinetics. 1/15 infrared beams bisect each tube, providing movement (position in multibeam) information of the fly across the tube. Locomotor tubes are loaded with 2% agar with 5% sucrose as fly food on one side, and yarn is put on the other side to restrain the behavior of flies inside the glass tubes. For experiments with the inducible Gene Switch system, 0.5 mM RU486 (mifepristone) was added to the fly food to activate the expression of the transgenes under the control of UAS. Three constitutive days of data were used for sleep analysis by Pysolo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pysolo.net/">https://www.pysolo.net/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Appetitive conditioning</title><p>Approximately 100 four- to seven-day-old mixed-sexes flies were starved for 12 hr in <italic>Drosophila</italic> bottles with water -soaked filtered paper and then trained at 25 °C and 70% relative humidity to associate sucrose with odor A for 2 min, and then a blank with odor B for 2 min with 30 s clean air in between. The odors used were 4-Methylcyclohexanol (MCH) and 3-Octanol (OCT) in paraffin oil and the concentration for both MCH and OCT in oil was 1:10. After conditioning, flies were moved back to normal fly food or starved for 1 hr and dissected for subsequent ap cell sorting and RNA-sequencing. For the short-term memory test, flies were tested immediately after conditioning in the same wheel for 2 min.</p><p>To assess post-training sleep, flies were introduced in glass tubes containing 2% agar and 5% sucrose through an aspirator without anesthesia and loaded into the DAM system after training. For long-term memory assessment, trained flies were either kept on food vials for 24 hr or were further starved. Starved flies were tested for memory 24 hr after training, while fed flies were re-starved for 42 hr before memory tests. Memory was tested by giving flies a choice between odor A and odor B for 2 min in a T-maze. Performance index (PI) was calculated as the number of flies selecting CS<sup>+</sup> odor minus the number of flies selecting CS<sup>-</sup> odor divided by the total number of flies. Each PI is the average of PIs from reciprocal experiments with two odors swapped to minimize non-associative effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell isolation and sorting</title><p>Dissected brains are dissociated by following the protocol from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2017</xref>. Briefly, brains are dissected in Schneider′s medium, and then are placed in a shaker and dissociated in Papain solution, filtered through a 100 μm cell strainer, and re-suspended in Schneider′s medium. 500 GFP+ cells from the same conditions were sorted into 96 well microplate with lysis buffer from Smart-seq2 HT kit and frozen. We dissected 50 brains for each group to ensure enough GFP+ cells. Cell sorting were conducted by either BD FACSMelody or BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences), and dead cells were excluded with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Doublets were excluded using and forward scatter (FSC-H by FSC-W) and side scatter (SSC-H by SSC-W). Size of cells was selected by FSC-A by FSC-A and validated for fly neurons using cells from flies expressing nsyb-nGFP.

Recently, the authors showed that fruit flies form sleep-dependent long-term appetitive memory only when fed. They showed that this context-dependent memory trace maps to the anterior posterior (ap) α'β' mushroom body neurons (MBNs) (Chouhan et al., (2021) Nature). However, the molecular cascades induced by during training that promote sleep and memory have remained enigmatic.</p><p>Here the authors investigate this issue by combining cell-specific transcriptomics, genetic perturbations, and measurements of sleep and memory. They identify an array of genes altered in expression following appetitive training. These genes are mainly downregulated, and predominantly encode regulators of transcription and RNA biosynthesis. This is a conceptually attractive finding given that long-term memory requires de novo protein translation.</p><p>The authors then screen these genes for novel regulators of sleep and memory. They show that one of these genes (Polr1F) acts in ap α'β' MBNs to promote wakefulness, while another (Regnase-1) promotes sleep. They also identify a specific role for Regnase-1 in ap α'β' MBNs in regulating short- and long-term memory formation - likely through effects on the development of ap α'β' MBNs - and demonstrate that Pol1rF inhibits translation throughout the fly brain.</p><p>The analyses of molecular alterations in ap α'β' MBNs are interesting and impressive. However, as noted by the authors, further experiments are required to clarify the precise contribution of reductions in Polr1F and Regnase-1 to training-induced changes in memory and sleep. Nonetheless, this study provides a useful platform for such studies, and provides a conceptual advance in linking acute changes in RNA processing pathways to the interconnected processes of sleep, memory, and protein translation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89023.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Previous work (Chouhan et al., 2022) from the Sehgal group investigated the relationship between sleep and long-term memory formation by dissecting the role of mushroom body intrinsic neurons, extrinsic neurons, and output neurons during sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory consolidation. In this manuscript, Li et al., profiled transcriptome in the anterior-posterior (ap) α'/β' neurons and identified genes that are differentially expressed after training in fed condition, which supports sleep-dependent memory formation. By knocking down candidate genes systematically, the authors identified Polr1F and Regnase-1 as two important hits that play potential roles in sleep and memory formation. What is the function of sleep and how to create a memory are two long-standing questions in science. The present study used a new approach to identify novel components that may link sleep and memory consolidation in a specific type of neuron. Importantly, these components implicated that RNA processing may play a role in these processes.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about the innovative approach employed to identify RNA processing genes involved in sleep regulation and memory consolidation. During the revision process, the authors fully addressed major concerns raised by reviewers. First, the author used the Gal80ts to restrict the knockdown of Regnase-1 in adult animals and concluded that Regnase-1 RNAi appears to affect sleep through development. Second, the author showed that Regnase-1 knockdown produced robust phenotypes for both sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory, as well as a severe short-term memory phenotype. The author cautiously concluded that flies with constitutive Regnase-1 knockdown could be poor learners, thereby exhibiting a memory phenotype. Although we don't yet have a strong link between sleep and long-term memory consolidation, the interpretation presented in the manuscript is sufficiently justified by the data. This work presents a novel strategy to explore the link between sleep and memory consolidation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89023.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #4 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Li and Chouhan et al. follow up on a previous publication describing the role of anterior-posterior (ap) and medial (m) ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells in mediating sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory consolidation, respectively, based on feeding state in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The authors sequenced bulk RNA of ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells 1h after flies were either trained-fed, trained-starved or untrained-fed and find a small number of genes (59) differentially expressed (3 upregulated, 56 downregulated) between trained-fed and trained-starved conditions. Many of these genes encode proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The authors then screened these differentially expressed genes for sleep phenotypes by expressing RNAi hairpins constitutively in ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells and measuring sleep patterns. Two hits were selected for further analysis: Polr1F, which promoted sleep, and Regnase-1, which reduced sleep. The pan-neuronal expression of Polr1F and Regnase-1 RNAi constructs was then temporally restricted to adult flies using the GeneSwitch system. Polr1F sleep phenotypes were still observed, while Regnase-1 sleep phenotypes were not, indicating developmental defects. Appetitive memory was then assessed in flies with constitutive knockdown of Polr1F and Regnase-1 in ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells. Polr1F knockdown did not affect sleep-dependent or sleep-independent memory, while Regnase-1 knockdown disrupted sleep-dependent memory, sleep-independent memory, as well as learning. Polr1F knockdown increased pre-ribosomal RNA transcripts in the brain, as measured by qPCR, in line with its predicted role as part of the RNA polymerase I complex. A puromycin incorporation assay to fluorescently label newly synthesized proteins also indicated higher levels of bulk translation upon Polr1F knockdown.

It combines transcriptomic approaches following memory induction with measurements of sleep and memory to discover molecular pathways underlying these interlinked behaviors. The authors explore transcriptional changes in specific mushroom body neurons and suggest roles for two genes involved in RNA processing, Polr1F and Regnase-1, in the regulation of sleep and memory. Although this work exploits convincing and validated methodology, the strength of the evidence is incomplete to support the main claim that these two genes establish a definitive link between sleep and memory consolidation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reconsideration of our manuscript and recognize that we should have toned down the claims, especially with respect to the link between sleep and memory consolidation. We have now changed the title, the abstract and the main text and also Figure 5 to essentially just state our findings. While there is a little speculation in the Discussion, we point out that future work would be required to draw conclusions. We believe the manuscript still represents a considerable advance in showing the modulation of RNA processing genes during sleep-dependent memory consolidation in the relevant neurons, and also showing how one such gene affects sleep and translation and a second affects sleep and memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Prior work by the Sehgal group has shown that a small group of neurons in the fly brain (anterior posterior (ap) α'β' mushroom body neurons (MBNs)) promote sleep and sleep-dependent appetitive memory specifically under fed conditions (Chouhan et al., (2021) Nature). Here, Li, Chouhan et al. combine cell-specific transcriptomics with measurements of sleep and memory to identify molecular processes underlying this phenomenon. They define transcriptional changes in ap α'β' MBNs and suggest a role for two genes downregulated following memory induction (Polr1F and Regnase-1) in regulating sleep and memory.</p><p>The transcriptional analyses in this manuscript are impressive.

Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Previous work (Chouhan et al., 2022) from the Sehgal group investigated the relationship between sleep and long-term memory formation by dissecting the role of mushroom body intrinsic neurons, extrinsic neurons, and output neurons during sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory consolidation. In this manuscript, Li et al., profiled transcriptome in the anterior-posterior (ap) α'/β' neurons and identified genes that are differentially expressed after training in fed condition, which supports sleep-dependent memory formation. By knocking down candidate genes systematically, the authors identified Polr1F and Regnase-1 as two important hits that play potential roles in sleep and memory formation. What is the function of sleep and how to create a memory are two long-standing questions in science. The present study used a new approach to identify novel components that may link sleep and memory consolidation in a specific type of neuron. Importantly, these components implicated that RNA processing may play a role in these processes.</p><p>While I am enthusiastic about the innovative approach employed to identify RNA processing genes involved in sleep regulation and memory consolidation, I feel that the data presented in the manuscript is insufficient to support the claim that these two genes establish a definitive link between sleep and memory consolidation. First, the developmental role of Regnase-1 in reducing sleep remains unclear because knocking down Regnase-1 using the GeneSwitch system produced neither acute nor chronic sleep loss phenotype. In the revised manuscript, the author used the Gal80ts to restrict the knockdown of Regnase-1 in adult animals and concluded that Regnase-1 RNAi appears to affect sleep through development. Conducting overexpression experiments of Regnase-1 would lend some credibility to the phenotypes, however, this is not pursued in the revised manuscript. Second, while constitutive Regnase-1 knockdown produced robust phenotypes for both sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory, it also led to a severe short-term memory phenotype. This raises the possibility that flies with constitutive Regnase-1 knockdown are poor learners, thereby having little memory to consolidate. The defect in learning could be simply caused by chronic sleep loss before training. Thus, this set of results does not substantiate a strong link between sleep and long-term memory consolidation. Lastly, the discussion on the sequential function of training, sleep, and RNA processing on memory consolidation appears speculative based on the present data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the enthusiasm about the approach. As noted above, we have now removed all claims about a link between sleep and memory, and instead just emphasize that we have identified RNA processing genes that affect sleep and memory. We agree with the reviewer that the basis of the Regnase-1 memory phenotype is unclear as the flies may be poor learners. Also, the learning/memory defects could be secondary to sleep loss or, as Reviewer 4 below suggests, all the behavioral deficits could be caused by impaired development/function of the relevant ap ɑ′/β′ cells. We have now included this possibility in the discussion of the manuscript. And we have modified the discussion on training, RNA processing, sleep and memory to emphasize the need for future experiments to address the sequence and relationship of these different processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Li and Chouhan et al. follow up on a previous publication describing the role of anterior-posterior (ap) and medial (m) ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells in mediating sleep-dependent and sleep-independent memory consolidation, respectively, based on feeding state in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The authors sequenced bulk RNA of ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells 1h after flies were either trained-fed, trained-starved or untrained-fed and find a small number of genes (59) differentially expressed (3 upregulated, 56 downregulated) between trained-fed and trained-starved conditions. Many of these genes encode proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The authors then screened these differentially expressed genes for sleep phenotypes by expressing RNAi hairpins constitutively in ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells and measuring sleep patterns. Two hits were selected for further analysis: Polr1F, which promoted sleep, and Regnase-1, which reduced sleep. The pan-neuronal expression of Polr1F and Regnase-1 RNAi constructs was then temporally restricted to adult flies using the GeneSwitch system. Polr1F sleep phenotypes were still observed, while Regnase-1 sleep phenotypes were not, indicating developmental defects. Appetitive memory was then assessed in flies with constitutive knockdown of Polr1F and Regnase-1 in ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells. Polr1F knockdown did not affect sleep-dependent or sleep-independent memory, while Regnase-1 knockdown disrupted sleep-dependent memory, sleep-independent memory, as well as learning. Polr1F knockdown increased pre-ribosomal RNA transcripts in the brain, as measured by qPCR, in line with its predicted role as part of the RNA polymerase I complex. A puromycin incorporation assay to fluorescently label newly synthesized proteins also indicated higher levels of bulk translation upon Polr1F knockdown. Regnase-1 knockdown did not lead to observable changes in measurements of bulk translation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The proposed involvement of RNA processing genes in regulating sleep and memory processes is interesting, and relatively unexplored. The methods are satisfactory.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the paper is in the overinterpretation of their results, particularly relating to the proposed link between sleep and memory consolidation, as stated in the title. Constitutive Polr1F knockdown in ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells had no effect on appetitive long-term memory, while constitutive Regnase-1 knockdown affected both learning and memory. Since the effects of constitutive Regnase-1 knockdown on sleep could be attributed to developmental defects, it is quite plausible that these same developmental defects are what drive the observed learning and memory phenotypes. In this case, an alternative explanation of the authors' findings is that constitutive Regnase-1 knockdown disrupts the entire functioning of ap ɑ′/β′ Kenyon cells, and as a consequence behaviors involving these neurons (i.e. learning, memory and sleep) are disrupted. It will be important to provide further evidence of the function of RNA processing genes in memory in order to substantiate the memory link proposed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have removed claims of a link between sleep and memory and instead focused the manuscript on our findings of RNA processing genes modulated during sleep-dependent memory. We concur that impaired development of ap ɑ′/β′neurons could account for the sleep and memory phenotype observed and have included this possibility in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The title of the paper should be reconsidered to reflect the results.
