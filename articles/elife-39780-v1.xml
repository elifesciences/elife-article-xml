However, the underlying mechanisms restricting angiogenesis within this context remain ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate that induced endothelial-specific depletion of the transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) in male mice led to increased vascular density in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet feeding, endothelial cell FoxO1-deficient mice exhibited even greater vascular remodeling in the visceral adipose depot, which was paralleled with a healthier adipose tissue expansion, higher glucose tolerance and lower fasting glycemia concomitant with enhanced lactate levels. Mechanistically, FoxO1 depletion increased endothelial proliferative and glycolytic capacities by upregulating the expression of glycolytic markers, which may account for the improvements at the tissue level ultimately impacting whole-body glucose metabolism. Altogether, these findings reveal the pivotal role of FoxO1 in controlling endothelial metabolic and angiogenic adaptations in response to high-fat diet and a contribution of the endothelium to whole-body energy homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39780.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the body, thread-like blood vessels called capillaries weave their way through our tissues to deliver oxygen and nutrients to every cell. When a tissue becomes bigger, existing vessels remodel to create new capillaries that can reach far away cells. However, in obesity, this process does not happen the way it should: when fat tissues expand, new blood vessels do not always grow to match. The starved fat cells can start to dysfunction, which causes a range of issues, from inflammation and scarring of the tissues to problems with how the body processes sugar and even diabetes. Yet, it is still unclear why exactly new capillaries fail to form in obesity.</p><p>What we know is that a protein called FoxO (short for Forkhead box O) is present in the cells that line the inside of blood vessels, and that it can stop the development of new capillaries. FoxO controls how cells spend their energy, and it can force them to go into a resting state. During obesity, the levels of FoxO actually increase in capillary cells. Therefore, it may be possible that FoxO prevents new blood vessels from growing in the fat tissues of obese individuals.</p><p>To find out, Rudnicki et al. created mice that lack the FoxO protein in the cells lining the capillaries, and then fed the animals a high-fat diet. These mutant mice had more blood vessels in their fat tissue, and their fat cells looked healthier. They also stored less fat than normal mice on the same diet, and their blood sugar levels were normal. This was because the FoxO-deprived cells inside capillaries were burning more energy, which they may have obtained by pulling sugar from the blood.</p><p>These results show that targeting the cells that line capillaries helps new blood vessels to grow, and that this could mitigate the health problems that arise with obesity, such as high levels of sugar (diabetes) and fat in the blood. However, more work is needed to confirm that the same cellular processes can be targeted to obtain positive health outcomes in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>diet-induced obesity</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>FoxO1</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-130491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roudier</surname><given-names>Emilie</given-names></name><name><surname>Haas</surname><given-names>Tara L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant #436138-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>Christopher GR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stimulation of endothelial glucose metabolism and vascular growth by genetic depletion of endothelial Foxo1 improves the whole-body response to a high-fat diet, by preserving adipose tissue functions and glucose homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is a growing problem worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moller and Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tchernof and DesprÃ©s, 2013</xref>) and thus an urgent need exists to identify molecular processes and signaling pathways that may serve as novel therapeutic targets to hinder obesity-induced pathologies. Although the underlying causes of obesity-related complications are multifactorial, the dysfunction of adipose tissue plays a central role in the development of peripheral tissue metabolic disturbances, ultimately reflecting systemically in dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moller and Kaufman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuster et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Capillary endothelial cells (EC) are well-known regulators of tissue adaptation to pathologic challenges through their prominent role in blood vessel formation and remodeling. During expansion of visceral adipose tissue, impaired vascular remodeling promotes hypoxia, inflammation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corvera and Gealekman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuster et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, forced stimulation of vascular growth in adipose tissue of obese rodents improves adipose tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robciuc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seki et al., 2018</xref>), counteracting obesity-related metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seki et al., 2018</xref>). These findings indicate that the remodeling capacity of microvascular ECs during obesity is vital not only for the adipose tissue function but also for the development of systemic metabolic disturbances. However, surprisingly little is understood about the signaling pathways that limit the angiogenic response of EC in obesity.</p><p>Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) signaling is essential to the homeostasis of EC and restricts vascular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the control of angiogenesis-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Potente et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Milkiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roudier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>), FoxO1 is a gatekeeper of EC metabolism; its overexpression reduces the metabolic rate of EC and enforces a state of endothelial quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, this transcription factor is one of the major regulators of angiogenic capacity, since the switch from a quiescent to an angiogenic phenotype requires a coordinated increase in EC metabolic activity to meet the higher demand for energy and biomass production associated with proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Bock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schoors et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Compelling observational evidence indicates that endothelial FoxO1 dysregulation coincides with obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. For instance, FoxO1 protein levels were elevated in capillaries from skeletal muscle of mice fed a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nwadozi et al., 2016</xref>) and the activity of endothelial FoxO1 correlated with adipose insulin resistance of obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karki et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, in vitro conditions that mimic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance increase FoxO1 protein and activity in EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nwadozi et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the contribution of FoxO1 signaling to vascular remodeling during obesity has not been addressed experimentally. To date, only a few reports have assessed the relevance of endothelial FoxO proteins in diet-induced disorders, but none have examined the influence on adipose tissue. Moreover, those studies employed simultaneous EC-specific depletion of multiple FoxOs (FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4) and transgenic lines in which gene targeting was not exclusive to EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsuchiya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nwadozi et al., 2016</xref>), preventing discrimination of the specific functions of endothelial FoxO1. Notably, it has been shown that in vitro conditions associated with FoxO1 dysregulation can also compromise EC metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jais et al., 2016</xref>). Although this suggests that the interplay between endothelial FoxO1 levels and EC metabolic activity may be critically implicated in limiting vascular remodeling in obesity, this concept demands validation.</p><p>The converging roles of FoxO1 in the angiogenic phenotype and the metabolism of quiescent EC led us to hypothesize that FoxO1 is a critical nodal point in determining the response of capillary EC to obesity. Consequently, we postulated that targeted endothelial-specific depletion of FoxO1 would provoke capillary growth, preventing obesity-driven adipose tissue dysfunction, and provide a valuable tool to unmask the role of the microvascular endothelium metabolism in the pathophysiology of obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mice with EC-FoxO1 depletion exhibit greater vascular density in visceral adipose tissue</title><p>To assess the involvement of EC-FoxO1 in the control of vascular growth in the adipose tissue of adult mice, we utilized a mouse model of EC-selective depletion of FoxO1 expression (referred to âEC-FoxO1 KDâ mice hereafter) through inactivation of the <italic>Foxo1</italic> gene specifically in EC. <italic>Foxo1</italic> floxed (<italic>Foxo1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) mice were crossbred with <italic>Pdgfb</italic>-iCreERT2 mice that express tamoxifen-activated Cre recombinase in EC and Cre-mediated recombination of <italic>Foxo1</italic> was induced in adult mice. Littermate mice homozygous for the floxed <italic>Foxo1</italic> allele but not expressing Cre recombinase were used as controls. After tamoxifen injection, <italic>Foxo1</italic> recombination was observed within adipose and skeletal muscle but not within the liver, as endothelial <italic>Pdgfb</italic> expression is undetectable in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">HellstrÃ¶m et al., 1999</xref>). The endothelial cell specificity of the recombinase activity was confirmed in microvascular EC isolated from adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Foxo1</italic> transcript level, as measured by qPCR, was decreased by 50% in microvascular EC of EC-FoxO1 KD mice relative to control littermates 8 weeks after the administration of tamoxifen, confirming effective and stable <italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of note, <italic>Foxo3</italic> mRNA expression was unaltered in microvascular EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating a lack of compensation by this FoxO family member in response to the depletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic>. Moreover, consistent with the previously described absence of <italic>Pdgfb</italic>-Cre activity within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Claxton et al., 2008</xref>), no significant changes in <italic>Foxo1</italic> mRNA levels were detected in CD16/CD32<sup>+</sup> immune cells from white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that Cre-mediated recombination did not occur in these stromal cells. The depletion of EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> in microvascular beds of EC-FoxO1 KD mice also was validated via assessment of FoxO1 protein levels by Western blotting. In agreement with the lower mRNA levels observed in microvascular ECs from adipose tissue, protein levels of FoxO1 were diminished by 70% in capillary fragments from skeletal muscle of EC-FoxO1 KD mice compared to control littermates 6 weeks after the administration of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these results not only imply that successful <italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion was constrained to the endothelial cell compartment, particularly microvascular beds, but also support the use of EC-FoxO1 KD mice as an appropriate model to assess the relevance of endothelial FoxO1 for vascular remodeling during adipose tissue expansion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39780.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endothelial-specific depletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> induced in adult male mice effectively reduces FoxO1 levels in skeletal muscle and adipose microvascular beds.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCR of genomic DNA from multiple organs of control (Cre<sup>-</sup>; <italic>Foxo1<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) and EC-FoxO1 KD mice using primers for the floxed and deleted (E1âE3) alleles.

Thus, we inferred that the increased vascular density observed with EC-FoxO1 depletion may hinder adipose tissue expansion and dysfunction induced by high-fat diet. Although HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice showed only a trend towards reduced body weight gain (pÂ =Â 0.06), these mice displayed less fat accumulation, showing lower trunk fat content, smaller retroperitoneal (rWAT) and subcutaneous fat pads compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The phenotype was not explained by changes in food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice also displayed lower fed levels of serum triglycerides and glycerol, and less hepatic lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>), suggesting an improvement in the capacity to handle dietary nutrient excess in these mice. Moreover, histological analysis revealed that increased vascular growth in adipose tissue of HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice was associated with smaller-sized and generally spherical adipocytes, whereas adipocytes from HF-fed control mice were large with irregular polygonal shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâE</xref>), which was previously related to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, adipocytes from EC-FoxO1 KD mice retained a unilocular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) rather than the hallmark multilocular morphology of brown fat. Furthermore, no change in the mRNA levels of browning markers <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Prdm16</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) was detected with EC-FoxO1 depletion.

Surprisingly, EC-FoxO1 KD mice exhibited reduced VO<sub>2</sub> and increased RER during the dark cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>) with equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> production and activity levels compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). These data unexpectedly indicated that EC-FoxO1 KD mice increased oxidation of carbohydrate relative to fatty acid as an energy substrate, suggesting that EC-FoxO1 depletion shifted whole-body energy homeostasis towards glucose oxidation. Consistent with these findings, HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice displayed more rapid glucose clearance from the blood during glucose tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EâF</xref>). However, higher glucose tolerance was not associated with altered whole-body insulin sensitivity, based on insulin tolerance tests (ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6GâH</xref>) or insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Despite the effects on glucose metabolism observed in HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice, no change in whole-body glucose metabolism was detected in NC-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice compared to control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Interestingly, fasting glycemia was significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) whereas serum lactate levels were elevated in HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice compared to their littermates (10.9Â Â±Â 0.39 <italic>vs</italic>. 9.4Â Â±Â 0.55 mmol/L, respectively, pÂ =Â 0.04, nÂ =Â 7/group). These findings imply that altered whole-body glucose metabolism of EC-FoxO1 KD mice on a HF may be due to higher glucose turnover, leading us to postulate that increased glycolytic rates at the tissue level contribute to the metabolic phenotype of HF- EC-FoxO1 KD mice. To address this question, we first assessed the expression of main glycolytic genes, including the constitutive glucose transporter GLUT1 (<italic>Slc2a1</italic>), the rate-limiting enzymes hexokinase 2 (<italic>Hk2</italic>) and phosphofructokinase (<italic>Pfkm</italic>) and phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3 (<italic>Pfkfb3</italic>).

Our data underscore that the manipulation of endothelial FoxO1 levels profoundly modifies the endothelial phenotype under an obesogenic diet, with lower levels of EC-FoxO1 evoking increased endothelial metabolism and capillary growth, most robustly detected within visceral adipose. These effects were sufficient not only to prevent the detrimental obesity-driven alterations in visceral adipose tissue but also to elicit increased glucose clearance leading to higher glucose tolerance in HF-fed miceÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Broadly, these findings provide support for the emerging concept that intrinsic metabolic properties of EC actively influence whole-body energy balance.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39780.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic depicting the influence of FoxO1 in controlling the response of ECs to a HF diet.</title><p>In wild-type mice, FoxO1 represses glycolysis, which prevents endothelial cell growth. This results in impaired angiogenesis during adipose tissue expansion as well as dysfunction of the adipose tissue, which consequently leads to decreased glucose tolerance and increased serum and intra-tissueÂ levels of triglycerides. Conversely, when FoxO1 is depleted in endothelial cells, up-regulation of glycolytic genes accelerates glycolysis, which supports increased cellular metabolism, growth and proliferation. This, in turn, increases the nutrient demand of endothelial cells, resulting in higher uptake and consumption of glucose and an increased production of lactate. The accelerated endothelial cell growth ultimately preserves adipose tissue functions and promotes improved systemic glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-39780-fig10-v1"/></fig><p>A marked increase in vascular density in the adipose tissue was the bona fide phenotypic consequence of EC-FoxO1 depletion, which was strikingly evident under the stress of obesity-related tissue expansion. This demonstrates that endothelial FoxO1 is a prime regulator of adipose tissue microvascular remodeling in adult mice, underlining our hypothesis that FoxO1 levels are directly implicated in limiting the angiogenic response of ECs in obesity. Despite the enlargement of capillaries that was observed in EC-FoxO1 KD mice, these mice displayed a healthier adipose phenotype that lacked the metabolic dysfunctions typically caused by obesity. This finding is in line with previous evidence suggesting that enhanced EC-FoxO1 activity is associated with reduced adipocyte insulin sensitivity in the adipose tissue of obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karki et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, our findings indicate not only that EC-FoxO1 depletion beneficially increases adipose vascular density but also emphasize the intimate interplay of EC and adipocytes and the crucial role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of adipose tissue functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corvera and Gealekman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crewe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, EC-FoxO1 depletion induced relatively modest expansion of skeletal muscle vasculature. Our findings suggest that the tissue-restricted pattern of FoxO1-driven vascular growth is highly dependent on the co-presence of angiogenic factors within the local environment, which is impacted by nutritional status. Besides the higher levels of angiogenic mediators detected in adipose tissue of EC-FoxO1 KD mice, another argument favoring this hypothesis is provided by our observation that EC-FoxO1 depletion was associated with increased EC content within skeletal muscle only under HF feeding. It is noteworthy that previous reports showed that HF-feeding increases VEGF-A protein within the skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Silvennoinen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nwadozi et al., 2016</xref>) and FoxO1 levels within skeletal muscle capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nwadozi et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, our findings also support the concept that the impaired vascular growth reported with sustained HF diet results from the repressive action of EC-FoxO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Milkiewicz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roudier et al., 2013</xref>) rather than the lack of a pro-angiogenic stimulus.</p><p>Interestingly, EC from HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice demonstrated markedly enhanced glycolytic activity, based on the increased expression of glycolytic markers and concomitant increase in glucose uptake, glucose consumption and lactate production. Although the regulation of endothelial metabolism by <italic>Foxo1</italic> overexpression was reported in cultured EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>), our data provide novel evidence of the impact of lower FoxO1 levels on endothelial metabolism and its consequences to whole-body homeostasis. It has become recently clear that endothelial metabolic activation represents an important feature of excessive angiogenesis, and that its repression holds therapeutic promise particularly within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schoors et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantelmo et al., 2016</xref>). Our study drives this concept from the opposite angle by highlighting the potential for induction of endothelial metabolic activity as an approach to overcome the impairments in adaptive capillary growth that prevail in obese individuals. In fact, our data strongly indicate that the metabolic endothelial adaptation seen in response to FoxO1 depletion results in beneficial expansion of microvascular EC content and prevents obesity-related disorders. The lack of additional influence of combined depletion of EC <italic>Foxo1</italic> and 3 with respect to expression of <italic>Pecam1</italic> and glycolytic pathway genes and glucose uptake reinforces FoxO1 as the dominant regulator of EC metabolic homeostasis. More importantly, these findings indicate FoxO1 as a central target for the manipulation of capillary EC response to obesity-induced conditions.</p><p>The finding that increased endothelial glycolysis induced by EC-FoxO1 depletion significantly impacts whole-body energy homeostasis is intriguing. Improvements in whole-body energy homeostasis subsequent to microvascular expansion have been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nwadozi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robciuc et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, these effects had been ascribed to the improved passive exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to parenchymal tissues due to the increased capillary EC surface area. Our findings add another dimension to the provocative idea that EC can actively impact metabolism at the tissue level by bringing to light the dynamic contribution of EC metabolic activity to whole-body energy homeostasis during obesity. Although currently available tools do not provide the resolution required for a quantitative in vivo assessment of glucose consumption specifically by microvascular EC, our data strongly suggest that increasing EC metabolic activity leads to increased glucose uptake from the circulation and thus positively influences systemic glucose usage and tolerance. In addition, several pieces of available knowledge provide support for our hypothesis. First, EC are uniquely positioned at the interface between the bloodstream and the tissue parenchymal cells, which provides them with preferential access to circulating metabolic substrates. Second, glucose uptake by these cells is mediated via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), an insulin-independent transporter that is widely recognized to regulate basal glucose disposal. Interestingly, a direct connection between endothelial GLUT1 level and whole-organ glucose metabolism under physiological conditions was reported in a mouse model of EC-<italic>Hif1a</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Third, EC are among the most abundant cell types in the human body, accounting for 2â7% of the total cell number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianconi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender et al., 2016</xref>), with the majority of these EC residing within capillaries. Therefore, it is plausible that the combined increase in EC metabolic activity with the expansion of capillary EC number can impact the overall systemic glucose homeostasis. The exact contribution of EC metabolism to whole-body substrate utilization, however, merits further investigation, as EC-FoxO1 depletion reprogrammed both metabolic activity and angiogenic responses of EC.</p><p>Beyond the remarkable effect that we observed on whole-body glucose metabolism, our findings support the notion that the substantial increase in vascular growth resulting from EC-FoxO1 depletion also impacted lipid handling under HF feeding conditions. In fact, HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice displayed lower adiposity and serum levels of triglycerides and glycerol and less lipid accumulation in the liver. Although this could constitute a direct consequence of vascular growth, as fatty acid oxidation is used to support de novo nucleotide synthesis in EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schoors et al., 2015</xref>), it is also likely to involve secondary compensatory effects triggered by sustained imbalances in global glucose homeostasis that result from increased EC metabolic activity.</p><p>A number of previous reports have shown that lower expression of EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> leads to disrupted vascular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furuyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sengupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dharaneeswaran et al., 2014</xref>), which seemingly contradicts the phenotype we observed. A significant part of this discrepancy may arise from differences in experimental design and approach. Those studies used Cre-deleter models (Tie2-Cre and Cdh5-Cre) that broadly affect all vascular beds (including lymphatic endothelium) beginning at an early embryonic stage and also exhibit substantial Cre recombinase activity within hematopoietic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, we employed a model of inducible EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion in adult mice, in which Cre activity was restricted to mature microvascular EC. Consistent with our findings, the induced depletion of EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> in newborn mice resulted in increased EC growth and vessel enlargement within mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wilhelm et al., 2016</xref>), although to a greater extent than the phenotype observed in our study. Interestingly, microvascular EC possess distinct tissue-specific molecular signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nolan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that EC-depletion of FoxO transcription factors can result in unique biological consequences in different tissue contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paik et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is likely that both the developmental stage and the tissue microenvironment contribute substantially to phenotype observed with EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion. These study-specific features emphasize that the methodological details need to be carefully considered in the interpretation of data from EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion and highlight that the impact of EC-depletion cannot necessarily be extrapolated to different tissue contexts.</p><p>Altogether, our study reveals that EC-FoxO1 depletion evokes increased glycolytic capacity of endothelial cells and enables microvascular expansion in conditions where an angiogenic stimulus is present, as exemplified by the capillary expansion seen in white adipose depots in HF-fed mice. The repercussions of these combined influences include profound improvements in white adipose tissue capacity to cope with the stimulus of sustained nutrient excess and systemic enhancement of glucose clearance. In conclusion, these effects clearly define FoxO1 as the major regulator of the EC response to HF diet through the repression of beneficial metabolic and angiogenic adaptations in response to the stimulus of nutrient excess. Finally, this study brings to light an unappreciated role of EC as a distinctive metabolic entity rather than a simple exchange interface and highlights the modulation of endothelial metabolic and angiogenic activity as a potential target in the treatment of obesity-related disturbances.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(M. musculus, <break/>FVB/n)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Foxo1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> <break/>(FVB-<italic>Foxo1<sup>tm1Rdp</sup></italic>)</td><td valign="top">From the <break/>laboratory of Dr <break/>Tara L.

By utilizing a tamoxifen-inducible EC-specific <italic>Foxo1</italic> knock-out mouse model, the authors demonstrate that upon high-fat diet, EC <italic>Foxo1</italic> elimination results in greater vascular growth in visceral white adipose tissue and healthier adipose tissue expansion, resulting in improved glucose intolerance.

We initially did not discuss findings from these papers for the sake of focus and brevity. However, we agree with the reviewers that the manuscript will benefit from added discussion of these points, which is included in the revised version of our manuscript. Importantly, we highlight a unifying emergent theme â that the influence of endothelial FoxO1 varies with context [developmental stage; tissue type; vessel type; presence of environmental stressors], and that these variations are unmasked through the use of a variety of experimental models and methodological approaches. We elaborate on this below.</p><p>Stage of development at the time of FoxO1 deletion in endothelial cells (EC) significantly influences outcomes:Whilst embryonic deletion of EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> (or global FoxO1) leads to lethality with apparent disruption of vascular organization (not EC differentiation),<sup>1-3</sup> post-natal conditional deletion of EC-FoxO1 is not lethal.<sup>4</sup> These contrasting phenotypes (lethal vs. not lethal) observed with the genetic manipulation of FoxO1 in EC reflect the disparate incidence of angiogenesis in pre- vs. postnatal life and are also consistent with differences in the process of embryonic/developmental angiogenesis compared to angiogenesis within adult tissues. Throughout embryogenesis, the entire organism undergoes active expansion, and all vasculature (macro and micro) likewise is stimulated to expand, remodel and specialize according to location in the vascular tree. In turn, at the adult stage, angiogenesis occurs only when stimulated, and only within selective locations of the vasculature. Since endothelial cells (EC) are considered to be quiescent in the adult, angiogenic growth is orchestrated by a selected subset of mature EC, which do not exhibit the functional plasticity observed in embryonic EC. Moreover, recent data suggest that capillary formation and expansion in the adult occurs by clonal expansion of mature endothelial cells<sup>5</sup> whereas random integration or cell mixing mediates developmental angiogenesis. All these differences ultimately impact how the vasculature expands at different stages. Importantly, the effects on cell morphology and sprouting and the poor responsiveness to VEGF and TGFÎ² in response to FoxO1 deletion reported by Furuyama et al.<sup>1</sup> and Matsukawa et al.<sup>6</sup> were observed with the use of embryonic stem cells, which exhibit some but not all characteristics of mature differentiated endothelial cells. These data were challenged by findings published by Paik et al.,<sup>7</sup> who demonstrated that the deletion of FoxO transcription factors in EC of adult mice can either increase their proliferative capacity enhancing the response to VEGF or show no detectable phenotypic alteration. Thus, while findings reported with embryonic stem cells provide some clue of the effects of FoxO1 in EC, caution should be applied in extrapolating these results to the phenotype of mature EC. Furthermore, the differential processes involved in neovascularization within embryonic and adult vasculature offer a plausible rationale for the distinct phenotypes observed with FoxO1 deletion and limit the extent of direct comparison that can be made between the two types of experimental models.</p><p>The tissue microenvironment is crucial in establishing the consequence of EC-FoxO1 deletion: It has been reported that organ-specific differences remarkably affect phenotypic features of EC when depletion of EC-FoxO transcription factors is induced in adult mice,<sup>7</sup> which is consistent with the current knowledge that microvascular EC show distinct molecular signatures within different tissues according to unique extravascular and intrinsic signals.<sup>8</sup> Thus, the microenvironment exerts substantial control over angiogenesis,<sup>9</sup> and tissues exhibit a range of angiogenic capacities at the adult stage. For example, in the absence of an added metabolic stimulus, skeletal muscle microvasculature in adult mice is very stable and angiogenic signals are minimal. Conversely, adipose tissue undergoes expansion through-out maturity as adipose depot size increases with age, and it produces a multitude of pro-angiogenic factors that help to coordinate capillary growth with tissue expansion. In this context and in agreement with the previous cited study,<sup>7</sup> data from our current paper (and prior study,<sup>10</sup> despite use of a different FoxO deletion strategy) provide strong evidence that these tissue environments affect the outcome of ECâ<italic>Foxo1</italic> deletion. Indeed, while EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> deletion exerted minimal phenotypic effects within skeletal muscle of normal chow-fed mice, increased vascular density was detectable in white adipose tissue of the same mice. In considering the study of Wilhelm et al.,<sup>4</sup> it is apparent that we observed some similar and some disparate phenotypic features of EC with <italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion. Of note, although the authors had used a similar inducible deletion model, they induced the deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> in newborn mice and assessed the effects of endothelial-specific depletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> specifically in retinal <italic>developmental</italic> angiogenesis. Consistent with their findings, we also observed more vessels and larger vessels in the adipose tissue vasculature when the deletion of <italic>Foxo1</italic> was induced in adult male mice. However, the more extensive disorganization of the vasculature observed by Wilhelm et al. but not in our study may be interpreted as the consequence of stronger stimulation of the EC by the potently pro-angiogenic environment within the maturing retina. Considering that those investigators closely tracked angiogenic processes within a narrow time window (i.e. 14-21 days) while we reported end-point vascular differences after 16 weeks of diet intervention, we cannot rule out the occurrence of alterations in endothelial cell sprouting/migration in our model. Our study was not designed to have the temporal resolution to assess those events, but it would be valuable to address this question in future investigations.</p><p>Differences between Cre deleter models used to elicit FoxO1 depletion: Importantly, the selection of Cre mouse model can lead to divergent phenotypes directly affecting the outcomes of EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion. Tie2-Cre and Cdh5-cre models used in Dharaneeswaran et al.<sup>3</sup> and Tanaka et al.<sup>11</sup> studies are widely employed to manipulate gene expression within the endothelium. However, both models show substantial Cre recombinase activity within hematopoietic lineages,<sup>12-14</sup> which can confound the analysis and interpretation of the resultant phenotype. In addition, as both promoters are active in all endothelial cell populations, these constitutively active endothelial Cre transgenic models, affect all vascular beds, including lymphatic vasculature<sup>15, 16</sup> beginning at an early embryonic stage being thus generally referred to as endothelial-specific knockout models. It is worth noting that in direct contradiction with previous studies,<sup>1, 2</sup> Tanaka et al<sup>11</sup> reported no lethality with embryonic EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> deletion and as the reviewers also highlighted their EC-specific <italic>Foxo1</italic> knockout mice âwere born at term in Mendelian ratios and showed no gross or metabolic abnormalities.â Strikingly, additional studies<sup>2, 3</sup> that also used the Tie2-cre deleter to target Foxo1 reported embryonic lethality at approximately E11.0. The discrepancies between these studies and the Tanaka et al. study can probably be attributed to the variable cre activity associated with this Cre model. Indeed, Heffner et al. demonstrated that âembryos from the same litter display very different levels of Cre excision, ranging from endothelial-specific to nearly ubiquitous in non-target tissues.â<sup>14</sup> In contrast with these previous studies, we did not use a constitutively active endothelial Cre transgenic model. Instead, the endothelial Cre/ERT2 model used in our study induces Cre recombinase activity at the adult stage (by nature of the timing of the tamoxifen-injection) under the control of the Platelet-derived growth factor B (<italic>Pdgfb</italic>) promoter.<sup>17</sup><italic>Pdgfb</italic> expression is observed in capillary endothelial cells and in the endothelium of growing arteries during embryonic development and is restricted to capillaries into the adult stages.<sup>18</sup> Therefore, the activation of <italic>Pdgfb</italic>-driven Cre recombinase activity at the adult stage favours the influence of genetic manipulation within capillaries not affecting all EC equally. As a consequence, the divergent pattern of Cre activity between our model and the Tie2 or Cadh5-deleter models<sup>3, 11</sup> also could contribute to the differences in phenotype observed by us compared to those studies.</p><p>Overall, through these examples, we hope to have made a case that a) we do have a strong awareness of preceding studies and how their results relate to our own investigation and b) differences in the methodological approaches/experimental models need to be carefully considered in the interpretation of data from EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion when comparing the findings of these previously published articles and our data. Finally, we also would like to emphasize that ours is the first report documenting the effect of EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion in adult male mice, uniquely assessing angiogenesis of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in the context of obesity. Overall, our study brings to light several novel concepts in vascular remodeling of these tissues in a pathophysiological context, which is relevant for understanding disease processes in the adult. While our answer to the reviewers has been extensive to justify our position, we have inserted a much briefer mention of these issues into the Discussion of the manuscript (seventh paragraph), as we share the reviewersâ point of view that it is beneficial to readers for us to explain differences in models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More functional evidence other than merely gene expression data is required to support the conclusion that EC depletion of Foxo1 promotes endothelial glycolytic capacity, such as utilizing measurements of glycolytic rates on a Seahorse.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added to the revised manuscript a new set of data to illustrate that EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion, as well as the inhibition of FoxO1 transcriptional activity, leads to increased glycolytic capacity of endothelial cells. For this experiment, we isolated microvascular endothelial cells from adipose tissue of adult male mice with EC-<italic>Foxo1</italic> depletion (EC-FoxO1 KD) fed a high-fat diet (HF) for 5 weeks. Due to the limited yield of cells obtained, we were not able to assess the glycolytic capacity of those cells measuring the extracellular acidification rate of cell medium by Seahorse analysis as suggested by the reviewers. As a surrogate approach to provide a functional read-out, we conducted matched measurements of glucose consumption and lactate production over time by measuring the lowering of glucose and the accumulation of lactate in the media over a 32 hour time window. In line with the data we provided before on fluorescent glucose uptake and lactate release, endothelial cells freshly isolated from adipose tissue of high fat-fed EC-FoxO1 KDmice displayed higher rates of glucose consumption than cells from floxed littermate controls. These findings were paralleled with increased lactate levels in the cell culture medium. These data argue in favor of increased glycolysis, the predominant bioenergetic pathway for ECs.<sup>19</sup> To complement these observations, we repeated the measurement of lactate levels of microvascular endothelial cells from skeletal muscle cultivated in high-glucose conditions treated with FoxO1 inhibitor (AS1842856) with several protocol modifications. In the originally submitted manuscript, lactate levels were measured in cell medium after endothelial cells were incubated with FoxO1 inhibitor for only 18 hours in high-glucose medium containing 10% FBS. This time, we pre-incubated the cells for 24 hours with FoxO1 inhibitor in high-glucose medium with 0.1% FBS for 24 hours. After this 24h-pretreatment, culture medium was replaced by high-glucose DMEM plus 10% dialyzed FBS and cells were incubated in the presence and absence of FoxO1 inhibitor for 32 hours and cell media was collected in different time points (0, 8, 24 and 32 hours) for the assessment of glucose and lactate levels. Consistent with the findings in endothelial cells with EC-FoxO1 KD, we detected increased rates of glucose consumption and lactate productions when FoxO1 transcriptional activity was inhibited. Finally, we analyzed cultured microvascular EC treated with FoxO1 inhibitor for 24 hours for protein levels of hexokinase 2 and PFKFB3, and observed an increase in protein that matched with their elevated gene expression. We have added these new data to the revised manuscript (Figure 7D-E, Figure 8F-I, and Figure 8K-L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that EC-Foxo1 depletion stimulates vascular growth during age-related adipose expansion (Figure 1) but no data are shown concerning the age-related adipose expansion (for example increased visceral adipose tissue mass normalized to body weight from week 0 to week 16 for each genetic background) and depletion of foxo1 is shown only at mRNA level.</p><p>Similarly, all data are originated from direct comparison between two different genetic backgrounds (floxed mice are derived from outbreeding of Foxo1, 3, 4ff mice with wild-type FVB/n mice, described to be resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity, and the genetic background of Pdgfb-creERT2 mice is not indicated) under high fat diet. Comparisons between diets (normal chow and high fat) in the same genetic backgrounds (including body weights, fat depot and muscle weights as well as metabolic parameters) will be more relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect to age-related adipose expansion: We thank for the reviewers for this observation. Because we did not conduct analyses of adipose depots at week 0 of the diet, we realize that we cannot directly comment on age-related adipose expansion. We have adjusted the wording in the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><p>With respect to FoxO1 depletion: We have added Western blots of capillaries segments freshly isolated from skeletal muscle of EC-FoxO1 KD mice and Control littermates to provide further evidence of the efficacy of FoxO1 deletion at the protein level. Protein level decreased by ~ 70%, indicating that the decrease in FoxO1 mRNA is representative of a loss of FoxO1 protein (Figure 1D).</p><p>With respect to mouse background: We realize that our description of the mouse strains was not sufficiently detailed, leading to misinterpretation. <italic>Foxo1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice are on an FVB background. The <italic>Pdgfb</italic>-iCreERT2 founder is on a C57BL/6 background. After cross-breeding these two mouse strains, subsequent generations were bred back to the <italic>Foxo1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> strain to obtain homozygosity for the floxed alleles. Litters were back-crossed to the <italic>Foxo1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> founder line for 3 generations prior to beginning experiments. It also is important to note that all experiments were conducted on littermates, sharing the identical genetic background. Littermate mice homozygous for the floxed <italic>Foxo1</italic> or <italic>Foxo1,3</italic> alleles but not expressing Cre recombinase were used as controls in our study. In our revised manuscript we have better described these details about the mice used in our study both in the Results and the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The lower adipocyte size described in Figure 4 may explain the greater microvascular content in Figure 2. The microvascular content must be expressed as capillary:adipocyte ratio as performed for muscle (Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewersâ concern and agree that the adipocyte size could confound the assessment of microvascular density within adipose tissue. To address this question, we have quantified capillary number in paraffinized sections of eWAT from HF-fed Control and EC-FoxO1 KDmice (same experimental group used in the whole-mount staining analyses). The obtained data further confirm our previous findings of increased vascular density in adipose tissue of HF-fed EC-FoxO1 KD mice and clearly showed that the phenotype described in the originally submitted manuscript is not secondary to smaller adipocyte size. These data have been included in the revised manuscript (Figure 3F-G).</p><p>ReferenceList:</p><p>1) Furuyama T, Kitayama K, Shimoda Y, Ogawa M, Sone K, Yoshida-Araki K, Hisatsune H, Nishikawa S, Nakayama K, Nakayama K, Ikeda K, Motoyama N, Mori N.
