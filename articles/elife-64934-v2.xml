threats for risk assessment and to avoid danger. The dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) controls defensive behaviors, but it is unknown how it represents states associated with threat approach and avoidance. We identified a dPAG threatavoidance ensemble in mice that showed higher activity farther from threats such as the open arms of the elevated plus maze and a predator. These cells were also more active during threat avoidance behaviors such as escape and freezing, even though these behaviors have antagonistic motor output. Conversely, the threat approach ensemble was more active during risk assessment behaviors and near threats. Furthermore, unsupervised methods showed that avoidance/approach states were encoded with shared activity patterns across threats. Lastly, the relative number of cells in each ensemble predicted threat avoidance across mice. Thus, dPAG ensembles dynamically encode threat approach and avoidance states, providing a flexible mechanism to balance risk assessment and danger avoidance.</p></abstract><kwd-group

be represented in neural activity (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salzman and Fusi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>). Such representations must be specific enough to differentiate across behaviors, yet general enough to maintain functional cohesion across diverse threatening situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>). A large body of evidence has shown that defensive behaviors related to threat exposure are represented in dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esteban Masferrer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), as dPAG activity correlates with escape and freeze. Additionally, dPAG optogenetic and electrical stimulation induce these behaviors, as well as aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandão et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, pharmacological manipulations of dPAG activity impact open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze (EPM), a traditional measure of rodent anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogaça et al., 2012</xref>). Lastly, PAG activity in humans correlates positively with threat imminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mobbs et al., 2010</xref>). These reports show that the dPAG is a central node orchestrating defensive responses.</p><p>However, it is unknown how the dPAG represents moment-to-moment changes in brain states during threat exposure. The two main behavioral states observed during exposure to threats are approach and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stankowich, 2019</xref>). In the approach state, animals voluntarily go near the threat and perform risk assessment behaviors. In this state, the exploratory risk evaluation drive is stronger than the motivation to avoid danger. By contrast, in the avoidance state, animals perceive high risk, and thus attempt to minimize exposure to danger by escaping, freezing, and maintaining distance to the threat. No reports to date have investigated whether the dPAG consistently encodes approach and avoidance states across distinct threats.</p><p>Key questions regarding the neural representation of approach and avoidance states remain unanswered. Do dPAG cells respond uniformly to transitions between higher and lower threat imminence? What is the overlap between the dPAG encoding of two completely distinct threats? Does dPAG neuronal activity encode moment-to-moment changes regarding defensive approach and avoidance states? Addressing these questions would require population-level analysis of dPAG cells recorded longitudinally across threat modalities. Here, we report experimental data and analyses that directly address these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We performed microendoscopic calcium imaging of dPAG neurons expressing GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2016</xref>) during EPM and rat exposure assays. During the EPM test, we recorded 107 ± 19 cells per mouse (<italic>n</italic> = 8 mice; 857 cells were imaged; see Materials and methods). As expected, mice spent more time in the closed arms of the EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). They also displayed exploratory head dips (average frequency of events = 27.0 ± 9.7; <italic>n</italic> = 8 mice) over the edges of the open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). During EPM exploration cells often showed preferential activity either in closed or open arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). To identify EPM arm-type modulated neurons, we defined an ‘arm score metric’ ranging from −1 to +1, in which the +1 indicates that cell activity in the open arm is greater than activity in the closed arm, and vice versa. The arm score distribution in the observed data is wider than expected by chance, indicating that dPAG cells show robust preference for EPM arm types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, left panel). We defined neurons as belonging to one of the ensembles if activity in each arm-type was significantly greater than the pooled activity in the opposite arm type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right panel, see Materials and methods). The results showed that cells fired similarly in arms of the same type, as cell activity in one open arm was highly correlated to activity in the other open arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, top panel). Conversely, cell activity in closed and open arms was negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, bottom panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) neuronal ensembles encode arm type in the elevated plus maze (EPM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens implantation, virus expression strategy, and example Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals of neurons in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG).

The EPM score is near +1 for cells that fire similarly in arms of the same type. For example, a cell that had high activity in both open arms and very low rate on both closed arms would have a score near 1. A cell with high activity in both closed arms and low activity in both open arms also would have a score near 1. Thus, both open and closed arm-preferring cells would have positive scores. A cell active uniformly in the environment would have a score near 0. A cell that fired differently in arms of the same type would have negative score, such as a cell that has high activity in one open arm and lower than mean activity in the other open arm.

During transitions between arms, we identified opposite changes in activity levels of these two major, non-overlapping populations of dPAG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). To ensure that positive results were not due to cell categorization itself, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C,G</xref>, cell categorization was done on training data and results were plotted for separate testing data (see Materials and methods). For example, the closed arm-activated ensemble showed a decrease in activity when mice traversed from a closed arm to an open arm. Moreover, open and closed cells showed increased and decreased activity, respectively, during exploratory head dip behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Aggregate activity of dPAG cells in the EPM did not show significantly higher activity in the open arms, showing that in the entire population, the closed and open cell patterns counterbalance each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, 95% of dPAG cells showed relatively low correlations of speed and neural activity, between −0.17 and +0.2. These results suggest that arm-related activity preferences are not driven by variations in velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Instead, if EPM arm type is prominently represented in dPAG ensemble activity, then it may be possible to use dPAG activation patterns to differentiate mouse location in the EPM.

An acceptable interpretation of EPM behavior is that mice avoid the open arms because they are more vulnerable to potential threats in open spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Montgomery, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>). This view suggests that the beginning of the open arms is only slightly threatening, as if a dangerous stimulus is detected the mouse can quickly retreat to the safety of the closed arms. Conversely, it takes a longer time for the mouse to retreat to the closed arms if they are at the extreme end of the open arms. Thus, we argue that distance from the center of the maze is related to a gradient of threat, with the highest threat levels at the end of the open arms. The animal’s behavior supports this view, as mice avoid the extreme end of the open arm more robustly than the beginning of the open arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore defined the EPM location index to be a linearly varying metric between −1 and +1 (at closed and open arms extremities, respectively), assigning 0 to the center of the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, see Materials and methods). We then fitted a linear regression model to predict the EPM location index from dPAG cell activity. Interestingly, the model showed significantly higher than chance performance in predicting EPM location index, suggesting that the identified dPAG ensembles may not only encode arm type, but rather a risk perception and threat exposure gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Though there are closed and open arm-preferring cells, aggregate bulk dPAG activity did not show different activation levels across EPM arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The above results show that the identified ensembles encode approach and avoidance toward the threatening locations in the EPM. To investigate whether dPAG population coding of approach-avoidance states generalizes to exploratory behavior across different threatening contexts, we recorded the same dPAG neurons during exposure to a live predator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mice were allowed to freely explore a context, a long chamber, in the presence of a rat, which was tethered with a harness to one end of the chamber (see Materials and methods). All behavioral data from synchronized videos underwent automated behavior scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>). Mice spent most of the trial away from the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating aversion from perceived threat. Consistent with previous threat imminence theories and the array of defensive behaviors evoked in the presence of a predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McNaughton and Corr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stankowich, 2019</xref>), mice presented defensive strategy repertoires composed of approach and avoidance-related behaviors (i.e., escape and freeze) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

A positive result would show that the ensembles are likely responding not only to the original sensory biases (i.e., closed and open arms features), but potentially representing behavioral states that generalize across threats. Indeed, open cells showed higher activation than closed cells near the rat even though all cell types were positively activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). These data agree with reports showing dPAG activation with predator proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esteban Masferrer et al., 2020</xref>). The present results also showed that proximity to a live predator activated the neither cell ensemble. As the relatively low threat open arms did not significantly activate it, this ensemble of neurons may require a higher degree of threat to be activated relative to open cells.</p><p>Closed cells showed increased activity following onset of both escape and freeze, despite these behaviors having opposite motor outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). Additionally, even though freezing and approach onset occur similarly far from the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), open and closed ensembles showed opposite activity patterns and different generalized linear model (GLM) weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). The freezing data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> excludes freeze bouts that happened within 10 s of an escape. Thus, the activity patterns plotted during freezing cannot be attributed to slow decay induced by escapes. Rat movement onset likely constitutes a threat signal and switches states from approach to avoidance, as predator movement is indicative of increased threat imminence. Indeed, rat movement is a significant predictor variable for less frequent approach and more occurrences of threat avoidance-related behaviors, such as escape and freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Interestingly, rat movement bouts are not consistently directed toward the mouse, as it most often increases distance toward the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>). Nevertheless, rat movements predict escape and freezing, indicating it is perceived as a threat by the mouse. Accordingly, after rat movement onset, the threat avoidance-related closed arm ensembles displayed higher activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–J</xref>). Notably, neither of the ensembles consistently resembled the overall average dPAG activity during rat exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), as each ensemble had its own functional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Furthermore, dPAG cells also used shared patterns of neural activity across rat and EPM assays to represent threat imminence (measured as distance to threat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, see Materials and methods). These results suggest that dPAG neuronal activity can represent internal brain states using shared patterns of activity across different threats.</p><p>An approach state is associated with open arm entries, head dips in the EPM, and proximity to threat. Conversely, an avoidance state would be expected far away from threats and during actions that decrease threat exposure, such as closed arm exploration, escape, and freezing. Our results showed that closed cells were more active during higher distance from threat and threat avoidance-related behaviors, such as freezing and escaping, while open cells were more active during proximity to threats and exploratory head dips in the EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The consistency of these results across behaviors and two different threat modalities indicates that dPAG closed and open cells were encoding threat avoidance and threat approach states, respectively.</p><p>To further investigate how dPAG cells use a shared representation to encode approach and avoidance states, we developed an avoidance/approach score ranging between −1 and 1 (see Materials and methods). The score gradually increases during approach to threat and during EPM head dips, reaching +1 when the mouse is adjacent to the rat or in the extreme end of the open arms. The score decreases when the mouse is retreating from threat and is assigned a value of −1 when the mouse is furthest from the rat, freezing, or in the extreme end of the closed arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To investigate how the avoidance/approach score is encoded in dPAG activity, we used <italic>k</italic>-means clustering, an unsupervised approach, to group the data points into clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, panel 1). We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the optimal number of clusters for each assay, which were two clusters for EPM and three for the rat assay (see the Materials and methods section entitled ‘<italic>k</italic>-Means clustering of neural data’; see also AIC values for a range of cluster numbers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then calculated the avoidance/approach score for each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, panel 2). The clusters with the lowest and highest scores were classified as the ‘avoidance’ and the ‘approach’ cluster, respectively. Experimentally observed approach and avoidance clusters respectively had higher and lower scores than sampling distributions obtained from permuted behavioral labels, showing that our <italic>k</italic>-means approach identified activity patterns that strongly encode the avoidance/approach score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The approach and avoidance cluster centroids from one assay were then applied to the other assay (i.e., centroids were defined by training on EPM and applied on previously unseen data from the rat assay, or vice versa). Cluster centroids defined from the training data in one assay were applied to the data from the other assay to assign cluster identity based on shortest Euclidean distance to the centroid. For example, the points in the testing dataset that were closest to the avoidance centroid, previously defined by the training dataset, were assigned to the avoidance cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, panels 3–4). Scores for approach and avoidance clusters for shuffled data were used to create a sampling distribution. Lastly, we show that approach and avoidance clusters trained on one assay and applied on the other assay result in significantly different scores, despite the two assays having different geometries and distinct threat modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Importantly, these results were not found when computing approach and avoidance cluster centroids defined on the control toy rat assay but applied to the rat assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicate, using an unsupervised method, that approach and avoidance states are encoded using shared patterns of neural activity across assays. Similar results were also obtained by employing a hidden Markov model (HMM), showing that the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> can be found using a diversity of computational approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Importantly, dPAG activity reflects moment-to-moment changes in the behavioral states of the animal. Rather than merely encoding the defensive behavior movements, these activity patterns may indicate threat perception. Encoding of exploratory and defensive behavior has also been reported in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that multiple defensive nodes represent such brain states.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) displays a shared neural representation of avoidance and approach states across the elevated plus maze (EPM) and rat exposure assays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example tracks in the EPM (left) and rat exposure assay (right), color-coded by avoidance/approach score (see Materials and methods).

Rat approach and open arm exploration were correlated across mice, indicating that these measures also reflected trait avoidance levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We then found that mice with a higher proportion of open cells in relation to closed cells displayed increased avoidance of open arms and rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>). A possible interpretation for these results is that, rather than causing open arm exploration, the open arm ensemble is highly responsive to risk assessment and proximity to threat. Considering this hypothesis, our results suggest that mice with more open arm cells display an increased sensitivity to risk evaluation reflected on increased avoidance of threat. These data indicate that in addition to encoding moment-to-moment changes in behavioral state, dPAG ensembles composition may integrate risk evaluation processes and influence individual mouse differences in threat avoidance traits.</p><p>The dPAG’s role in defense has been described as restricted to the initiation of escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). A proposed model is that excitatory neurons initiate escape (but not other defensive behaviors) in response to imminent threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, optogenetically stimulating vglut2-positive cells in dPAG caused escape and presenting looming stimuli while optogenetically inhibiting those cells caused freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, threat information would be transmitted to the dPAG, resulting in initiation of escape and inhibition of freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lefler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tovote et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent data indicate that the dPAG’s influence on defense is not restricted to escape initiation. For example, optogenetic activation of dPAG CaMKIIα-positive neurons can cause both escape and freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). Increasing the optogenetic stimulation frequency of CaMKIIα-positive dPAG neurons switches responses from freezing to escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). Supporting the view that the dPAG may promote freezing, activation of excitatory ventromedial hypothalamus projections to the dPAG induces freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, the hypothalamic dorsal premammillary nucleus projections to the dPAG control escape elicited by numerous innate threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Recent work shows that the medial prefrontal cortex promotes aversion and might regulate defensive strategies through projections to the dPAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). These findings indicate that through different inputs, the dPAG may integrate distinct aspects of emotional states, detect diverse threats, and coordinate a range of defensive responses, including freezing and escape.</p><p>We propose that when the subject can voluntarily approach the threat, the dPAG has a broader function in threat processing. It may then function as a risk estimator that represents approach- and avoidance-related states, and consequently influences a wide range of behaviors related to both approach and avoidance. In contrast, there are situations in which threats appear independently of voluntary approach, such as during the presentation of looming stimuli. In such cases, approach cannot be assessed as only avoidance behaviors such as freezing and escape are possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salay et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, these situations only allow assessing the dPAG’s involvement in avoidance, but not approach-related states.</p><p>Our study reveals novel features of dPAG neurons. First, dPAG cells differentiated between open and closed spaces in the EPM. Second, we show that closed cell activity patterns were positively correlated with threat perception represented by the predator’s movement. Furthermore, despite having opposite motor outputs, escape and freezing correlated with increased closed cell activity. Conversely, open cell activity was inversely correlated with distance to threat. Closed and open cells show positive z-scored activity following escape onset. However, open cell activity starts decreasing following escape onset, while closed cell activity increases after flight initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Thus, our data highlight the importance of considering activity dynamics rather than only analyzing if cells display high or low activity during a behavior. Our observations suggest that dPAG is not simply a premotor area but rather reflects the subjects’ underlying emotional state, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carvalho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kincheski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nashold et al., 1969</xref>). This idea is consistent with the fact that dPAG activity represented location within the EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and that the dPAG used shared patterns of neural activity across rat and EPM assays to represent threat imminence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>) and behavioral states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The finding that the dPAG uses a conserved representation of threat approach and avoidance across assays expands prior results using stimulation, calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and c-fos expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittencourt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandão et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canteras and Goto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esteban Masferrer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). A role beyond motor output execution has also been proposed for the ventral PAG, as its neural activity reflects threat probability associated with specific cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright and McDannald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wright et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A possible mechanistic explanation for the differences between open and closed ensembles is that they might correspond to specific neural populations integrating different neurotransmitter systems with particular modulatory effects over defensive behaviors (e.g., glutamate, GABA, substance P, nitric oxide, etc.). Alternatively, these ensembles may have distinct input connectivity, leading to distinct activity patterns. Based on its connectivity, the dPAG is well positioned to have a privileged role in computing threat imminence and threat probability, as it receives input from sensory, limbic, and cognitive areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Silva and McNaughton, 2019</xref>), and projects not only to centers that control motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira-Pinto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marchand and Hagino, 1983</xref>) but also to prosencephalic targets likely to mediate fear behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krout and Loewy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motta et al., 2017</xref>). Future studies are needed to further dissect dPAG cell types based on genetic markers, connectivity, and functional differences. In summary, our study reveals two large functional neuronal ensembles of the dPAG representing internal states. By performing population-level analysis of dPAG neurons in two different threatening situations, we were able to demonstrate that dPAG cells are not only encoding specific behaviors or threat imminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esteban Masferrer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), but also that dPAG ensemble activity reflects moment-to-moment changes in the approach-avoidance state of the animal. These findings expand on the oversimplified view of dPAG as a premotor output region and highlight it as a key node reflecting the internal brain states that prepare the organism to engage in approach or avoidance of threat.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Long-Evans</td><td valign="top">Charles River Labs</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD-631593">RGD-631593</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40</td><td valign="top">Addgene</td><td valign="top">100843-AAV9</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">Mathworks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) of the C57BL/6J strain (Jackson Laboratory stock No. 000664) were used for all experiments.

This approach ensured that only large predator movements were used, rather than minor changes in position, such as small rat tail movements. If multiple rat movements occurred within 5.33 s of each other, only the first was used for analysis. Rat movement direction was measured with respect to the position of the mouse at movement initiation. A 0-degree movement was toward the mouse’s initial position and a 180-degree movement was away from the mouse’s initial position; 90- and 270-degree movements were sideways from the mouse’s initial position.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Categorization of open, neither, and closed arm-preferring cells</title><p>A cell was categorized as an open arm-preferring cell if activity in each individual open arm was significantly greater than the pooled activity in the closed arms (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p&lt;0.05).

Results presented use interleaved training and testing data. This method was implemented using PyTorch.</p></sec><sec id="s3-23"><title>CoCA significance testing</title><p>In order to test if correlations of testing data were better than expected by chance, correlations were computed between projected behavioral data (using weights fit by training data) and random projections of neural data (1000 trials). We emphasize that these correlations were applied to the testing data, and therefore it was possible for a random projection to have higher correlation than the CoCA projection. A one-tailed test was used (p&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s3-24"><title>Avoidance/approach score</title><p>To calculate the continuous avoidance/approach score for each assay, the distance from safety was calculated (rat: distance from the safe wall; EPM: distance from the end of the closed arm) and normalized such that it ranged from 0 to 1 in the rat assay and 0 to 0.9 in the EPM assay. A binarized direction value was also assigned to each timepoint, indicating if the mouse was moving toward (+1) or away from (−1) the threat. To incorporate categorized behaviors, the avoidance/approach score for freeze samples equaled the minimum score of −1. For the EPM only, the avoidance/approach score was multiplied by 1.11 for head dip samples, such that a head dip at the end of the open arm would yield the maximum score of 1.</p><p>To calculate the score at each timepoint:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>While approaching threat, avoidance/approach score = distance to safety × direction</p></list-item><list-item><p>While avoiding threat: avoidance/approach score = [1−distance to safety] × direction</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s3-25"><title><italic>k</italic>-Means clustering of neural data</title><p>To determine if the avoidance/approach score is represented in the neural data, the <italic>k</italic>-means algorithm was used to cluster this data in an unsupervised manner. One of the simplest unsupervised classification algorithms, this approach identifies groupings of activity that are strongly represented in the neural data, without providing any additional information about animal behavior. If behavior then shows a significant relationship to these clusters, it is clearly represented as a prominent network motif.</p><p>For each assay, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was calculated, which balances both the fit of the data (log-likelihood) and the model complexity, resulting in an optimal number of clusters that reasonably fit the data but are not too numerous. To measure AIC for <italic>k</italic>-means, we assumed the clusters were Gaussian-distributed with identity covariance matrices. The formula was as follows:<disp-formula id="equ11"><mml:math id="m11"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where RSS is the residual sum of squares, <italic>M</italic> is the dimensionality of the dataset, and <italic>K</italic> is the number of clusters.</p><p>For each implementation of <italic>k</italic>-means, clusters were identified using 10 different randomized initializations; the set with the minimum sum of Euclidean distances was used. The approach and avoidance clusters then identified, for each session, as those with, respectively, the highest and lowest mean avoidance/approach scores. The overall mean avoidance/approach scores for approach and avoidance clusters were then calculated across mice. To determine if these approach and avoidance cluster scores were statistically significant, the actual mean was compared to a sampling distribution of means, calculated in an identical manner with permuted behavioral labels over 100 iterations. If the approach and avoidance score means were respectively greater than or less than 95% of this sampling distribution, they were considered significant. For the training/testing analysis, <italic>k</italic>-means was implemented on one assay as described above (the training assay), using only cells that co-registered between both assays. The cluster centroids identified in the training assay were then used to categorize approach and avoidance samples in the withheld testing assay. The mean avoidance/approach score was calculated for all approach and avoidance timepoints, across all training or testing sessions.</p><p>In a similar way, avoidance/approach states were identified by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs (4 states), using the top principal components of the neural data as input (accounting for ≥ 60% of the total variance). Similar to <italic>k</italic>-means, this approach finds ‘hidden states’ or states represented by the neural data in an unsupervised manner; unlike <italic>k</italic>-means, HMMs additionally consider the sequentiality of the neural data. The parameters of the HMM were found via expectation maximization. These states were analyzed in an identical manner to the <italic>k</italic>-means clusters described above.

Unless otherwise noted, all statistical comparisons were performed by either nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum or signed-rank tests. With the exception of CoCA significance testing, all significance tests were two-tailed. Standard error of the mean was plotted in each figure as an estimate of variation of the mean. Correlations were calculated using Pearson’s method. Multiple comparisons were corrected with the false discovery rate method.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Philip Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel (Reviewer #2); Jonathan Fadok (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript looks at how dPAG neurons represent threat approach and avoidance using the elevated plus maze and a live rat exposure situation. The data show that the dPAG populations split in terms of avoidance and approach when the mice are exposed to the EPM. These populations correspond to threat approach and avoidance in the live rat procedure. Machine learning algorithms further show support for the generalization of neural representation of threat approach and avoidance across procedures. The paper uses established behavioral methods as well as state-of-the-art neural methods and analyses. It presents a thorough examination of dPAG activity in threat exposure tasks. Although the study of the dPAG in these tasks has been reported in the past (e.g., Deng et al., 2016, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4425-15.2016; Masberrer et al., 2020, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0761-18.2020), which limits the novelty of the present paper, relating the open-closed sensory states to threatening states in the live rat study is a nice development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The existing data mostly supports the main conclusions of the paper and I do not think added experimentation is needed. However, there are some concerns:</p><p>1. Concerns about the analyses, interpretation and representation of the data:</p><p>a. An argument is made in terms of threat and operationalized as a threat score and dPAG activity. However, this threat score seems to be determined where in the EPM the mouse is and has nothing to do with perception of threat derived from a behavioural response. So, if differential dPAG neurons fire to open vs closed arms in the EPM, then it seems hardly surprising that there would be a correlations between the 'threat score' and neural activity. What is more the threat score is more related to distance from centre as opposed to any actual threat. The latter is inferred. Correlation with head dip may be a better examination.</p><p>b. Cells were defined by their bias in firing patterns in open vs closed arms, which was then used to predict animal location. It would be more compelling if cell classification was determined using separate portions of the session than that used for prediction (akin to way training and testing is separated for SVM) to avoid circularity.</p><p>c. Emphasis is placed on how activity patterns are shared between incompatible behaviours such as freezing and escape, both of which are reactions to threat. While this might suggest threat-coding, it may also be the case that shared activity are an artifact of the slow kinetics of GCaMP6s coupled with these behaviours occurring in close temporal proximity to each other. Is there any evidence that the same patterns of activity are observed when the potential contribution of other behaviours are factored out? Perhaps GLM could be used to isolate event-related activity kernels.</p><p>d. For Figure 2D, define what is meant by strong correlation. What is the threshold?</p><p>e. Please include the EPM aggregate activity heatmap for all cells, as is reported for the REA in Figure 3C.</p><p>f. Is the overall activity bias near the rat in Figure 3C driven by novel threat preference in previously 'neither' cells, reduced activation of closed cells near the safe wall, or increased activation of open cells near the rat (relative to activity during EPM)?</p><p>g. The data in Figure 3-S3A do not appear to match the data Figures 3C and 3F and therefore are not representative.</p><p>h. The increased z-score to rat movement by closed-arm cells in Figure 3I-J is inconsistent with the interpretation that these neurons reflect threat proximity, since the threat is moving closer to the mouse and these cells are inhibited in proximity to threat in other scenarios. The data are better explained by the activity representing the mouse's state on the exploratory-defensive continuum.</p><p>i. There should be a zoomed-out image of PAG histology showing the spread of the GCaMP expression and the lens placement.</p><p>2. Methods. Methods should be written rigorously enough to promote reproducibility. Some specific questions are included below, but the authors should ensure that they provide a thorough account of the methods used.</p><p>a. Lack of clarity regarding shuffling and bootstrapping. It is unclear whether the authors are in fact applying bootstrapping (resampling from dataset with replacement) or another analysis method such as permutation tests (randomly relabelling cases). Please clarify and provide more details within Methods.</p><p>b. k = 10 seems arbitrary. It would be useful to know the relative strength of k = 2-10+ clusters (e.g. table of mean and minimum silhouette values) to confirm k = 10 is sensible.</p><p>c. The behavioural timeline, methods and procedures were confusing. More detail and clarity need to be provided in the Methods. This should account for the differential number of animals in the EPM and REA. Further, it was unclear when habituation took place.</p><p>d. Is the threat score binary (+1 or -1) or is it bounded by -1 to +1, with values in between? If that latter, how are values in between calculated? A liner a relationship is assumed between threat and distance travelled, which seems appropriate for the open arm but perhaps more uniformly low throughout the closed arms.</p><p>3. Discussion.</p><p>a. A discussion of the results and how they fit into the larger body of PAG literature is necessary.</p><p>b. The significance of the neither cells being activated in the REA.</p><p>c. Any insight the authors may have into the circuit or physiological differences of the two populations.</p><p>d. A discussion of the counterintuitive finding that a greater relative ratio of open:closed neurons correlates with less time in the open arm and threat approach.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dorsal Periaqueductal gray ensembles represent approach and avoidance states&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mihaela D Iordanova as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Philip Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel (Reviewer #2); Jonathan Fadok (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the paper was greatly improved with the inclusion of necessary additions to methods, improvements to language, and addressing concerns around circular analyses and overlapping behaviour-related activity. The change in the semantics from EPM threat score to EPM location index was welcomed, although whether there is a linear gradient of threat in EPM remains up for debate. Some questions remain over the concerns raised previously. These are specified below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Justification regarding the choice of 10 clusters has not been adequately addressed. A good solution would be to show that mean and minimum silhouette values for k = 10 is positive and higher/comparable to the range of other k-means solutions. This can be presented in a supplementary table. This is important because it goes a long way towards showing that the choice in clusters was valid. Currently the justification in the paper is not adequate and does not address why k=10 was chosen, rather is focused on why k=2 was not a good choice.</p><p>2. The added point that rat movements did not generally decrease distance to the mouse needs clarification. Did the increased distance between rat and mouse include movement made by the mouse? Given rat movement precipitates mouse escape, the increased distance is potentially due to mouse escape, not the rat moving away? Separately, was there a reason a 2 sec window was chosen? Rat movements towards the mouse followed by retreat (e.g. due to constrained movement) would easily elapse within 2secs, and be registered as movements away despite the mouse likely perceiving/responding to the advance. All relevant details about measuring rat movement should be included in Methods.</p><p>3. For variance thresholding, if this was performed per experimental session, were there cells that had high variance in one assay but low variance (and were thus excluded) in another assay? This would inflate the apparent degree of cross-assay coding. Details, i.e., a statement or Venn diagram, explaining how many cells were excluded on basis of EPM alone, REA alone, or both would be pertinent. If the number excluded on basis of only one assay is substantial, the text should acknowledge the impact this likely has on apparent cross-assay coherence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64934.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The existing data mostly supports the main conclusions of the paper and I do not think added experimentation is needed.

Here, location is defined as a binary value, as the maze was divided into two locations (open and closed arms).</p><p>Our next analysis, in Figure 2F-G, shows dPAG activity can be used to predict not just which arm type the mouse is in, but where within that arm the mouse is. Is the mouse located in the beginning of the open arm (near the center) or is it in the end of the open arm? For this analysis the location of the mouse was not defined by a binary value (closed vs open), but with the Threat score, which is a continuous variable, corresponding to -1 in the end of the closed arms, 0 in the center and +1 in the end of the open arms. We created the EPM threat score to correlate neural activity with a continuous, non-binary, definition of mouse position. Figure 2F-G shows that dPAG neural activity does not simply encode arm type (as shown in 2E), but also finer grained location within an arm.</p><p>We believe this suggestion arose due to the name “EPM threat score”. This name suggests that the metric is directly reflecting threat, when in reality we simply used it as a number to describe the position of the mouse within the maze. We apologize for this misunderstanding, and thus have changed the name of the metric to “EPM location index”. We have altered the manuscript to remove any text that could indicate to the reader that this score is directly measuring threat.</p><p>The reason we investigated if the animal represents continuously varying locations within an arm type is because we believe that different locations within the open arm are more or less aversive, with the end of the open arms being the most aversive location in the maze. Our justification for this view is explained below.</p><p>As the reviewers correctly point out, the EPM location index is fully determined by the animal’s position in the maze, and as such this metric does not directly represent threat perception or behavioral response. However, we disagree that the location index has ‘nothing to do with perception of threat’. Regions of the maze with higher location index are correlated with higher avoidance, which is a behavioral response dictated by threat perception. Even within the open arms, mice avoid the regions with larger positive scores (corresponding to the end of the open arms) more than the regions with small positive scores, which are located in the beginning of the open arms, near the center of the maze. This behavioral gradient of avoidance within the open arms strongly indicates that the animal likely perceives higher threat in the extreme end of the open arms than in the beginning of the open arms. The most common interpretation of plus maze behavior is that mice avoid the open arms because they are more vulnerable to potential threats in open locations. This aversion facilitates thigmotaxis, a tendency to be close to vertical surfaces (i.e. closed arms). This view suggests that the beginning of the open arms are only slightly threatening, as if a dangerous stimulus is detected the mouse can quickly retreat to the safety of the closed arms. Conversely, it takes a longer time for the mouse to retreat to the closed arms if they are at the extreme end of the open arm. Thus, we argue that distance from the center of the maze is related to a gradient of threat, with the highest threat levels at the end of the open arms. The animal’s behavior supports this view, as mice avoid the extreme end of the open arm more robustly than the beginning of the open arm. We now include data showing that behavioral avoidance varies even within an arm type (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B), providing a stronger justification to investigate if dPAG cells represent finer-grained locations within an arm and discuss it in the text.</p><p>Although we support the interpretation that distance from center is a metric related to EPM aversiveness, we do not claim in the text that the EPM location index is directly reflecting threat perception or behavior, and we only used the EPM location index as a continuous, non-binary, metric to describe mouse location in the maze. Lastly, as mentioned above we changed the name of this score to “EPM location index” to avoid confusion.</p><p>It is unclear to us how to implement the Reviewer’s suggestion of using ‘head dips’ instead of the threat score. Head dips cannot be used as a gradual continuous metric of location within the maze.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Cells were defined by their bias in firing patterns in open vs closed arms, which was then used to predict animal location. It would be more compelling if cell classification was determined using separate portions of the session than that used for prediction (akin to way training and testing is separated for SVM) to avoid circularity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this suggestion, and have therefore recalculated the results in Figure 2A-C, G to use the first 40% of each session for cell categorization and the last 60% for quantitative analyses. We altered the text and Methods to identify this. Interesting, we see similar results to before, indicating that cell responses to arm transitions and location in the EPM are robust during a session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Emphasis is placed on how activity patterns are shared between incompatible behaviours such as freezing and escape, both of which are reactions to threat. While this might suggest threat-coding, it may also be the case that shared activity are an artifact of the slow kinetics of GCaMP6s coupled with these behaviours occurring in close temporal proximity to each other. Is there any evidence that the same patterns of activity are observed when the potential contribution of other behaviours are factored out? Perhaps GLM could be used to isolate event-related activity kernels.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that was not addressed in the original submission. We thank the Reviewer for this question. In the rat assay the mouse is initially placed far from the rat. The mouse spends most of the time far from the rat, but sometimes it slowly approaches the rat, and then escapes in high velocity back to the safety of the opposite side of the chamber. After reaching the safer side, the mouse often displays many freezing bouts. Thus, freezing tends to occur after escaping. The analysis showed that the transition probability from freezing to escape is much lower than escape to freezing (0.01 and 0.61 respectively, n=44 mice). Thus, freezing tends to happen after escape (but escape rarely happens immediately after freezing).</p><p>As a consequence, it is possible that the freeze-related activity we identify could reflect slowly decaying GCaMP activity from a prior recent escape, rather than new “de novo” activity induced by freezing. To account for this confound, we calculated freeze bout-triggered activity traces excluding all freezes that happen within 10 seconds from an escape. These data show that even when excluding potentially confounding escape-related activity prior to freezing, closed cells and open cells show respective increases and decreases in activity during freezing (new Figure 3, panels D and E; I and J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. For Figure 2D, define what is meant by strong correlation. What is the threshold?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not defining ‘strong’. We did not wish to create a binary distinction between cells with strong and weak correlation. Rather, we intended to emphasize that speed cannot explain the arm-type preference displayed by dPAG cells. We altered the text to read “Importantly, 95% of dPAG cells showed relatively low correlations of speed and neural activity, between -0.17 and +0.2. These results suggest that arm-related activity preferences are not driven by variations in velocity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Please include the EPM aggregate activity heatmap for all cells, as is reported for the REA in Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this new analysis as requested and added it to the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Aggregate dPAG does not show differential activation in closed and Open arms, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Is the overall activity bias near the rat in Figure 3C driven by novel threat preference in previously 'neither' cells, reduced activation of closed cells near the safe wall, or increased activation of open cells near the rat (relative to activity during EPM)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the opportunity to address this important question. We show in Figure 3F that all three cell types are more active near the rat than far from it. However, consistent with their activity patterns in the EPM, open cells show significantly higher activation near the rat than closed cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. The data in Figure 3-S3A do not appear to match the data Figures 3C and 3F and therefore are not representative.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. We now updated Figure 3-S3A to show representative examples of open and closed cells respectively displaying increases and decreases in activity as the mouse approaches the rat. This same result is shown averaged across cell ensembles in Figure 3G.</p><p>Figure 3C shows that dPAG cells in general (without separating into closed and open cells) are more active near the rat. This result is independent of the example individual heat maps for closed and open cells in Figure 3-S3A, and thus is not in disagreement (or agreement) with 3-S3A. Different results can be found when separating the cells into closed and open ensembles compared to pooling all cells together.</p><p>If the explanation above is not satisfactory, we ask the Reviewer to please explain in more detail what the discrepancy is between 3-S3A and 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. The increased z-score to rat movement by closed-arm cells in Figure 3I-J is inconsistent with the interpretation that these neurons reflect threat proximity, since the threat is moving closer to the mouse and these cells are inhibited in proximity to threat in other scenarios. The data are better explained by the activity representing the mouse's state on the exploratory-defensive continuum.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explaining more clearly the rat movement metric. As stated in the paper, the rat is constrained in its movement by a harness, which only allows it to move in a restricted area. Thus, for the most part, the rat cannot significantly change the distance to the mouse by moving. We now added a new panel in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 (panel B) showing that proximity to the rat does not generally increase during rat movements. The rat movement bouts are mostly changes from one resting position to another, or exploratory sniffing towards the walls, and may be in any direction. The rats were screened for low aggressiveness prior to their use, and consequently rat movement is very rarely motion towards the mouse, and the rat never displayed any attacking bouts.</p><p>Even though rat motions are not directed towards the mouse, the mouse tends to react to rat movements as sign of increased threat, and thus rat movement predicts decreased approach to rat, and increased escape and freezing (Figure 3-S4). These data show that rat movement is predictive of increased defensive behaviors such as escape and freezing. We argue that closed cells are more activated during threat-avoidance related defensive behaviors (i.e., escape and freezing). Consequently, it is expected that rat movement (which is a stimulus that provokes more escape and freezing) should be positively correlated with increases in closed cell activity.</p><p>Nevertheless, we strongly agree with the Reviewer’s view that the data is well explained by changes in the “exploratory-defensive continuum”. This continuum is reflected in both behavioral and non-behavioral features. Higher defensive states are displayed during increased threat perception, and one of the metrics influencing threat perception is threat distance, while another is movement of the predator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i.

A discussion of the results and how they fit into the larger body of PAG literature is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out by the Reviewers earlier, prior papers have recorded dPAG activity during threat exposure.

The significance of the neither cells being activated in the REA.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation of these data is that the neither ensemble may require a higher amount of threat to be activated.

A discussion of the counterintuitive finding that a greater relative ratio of open:closed neurons correlates with less time in the open arm and threat approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results are very similar to the one previously reported by Jimenez et al., 2018 in Neuron (“Anxiety Cells in a Hippocampal-Hypothalamic Circuit”). In that paper the authors identify ventral hippocampal cells that are preferentially active in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Increased open arm activity was correlated with decreased open arm exploration and inhibition of the ventral hippocampus (which would result in inhibition of these open arm cells) increased open arm exploration. Thus, both this published result in the hippocampus as well as our dPAG result suggest that increased activity of open arm cells is correlated with decreased open arm exploration.</p><p>In our view, a possible interpretation for these results is that rather than causing open arm exploration, open arm ensemble is highly responsive to risk-assessment and proximity to threat. Considering this hypothesis, the present results suggest that mice with more open arm cells display an increased sensitivity to risk-evaluation reflected on increased avoidance of threat. We now added text discussing our interpretation of this result.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Justification regarding the choice of 10 clusters has not been adequately addressed. A good solution would be to show that mean and minimum silhouette values for k = 10 is positive and higher/comparable to the range of other k-means solutions. This can be presented in a supplementary table. This is important because it goes a long way towards showing that the choice in clusters was valid. Currently the justification in the paper is not adequate and does not address why k=10 was chosen, rather is focused on why k=2 was not a good choice.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the Reviewers' concern regarding our choice of cluster number, we have added Figure 4—figure supplement 1, which depicts the mean (+/- s.e.m.) Akaike information criterion (AIC) for 2 to 10 clusters. The AIC score is a standard hyperparameter and model selection metric in machine learning. We chose the AIC compared to silhouette values because the AIC score prioritizes model fit and complexity, rather than cluster consistency. The AIC measures the log likelihood minus a model complexity term that reflects the number of model parameters. The AIC therefore balances both the fit of the data (log-likelihood) and the model complexity, resulting in an optimal number of clusters that fit the data reasonably but are not too numerous. To measure AIC for k-means, we assumed the clusters were Gaussian distributed with identity covariance matrices.</p><p>This supplemental figure shows that the data is best fit by a k-means model with 2 clusters for the EPM assay and either 2 or 3 clusters for the rat exposure assay, due to their significantly lower AIC than other tested values of <italic>k</italic>.</p><p>We thus no longer use 10 clusters, and instead updated Figure 4C-D and Figure 4-2 with the optimized <italic>k</italic> values mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The added point that rat movements did not generally decrease distance to the mouse needs clarification. Did the increased distance between rat and mouse include movement made by the mouse? Given rat movement precipitates mouse escape, the increased distance is potentially due to mouse escape, not the rat moving away? Separately, was there a reason a 2 sec window was chosen? Rat movements towards the mouse followed by retreat (e.g. due to constrained movement) would easily elapse within 2secs, and be registered as movements away despite the mouse likely perceiving/responding to the advance. All relevant details about measuring rat movement should be included in Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The distance presented did not include movement by the mouse and was relative to the mouse's position at the start of movement. Consequently events categorized as increasing rat to mouse distance are due to the rat moving away from the mouse, rather than due to the mouse escaping.</p><p>We added a polar plot displaying the angle of all rat movements relative to the mouse (Author response image 2 and also Figure 3, figure supplement 4C). An angle of zero corresponds to Rat movements towards the mouse, while an angle of 180 indicates movements away from the mouse. Note that movements away from the mouse are more common than movements towards the mouse. Taken together, these data show that the rat is not consistently moving towards the mouse, as indicated both by the polar angle plot and also by the distribution of mouse-rat distance changes during rat movements (Figure 3, figure supplement 4B).</p><p>A window of 2 seconds was used to allow sufficient time to include the entire rat movement bout.

For variance thresholding, if this was performed per experimental session, were there cells that had high variance in one assay but low variance (and were thus excluded) in another assay? This would inflate the apparent degree of cross-assay coding. Details, i.e., a statement or Venn diagram, explaining how many cells were excluded on basis of EPM alone, REA alone, or both would be pertinent. If the number excluded on basis of only one assay is substantial, the text should acknowledge the impact this likely has on apparent cross-assay coherence.</p></disp-quote><p>Among the 375 total co-registered cells, 10 were excluded because of low variance in both the EPM and Rat, 11 were excluded because of low variance in the EPM but were not excluded in the Rat, and 38 were excluded in the Rat but not the EPM. We opted to show a more informative color scatterplot instead of the suggested Venn diagram because the full range of the data can be seen in the scatterplot. This scatterplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>) reveals that even among cells that were excluded due to low variance in only one assay, very few cells had very large variance in the other assay.
