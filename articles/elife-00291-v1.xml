protein required for TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 function, controls trafficking of TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to endolysosomes. The mechanisms by which UNC93B1 mediates these regulatory effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that UNC93B1 enters the secretory pathway and directly controls the packaging of TLRs into COPII vesicles that bud from the ER. Unlike other COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with the TLRs through post-Golgi sorting steps. Unexpectedly, these steps are different among endosomal TLRs. TLR9 requires UNC93B1-mediated recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) for delivery to endolysosomes while TLR7, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 utilize alternative trafficking pathways. Thus, our study describes a mechanism for differential sorting of endosomal TLRs by UNC93B1, which may explain the distinct roles played by these receptors in certain autoimmune diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00291.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00291.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00291.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are proteins that are responsible for recognizing specific molecules associated with invading pathogens, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

However, some of the body's own DNA and RNA is also found outside cells (e.g., in the bloodstream) and TLRs must be able to discriminate between these nucleic acids and those belonging to pathogens, because failure to tell the difference between the two could result in autoimmune disease. To reduce this risk, TLRs are sequestered inside the cell within membrane-bound compartments known as endosomes.</p><p>UNC93B1 is a transmembrane protein that is known to control the movement of TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum—where TLRs are assembled—to endosomes. However, the exact mechanisms by which this protein controls TLR trafficking were unclear. Now Lee et al. reveal that it directly controls the packaging of at least six TLRs at the endoplasmic reticulum: it helps to load these TLRs into vesicles, which are in turn processed by the Golgi apparatus—the organelle wherein proteins are sorted and packaged en route to their final destinations. Surprisingly, UNC93B1 remains associated with the TLRs even after Golgi processing.</p><p>Lee et al. also reveal that specific endosomal TLRs are subject to distinct post-Golgi trafficking mechanisms. In order for TLR9 to be delivered to the endosome, UNC93B1 must recruit an adaptor protein called AP-2, whereas other TLRs appear to require different actions by UNC93B1. By defining the mechanisms that underlie the differential trafficking of endosomal TLRs, Lee et al. suggest that we may learn how to manipulate distinct aspects of TLR activation, and also gain insights into the causes of certain autoimmune diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00291.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00291.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd><kwd>UNC93B1</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd><kwd>AP-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI072429, AI063302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lupus Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>Gregory M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weisenfeld Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Bettina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A transmembrane protein uses distinct mechanisms to regulate the movement of specific toll-like receptors-key immune system components involved in detecting pathogens-to their final locations inside cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize conserved microbial features and initiate signals critical for induction of immune responses to infection. A subset of TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) recognizes forms of nucleic acids, including double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA, and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbalat et al., 2011</xref>). This specificity facilitates recognition of a broad array of microbes but introduces the potential for recognition of self-nucleic acids. TLR7 and TLR9 recognition of self-RNA and self-DNA, respectively, contributes to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marshak-Rothstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christensen and Shlomchik, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Discrimination between self and microbial nucleic acids cannot be achieved solely through recognition of distinct features but instead relies on differential delivery of these potential ligands to TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton and Kagan, 2009</xref>). All of the TLRs capable of nucleic acid recognition localize within endosomal compartments which sequesters these receptors away from self nucleic acids in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton and Kagan, 2009</xref>). Our previous studies as well as work from other groups indicate that a requirement for ectodomain cleavage of intracellular TLRs further restricts receptor activation to protease-rich acidic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Cattaneo et al., 2012</xref>). Bypassing this requirement enables responses to extracellular self nucleic acid and leads to fatal inflammatory disease in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mouchess et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the system appears carefully balanced as simply overexpressing TLR7 in mice causes responses to self-RNA and development of an SLE-like disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pisitkun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Subramanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deane et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, defining the regulatory steps that control TLR localization and influence the threshold of receptor activation has important implications for self/non-self discrimination.</p><p>TLR9 and other intracellular TLRs must traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to endolysosomes before responding to ligands. UNC93B1, a multi-pass transmembrane protein localized to the ER, appears to facilitate this trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Mice homozygous for a nonfunctional Unc93b1 (H412R) allele (<italic>Unc93b1</italic><sup>3d/3d</sup>) fail to respond to TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 ligands, and mice and humans deficient in UNC93B1 are highly susceptible to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casrouge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabeta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lafaille et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, UNC93B1 has been implicated in the function of TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koblansky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oldenburg et al., 2012</xref>). UNC93B1 is not required for responses by surface localized TLRs such as TLR2 and TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabeta et al., 2006</xref>). UNC93B1 associates with endosomal TLRs, and in cells with defective UNC93B1, TLR9 and TLR7 fail to leave the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanism by which UNC93B1 facilitates TLR trafficking to endosomal compartments remains enigmatic, especially considering its reported direct translocation from the ER to endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). This pathway is inconsistent with our findings that TLR9 and TLR7 traffic through the general secretory pathway en route to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>). In addition, mice expressing an aspartic acid to alanine mutation at amino acid position 34 in UNC93B1 (<italic>Unc93b1</italic><sup>D34A/D34A</sup>) were recently shown to develop spontaneous autoimmunity due to enhanced TLR7 responses and diminished TLR9 responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2011</xref>). These findings suggest that regulation of TLRs by UNC93B1 can influence the relative thresholds of receptor activation. For these reasons, we have sought to define the molecular basis by which UNC93B1 controls endosomal TLR trafficking and function.</p><p>Beyond the implied role for UNC93B1 discussed above, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate proper localization of endosomal TLRs and no other factor required specifically for endosomal TLR trafficking has been identified. Nevertheless, several reports suggest that endosomal TLR trafficking may be influenced at both ER and post-Golgi trafficking steps. Gp96 functions as an ER folding chaperone for many TLRs, including TLR9, and PRAT4A has been implicated in TLR trafficking from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the HRS/ESCRT pathway is involved in post-Golgi trafficking by sorting ubiquitinated TLR7 and TLR9 to endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>), and the adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) has been reported to target TLR9 and TLR7 to lysosome related organelles specialized for type I IFN induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blasius et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasai et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, UNC93B1 trafficking to these compartments is also impaired in AP-3 deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasai et al., 2010</xref>). Whether UNC93B1 interacts with other components implicated in trafficking of endosomal TLRs remains to be determined.</p><p>In this study, we report that UNC93B1 is required for multiple steps of TLR trafficking. UNC93B1 plays a direct role in facilitating exit of TLRs from the ER as well as a later role in recruitment of adaptor protein-2 (AP-2) to facilitate endocytosis of TLR9 from the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, TLR7 does not have the same requirements for UNC93B1 and utilizes distinct trafficking machinery to reach endolysosomes. Thus, our results describe how UNC93B1 controls endosomal TLR trafficking and provide the first mechanistic basis for differential regulation of these receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UNC93B1 traffics to phagosomes via the Golgi compartment</title><p>UNC93B1 has been described as an ER-resident trafficking chaperone that translocates TLRs directly from the ER to endolysosomes upon TLR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). This model is based in part on the observation that UNC93B1 never acquires Endoglycosidase H (EndoH)-resistant glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>), which are acquired only when proteins traffic through the medial Golgi. Because this proposed function for UNC93B1 conflicts with our model of TLR9 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011</xref>), we first examined whether UNC93B1 is present in endolysosomal compartments in unstimulated cells. Wildtype (WT) UNC93B1 but not the nonfunctional (H412R) mutant was detectable in phagosomes purified from unstimulated RAW264 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Moreover, a portion of UNC93B1-WT gained EndoH-resistance in multiple cell types, while UNC93B1-H412R was entirely EndoH-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). These results agree with a previous report that the H412R mutant fails to leave the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). To formally demonstrate that the increased molecular weight of UNC93B1-WT is due to N-linked glycans, we mutated Asn-251, which is within a consensus N-glycosylation site, and this mutant failed to acquire EndoH-resistant glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Based on the acquisition of EndoH-resistant glycans by UNC93B1, we examined whether UNC93B1 is detectable within COPII vesicles, which mediate transport of cargo between the ER and Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>). Using an in vitro COPII budding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merte et al., 2010</xref>), we compared levels of UNC93B1-WT and UNC93B1-H412R in purified vesicles. UNC93B1-WT, but not H412R, was clearly present within the vesicles, further supporting a model in which UNC93B1 exits the ER through the general secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that a pool of UNC93B1 protein exits the ER and traffics through the Golgi in unstimulated cells. Moreover, transit from the ER to the Golgi may be important for UNC93B1 function, as the nonfunctional UNC93B1-H412R mutant fails to enter COPII vesicles and does not reach the medial Golgi.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00291.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>UNC93B1 traffics to the Golgi en route to endolysosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UNC93B1 is present in phagolysosomes of unstimulated cells.

While all three bands were present in macrophages with functional UNC93B1, only the ER-resident form was detectable in cells expressing the UNC93B1-H412R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with our previous analysis of TLR9 in UNC93B1 shRNA knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>). These data indicate that TLR9 does not reach the medial Golgi in the absence of functional UNC93B1. Because a pool of UNC93B1 can traffic from ER to Golgi by entering COPII vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we considered whether UNC93B1 regulates this aspect of TLR9 trafficking. Indeed, analysis of TLR9 loading into COPII vesicles revealed that TLR9 was only detectable in the presence of functional UNC93B1 whereas a control traffic protein, ERGIC/p58, was packaged independently of UNC93B1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00291.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>UNC93B1 controls ER exit of TLRs 3, 7, 9, 11, and 13.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TLR9 fails to exit the ER in cells lacking functional UNC93B1.

Based on the predicted topology of UNC93B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>), the N- and C-termini face the cytosol, so we reasoned that these regions would be most likely to interact with putative trafficking factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, N-terminal truncations resulted in a strong defect in TLR9 trafficking from the ER as evidenced by significantly reduced or absent precursor and cleaved forms of TLR9 in cells expressing the Δ50 and Δ57 UNC93B1 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Moreover, we could detect both the precursor and cleaved forms of TLR9 associated with immunoprecipitated UNC93B1, suggesting that UNC93B1 and TLR9 remain associated after leaving the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To test whether this post-ER interaction may have functional consequences, we screened UNC93B1 mutants for any role in TLR9 function beyond ER export. Strikingly, truncation of the UNC93B1 C-terminus (Δ523 and Δ538) resulted in an accumulation of the Golgi-modified precursor form of TLR9 and a marked reduction of the cleaved receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This pattern suggests that TLR9 trafficking is blocked at some point after the medial Golgi, in contrast to the trafficking defect observed with N-terminal deletion mutants. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed reduced TLR9 signaling in cells expressing the Δ523 and Δ538 UNC93B1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that UNC93B1 directly recruits AP-2 via a YxxΦ motif present in its C-terminal cytosolic tail.</p><p>AP-2 complexes direct clathrin-mediated endocytosis of cargo from the plasma membrane. Therefore, our results suggest that UNC93B1 and TLR9 traffic together to the surface and require AP-2-mediated internalization to reach endocytic compartments. To test this possibility, we examined whether TLR9 required UNC93B1-mediated recruitment of AP-2 to gain access to endolysosomal compartments. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we detected reduced colocalization of TLR9 and the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 in UNC93B1-Y539A-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We also compared surface expression of N-terminally tagged TLR9 in cells expressing different UNC93B1 alleles. While surface TLR9 was only weakly detectable in cells expressing UNC93B1-WT, expression of UNC93B1-Y539A increased the levels of FLAG-TLR9 at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, as we found for TLR9-HA, the FLAG-TLR9 Golgi-modified precursor form accumulated in UNC93B1-Y539A expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This result suggests that disruption of the interaction between UNC93B1 and AP-2 leads to defective endocytosis of TLR9 from the cell surface. In support of this model, siRNA knockdown of AP-2µ1 resulted in a similar increase in surface expression of TLR9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and accumulation of the TLR9 precursor form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As a positive control for AP-2µ1 knockdown, we observed accumulation of CD71 (transferrin receptor) at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We considered the possibility that TLR7 may recruit AP-2 directly, thereby obviating the need for UNC93B1. However, when we screened by Y2H for interactions between the cytosolic region of TLR7 and AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4, we found that TLR7 interacted specifically with AP-4μ but not AP-2μ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We identified three potential YxxΦ motifs within TLR7, and mutating one of these (Tyr-892) disrupted the interaction with AP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, a TLR7-Y892A mutant no longer responded to TLR7 ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and displayed reduced ectodomain processing when expressed in bone marrow derived macrophages, suggesting that AP-4 is required for TLR7 delivery to endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). AP-4 has been implicated in vesicular trafficking between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dell'Angelica et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simmen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barois and Bakke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgos et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the association between AP-4 and TLR7 suggests that TLR7 is diverted from the secretory pathway at the TGN and delivered directly to endosomes while continually associating with UNC93B1. Thus, the mechanisms controlling trafficking of TLR7 and TLR9 to the compartments from which they signal are distinct.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Several UNC93B1 dependent TLRs traffic independently of the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway</title><p>We next sought to determine whether the post-Golgi trafficking of other UNC93B1-dependent TLRs is similar to either of the pathways we have described for TLR7 and TLR9.

Moreover, the full-length EndoH-resistant form did not accumulate in these cells, as we observed for TLR9. Together with the responses to TLR13 ligands, these results indicate that TLR13 traffics independently of the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway. We performed similar experiments with TLR11 and TLR12, which both recognize profilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yarovinsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koblansky et al., 2012</xref>). Both of these receptors appear to undergo ectodomain cleavage, although the sizes of the cleaved receptors are quite distinct: ∼45 kDa for TLR11 and ∼75 kDa for TLR12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Importantly, both receptors acquired EndoH-resistant glycans, and the glycosylation was unaffected in UNC93B1-Y539A expressing cells.

It is important to note, though, that we have not examined TLR3 trafficking. Thus, it remains possible that TLR3 may also utilize this route, especially considering the several reports that describe TLR3 surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qi et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pohar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weber et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>TLR7 and TLR9 association with UNC93B1 is mutually exclusive</title><p>We have shown that UNC93B1 associates with both the full-length and cleaved forms of TLR9 and TLR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig6">Figures 3E, 6C</xref>); however, the differential post-Golgi trafficking routes taken by TLR7 and TLR9 suggest that UNC93B1 must associate with TLR7 and TLR9 in separate complexes. To test this possibility directly, we examined interactions between TLR7, TLR9, and UNC93B1 by immunoprecipitation. While both TLR7 and TLR9 could precipitate UNC93B1, we could never detect interactions between the two receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, UNC93B1 binding to TLR7 appears to preclude binding to TLR9 and vice versa.

First, we describe mechanisms by which UNC93B1 can regulate multiple aspects of TLR trafficking. UNC93B1 controls exit of at least six TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13) from the ER by regulating their loading into COPII vesicles. In addition, we show that UNC93B1 acts at the cell surface by recruiting clathrin AP-2 to internalize TLR9 from the plasma membrane into endosomes. Perhaps most surprisingly, our results indicate that TLR7 and TLR9 have different requirements for UNC93B1 and demonstrate that the localization of these receptors is controlled through distinct post-Golgi trafficking mechanisms. This last point may provide an explanation for the contrasting roles played by TLR7 and TLR9 in SLE.</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that TLR9 and TLR7 fail to reach endosomes in the absence of functional UNC93B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Interactions between UNC93B1 and TLRs appear necessary for proper trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>), but until our work it was unclear how UNC93B1 mediated delivery of TLRs to endosomal compartments. The most direct examination of UNC93B1 function concluded that the protein translocates with TLRs from the ER to endolysosomes without passing through the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, we propose that UNC93B1 is required for loading of TLR9 into COPII vesicles, which direct transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zanetti et al., 2012</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that UNC93B1 regulates this essential aspect of ER exit. First, UNC93B1 is detected within COPII vesicles, but the nonfunctional UNC93B1-H412R mutant is not. Second, a fraction of UNC93B1 protein acquires EndoH-resistant glycans, indicative of trafficking through the medial-Golgi. Again, the UNC93B1-H412R mutant does not acquire EndoH resistance. Third, in cells lacking UNC93B1, TLR9 is not detected within COPII vesicles. Fourth, the EndoH-resistant precursor and cleaved forms of TLR9 are absent in cells not expressing functional UNC93B1. Importantly, we ruled out the possibility that UNC93B1 functions as a folding chaperone by showing that CD4-TLR fusion proteins require UNC93B1 for ER exit. Altogether, these results argue that UNC93B1 regulates TLR passage through the general secretory pathway, instead of controlling direct translocation between the ER and endosomes. We cannot formally rule out that a pool of UNC93B1 uses this non-canonical route, but it would seem to have little if any relevance for TLR trafficking. The recent identification of Sec22b as a factor required for ER to endosome translocation may allow for further investigation of this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cebrian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our work suggests that at least six, and possibly seven, TLRs are regulated by UNC93B1 in mice. TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13 require UNC93B1 for exit from the ER. It is likely that TLR8 also requires UNC93B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Itoh et al., 2011</xref>), based on its similarity to TLR7, but we have not yet tested this possibility. Regulation of ER exit of TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13 by UNC93B1 is not completely unexpected, as these TLRs were previously linked to UNC93B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinkmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pifer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koblansky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oldenburg et al., 2012</xref>). The determinants of UNC93B1 binding to each of these TLRs remain poorly defined. Residues within the first 50 amino acids of UNC93B1 appear necessary for export of TLR9 but not for export of TLR7. This result suggests that distinct regions of UNC93B1 are required for association with TLR9 and TLR7, although measuring how these mutations impact TLR/UNC93B1 interactions has been challenging for us and for other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fukui et al., 2009</xref>). The fact that UNC93B1-D34A-expressing mice exhibit enhanced TLR7 responses and develop SLE suggests that UNC93B1 is limiting in the ER, at least for TLR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukui et al., 2011</xref>). Presumably, the inability of UNC93B1-D34A to interact with TLR9 results in greater TLR7 export and enhanced signaling. These results and our finding that TLR7 and TLR9 association with UNC93B1 is mutually exclusive suggest that each UNC93B1 molecule may interact with a single TLR. This specificity is particularly important in light of our findings that trafficking routes of TLR7 and TLR9 are distinct. Whether UNC93B1 is similarly selective for other TLRs and identification of the domains that mediate any selectivity are important topics for future studies. Selective export of individual TLRs may provide a mechanism for differential regulation of endosomal TLR responses between cell types or in response to external signals.</p><p>Through analysis of UNC93B1 mutants we identified an additional role for UNC93B1 in directing post-Golgi trafficking of TLR9. Unlike typical COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with its cargo, traffics with TLR9 to the cell surface, and associates with AP-2 via a YXXΦ motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Recruitment of AP-2 is necessary for internalization of TLR9 and subsequent trafficking to endolysosomes. This AP-2-dependent trafficking route has been described for several proteins localized to endolysosomes, including LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and MHC Class II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gough et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janvier and Bonifacino, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormick et al., 2005</xref>). In some cases, the same protein can access endocytic compartments through multiple routes. For example, LAMP-1/2 can also traffic directly from the TGN to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlsson and Carlsson, 1998</xref>). While we cannot rule out that TLR9 may reach endolysosomes through multiple routes, AP-2-mediated internalization appears to be the main pathway of delivery, at least in the cells types we have examined. It is interesting that TLR9 and UNC93B1 would have evolved such dependency on this route, especially considering the potential for self-DNA recognition associated with surface localization of TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mouchess et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, our results appear to underscore why the requirement for ectodomain processing is a critical mechanism ensuring that receptors at the plasma membrane remain nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mouchess et al., 2011</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00291.011</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Trafficking pathways controlling localization of endosomal TLRs.</title><p>UNC93B1 interacts with several TLRs in the ER and facilitates loading into COPII vesicles. Unlike typical COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with TLR9 and TLR7 after exit from the ER. Through its recruitment of AP-2, UNC93B1 is necessary for endocytosis of TLR9 from the plasma membrane into endosomes. TLR7 does not rely on this trafficking route. Instead, TLR7 utilizes AP-4 to bypass the cell surface and traffic directly to endosomes. This difference in trafficking may result in TLR9 and TLR7 accessing distinct compartments with unique functional properties related to the function of each receptor.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00291.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00291.011</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00291-fig9-v1"/></fig></p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of our study is the observation that trafficking of TLR7 and TLR9 are distinct. We find no evidence that TLR7 requires UNC93B1 for recruitment of AP-2. Instead, TLR7 appears to employ AP-4 in a direct route of traffic from the TGN to the endosome. These results provide the first evidence that different pathways control TLR7 and TLR9 trafficking and localization. One potential implication of this result is that these pathways may deliver TLR9 and TLR7 to distinct compartments with different access to ligands or distinct signaling properties. We find that TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13, like TLR7, do not require the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway. However, it remains to be determined whether these TLRs utilize the AP-4 pathway or another pathway to traffic from TGN to endosomes. Further compartmental specialization is generated by AP-3, which interacts with TLR9 and directs the receptor to endosomal compartments dedicated to type I interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blasius et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasai et al., 2010</xref>). TLR7 may also utilize AP-3 to reach this specialized compartment, although we could not detect interaction between AP-3 and TLR7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Whether there is transport of TLRs between each of the compartments serviced by AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4 remains an open question.</p><p>The use of distinct molecular pathways to regulate endosomal TLRs may allow for differential regulation of trafficking, either in response to external cues or between different cell types. In addition, TLR7- and TLR9-containing compartments may have differing abilities to access internalized ligands, influencing responses to microbial or self ligands. These possibilities are particularly intriguing when considering the contrasting roles played by TLR7 and TLR9 in SLE, where loss of TLR7 protects against disease while loss of TLR9 exacerbates disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christensen et al., 2006</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that distinct cell biological regulation may underlie the different roles played by these receptors in autoimmune disease. Defining the mechanisms underlying this regulation may help explain the etiology of certain autoimmune diseases as well as provide opportunities to selectively manipulate distinct aspects of TLR activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used for immunoblots, immunoprecipitations, or flow cytometry: anti-HA as purified antibody or matrix (3F10; Roche, Indianapolis, IN), anti-FLAG as purified antibody or matrix (M2 and M5; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-GFP (JL-8; Clontech Laboratories, Inc, Mountain View, CA), anti-GFP as purified or matrix (RQ2; MBL International Corporation, Woburn, MA), anti-<italic>myc</italic> (purified mouse; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), anti-V5 (mouse monoclonal; Invitrogen) anti-CD4 (RM4-5; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-Lamp-1 (1D4B; BD Biosciences), anti-calnexin (rabbit polyclonal; Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY), anti-ERGIC/p58 (rabbit) has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merte et al., 2010</xref>), anti-TNFα-PE or -APC (MP6-XT22; eBiosciences, San Diego, CA), anti-CD71-APC (OKT9; eBiosciences), goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor647 (Invitrogen), goat anti-rat-HRP, sheep anti-mouse-HRP, and donkey anti-rabbit-HRP (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>This is an excellent study providing novel insights into the mechanisms of differential trafficking of TLR7 and TLR9 by the multipass transmembrane protein Unc93b1. The study will have general impact in immunology and cell biology. On the basis of enthusiastic comments by the Reviewing editor and two other reviewers, we will be happy to accept this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, provided that the authors address the minor issues raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1) A striking finding of this study is the differential use of the Unc93B/AP-2 trafficking pathway by TLR9 and TLR7. The authors suggest that TLR7 can direct itself to endosomes from the golgi through interactions with AP-4 subunits. Is this a common feature of the several TLRs that bind to Unc93B? If yeast 2-hybrid analyses are performed with other endosomal TLRs, are there other examples of TLR-AP4 interactions, or is TLR7 unique?</p><p>2) The authors make the intriguing suggestion that Unc93B binds to a single TLR at a time. This model predicts that at least five different complexes of Unc93B exist in cells (Unc-TLR9 complexes, Unc-TLR7 complexes, etc). If this is true, then immunoprecipitation assays with TLR7 should not be able to co-purify TLR9, while Unc93B pulldowns should isolate both TLR7 and TLR9. The authors are encouraged to perform these assays.</p><p>3) In Figure 7, the schematic figure indicates the role of AP-1 in transfer of TLR9 from Golgi to the plasma membrane. However, we could not find data for this in the study. Can the authors clarify this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00291.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A striking finding of this study is the differential use of the Unc93B/AP-2 trafficking pathway by TLR9 and TLR7.

As shown in our new Figure 7A, the response to TLR13 ligands is unaffected in these cells, suggesting that TLR13 does not require the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway for its function. Additionally, we present biochemical evidence that TLR13 trafficking in UNC93B1-Y539A mutant cells is unimpaired (Figure 7B). This result suggests that TLR13 (like TLR7) may utilize AP-4 for Golgi to endosome trafficking, although we do not yet have any direct evidence for this conclusion.</p><p>We also tested how responses to TLR3 (PolyI:C) and TLR11 (profilin and flagellin) ligands were affected by the UNC93B1-Y539A mutant. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect responses to TLR3 and TLR11 ligands in macrophages, even when we ectopically expressed TLR11. However, we were able to examine TLR11 and TLR12 trafficking in UNC93B1-Y539A mutant cells and found that the trafficking of these receptors is also unaffected by disruption of the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway (Figure 7C, D).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have also tried to detect interactions between the cytosolic domains of other endosomal TLRs and the μ subunit of AP-4 using the yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assay. We failed to detect any interactions between AP-4 and TLR3, TLR9, TLR11, or TLR13. While this result could support the conclusion that trafficking of TLR3, TLR11, and TLR13 is distinct from trafficking of TLR7, we are hesitant to leap to this conclusion. Our primary concern is that, for reasons that remain unclear, TLR cytosolic domains do not behave equivalently in Y2H assays. For example, Brown et al have reported that the TLR9 cytosolic domain fails to interact with MyD88 by Y2H, while TLR2, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR8 do interact with MyD88 (see Brown et al, EJI, 2006). We have experienced the same problems with the TLR9 cytosolic domain, which is why we did not include Y2H data for TLR9, and suspect that TLR3, TLR11, and TLR13 have similar limitations. Therefore, we cannot rule out that lack of interaction between TLR3, TLR11, or TLR13 (or TLR9 for that matter) and AP-4 is due to a technical limitation of the Y2H assay for these TLRs. For this reason, we have relied on the functional assays that we discussed previously. We would prefer to omit the AP-4 Y2H interaction data from our manuscript due to these technical issues, but we have included the results below for the benefit of the reviewers. [Editors' note: the authors have agreed to make the results available in the author response, with the caveats described above.]<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Results from a yeast two-hybrid assay testing for interaction between the AP-4μ subunit and the C-terminal cytosolic region of TLR3, 7, 9, 11, 13.</title><p>Growth on –His–Trp– Leu plates (–His) indicates interaction.

This model predicts that at least five different complexes of Unc93B exist in cells (Unc-TLR9 complexes, Unc-TLR7 complexes, etc). If this is true, then immunoprecipitation assays with TLR7 should not be able to co-purify TLR9, while Unc93B pulldowns should isolate both TLR7 and TLR9. The authors are encouraged to perform these assays</italic>.</p><p>We have performed these biochemical experiments and include these data in our new Figure 8. As predicted by the model, immunoprecipitation of TLR7 or TLR9 does precipitate UNC93B1, but does not precipitate the other receptor.</p><p><italic>3) In Figure 7, the schematic figure indicates the role of AP-1 in transfer of TLR9 from Golgi to the plasma membrane. However, we could not find data for this in the study. Can the authors clarify this</italic>?</p><p>Including AP-1 in the schematic was a mistake. While we think it is possible that AP-1 mediates this step, we do not have evidence for or against this possibility. We have corrected the schematic (Figure 9) to more accurately reflect our current knowledge.</p><p>Unrelated to the three points raised by the reviewers, we have also included additional evidence that AP-4 is involved in TLR7 trafficking to endosomes. In our original submission we described a mutation in TLR7, Y892A that disrupts AP-4 interaction. This mutant receptor no longer responds to TLR7 ligands. In this revised manuscript we now show that this receptor has a substantial reduction in ectodomain processing, further supporting the conclusion that failure to recruit AP-4 leads to reduced TLR7 trafficking to endosomes (Figure 6H).</p></body></sub-article></article>
