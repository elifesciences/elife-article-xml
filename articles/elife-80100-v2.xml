and flight response, attention control, and sleep/wake cycles. While efferent projections of the LC have been extensively investigated, little is known about its local circuit organization. Here, we performed large-scale multipatch recordings of noradrenergic neurons in adult mouse LC to profile their morpho-electric properties while simultaneously examining their interactions. LC noradrenergic neurons are diverse and could be classified into two major morpho-electric types. While fast excitatory synaptic transmission among LC noradrenergic neurons was not observed in our preparation, these mature LC neurons connected via gap junction at a rate similar to their early developmental stage and comparable to other brain regions. Most electrical connections form between dendrites and are restricted to narrowly spaced pairs or small clusters of neurons of the same type. In addition, more than two electrically coupled cell pairs were often identified across a cohort of neurons from individual multicell recording sets that followed a chain-like organizational pattern. The assembly of LC noradrenergic neurons thus follows a spatial and cell-type-specific wiring principle that may be imposed by a unique chain-like rule.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd><kwd>cell type</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>circuitry</kwd><kwd>connectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50HD103555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinney</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 EY07001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinney</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH109556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Junzhan</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Xiaolong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS101596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinney</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Xiaolong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interrogating mouse locus coeruleus via large-scale multipatch whole-cell recordings uncovers its cellular heterogeneity and cell-type-specific wiring logic.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small pontine nucleus that houses the vast majority of norepinephrine (NE)-producing neurons in the brain and sends widespread noradrenergic projections to all major divisions of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>). By releasing NE across the CNS, the LC participates in many cognitive processes and behaviors crucial for survival, including fight and flight response, attentional control, and sleep/wake cycles, while its dysregulation is implicated in various neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bast et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fortress et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Southwick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weinshenker, 2018</xref>). Given its small size, the LC has been long considered as a homogeneous cluster of NE-producing neurons (LC/NE neurons) exerting global, uniform influence over all CNS divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sara and Bouret, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>). However, increasing evidence supports LC/NE neurons are heterogeneous in terms of the anatomical projections, morpho-electric profiles, and specific behavioral functions they involve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Particularly, recent tracing studies coupled with behavioral paradigms suggest that the LC is composed of multiple specialized noradrenergic modules. Each module comprises nonoverlapping LC/NE neurons with specific electrophysiological properties and projection targets, thus participating in distinct functions of the circuits within its efferent domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Totah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, LC/NE neurons within each module are also able to switch from a discrete, patterned coding mode to a global broadcast mode to cope with the more demanding situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Such functional modularity in the LC and their context-dependent adaptivity suggest LC neurons are functionally heterogeneous and may interact with each other in a complex and subtle way within the local circuit to coordinate the division of labor. To understand how each LC module is functionally specialized and how distinct LC modules interact to achieve specific functions, it is essential to dissect the local circuit organization of the LC in terms of its cellular diversity and wiring logic.</p><p>LC/NE neurons belong to monoaminergic systems, and their axon terminals are believed to be ‘asynaptic’-free nerve endings from which NE is released to modulate the activity of nearby fast-acting synapses releasing glutamate or GABA in the form of ‘volume transmission.’ Increasing evidence suggests monoamine neurons, including LC/NE neurons, could co-release glutamate to engage in fast neurotransmission as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fung et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). It appears that NE can be released locally in the LC to activate α2 adrenoceptor (α2AR) on the same or adjacent LC/NE neurons to initiate a negative feedback mechanism regulating their excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghajanian and VanderMaelen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egan et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Williams et al., 1985</xref>), but it remains to be illustrated whether these neurons can interact with each other via fast neurotransmission. In addition, it is long believed that LC/NE neurons form extensive gap junctions to synchronize their activity as a global broadcast. However, gap junctions among LC/NE neurons appear to be prevalent only in neonates and decline significantly with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christie and Jelinek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travagli et al., 1995</xref>). It remains to be determined with direct demonstration if electrical coupling persists within mature LC/NE neurons to mediate their synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ishimatsu and Williams, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patrone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rash et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travagli et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To answer all these questions, here we adopted several strategies for studying cortical circuits, including adult tissue slicing and simultaneous multipatch recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ting et al., 2014</xref>), to the brainstem to interrogate LC local circuit in adult mice. By profiling the morpho-electric properties of each LC/NE neuron and examining their connectivity at an unprecedented scale and level of detail (&gt;700 neurons), we have uncovered and defined two major morpho-electric noradrenergic cell types in the LC and deciphered the major mechanism governing their interactions at single-cell resolution. Our results indicate that at least in our horizontal slice preparation, no glutamatergic excitatory transmission was detected among LC neurons. Instead, we found electrical coupling is the major synaptic mechanism by which mature LC neurons communicate with each other, and their assembly follows a spatial and cell-type-specific wiring principle that may be imposed by a unique chain-like rule.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electrophysiological and morphological heterogeneity of LC/NE neurons</title><p>Each brainstem slice prepared from adult mice with an NMDG-based slicing protocol contained numerous healthy LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ting et al., 2014</xref>), allowing for simultaneous patch-clamp recordings of up to eight mature LC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure only noradrenergic neurons (henceforth LC/NE neurons) were studied (i.e., surrounding GABAergic neurons in the peri-LC area were excluded) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>), only fluorescence-positive neurons were targeted for recordings in each slice prepared from <italic>Dbh</italic>-Cre: Ai9 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To put their electrophysiology in a broader context of slice electrophysiology, we also recorded pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (CA1-PVs) from the hippocampal CA1, two cell types commonly recorded and studied in brain slices, using the same conditions. LC/NE neurons at rest had a highly depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP, –43.0 ± 0.1 mV, n=289), and all neurons were spontaneously active at rest (1.6 ± 0.4 Hz, n=30; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), similar to previous reports on LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrzejewski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballantyne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuo et al., 2020</xref>), but different from hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In response to negative current injection, LC/NE neurons were charged much more slowly with a higher input resistance compared to both types of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In response to prolonged suprathreshold positive current injection, the majority of LC/NE neurons exhibited a characteristic pause after their first action potentials (APs) followed by a series of APs, which departed significantly from stereotypical firing patterns of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). LC/NE neurons were also unique in their single APs, which were much wider with a lower amplitude, followed by a deep and prolonged afterhyperpolarization compared to hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). To illustrate strikingly distinct properties of LC/NE neurons, we extracted 13 electrophysiological features from three groups of neurons (see ‘Materials and methods’) and plotted them in a t-SNE-map. This t-SNE-based clustering approach clearly separated LC neurons from the two types of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), highlighting the unique electrophysiological properties of LC neurons.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Electrophysiological properties of locus coeruleus/norepinephrine (LC/NE) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Horizontal slices prepared from <italic>Dbh</italic>-cre:Ai9 mice for multicell patch-clamp recordings of LC/NE neurons.

Most LC neurons were large cells with smooth dendrites (aspiny), similar to CA1-PVs in the hippocampus, but different from CA1-PCs with spiny dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, their dendritic trees were more tortuous with less branch order than hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). LC/NE neurons had diverse somatodendritic shapes, based on which we could group them into two major types: fusiform cells (FF) and multipolar cells (MP) following previous nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanson, 1976</xref>). FFs had an elongated, usually spindle-shaped large soma with two, or rarely three, primary dendrites originating from opposite poles of the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D and F</xref>). The second type of neurons, MP, had a triangular or nearly round soma with more than three primary dendrites that could originate from any side of their soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and F</xref>). The dendrites of MPs also branched more profusely around the soma compared to that of FF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To support LC neuron classification, we reconstructed a subset of LC/NE neurons and quantified their soma bipolarity (i.e., the ratio of the major to the minor axis of a fitted ellipse of the soma; the larger the ratio, the more bipolarity the soma exhibits) and the bipolarity index of dendritic arborization (the proportion of the dendrites originating around the major axis of the fitted ellipse; the larger the proportion, the more bipolarity the dendritic arborizations exhibits) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and then plotted these two parameters against each other. Two types of neurons were well separated in this plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also trained a nonlinear neural network-based classifier to distinguish cell types and the classifier could separate two types with a performance accuracy of 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Of note, the performance using soma shape alone was almost as good as the performance using two parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>), suggesting that soma shape is a reliable criterion to distinguish two types of neurons. These analyses supported our manual classification based on the somatodendritic shape.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Two morphological cell types of locus coeruleus/norepinephrine (LC/NE) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A micrograph shows seven morphologically recovered LC/NE neurons, most of which are multipolar cells (MP).

Given that FFs constitute ~38% of total LC/NE neurons, the proportion of FFs in each multicell recording set (the cohort of &gt;3 LCs neurons from each slice) should fall most frequently within the range of 30–40% if FFs are evenly distributed across the entire LC. However, this was not the case in the histogram of FF proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) across all recording sets. Instead, the FF proportions were heavily biased toward either the range of 0–20% or of 50–100%, suggesting that FFs were not evenly distributed across the entire LC, but preferentially localized in certain anatomical positions. Indeed, we often recorded a cohort of neurons in which most LC/NE neurons were FFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The same was true for the proportions of MP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Given the wide range of the inter-soma distance of tested pairs, a low coupling rate in our dataset was not unexpected. To examine how electrical coupling among LC neurons was restrained by their inter-soma distance, we measured the inter-soma distances of all tested cell pairs to derive their electrical coupling rate as a function of the inter-soma distance. With an inter-soma distance &lt;40 µm, the coupling rate between LC neurons was ~12%, indicating that electrical connections were prominent among LC neurons in adult mice. However, the coupling rate dropped quickly as the inter-soma distance increased from 40 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, while the coupling rate was much lower in cell pairs with the inter-soma distance &gt;40 µm, it was much more resistant to the increase of the inter-soma distance than the rate in cell pairs with the inter-soma distance &lt;40 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The coupling rate remained relatively constant when the inter-soma distance increased from 40 µm to 240 µm before dropping to zero, with a second small peak around 140 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Previous reports suggest that electrical connections among LC/NE neurons decline significantly with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christie and Jelinek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travagli et al., 1995</xref>).

To examine whether electrical coupling between LC/NE neurons was also cell-type specific, we examined all tested cell pairs with recovered morphology and assigned each cell to either FF or MP, and then derived the coupling rates as a function of cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

By contrast, only 0.8% of FF–MP pairs were coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; p&lt;0.0001 for both comparisons). While the coupling rate of FF–FF pairs was slightly higher than that of MP–MP pairs, there was no significant difference between these two (p=0.08). Given that the coupling rate is sensitive to the inter-soma distance, we then compared their rates within the same inter-soma distance range to rule out the possibility that the rate differences we observed were due to the differences in the inter-soma distance. Interestingly, with the inter-soma distance of up to 40 µm, no connection was identified in FF–MP pairs (0 out of 55 tested pairs). In contrast, the coupling rates for FF–FF and MP–MP pairs were much higher (11 out of 35 tested pairs, 31.4% for FF–FF, p&lt;0.01 compared with FF–MP; 7 out of 65, 10.7% for MP–MP, p&lt;0.01 compared with FF–MP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In addition, the coupling rate for FF–FF pairs was significantly higher than that for MP–MP pairs over this inter-soma distance range (p=0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). With the inter-soma distance range of 40–80 µm, the coupling rates for both MP–MP and FF–FF pairs were also significantly higher than that for FF–MP pairs (p&lt;0.01 for both comparisons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), but there was no significant difference between the MP–MP coupling rate and FF–FF coupling rate (p=0.67). Electrical coupling in FF–MP pairs most occurred in those cell pairs with the inter-soma distance &gt;80 µm, but their rate even in this inter-soma distance range was lower than the rates for MP–MP and FF–FF pairs (FF–FF vs. FF–MP: 6.3% vs. 1.4%, p&lt;0.01; MP–MP vs. FF–MP: 3.9% vs. 1.4%, p=0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of high-quality morphology recovered from each LC neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) to examine putative electrical synapses between any coupled pairs. We traced the entire somatodendritic domain of a coupled pair under a ×100 oil immersion objective lens and scrutinized those areas where two neurons have overlapping somatodendritic structures. In those coupled cell pairs, a dendritic branch from one cell merged with a dendritic segment from another cell at one or multiple crossing points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), whereas we rarely found these close contacts in uncoupled cell pairs.

Indeed, putative synaptic numbers and coupling coefficients showed a positive correlation (<italic>r</italic>=0.86, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

When one cell pair had multiple contacts, these contacts were generally confined to the same major dendrite from each cell; some of them were even confined to the same dendritic branch of the same order of each cell. For each putative synapse, the dendric distance to one soma was linearly related to the distance to another soma with an r of 0.86, indicating that the putative synapses sit a similar dendritic distance away from the two somata of the coupled pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The average dendritic distance of putative synapses from FF–FF pairs was 168 µm, tending to be slightly greater than the distance for MP–MP pairs (140.0 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In addition, the dendritic distance of the putative synapse appeared to negatively correlate with its coupling coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Connectivity patterns of electrical coupling beyond two LC neurons</title><p>Multicell recordings (≥3 cells) allowed for examining electrical coupling beyond two cells. In many individual recording sets, we could identify multiple electrical connections among a cohort of cells. An example of such a case is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>, in which a current pulse in presynaptic Cell 6 evoked a membrane response of the same sign in postsynaptic Cell 1 and 8. A current pulse in presynaptic Cell 1 or 8 evoked a membrane response of the same sign in postsynaptic Cell 6, but not 8 or 1 respectively. This indicates Cell 1 and Cell 8 both electrically connect with Cell 6, but Cell 1 and Cell 8 do not directly connect with each other. This result also indicates that electrical signals from one cell hardly pass to other cells via second-order coupling if they are not electrically coupled in the first order. Other tested pairs did not show evidence of electrical coupling in either direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Out of our all multiple-cell recording sets (≥3 cells), 15 individual recording sets have more than two electrical connections (or electrically coupled pairs) identified. In these recording sets, one coupled pair often shared the same coupling partner with another coupled pair as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref> (i.e., A↔B↔C; each letter represents a cell; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is surprising since two coupled pairs should be less likely to share the same partner if each cell is coupled with other cells in the network at the same rate. However, two coupled pairs without a sharing partner (i.e., A↔B, C↔D) were rare in our recording sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data suggest each cell is not equally coupled with other cells in the network; instead, electrically coupled cells tend to cluster together and form a chain-like pattern (i.e., A↔B↔C). To test this hypothesis, we started by assessing how well a randomly connected network describes our dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erdos and Rényi, 1984</xref>). In this model, the existence of an electrical connection between any two neurons was independently chosen with a uniform probability p (i.e., the overall connectivity rate across all of our recordings: 0.0438; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We first tested this random connectivity model in predicting the patterns of two electrical connections in our recording sets (Model 1, see ‘Materials and methods’). Specifically, based on random pairwise connectivity, we predicted the numbers of a chain-like pattern of two connections (A↔B↔C) versus a non-chain-like pattern of two connections (A↔B, C↔D) using our recording sets of 3–8 neurons. We found that the observed number of the chain-like connection pattern (n=16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) was higher than the numbers predicted by the random connectivity model (n=12.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [6, 21]), whereas the observed number of the non-chain-like patterns (n=5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) was significantly less than the numbers predicted by the model (n=11.6, 95% CI = [6, 19], p=0.01). We calculated the ratio of the chain-like pattern number to the non-chain-like pattern number to reflect the clustering degree of two electrical connections, which we henceforth called the cluster index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The cluster index in our experimental dataset was 3.2, which was significantly higher than the number predicted by the model (1.1, p=0.001). We then tested whether differences in the organizing pattern of two connections (observed vs. predicted) can be better explained by the cell-type-specific connectivity rule as we deciphered (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) by incorporating cell-type information into the model. That is to say, pairwise connection probabilities for FF–FF, FF–MP, and MP–MP pairs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) were used to obtain a new model prediction. With this revised model (Model 2, see ‘Materials and methods’), the observed numbers on average of the chain-like pattern again remained higher than the predicted numbers (n=12.6, 95% CI = [7, 18]), and the observed number of the non-chain-like pattern was still significantly lower than the numbers (n=11.2, 95% CI = [6,16], p&lt;0.001) predicted by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The cluster index predicted by Model 2 was very similar to that predicted by Model 1, and significantly lower than the observed index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that the cell-type-specific rule cannot explain our dataset. Given that neurons of the same type tended to be near each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) and electrical connections are highly sensitive to the inter-soma distance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), we further revised our model (Model 3, see ‘Materials and methods’) by zeroing out connections between cell pairs that were greater than 80 µm, and by using the FF–FF and MP–MP connection rate for cell pairs within 40–80 µm apart and FF–MP connection rate for cell pairs within 80 µm apart. The results did not fundamentally change: the observed number of the chain-like pattern was not significantly different from the predicted value (n=19.4), but the observed number of the non-chain-like pattern (n=4) was still significantly lower than that (n=15.9) predicted by the model. The cluster index predicted by Model 3 was still significantly lower than the observed index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that additional spatial connectivity rules could not explain our dataset as well. In summary, the clustering of two connections in our dataset (i.e., a chain-like pattern) cannot be explained by the random model and spatial and cell-type-specific rules as shown above, suggesting an additional, possible chain-like rule dictating the organization of electrical connections in the LC network (note that all three models shared the assumption that the probability for two neurons to form an electrical connection is independent of all other pairwise connections, an assumption that the new rule will perhaps have to violate). Indeed, in a proof-of-concept new model (Model 4, Appendix 1) where the said assumption in Models 1–3 was violated (i.e., a cell’s connectivity being scaled up or down contingent on whether or not it has an existing electrical connection), the observed patterns of two connections can be well predicted by the model (Appendix 1), supporting that electrical connections among LC neurons are not random, but incline to cluster together in LC (in addition to following cell type and spatial rules). Such an underlying new rule could impose on both cell types, and thus the most frequent patterns of two electrical connections in our dataset are FF–FF–FF and MP–MP–MP, while other combination patterns are either rare or not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Electrically coupled homotypic locus coeruleus (LC) subnetworks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In two electrical connections between LC neurons, comparing observed ratio (chain/non-chain pattern) vs the ratios predicted by Model 1 (random connectivity), Model 2 (cell-type-specific), and Model 3 (cell type and spatial-specific) suggests a chain-like rule dictating electrical connections.

Indeed, when we examined the organizing pattern of three electrical connections in those individual recording sets, the most frequent was still the chain-like pattern (A↔B↔C↔D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), while other possible organizing patterns including circular-like and hub cell-like patterns were rarely observed in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We then extended our models to predict how three electrical connections are organized. Our random connectivity model (Model 1) predicted 2.0 chain-like patterns of triple connections on average (95% CI = [0,6]) across all our recordings, which was the same as the actual observed number, while it predicted 3.0 non-chain-like triple connections on average (95% CI = [0, 7]), which was greater than the observed number (1). We again used the ratio of chain-like to non-chain-like patterns to measure the chain-like tendency in our dataset and compare it with model predictions. The observed ratio in our dataset was 2, significantly higher than the predicted ratio (0.68±0.25, p=0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Our Model 2 (see above) also predicted 2.2 chain-like pattern of triple connections on average (95% CI = [0,6]); however, it predicted 4.9 non-chain-like triple connections (95% CI = [2,8]), which was significantly greater than the observed number (n=1, p=0.01). Again, the observed ratio was significantly higher than the ratio predicted by Model 2 (0.52±0.47, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similar results were obtained using our Model 3 (see above, incorporating inter-neuronal distance), which predicted 6.8 of the chain-like patterns of triple connections on average and 9.3 non-chain-like triple connections on average. Once again, the observed ratio was significantly higher than the ratio predicted by the third and final model (0.76±0.24, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). All simulations indicate that, in addition to spatial and cell-type-specific rule, an additional chain-like rule may apply for the organization of three electrical connections.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we overcame the technical barriers to record up to eight noradrenergic neurons simultaneously from adult mouse LC. Simultaneous multicell patch-clamp recordings (i.e., recording more than two cells) have been developed to study cortical circuits for a while, but it remains a challenge to apply this technique to small nuclei in the brainstem such as the LC given the space restraint and limited cell number in each brain slice. By optimizing slice quality and adapting our multipatching system to small brainstem slices, we could simultaneously record LC/NE neurons in vitro in the cohort of an average of six cells from adult mice. This technical development allowed for profiling the cellular diversity of LC/NE neurons while simultaneously mapping their connections at a single-cell resolution. In fact, this study may represent the first multicell patch recordings of a monoamine modulatory system in the brain, allowing for examining how monoaminergic neurons interact with each other at the single-cell level for the first time. Our results indicate noradrenergic neurons in the LC could be classified into at least two major morpho-electric cell types, and neurons within each cell type form a homotypic network module via gap junctions. Given that each of these cell types may have preferential anatomical locations in LC and different projection targets, each electrically coupled homotypic network may coordinate/synergize their input/output as a whole to engage in distinct functions of the circuits within its efferent domain. In addition, our large dataset has allowed us to directly test several long-standing questions regarding local circuit interaction in the LC, including α2AR-mediated actions and fast glutaminergic synaptic connection at the single-cell level.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Morpho-electric diversity of LC/NE neurons</title><p>Morphological heterogeneity of LC neurons has been noticed since the very early LC studies. The anterior horn of the LC and the ventral part of the LC core appears to be dominated by cells with a stellate multipolar soma, whereas its posterior horn and the dorsal edge of the LC core are dominated by cells with a fusiform-shaped soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanson, 1976</xref>). In addition, LC neurons with distinct soma shapes preferentially project to different brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waterhouse et al., 1983</xref>), warranting further exploration of the morphological diversity of LC neurons and their functional relevance. To this end, we recovered the morphology of a large number of LC/NE neurons via biocytin staining to characterize their morphological features, providing a quantitative, less ambiguous classification of LC/NE neurons. We confirmed that the soma shape of LC/NC neurons could be either fusiform, round, or pyramid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swanson, 1976</xref>). Cells with fusiform-shaped soma have a polarized dendritic arborization (bitufted or bipolar), while cells with round or pyramid-like soma have much less polarized dendrite arborization. These differences allowed for classifying LC neurons into two morphological cell types – multipolar cell (MP) and fusiform cell (FF), which was substantiated by a machine learning algorithm. In addition to having distinct somatodendritic shapes, MP and FF cells have different local axonal arborization as well, further supporting our classification. Finally, MPs and FFs have distinct intrinsic electrophysiological properties. While mature LC/NE neurons as a whole exhibit the stereotypical physiological properties that clearly differentiate them from hippocampal neurons, there are subtle differences between MP and FF in their individual APs: MPs had a longer AP with smaller amplitude than FFs. Furthermore, FFs could sustain higher frequency firing than MPs with large suprathreshold depolarizing current injections.</p><p>The observation that FFs fire narrower spikes than MPs suggests FF may correspond to ‘narrow’ units identified during extracellular recordings of LC neurons, while MP may correspond to those ‘wide’ units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su and Cohen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>). However, ‘narrow’ units are heavily biased toward the ventral part of the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su and Cohen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>), while FFs as we described here may be dorsally biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>). In addition, FFs do not exhibit a higher spontaneous firing rate than MPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), inconsistent with a higher firing rate found for extracellularly recorded ‘narrow’ units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, there is a twofold difference in spike width between ‘narrow’ and ‘wide’ units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>), but the difference in spike width between FF and MP is subtle despite being significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, there is no consistent evidence supporting that FF cells we defined here correspond to those ‘narrow’ units, and MPs correspond to ‘wild’ units. Likely, each single unit type is not confined to a specific morphological type, or both single unit types may be from the same MP type reflecting within-MP functional heterogeneity. The latter may be more likely given that MPs are a predominant LC cell type and are more heterogeneous than FF in terms of soma size and spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>), as well as electrophysiology properties including AP half-width (data not shown). Nevertheless, how in vitro intracellular waveforms correlate with in vivo extracellular ones is unknown in LC, and we thus cannot rule out the possibility that FF cells correspond to those ‘narrow’ units. Establishing a real correspondence between cell types as we discovered here and single unit types is important for the field, warranting a new systematic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su and Cohen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Totah et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Each of the two cell types has unique morphology and electrophysiology, suggesting that they may participate in distinct functions of the circuits within their efferent domains. Indeed, previous studies indicate that fusiform-shaped cells in the posterior horn of the LC and the dorsal edge of the LC core preferentially project to the neocortex and hippocampus, while multipolar neurons in its anterior horn and/or the ventral part of the LC core preferentially project to the spinal cord, cerebellum, and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waterhouse et al., 1983</xref>). While it is difficult to register each cell in our slice recordings to their anatomical location in vivo, we reason that FF cells as we defined here correspond to those fusiform-shaped cells in the posterior horn of the LC and/or the dorsal edge of the LC core, while MP cells may correspond to those multipolar cells in the anterior horn and/or the ventral part of the core. If this is true, these two types as we defined here might form separate LC subnetworks with distinct projection domains, each performing a nonoverlapping function in the brain. In addition, FF and MP may be further classified into different subtypes based on the locations, each of which has different preferred projection targets as well and thus form distinct MP and FF subnetworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>). This may be particularly the case for MP (also see below). To explore the functional relevance of these two major morphological types or the putative subtypes within each morphological type, identifying a specific genetic marker for each cell type or subtype is required. Prior studies indicate some LC neurons could express neuropeptide Y (NPY) and/or galanin. However, it appears neither NPY-expressing nor galanin-expressing LC neurons are confined to a specific morphological type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holets et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Melander et al., 1986</xref>), suggesting that neither NPY nor galanin is a good candidate to differentiate the two LC morphological types. In this regard, relatively new approaches such as single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) are being applied to the LC, which has the potential to identify the specific marker genes for each LC type or subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luskin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scala et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). With type-specific marker genes identified with scRNA-seq, one can leverage an intersectional genetic strategy employing a dual recombinase system using both Cre recombinase as well as a second recombinase, flippase (Flp), to express the reporter genes in each specific LC neuronal type (or subtype). For this purpose, triple transgenic mice could be generated by crossing the Cre/Flp or Cre/Dre double-dependent reporters crossed with <italic>Dbh</italic>-cre (labeling all noradrenergic neurons) and an Flp driver line (expressing Flp in the marker gene locus) to label and manipulate each cell type (or subtype) while animals are trained to perform behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lusk et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Plummer et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chemical transmission between LC/NE neurons</title><p>The physiological function of monoamine neurons is considered to be modulatory given that most monoamine axon terminals in the CNS are ‘asynaptic’ free nerve endings thought to mediate ‘volume transmission.’ However, increasing evidence suggest monoamine axon terminals, including noradrenergic terminals, co-release glutamate to participate in fast synaptic transmission. At least a subset of their axonal terminals makes the junctional or conventional-looking synaptic contacts onto targeted neurons, possibly mediating rapid glutamatergic synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trudeau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). While evidence for this emerging concept of monoamine function is pretty strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), a direct demonstration of the glutamatergic nature of synapses established by monoamine neurons is still lacking. We thus took advantage of our unprecedented multicell recordings of monoamine neurons to examine whether there is any glutamatergic synaptic transmission between LC/NE neurons. Given the high-throughput nature of our system, we were able to test more than 1500 cell pairs, including those narrowly spaced cell pairs (&lt;40 µm apart). However, we did not find evidence of glutamatergic synaptic transmission between LC/NE neurons in our horizontal slice preparation. It will be interesting to examine whether this type of connection, if it does exist among LC neurons, can be more readily detected in coronal slices where peri-LC glutamate transmission may be somewhat more spared than in horizontal slices. Nevertheless, we believe this type of connection, if it does exist, is sparse, given that only a small subset of all terminals established by monoamine neurons may actually be specialized for the synaptic release of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trudeau, 2004</xref>). In addition, our result does not rule out the possibility that a subset of noradrenergic axonal terminals does make glutamatergic synapses onto other target regions, including the spinal cord and the parabrachial nucleus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Monoamine release is controlled by their autoreceptors in the presynaptic terminals. The same receptors are often expressed in the somatodendritic domains of monoamine neurons, activation of which increases potassium conductance as seen in their terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courtney and Ford, 2014</xref>). Alpha2 adrenoceptors (α2AR) are such autoreceptors for NE which are expressed in the somata of LC/NE neurons as well. While α2AR-mediated action on LC neurons is well established, it is unclear under what conditions these receptors are activated and what is their natural agonist. These receptors may be expressed in the soma to sense NE locally released from other or the same LC/NE neurons to engage in lateral inhibition or autoinhibition, and/or epinephrine released from the medulla oblongata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cedarbaum and Aghajanian, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho¨kfelt et al., 1974</xref>). It appears that NE could be released locally from local axonal terminals or somatodendritic domains of LC neurons following a single AP, but it is unknown whether NE released from individual neurons is sufficient enough to activate α2AR to evoke lateral inhibition on adjacent neurons. After testing more than 1500 cell pairs, we did not find any detectable hyperpolarization following the stimulation of a single LC/NE neuron. While other unknown reasons may contribute to the absence of lateral inhibition, a plausible explanation is that NE released from individual LC/NE neurons is not sufficient to activate α2AR to evoke detectable inhibition on LC/NE neurons at least in our in vitro preparation. A recent study suggests that α2AR-mediated lateral inhibition is a frequency-dependent population-wide phenomenon, which can be readily detected when many neurons are simultaneously activated via an optogenetic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davy et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, α2AR-mediated lateral inhibition appears to be a specific network interaction that is prevalent among LC neurons targeting distinct brain regions (module-specific), rather than a nonspecific, spatial ‘surround’ inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davy et al., 2022</xref>). All these could explain why lateral inhibition could not be readily detected at the single-cell level in our dataset where each LC neuron was randomly targeted and individually tested for this type of interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Electrical connection between LC/NE neurons</title><p>Several previous studies suggest that electrical coupling in the LC is negligible or absent in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christie and Jelinek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travagli et al., 1995</xref>). This is surprising given that electrical coupling is an appealing mechanism for LC/NE neurons to synchronize to cope with the global demand for NE signaling. In contrast to these studies, our multicell recordings provide a direct demonstration of electrical coupling established by mature LC/NE neurons with a coupling rate consistent with a previous report from extracellular recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>), substantiating prior evidence that electrical coupling is still an important mechanism for LC/NE neurons to interact with each other in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rash et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Bockstaele et al., 2004</xref>). An electrical coupling rate ranging from 15% to 80% has been reported in many brain regions based on pairwise testing of narrowly spaced cells of the same cell type from juvenile animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devor and Yarom, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Long et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tamás et al., 2000</xref>). These coupling rates as reported in diverse brain regions may significantly drop e as cells are more spatially spaced Indeed, several studies indicate the electrical coupling rate often drops to zero once the inter-soma distance increases to more than 40 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beierlein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galarreta and Hestrin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tamás et al., 2000</xref>). These spatial and cell-type-specific rules appear to apply to electrical coupling among mature LC neurons as well. While the overall coupling rate is low among all LC cell pairs, it is much higher when cell pairs are narrowly spaced (with inter-soma distance &lt;40 µm), particularly for FF-FFs. Interestingly, when a cell pair is more than 40 µm apart, the possibility of finding an electrical connection, despite being very low, is much less distance-dependent, possibly due to the dominant dendrodendritic form of electrical synapse formed between these neurons (see below). In addition, electrical coupling appears to decrease with age in most brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peinado et al., 1993</xref>), including in LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christie and Jelinek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travagli et al., 1995</xref>). However, a direct comparison of the coupling rate in adults to juvenile animals did not reveal a significant difference between the two ages, indicating that electrical coupling in the LC may be less subject to developmental change than previously thought.</p><p>It is well documented that gap junctions generally form between cell pairs of the same type (homotypic gap junctions), while gap junctions between different cell types (heterotypic gap junctions) are rare or absent in most brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peinado et al., 1993</xref>). This rule also applies to LC neurons: most electrical couplings occur between cell pairs of the same noradrenergic type, while electrical coupling is rare between cell pairs of the different cell types. This is still true when the inter-soma distance is controlled. Comparing the spatial profiles of homotypic gap junctions versus heterotypic gap junctions, we found that neurons appear to form gap junctions exclusively with narrowly spaced, adjacent LC neurons of the same type (homotypic connection), while the heterotypic connections, despite being very rare, typically form between cell pairs that are more spatially apart. The result suggests that each LC neuron is intricately connected with their very close neighboring neurons of the same type to constitute cell-type-specific electrical subnetworks (FF subnetwork vs. MP subnetwork), each of which may synchronize independently via extensive gap junctions. This finding provides a plausible cellular mechanism for prior observations that LC pairwise correlated firing and LC ensembles identified in extracellular recordings are cell-type specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Totah et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, the coupling rate between FF–FF pairs is more than threefold higher than that between MP-MP pairs, suggesting that the MP electrical subnetwork may be smaller in terms of cell population than the FF subnetwork. Alternatively, a lower coupling rate among MPs may suggest that MPs are more heterogeneous than FFs. Indeed, as discussed above, LC neurons with multipolar-shaped soma are widely distributed across multiple LC subregions and more heterogeneous than those fusiform cells. In addition, putative MPs in distinct LC subregions appear to have different preferred projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loughlin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waterhouse et al., 1983</xref>). Therefore, MP cells in each LC subregion may only electrically connect with MP cells in the same LC subregion to form subregion-specific MP subnetworks, each of whicht performs unique functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Given that FFs and MPs (or their subgroups) may have different preferential locations and distinct projection targets, within-cell-type electrical coupling is likely to promote the spread of electrical and chemical signals and spike synchronization within each subnetwork, exerting their synergetic effect on specific target regions.</p><p>While close appositions between two neurons do not necessarily mean electrical synapses, such contact sites identified under the light microscope could be reliably confirmed as real electrical synapses by follow-up electron microscope studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukuda and Kosaka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukuda and Kosaka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tamás et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vervaeke et al., 2012</xref>). Our examination of close appositions between electrically coupled pairs indicates more than 50% of electrically coupled pairs have only one putative synapse, and multiple contact sites between pairs are less frequent. Almost all putative synapses were found to occur between dendrites, corroborating a previous LC study in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ishimatsu and Williams, 1996</xref>). In fact, dendro-dendritic synapses appear to be a dominant form of electrical synapses across brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukuda and Kosaka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukuda and Kosaka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hidaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sotelo et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vervaeke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waterhouse et al., 1983</xref>), while somato-dendritic or somato-somatic ones are much less common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tamás et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, electrical synapses in dendrites are localized further away from the soma as animals get older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukuda and Kosaka, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukuda and Kosaka, 2003</xref>). Consistent with these previous findings, putative synapses in mature LC were located most frequently in the middle part of the entire dendritic trees of the electrically coupled cell pair, with a similar dendritic distance to each soma. Given electrical synapses being located at such distal sites, fast signals like action potentials in prejunctional cells could be low-pass filtered and highly attenuated when propagating to postjunctional cells, giving rise to small-amplitude coupled potentials (like spikelet) at the somata of post-junctional neurons. How could such a small coupled potential drive synchronized firing and network oscillations under natural stimulation conditions? Recent work has shown those gap junctions found at distal dendritic sites can interact locally with chemical synaptic inputs to drive synchronized spiking. While coupled potentials are small at the soma, these electrical signals are expected to be larger near gap junctions, where they enable excitatory synaptic charge to spread into the dendrites of neighboring coupled neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vervaeke et al., 2012</xref>), and/or sum with chemical synaptic inputs to generate dendritic spikes that actively propagate with little delay to the soma and drive action potentials with high fidelity. The former may promote the synchronized response of an electrically coupled neuronal population to certain specific synaptic inputs, while the latter allows weak distal gap junction inputs to synchronize somatic action potentials, promoting synchronized spiking of electrically coupled neurons upon common chemical synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Migliore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trenholm et al., 2014</xref>). It will be interesting to investigate in future studies the mechanism(s) that LC neurons deploy to leverage their gap junctions to promote inter-neuronal synchrony.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The network of electrically coupled LC/NE neurons</title><p>Electrical coupling is not just about connections between two neurons, instead it connects a group of neurons into an electrically coupled network that coordinates/synergizes their activity as a whole. Thus, two questions ensue: what is the population size of each network, and how does an individual neuron in each network connect to other neurons of the same network? Despite extensive studies of gap junctions across almost all brain regions, these questions remain largely unexplored due to technical limitations. Gap junction studies with the dye-coupling approach may provide an insight into these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Long et al., 2004</xref>), but the neuron clusters labeled by this approach could result from a second-order coupling, in addition to first-order coupling – these couplings are not otherwise discriminable – greatly compounding interpretation. In addition, the relative impermeability of different dyes to different kinds of electrical synapses results in many inconsistent results. In this regard, our multipatch recordings confer some technical advantages over the dye-based approach. First, given gap junctions being located at the dendrite far away from the soma, somatic membrane potentials in a pre-junctional cell are likely to be highly attenuated by the time they reach a post-junctional cell. It is reasonable to conclude that such highly attenuated coupled potential from the first-order coupling can hardly propagate any further into cells through second-order coupling. Thus, the gap junctions with a dominant dendrodendritic form identified with pairwise recordings should be essentially first-order gap junctions, but this assertion has never been directly confirmed as yet. Our multicell recording sets allowed for directly testing said assertion and ruled out the possibility that gap junctions identified with pairwise patch recordings in LC could result from a second-order coupling. However, caution should be taken in interpreting the results if electrical synapses are located in the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>), assuming the signals passing through somatosomatic electrical synapses are less attenuated. Given that the electrical couplings we identified in LC neurons are confirmed as first-order, we can then examine the real organization of electrical connections beyond two cells in the context of the network. Specifically, our multiple-cell recording allows for identifying multiple electrically coupled pairs across a cohort of up to eight cells, providing the first glimpse into how each neuron interacts with the rest of the neurons in an electrically coupled neuronal network.</p><p>With the support from the simulation with a random connectivity model, a chain-like pattern of two connections (A↔B↔C) is overrepresented in our dataset. One might argue that said overrepresentation may be accounted for by spatial and cell-type-specific connectivity rules that were empirically determined by us here. However, revising our model by adding these connectivity rules did not significantly improve simulation results, and a chain-like pattern of two connections (A↔B↔C) remains unexplained. All simulations suggest that, in addition to spatial and cell-type-specific rules governing LC electrical connections, there is an additional chain-like connectivity rule that may contribute to the overrepresentation of a chain-like pattern of two connections in our dataset. Furthermore, while the number of recording sets with three connections is low, a chain-like pattern (A↔B↔C↔D) is still a dominant pattern of three connections in our recording sets. Our simulation on the pattern of three connections yielded similar results and supported the idea of overrepresentation of a chain-like electrical connectivity pattern in LC/NE neurons. In addition, the overrepresentation can not be explained by the spatial and cell-type-specific connectivity rules, further suggesting an additional chain-like connectivity rule for the organization of three connections. While we could not test if this additional connectivity rule may apply to four or more connections for now (no four connections were found in our dataset), the chain-like connectivity rule may be a general wiring principle dictating a whole electrically coupled network composed of hundreds of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Indeed, previous dye-based studies suggest the same connectivity rule in many brain regions and cell types, including LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christie and Jelinek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Long et al., 2004</xref>). If a chain-like organizing pattern is true, then the dye injection of a single cell can only label the maximum of two additional cells if only first-order coupled cells are labeled. Indeed, the cluster of labeled cells in these studies is often small with a maximum of two additional labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christie and Jelinek, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>). Some studies do label more than two additional cells, but additional cells may be labeled via second-order coupling with a long dye injection time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devor and Yarom, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Long et al., 2004</xref>). The most convincing evidence for this rule comes from the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, where gap junctions between five neurons have been elegantly shown to arrange like a chain-like pattern across neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curti et al., 2012</xref>). However, the interpretation of these data is restrained by several issues inherent to this approach (see above), and whether or not this chain-like connection pattern applies to the whole LC electrically coupled network needs to be further explored in the LC, as well as in many other brain regions. In addition, the other two possible EC organization patterns, circular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right panel fourth cartoon) or hub-like connection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, right panel third cartoon) patterns, were not observed in our dataset, suggesting that electrically coupled pairs in LC may not be organized as these two patterns. However, simulated results on current data could not rule out these two patterns. Model 3 simulations predicted 2.45 hub-like connections on average (95% CI: [0,5]) and predicted 1.39 circular-like connections on average (95% CI: [0,4]). While both average predicted numbers are numerically higher than the observed numbers of each (0), the observed numbers are still within statistical bounds. More data collected with more advanced recording techniques may be able to answer these questions in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine.

Briefly, animals were deeply anesthetized using 3% isoflurane.

This recording chamber was continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF throughout the recording session. Brainstem slices from juvenile mice were prepared following a similar protocol except for the cutting solution (with regular ACSF, not NMDG).

Briefly, patch pipettes (4–7 MΩ) were filled with an internal solution containing 120 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM KCl, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 mM sodium phosphocreatine, and 0.5% biocytin (pH 7.25). Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from up to eight neurons were performed using two Quadro EPC 10 amplifiers (HEKA Electronic, Germany). PatchMaster (HEKA) and custom-written MATLAB-based programs (MathWorks) were used to operate the recording system and perform online and offline data analysis. In current-clamp recordings, neurons were first current clamped at ~–40 pA to prevent its spontaneous firings (see ‘Results’). Action potentials were evoked by current injection into presynaptic neurons at 2 nA for 2 ms at 0.05 Hz for 20–50 trials, and the average of the sweeps in postsynaptic cells was used to detect synaptic connections. The spike threshold and firing pattern in response to sustained depolarizing currents were recorded for each neuron by injecting increasing current steps (+10 pA).</p><p>For coupling coefficient (CC) calculations in gap junctions, hyperpolarizing current pulses of 600ms duration were injected into one cell and resulting voltage deflections were measured in both cells. The voltage deflections were measured at the last 10–20 ms of current injections given the large time constant of the membrane potential responses of two cells (see ‘Results’). The coupling coefficient from cell 1 to cell 2 (CC1) was defined as V2/V1 and the coupling coefficient in the opposite direction from cell 2 to cell 1 (CC2) was defined as V1/V2, where V1 is the voltage deflection in one cell and V2 is the corresponding voltage deflection in the other cell. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, a total of 4–30 single responses were often generated and averaged. For each of the coupled pairs, the mean coupling coefficient was calculated as the average from the values in both directions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological features extraction</title><p>A custom-made Python software kit named Patchview was developed to analyze the electrophysiology data offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ming Hu, 2022</xref>). We extracted 13 electrophysiological properties from each neuron, following a similar method as used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scala et al., 2021</xref>). The rheobase refers to the minimal stimulation current to elicit any action potentials. To extract the properties of AP, we used the first AP elicited by our step stimulation protocol. To calculate the threshold of the AP, the trace within 20 ms preceding the AP peak was used to calculate the third derivative first and the data point with the maximal third derivative value was defined as the threshold of the AP. The AP amplitude is the difference between the threshold potential and the peak potential of the AP. The AP width was defined as that at half-height. The time range from the threshold point to the peak is ‘rising phase time’ while ‘decay phase time’ is the time range from the peak to the potential equal to the threshold. The afterhyperpolarization was defined as the voltage difference between the threshold and the minimal value of the trough after the AP. The time range from the stimulation onset to the threshold of the first AP at the rheobase sweep was defined as the AP delay time.</p><p>To calculate the time constant τ, we fitted each hyperpolarizing trace (from the stimulation onset to the minimal potential within the first-half stimulation period) with an exponential function as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>t</italic> is the time relative to the stimulation onset, <italic>a</italic> and <italic>C</italic> are two constants, <italic>f(t)</italic> is the current value at time <italic>t</italic>, and τ is the membrane constant.

To calculate the adaptive index, the inter-spike intervals (ISIs) were first measured, and then the ratio of the last and the first ISIs was calculated. The CV was calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation of ISIs and the mean of ISIs. To compare the first AP and the subsequent ones, we calculated the ratio of their AP amplitude and the ratio of their half-widths. The amplitude and half-width of the first AP were first calculated and then divided by the mean of these values of the subsequent APs.</p><p>To calculate the input resistance, we measured the steady-state membrane potentials in the traces elicited by the first five negative currents in the step protocol, and then plotted these values (y-axis) against each of the corresponding currents (x-axis).

Briefly, neurons were filled with biocytin during the recording, and slices were fixed right after recordings by immersion in freshly prepared 2.5% glutaraldehyde (from Electron Microscopy Science Cat# 16220), 4% paraformaldehyde (from Sigma-Aldrich Cat# P6148) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C for 7–10 days, and then processed with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method to reveal cell morphology. Slices were then mounted in an aqueous Mowiol mounting solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and the morphologically recovered cells were examined, reconstructed, and analyzed using a ×100 oil-immersion objective lens and camera lucida system.

For instance, if there were four neurons A, B, C, and D in a particular recording/slice, then the expected value of a non-chain-like two-connection AB-CD was calculated to be equal to P(pairwise connection) * P(pairwise connection). The expected number of chain-like and non-chain-like two-connections for a given slice was the sum of the expected values of all two-connections for the recording.

Second, because neurons of the same type clustered together in the recordings, FF-FF and MP-MP connection probabilities for short distances (16–40 µm) were used, and because neurons of different types were further apart in the recordings, FF-MP connection probability for 0–80 mm distance was used in the model.

If the random number was lower than the expected value of the connection (different values based on whether the corresponding connection in the recording was FF-FF/FF-MP/MP-MP), the simulated connection was considered to exist. For each run, simulated double and triple connections were obtained for each recording and the total simulated number was obtained by summing over all the simulated recordings.

Here, the probability for a neuron to connect with another neuron was not independent of other connections in the recording. Instead of using an overall connectivity probability for all neurons (P: the ratio of the observed number of electrical connections to the total number of potential electrical connections tested across all recordings), we manipulated a neuron’s connectivity as a function of other pairwise inter-neuronal connections in a given recording in two different ways. First, if a given neuron already had a pairwise electrical connection with another neuron, then the probability for it to form a pairwise electrical connection with yet another neuron would be scaled up by a factor <italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> (i.e., the new probability = P*<italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic>,), whereas if the recording slice already had a pairwise connection between two neurons, none of which was the given neuron, then its probability of forming a pairwise connection would be scaled down by a factor <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic> (i.e., the new probability = P/<italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic>). The simulation was performed for every recording slice of n neurons (where n=2,3, …, or 8) with the total number of simulated slices equivalent to the number of slices in our recordings, so that the total number of possible pairwise connections across all the recording slices in our model is equal to the total number of said connections in the biology. Simulated numbers of double or two-connections were calculated as before. We found that for several different values of the scaling-up factor <italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> and scaling-down factor <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic>, model estimates came close to experimental data. For instance, for <italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic> equal to 2.9 and 3.9, respectively, the observed number of the chain-like pattern (n=16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) was no different from the numbers predicted by the new dependent pairwise connectivity model (n=16.0, 95% CI = [6, 28]), and the observed number of the non-chain-like pattern (n=5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) was indistinguishable from the numbers predicted by the new model (n=4.8, 95% CI = [0, 12]). In further simulations, we found that one factor alone (<italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> or <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic>) cannot reproduce the experimental findings. At present, we have no evidence for mechanisms that could potentially underlie either the scaling-up factor <italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> or the scaling-down factor <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic>, but this simulation indicates that the probability for a neuron to connect with another neuron is contingent upon whether it has existing electrical connections, supporting that electrical connections among LC neurons are not random, but incline to cluster together in LC. We are now revising the new model by adding spatial and cell-type-specific rules into the model to test what <italic>f<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>f<sub>2</sub></italic> would be for the model to predict our experimental data.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80100.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Johansen</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04j1n1c04</institution-id><institution>RIKEN Center for Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" object-id-type="id" object-id="10.1101/2022.03.01.481656" link-type="continued-by" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.01.481656"/></front-stub><body><p>Recent studies of the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenaline system have demonstrated a modular functional organization, yet how different noradrenaline cell classes are independently regulated is not clear.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nelson Totah (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on their findings, the authors argue that locus coeruleus noradrenaline neurons do not communicate through direct, excitatory synaptic transmission. However, this possibility has not been ruled out through their experiments as the horizontal slice preparation likely severed some axonal connections. The authors could try performing some experiments in coronal slices in which axonal connectivity may be somewhat more spared. Alternatively, they could moderate their claims in this aspect of the study.</p><p>2) The authors also argue that their results support the idea that lateral inhibition through alpha2 adrenergic receptors does not occur in the LC. However, there is a wealth of data supporting the existence of lateral inhibition and the present finding are based on the stimulation of single LC-noradrenaline neurons without a more parametric analysis of different stimulation frequencies/timing. For example, it is possible, given that LC neurons often fire together, that the activity of many LC neurons at one time is required to detect lateral inhibition, as noted by the authors in the discussion. In addition, given previous work showing that the frequency and timing of spikes are important in producing and detecting lateral inhibition (see Rev. 2 comments below and Huang et al. 2007. Proc National Acad Sci 104, 1401-1406), further exploration of this question is warranted. The authors could attempt stimulation of multiple LC-noradrenergic neurons at one time (possibly using optogenetic approaches) and/or explore the parametric space more extensively. Alternatively, they could remove this section from the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Congratulations to the authors on an extremely difficult set of experiments, stunning anatomy, and careful analyses to address important and timely questions about the LC. Really (to my knowledge) no one has dug into the anatomy like this since a few Japanese groups in 1978/1979 and Americans in mid-1980's. An update was needed – and to couple them with recordings is a truly unique data set. I have some comments and questions which I hope will help the authors to improve the manuscript and connect it better with the existing literature.</p><p>One of the major strengths of the Author's work is the ability to potentially connect LC neuron types (FF and MP) with the two types of previously reported extracellular single unit. In light of that, additional characterization of a few things would be help to the field in making the connection to single units. The authors show clear data that FF cells may correspond to 'narrow units' because they have narrow AP width and have larger (albeit not significantly) AHP. Do FF have higher FR as do &quot;narrow units&quot;? Where were the FF neurons located in the LC core? The &quot;narrow units&quot; have been shown to be located throughout the core, but biased ventrally. This info would help link to existing extracellular study identifying multiple cell types.</p><p>It is a bit strange that Figure 1C and 1D come after Figure 2. It may improve the flow of the manuscript to move those panels into figure 2.</p><p>Figure 2E – it would be helpful to have a conceptual description of what it would mean to be low x value – low y value versus high x value – high y value.</p><p>Figure 2F – are the rings here the number of neurons? It would be helpful to the reader if the authors could label the axis and state this in the legend.</p><p>Figure 2H, 2I – it would help to explain that Y axis of panel is related to branching point. It is not clear to me how to interpret this plot. it might be standard in this field but would help the general reader to have this information briefly in the Results section or figure legend to better understand the plot.</p><p>Figure 3A (&quot;Cell 7 and Cell 2 is electrically coupled&quot;) – &quot;is&quot; should be &quot;are&quot;.</p><p>Figure 7C – This plot in C is confusing. The methods state that a horizontal (transverse) plane was used, therefore, ventral and dorsal should be medial and lateral. Can the Authors clarify this?</p><p>Line 78 – strike &quot;the&quot;.</p><p>Line 94 – Can the authors comment on Why the RMP is so different from what was reported in earlier work (see Supplementary Table 5 in Chandler, Gao, and Waterhouse. 2014. Proc National Acad Sci 111, 6816-682)?</p><p>Lines 132-134 – The fact that the axon originated from different locations on FF versus MP cells is interesting. Is this common in other brain regions and various cell types? How does this affect spike generation and spike conductance based on axonal location? This could be useful to briefly discuss, but this comment is not a criticism or request for necessary information. This is just a curious question and something could be added only if the authors see how answering it could be beneficial to understanding LC-NE release and noradrenergic neuromodulation.</p><p>Lines 145-148 – Given that there was a sampling bias with some slices heavily enriched with FF and other slices with MP, can the authors say the dorsal-ventral levels of the FF sample biased slices? I understood that horizontal/transverse slicing was used, so some slices were more ventral than others. Were surrounding slices stained to enable precise knowledge of the location in the dorsal-ventral axis? Prior work showed that single units of narrow type were biased to be more ventral (Totah, et al. 2018. Neuron 99, 1055-1068.e6) and ventrally distributed narrow waveform units have been shown to have distinct functional roles (Li, et al. 2016. Brain Res 1641, 274-290; Hirschberg, et al. 2017. <italic>eLife</italic> 6, e29808). Thus, showing that FF units are also ventrally biased would help link the present work with extracellular work.</p><p>Line 204 – Given the importance of the present study in linking with extracellular recordings used in functional/behavioral studies of LC, it may be noted that Totah, et al. 2018. Neuron 99, 1055-1068.e6 found that 6% of all unit pairs had a CC consistent with a gap injection, which is very similar to the 4.3% that the authors report.</p><p>Line 209 – Do the authors mean Figure 4D instead of 4A?</p><p>Lines 220-221 – The authors may wish to note that their results are consistent with the extracellular study of CC's reporting putative gap junction mediated interactions in adult rat (Totah et al. 2018), intracellular recordings showing gap junction blockade dependent Vm coupling (Alvarez, et al. 2002. Proc National Acad Sci 99, 4032-4036), as well as anatomical studies showing gap junctions are present in adult rat LC (Bockstaele, et al. 2004. Neurochem Int 45, 421-428; Rash, J. E. et al. 2007. Neuroscience 147, 938-956).</p><p>Lines 190 – 225 – without the use of a gap junction blocker, it should be made clear that the electrical coupling is likely or putatively gap junction mediated.</p><p>Lines 411 – 414 – The description of prior work is a bit unclear when using the terms &quot;dorsal horn&quot; and &quot;ventral horn&quot; given that there is an anterior horn (which lies largely dorsal to the LC core) and a posterior horn. It would be helpful to clarify this. My understanding of Loughlin et al. 1986 is that they found: large MP cells in the ventromedial aspect of the LC core (consistent with later work by Hirschberg et al. and Li et al) and in the anterior horn of the LC (which is by definition at the dorsal edge of the LC core or even more dorsal than LC core); medium size MP cells throughout the LC core; and FF cells that were strongly anterior-posterior oriented and located on the dorsal edge of the LC core.</p><p>Loughlin also observed &quot;small, round cells&quot; which might be similar to the &quot;oval&quot; cells reported by Shimizu et al. (SHIMIZU, N., OHNISHI, S., SATOH, K. and TOHYAMA, M. 1978. Cellular Organization of Locus Coeruleus in the Rat as Studied by Golgi Method. Arch Histol Japon 41, 103-112). Did the authors happen to observe these?</p><p>Lines 496 – 499 – the finding of FF and MP specific networks of electrically coupled cells links nicely with the finding that LC pairwise correlated firing identified in extracellular recordings are cell-type specific (Totah, et al. 2018. Neuron 99, 1055-1068.e6), as are LC ensembles (Noei, et al. 2022. Proc National Acad Sci 119, e2116507119). This again is an important point because the present work serves to build a bridge between cell morphology and membrane characteristics with extracellular recordings of different unit types performed in functional/behavioral studies (Hirschberg, et al. 2017. <italic>eLife</italic> 6, e29808; Breton-Provencher, et al. 2022. Nature 1-7 doi:10.1038/s41586-022-04782-2).</p><p>The work is overall abbreviation heavy and the authors could write out ISD, EC, and CC instead of abbreviating them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I do not think there is sufficient evidence presented here to reject the notion that local NE is released and perhaps affects LC function. Although the authors take two different current injection approaches (resulting in 1 AP or 5 AP), we simply do not know where to sample to determine if NE is playing a role. Two explanation seems just as plausible as 'no chemical transmission'. (1) The multipatch approach could just not have neurons that receive NE from the upstream neurons.

However, this possibility has not been ruled out through their experiments as the horizontal slice preparation likely severed some axonal connections. The authors could try performing some experiments in coronal slices in which axonal connectivity may be somewhat more spared. Alternatively, they could moderate their claims in this aspect of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that coronal slice preparation may have more axons spared, and glutaminergic synaptic transmissions, if they do exist among LC neurons, may be more readily detected in coronal slices. However, we believe that these connections, if any, are sparse, and detecting these sparse connections with coronal slice preparation needs another large-scale connectivity study with extensive time and personnel investment. Thus, we chose not to pursue this line of research for this study, but we added a few sentences in the revision to discuss how we prepared the slices may affect our results (Line 503-507). Our claim was accordingly moderated as well in the revision. We could further explore this topic with the different slice preparation in our next study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also argue that their results support the idea that lateral inhibition through alpha2 adrenergic receptors does not occur in the LC. However, there is a wealth of data supporting the existence of lateral inhibition and the present finding are based on the stimulation of single LC-noradrenaline neurons without a more parametric analysis of different stimulation frequencies/timing. For example, it is possible, given that LC neurons often fire together, that the activity of many LC neurons at one time is required to detect lateral inhibition, as noted by the authors in the discussion. In addition, given previous work showing that the frequency and timing of spikes are important in producing and detecting lateral inhibition (see Rev. 2 comments below and Huang et al. 2007. Proc National Acad Sci 104, 1401-1406), further exploration of this question is warranted. The authors could attempt stimulation of multiple LC-noradrenergic neurons at one time (possibly using optogenetic approaches) and/or explore the parametric space more extensively. Alternatively, they could remove this section from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and interpretations of the data regarding lateral inhibition. In fact, we were fully aware of the prior wealth of data supporting the existence of lateral inhibition and have discussed possible reasons for the absence of lateral inhibition in our dataset. Now both reviewers provided additional potential explanations for this absence. The most plausible explanation appears to be that α2AR-mediated lateral inhibition is a population phenomenon, which would not be readily detected at the single-cell level in in vitro conditions. As reviewers suggested, we may need to vary spike frequency and timing to identify optimal spiking parameters (or stimulating multiple LC neurons at one time) to detect this phenomenon in slices. Alternatively, we could employ other approaches (optogenetic or chemogenetic approach) to activate a group of neurons at one time to evoke this phenomenon, as a recent preprint paper demonstrated (Line 527-534). All these are excellent suggestions, but it may take more than six months to complete these experiments since we need to train another person from scratch for LC recordings (the first author graduated from the program and has left the lab). We thus chose to remove most of the data (about α2AR-mediated lateral inhibition) from the paper in the revision, as the reviewers suggested. We do plan to further explore this interesting topic in our next study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Congratulations to the authors on an extremely difficult set of experiments, stunning anatomy, and careful analyses to address important and timely questions about the LC. Really (to my knowledge) no one has dug into the anatomy like this since a few Japanese groups in 1978/1979 and Americans in mid-1980's. An update was needed – and to couple them with recordings is a truly unique data set. I have some comments and questions which I hope will help the authors to improve the manuscript and connect it better with the existing literature.</p><p>One of the major strengths of the Author's work is the ability to potentially connect LC neuron types (FF and MP) with the two types of previously reported extracellular single unit. In light of that, additional characterization of a few things would be help to the field in making the connection to single units. The authors show clear data that FF cells may correspond to 'narrow units' because they have narrow AP width and have larger (albeit not significantly) AHP. Do FF have higher FR as do &quot;narrow units&quot;? Where were the FF neurons located in the LC core? The &quot;narrow units&quot; have been shown to be located throughout the core, but biased ventrally. This info would help link to existing extracellular study identifying multiple cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our work and agree that establishing the correspondence between LC neuron types (FF and MP) with previously reported two single unit types could enhance the significance of our findings. In light of a prior study in rat LC (Loughlin et al. 1986), FF cells as we defined here may correspond to the fusiform-shaped cells on the <italic>dorsal</italic> edge of the LC core (or the posterior horn). Given that “narrow units” are heavily biased toward the <italic>ventral</italic> part of the LC (Totah et al., 2018; Su and Cohen, 2022), our defined FF cells thus may not correspond to those “narrow units” reported in extracellular recordings. In addition, FF cells do not have a higher spontaneous firing rate than MPs (see Figure 2H), inconsistent with a higher firing rate of “narrow units” (Totah et al., 2018). Furthermore, there is a two-fold difference in spike width between “narrow units” and “wide units”, but the difference in spike duration (including the rise phase of first derivatives) between FF and MP is subtle despite being significant (Li et al., 2016). Therefore, there is no consistent evidence supporting that FF cells we defined here correspond to those “narrow units”. Likely, each single unit type may not be confined to a specific morphological type, or both single unit types are from the same MP type reflecting within-MP functional heterogeneity. The latter may be more likely given that MPs are a predominant LC cell type and they are more heterogeneous than FFs in terms of soma size and spatial distribution (Loughlin et al., 1986), as well as the electrophysiological properties (including AP half-width). To establish a real correspondence between cell types we defined here and those units recorded from extracellular recording may need a new systematic study. For instance, with in vivo loose patch recording, one can label these neurons via biocytin once the neurons are recorded in vivo. We have revised the Discussion regarding the correspondence between LC cell types with single units in the revision (Line 439-459).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is a bit strange that Figure 1C and 1D come after Figure 2.

Sholl analysis includes counting the number of dendritic (or axonal) intersections that occur at fixed distances from the soma in concentric circles. This analysis reveals the number of branches, branch geometry, and overall branching patterns of neurons. We included more technical details about this analysis in the revision (Figure 2 legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A (&quot;Cell 7 and Cell 2 is electrically coupled&quot;) – &quot;is&quot; should be &quot;are&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7C – This plot in C is confusing. The methods state that a horizontal (transverse) plane was used, therefore, ventral and dorsal should be medial and lateral. Can the Authors clarify this?</p></disp-quote><p>The plot in Figure 7C is a sagittal view of LC, not a horizontal view, and the proposed LC subdivisions and predominant cell types for each subdivision were adopted from Loughlin et al. 1986 with a slight modification. As mentioned in our response to a question below, estimating in vivo anatomical locations of two cell types (MP and FF) and identifying which LC subdivision they may be predominantly located at is difficult (e.g., by mapping each cell’s soma location to the Allen Brain Atlas), and therefore we could not generate an LC schematic diagram based on our real data. We have revised the Figure 7 legend to make this point clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 78 – strike &quot;the&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 94 – Can the authors comment on Why the RMP is so different from what was reported in earlier work (see Supplementary Table 5 in Chandler, Gao, and Waterhouse. 2014. Proc National Acad Sci 111, 6816-682)?</p></disp-quote><p>We reported the RMP values without correcting junction potentials, and these values are very similar to those reported in several previous reports (Ballantyne et al., 2004; Kuo et al., 2020). The difference between ours and Chandler, et al. 2014 may be due to the fact that RMP values in Chandler, et al. 2014 have been corrected with junction potentials. We added a statement to reflect this point in the revised Method section (Line 787 or 788).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 132-134 – The fact that the axon originated from different locations on FF versus MP cells is interesting. Is this common in other brain regions and various cell types? How does this affect spike generation and spike conductance based on axonal location? This could be useful to briefly discuss, but this comment is not a criticism or request for necessary information. This is just a curious question and something could be added only if the authors see how answering it could be beneficial to understanding LC-NE release and noradrenergic neuromodulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) in general have the axon originating from the soma, but a small subset of PNs could have the axon originating from the dendrites (Hamada et al., 2016). The dendrite-originated axon is more common in GABAergic interneurons (particularly VIP and SST-expressing interneurons) and aminergic neurons (Hausser et al., 1995). Therefore, it is common that neurons can have the axon originating from different locations, particularly for aminergic neurons. Given that action potential initiates from the axonal initial segment, the location where the axon originates will affect how synaptic inputs are integrated and converted into the outputs of the neurons. For those cells such as FF whose axons originate from the dendrite, those synapses made on the axon-bearing dendrite are in an electrotonically privileged position in evoking action potentials compared to synapses made on other dendrites. Therefore, MP and FF may have different synaptic integration mechanisms. We added a sentence to briefly illustrate this point in the revision (Line 170-172).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 145-148 – Given that there was a sampling bias with some slices heavily enriched with FF and other slices with MP, can the authors say the dorsal-ventral levels of the FF sample biased slices? I understood that horizontal/transverse slicing was used, so some slices were more ventral than others. Were surrounding slices stained to enable precise knowledge of the location in the dorsal-ventral axis? Prior work showed that single units of narrow type were biased to be more ventral (Totah, et al. 2018. Neuron 99, 1055-1068.e6) and ventrally distributed narrow waveform units have been shown to have distinct functional roles (Li, et al. 2016. Brain Res 1641, 274-290; Hirschberg, et al. 2017. eLife 6, e29808). Thus, showing that FF units are also ventrally biased would help link the present work with extracellular work.</p></disp-quote><p>With horizontal slicing (2-3 slices in total with 200 µm thickness), the first slice tends to include the posterior horn of the LC and the dorsal part of the LC core, while the last one or two slices are more likely to include the ventral part of the LC core as well as the anterior horn (based on the Allen Brain Atlas). If the cellular organization of mouse LC is the same as that of rat LC (illustrated by Laughlin et al.1986), the first slice is expected to bias toward FF cells (FF sample biased slices), while the last one or two slices bias toward MP cells (MP sample biased slices). Unfortunately, we lost track of the slice order (the first collected vs the last collected from each animal) of all recorded slices, and thus were unable to confirm if those FF sample biased slices were collected earlier than those MP biased slices. Nevertheless, we noticed that in each slice FFs in general appear to be closer to the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle (more dorsal) than MPs, suggesting FFs in mice may indeed be dorsally biased, similar to rat LC (Loughlin et al. 1986).

It would be helpful to clarify this. My understanding of Loughlin et al. 1986 is that they found: large MP cells in the ventromedial aspect of the LC core (consistent with later work by Hirschberg et al. and Li et al) and in the anterior horn of the LC (which is by definition at the dorsal edge of the LC core or even more dorsal than LC core); medium size MP cells throughout the LC core; and FF cells that were strongly anterior-posterior oriented and located on the dorsal edge of the LC core.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our description of this prior work was a bit simplified and incomplete.

These cells thus may not be included in our study (not labeled by the <italic>Dbh-cre</italic> line). However, we did see one or two cells of a similar profile out of ~700 cells recorded, which may be due to the fact that we accidentally patched a few unlabeled neurons.
