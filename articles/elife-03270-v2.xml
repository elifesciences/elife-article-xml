Notably, increased pHi is now acknowledged as a conserved characteristic of cancers and in cell models is confirmed to increase proliferation and migration as well as limit apoptosis. However, the significance of increased pHi for cancer in vivo remains unresolved. Using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we show that increased pHi is sufficient to induce dysplasia in the absence of other transforming cues and potentiates growth and invasion with oncogenic Ras. Using a genetically encoded biosensor we also confirm increased pHi in situ. Moreover, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models and clonal human mammary cells we show that limiting H<sup>+</sup> efflux with oncogenic Raf or Ras induces acidosis and synthetic lethality. Further, we show lethality in invasive primary tumor cell lines with inhibiting H<sup>+</sup> efflux. Synthetic lethality with reduced H<sup>+</sup> efflux and activated oncogene expression could be exploited therapeutically to restrain cancer progression while limiting off-target effects.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03270.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03270.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03270.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An individual can develop cancer if cells in their body gain genetic mutations that enable the cells to divide more rapidly and move—or metastasize—to other tissues and organs. These mutations can alter the chemistry of the cell; for example, the inside of a cancer cell is much more alkaline (has a higher pH) than the inside of a normal cell. This helps the cancer cells to grow and divide rapidly, and move to other parts of the body, but it is not clear how important this change in pH within the cell is for the development of cancer.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that many cancer cells increase the amounts or activities of the proteins that remove hydrogen ions from the cell, and so make the inside of a cell more basic. Here, Grillo-Hill et al. increased the amount of one of these proteins, NHE1, in fruit flies to study its effects on healthy cells.</p><p>The experiments showed that the larval cells that produced more NHE1 were more alkaline than normal cells, and this caused the cells to become less organized and grow more rapidly. Grillo-Hill et al. also found that NHE1 can work together with the oncogene RasV12 that promotes cancer development to enhance migration within the developing wings of the larvae.</p><p>Next, Grillo-Hill et al. tested whether the change in pH is necessary for cells to become cancerous. Flies missing the gene that makes NHE1 appeared normal. However, if these cells also have the oncogene Raf—which, like RasV12, promotes cancer—the inside of the cells gradually became so acidic that they died. Grillo-Hill et al. also found that blocking the activity of NHE1 in human cancer cells could lead to increased death but does not increase the death of normal cells.</p><p>Grillo-Hill et al.'s findings show that increasing the internal pH of healthy cells leads to characteristics similar to those found in cancer cells. Furthermore, cancer cells can die if they become more acidic. This suggests that targeting pH levels could guide the development of treatments for cancer that selectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03270.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03270.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>intracellular pH</kwd><kwd>synthetic lethality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM58642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Research Coordinating Committee Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Academic Senate grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increasing the internal pH of cells can induce dysplasia and enhance oncogene-increased cell growth, while decreasing the internal pH combined with oncogene expression leads to synthetic lethality.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysregulated pH is a common characteristic of cancer cells, which have a lower extracellular pH (pHe) and higher intracellular pH (pHi) than normal cells.

The higher pHi of cancer cells is paradoxical because increased production of metabolic acids generated by aerobic glycolysis would be predicted to lower pHi.

Therapeutic targeting of these proteins to reduce H<sup>+</sup> efflux and lower pHi has been suggested for limiting cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webb et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harguindey et al., 2013</xref>), based primarily on findings with xenograft models and isolated cells. Xenograft tumor growth is suppressed by inhibiting NHE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagarde et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) or MCT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonveaux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colen et al., 2011</xref>) activity.

Although previous studies suggest important roles for pH dynamics in regulating cancer cell behaviors, whether increased pHi is sufficient or necessary for cancer progression in vivo remains unresolved.</p><p>To better understand how H<sup>+</sup> efflux and increased pHi affect cancer cell behaviors we asked two distinct but related questions. First, is increased pHi by NHE1 over-expression in the absence of other transforming signals sufficient to induce dysplasia? Second, is H<sup>+</sup> efflux by NHE1 necessary for oncogene-induced dysplasia? We found that over-expression of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Dnhe2</italic>, an ortholog of mammalian NHE1, causes dysplasia, increases proliferation and facilitates oncogene-induced cell invasion in vivo. Additionally, we found that reducing H<sup>+</sup> efflux genetically or pharmacologically limits oncogene-induced increases in proliferation and has synthetic lethality with oncogenic Raf in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina as well as in human mammary epithelial cells expressing oncogenic RasV12.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To address our first question we overexpressed <italic>Dnhe2</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye imaginal discs.

In wild type <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the adult eye is a precisely patterned epithelial structure with hexagonal unit eyes, termed ommatidia, uniformly arrayed across the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, left). Wild type ommatidia contain eight photoreceptor neurons (R cells), forming a polarized, asymmetrical trapezoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, tracing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left). In <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> flies, ommatidial organization was disrupted and individual facets were irregular in shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, middle). In section, <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> retinae had misoriented ommatidia, abnormal cell fates and missing R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, middle). This phenotype is similar to disrupted tissue organization with expression of a short, unregulated isoform of <italic>Dnhe2</italic> in a subset of retinal cells using <italic>sevGAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simons et al., 2009</xref>). We also used <italic>eyelessGAL4</italic> to express <italic>Dnhe2</italic> earlier in eye development, which caused a very mild rough eye phenotype. To resolve whether increased H<sup>+</sup> efflux by <italic>Dnhe2</italic> is necessary for disrupted tissue architecture we generated transgenic flies expressing a mutant <italic>Dnhe2</italic><sup><italic>E358I</italic></sup>, analogous to the NHE1<sup>E266I</sup> mutation that abrogates H<sup>+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denker and Barber, 2002</xref>). Externally, <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic><sup><italic>E358I</italic></sup> retinae had subtle defects in patterning, including rare bristle placement defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, right). In section, no patterning defects were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, right), suggesting that dysplasia in <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> eyes is dependent on ion transport.</p><p>To determine whether <italic>Dnhe2</italic> over-expression increased pHi we generated transgenic flies expressing a genetically encoded, ratiometric mCherry-pHluorin pH sensor that was previously used to measure pHi in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koivusalo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). After ∼24 hr of transgene expression there was no detectable difference in pHi between wild type and <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> in wL3 eye imaginal discs (data not shown). However, in pupal eyes at 42 hr after puparium formation (42H apf), pHi in <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> was significantly higher than wild type in both apical non-neural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>) and in photoreceptor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, pHi in pupal eyes expressing the mutant <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic><sup><italic>E358I</italic></sup> was not different than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), indicating that this mutant lacks H<sup>+</sup> efflux. The delay between onset of transgene expression and increased pHi could be due to accumulation of functionally processed <italic>D</italic>Nhe2 protein. These data suggest that patterning defects in <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> retinae reflect constitutively increased pHi, although we cannot rule out possible effects of decreased pHe or altered sodium levels.</p><p>To determine the underlying cause of the adult rough eye phenotype, we examined <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> retinae at earlier time points in development. In wild-type pupal eyes, precise retinal organization is apparent on the apical surface with immunolabeling of the adherens junction protein beta-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, schematic drawing on right). Four central cone cells (blue) display stereotyped contacts, and are enwrapped by two semi-circular primary pigment cells (orange) to form the ommatidial core. Individual ommatidia are separated by a single layer of secondary pigment cells (yellow), with tertiary pigment cells (green) and bristles (purple) at alternating vertices to form the hexagonal shape of ommatidia; these cells are collectively referred to as lattice cells. <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> pupal eyes had severely disrupted cell shapes and tissue organization, and ommatidia overall were smaller than in wild type. Ommatidia had aberrant numbers of cone and primary pigment cells (pink).

At the level of cone cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, labeled ‘c’), 4 nuclei per ommatidium are present in wild type, and phalloidin labels the center of each ommatidium. The number and arrangement of nuclei were aberrant with <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> expression, although phalloidin labeling appeared similar to wild type. Optical sections ∼3 µm deeper in the epithelium reveal R cell nuclei arranged in a characteristic pattern revealed by the neuronal antigen Elav, where four R cells (R1/3/6/7) are visible in wild type. We saw strong phalloidin labeling in the center of each ommatidium, marking the nascent rhabdomeres. In <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> pupal eyes, the number and arrangement of R cells in this section were disrupted, and we did not see the phalloidin signal in the center of the ommatidia. Optical sections ∼3 µm deeper in wild type pupal eyes show the stereotyped arrangement of the other four R cells (R2/5/7/8). In <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> retinae, this organization was disrupted, and there are more Elav-negative nuclei present than in wild type. On the basal side of the WT pupal eyes, phalloidin-labeled asters mark the centers of ommatidia, and Elav-negative nuclei of lattice cells were seen. In <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> eyes, phalloidin-labeling was decreased and did not show the same pattern as in wild type. Additionally, Elav-positive nuclei persist in this layer, suggesting severe disorganization of R cells. There were also disorganized Elav-negative nuclei, which may be lattice cells. From these data, increasing pHi in the developing eye causes profound defects in tissue architecture that affect all cell types in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye, and shows severe disruption of patterning throughout this complex, multilayered epithelium. These phenotypes are consistent with dysplasia, and are similar to effects of expressing activated, oncogenic Raf, as shown below.</p><p>Consistent with increased pHi being a conserved proliferative signal from yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orij et al., 2012</xref>) to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pouysségur et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kapus et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Putney and Barber, 2003</xref>), cell proliferation was substantially increased with <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> expression. A regulated band of proliferation in wL3 eye imaginal discs termed the second mitotic wave (SMW) is present posterior to the morphogenetic furrow, a physical indentation in the epithelium that serves as a spatial and temporal benchmark of eye development. Posterior to the SMW, cells divide stochastically. With <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> expression, we found a significant increase in the number of proliferating phospho-histone H3 (phosH3) positive cells within this posterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). We also expressed <italic>Dnhe2</italic> in the posterior compartment of the developing wing imaginal disc using an <italic>engrailed</italic> driver (<italic>enGAL4</italic>).

In clonal human mammary MCF10A cells we found that loss of NHE1 activity lowers pHi and increases cell death selectively in cells expressing oncogenic RasV12. We first used an estrogen receptor-induced H-RasV12 (ER-RasV12) and suppressed NHE1 expression with shRNA. Tamoxifen-induced Ras expression markedly increased rate of pHi recovery from an acid load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Tamoxifen increased pHi in ER-Ras cells and with NT shRNA but not in vector control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, with NHE1 shRNA pHi was significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), indicating NHE1 is necessary for increased pHi with oncogenic Ras.

A similar NHE1-dependent increase in pHi was shown using MCF10A cells stably expressing H-RasV12 (sRasV12) and 5(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) to pharmacologically inhibit NHE1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>).

However, the balkanization of cancers by causative mutation or tissue of origin ignores the shared disease physiology in most cancers as highlighted by the ‘hallmarks of cancer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Dysregulated pHi is an emerging hallmark of cancer that is associated with traditional hallmarks, including resisting cell death, sustaining proliferative signaling, activating invasion and metastasis, deregulating cellular energetics and tumor-promoting inflammation. Therefore, targeting pHi-regulatory proteins in cancer cells could address distinct pathological characteristics in parallel.</p><p>Our data provide an in vivo functional corollary of the established increased pHi and upregulation of H<sup>+</sup> efflux mechanisms in cancer cells. Building on previous reports that NHE1 activity and expression is increased in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McLean et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miraglia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), we show that engineered over-expression of an NHE1 ortholog in vivo increased pHi by ∼0.3 pH units, which is comparable to the increase seen with oncogene transformation. Moreover, over-expression of <italic>Dnhe2</italic> was sufficient to induce dysplasia and hyper-proliferation phenotypes, and it enhanced oncogene-mediated invasion. Further, co-expressing <italic>RasV12</italic> and <italic>Dnhe2</italic> had a strong, synergistic effect on growth and invasion. A similar synergistic effect between expression of <italic>RasV12</italic> and the C subunit of the V-ATPase, <italic>Vha44</italic> was recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Petzoldt et al., 2013</xref>), which supports the ability of increased H<sup>+</sup> efflux to enhance RasV12-induced phenotypes. However, <italic>Vha44</italic> enhances invasion with RasV12 but not activated Src or Abl, suggesting an oncogene-specific synergy. Important to determine in future studies are the relative effects of increased pHi on growth and invasion, and whether decreased pHe contributes to the non-autonomous effects we observed in imaginal discs.</p><p>Our data also indicate that reducing H<sup>+</sup> efflux in cancer cells suppresses multiple pathological characteristics in parallel. Previous studies identified distinct responses to reduced H<sup>+</sup> efflux, such as tumor growth in xenograft models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagarde et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sonveaux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) or viability of isolated cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reshkin et al., 2003</xref>). We now show progressive effects of limiting H<sup>+</sup> efflux with oncogene expression, including initially suppressing hyper-proliferation and dysplasia, followed by decreasing pHi, and culminating in a synthetic lethal interaction with histological features of coagulative necrosis. Coagulative necrosis is characteristically found within the central region of solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Searle et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagarde et al., 1988</xref>), and is thought to be induced by extreme physiological cellular stresses. Removing <italic>Dnhe2</italic> in an otherwise wild type genetic background decreased pHi but had no effect on larval tissue morphology. <italic>Dnhe2</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup> retinal pHi in pupae was slightly higher than in larvae but not significantly different compared with wild type. These data suggest that in the absence of <italic>Dnhe2</italic>, pHi homeostasis during metamorphosis can be maintained by alternative ion transport mechanisms, changes in cellular buffering capacity and/or metabolic changes. While our <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies evaluate synthetic lethality in the ~20% <italic>Dnhe2</italic> homozygous mutant ‘escaper’ flies that survive to eclosion, our studies in several transformed cell lines also show a synthetic lethality interaction, suggesting a conserved mechanism. The synthetic lethal interaction we observed suggests H<sup>+</sup> efflux is necessary for dissipating oncogene-generated acids, most likely from increased glycolytic metabolism. Our studies further show that these lethal interactions occur in two genetically complex, physiologically adapted invasive tumor cell lines.</p><p>Our data build on the long-standing observation of increased pHi in cancer cells and suggest several new directions for future investigation. First, our findings indicate that the biosensor pHluorin can be used to resolve pHi dynamics in vivo during tumor formation and metastasis and whether there are spatially distinct pHi dynamics within a tumor that might inform us about tumor properties and plasticity. Second, the rough eye phenotype induced with <italic>GMR &gt; Dnhe2</italic> provides a new model for genetic screens to identify pH-sensitive pathways and previously unrecognized pH sensors regulating cell growth and tissue architecture. Dysplasia with increased pHi in the absence of oncogenes is likely in part dependent on cancer-promoting pH sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schönichen et al., 2013</xref>), including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the actin regulatory protein cofilin that support tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cance et al., 2013</xref>) and have increased activity at higher pHi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frantz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Third, the synthetic lethality we show suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting H<sup>+</sup> efflux transporters or pH sensors with selective roles in oncogene-induced responses could limit metastatic progression with minimal off-target effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic techniques were used.

Your article has been evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the research is interesting and potentially very exciting, putting intracellular pH as a primary contributor to carcinogenesis. However, the reviewers also agree that the phenotype is not well defined, and proper characterization will require additional experiments, probably including the analysis of new fly crosses. The reviewers feel that the work may well take more than the 2 month revision time frame, because new strains will likely be needed and this will be time consuming. You will need to decide whether to revise for <italic>eLife</italic> or withdraw and try another journal.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their major comments and arrived at the following consensus comments that will need to be addressed in a revised submission.</p><p>1) More analysis is needed to define the phenotypes of Nhe2 overexpression and loss of function. The present analysis is inadequate to determine whether the effects are consistent with altered proliferation, migration or other biology, as suggested by in vitro studies of NHE1. The standard approach for analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oncogenes and tumor suppressors is to compare clones of cells that do or do not contain the genetic alteration, typically using the FRT/Flipout system to generate mutant clones and twin spots. You should make clones of <italic>Dnhe2</italic> mutant cells in the proliferating epithelium (the eye or wing disc) and compare them to the twin-spot cloned to see whether the mutant clone has a change in cell number or cell size, and whether the labeled mutant cells have migrated away from their original location or invaded to other tissues. This will circumvent the issues of high lethality in some of your experiments.</p><p>2) The use of the GMR driver for expression means that Nhe2 is being over expressed in differentiating photoreceptors and accessory cells. This may compromise your ability to detect an effect on cell proliferation. A driver expressed in proliferating cells to allow you to detect changes in proliferation (e.g. additional cycles after the normal exit time).</p><p>3) A pHi indicator driven from an ubiquitous promoter should be used to allow comparison of pHi in altered clones with surrounding normal cells.</p><p>If these experiments allow clear conclusions as to the effects of Nhe2 gain and loss of function in conjunction with Ras and Raf oncogenes, then some of the more paradoxical results (e.g., reduced/increased pHi upon Nhe2 loss in larva/pupa) could be omitted and reserved for a subsequent paper in which the mechanisms are investigated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03270.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) More analysis is needed to define the phenotypes of Nhe2 overexpression and loss of function.

New data on the <italic>GMR&gt;Dnhe2</italic> phenotype in pupal retinae show clear effects on cell fate specification, cell-cell contacts and cell morphologies across cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). We also include new data from generating mosaic tissue to characterize <italic>Dnhe2</italic> overexpression phenotypes in wing epithelium. We expressed <italic>Dnhe2</italic> in the posterior compartment of the developing wing imaginal disc using an <italic>engrailed</italic> driver (<italic>enGAL4</italic>). We show autonomous effects of <italic>Dnhe2</italic> on proliferation and on dysplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F, G</xref>). We do not see evidence of <italic>en&gt;Dnhe2</italic>-expressing cells migrating out of the tissue across compartment boundaries, similar to our results using <italic>ptcGAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Dnhe2</italic> is not sufficient to induce migration alone.</p><p>We also include new data on <italic>Dnhe2</italic> enhancing oncogene-induced invasion. To determine effects on invasive phenotypes, we identified invasive cells based on their isolation in three dimensions from other GFP-positive cells in the wing disc. We found only a single example where a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stock and Schwab, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rofstad et al., 2006</xref>) cells that met this definition in either control or <italic>Dnhe2</italic>-expressing discs, and no examples in <italic>RasV12</italic>-expressing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, in <italic>ptc&gt;RasV12, Dnhe2</italic> discs, we found examples of invasive cells in all discs examined. Further, we found several different types of invasive behaviors, including basal expansion of the <italic>ptc</italic> stripe, single invasive cells and streams of cells migrating out of the stripe into neighboring tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we added new data on cell death with inhibiting NHE1 in two more tumor-derived cell types, MDA-MB-231 clonal mammary carcinoma cells and SW620 clonal colorectal cells.</p><p>We attempted but were unsuccessful in using twinspot analysis with <italic>Dnhe2</italic> over-expression. We spent several months generating the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines necessary for determining whether over-expression of <italic>Dnhe2</italic> increased clone size relative to a twinspot. We then spent two months testing heat-shock conditions (altered temperature and length of heat shock) for generating 1-2 clones per disc, which is necessary for analysis. However, we either obtained no clones or we obtained too many clones to properly match clone and twinspot.</p><p>We are unable to generate loss-of-function mosaic clones because the <italic>Dnhe2</italic> genomic locus is too close to the nearest flippase recognition site (FRT40A).</p><p><italic>2) The use of the GMR driver for expression means that Nhe2 is being over expressed in differentiating photoreceptors and accessory cells. This may compromise your ability to detect an effect on cell proliferation. A driver expressed in proliferating cells to allow you to detect changes in proliferation (e.g. additional cycles after the normal exit time)</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we performed additional experiments to test the effects of overexpressing <italic>Dnhe2</italic> using a different driver. We used two transgenic lines that contain the <italic>eyeless-GAL4</italic> (<italic>eyGAL4</italic>) driver, which is expressed in retinal cells from their specification during embryogenesis and crossed them to two different <italic>UAS-Dnhe2</italic> transgene insertion lines. We found that eyes in <italic>ey&gt;Dnhe2</italic> lines showed a less disrupted architecture than <italic>GMR&gt;Dnhe2</italic>, which may be because <italic>GMRGAL4</italic> is a very strong driver and likely generates higher <italic>Dnhe2</italic> expression than <italic>eyGAL4</italic>.</p><p><italic>3) A pHi indicator driven from an ubiquitous promoter should be used to allow comparison of pHi in altered clones with surrounding normal cells</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we agree this would be an ideal strategy to compare pHi in altered clones with surrounding normal cells. However, the suggested strategy is currently not technically feasible because it would require three fluorophores with non-overlapping spectra. In our transgenic lines, the pH-sensitive pHluorin (ex475, em535) is fused to pH-insensitive mCherry (ex587, em610) to normalize to expression of the biosensor. Therefore, only blue or far-red fluorophores could be used to mark clones. CFP (ex435, em485) cannot be used because it has spectral overlap with GFP. Existing fluorescent proteins toward the far-red end of the spectrum such as mKate (ex588, em635), E2-Crimson (ex611, em646) or mPlum (ex590, em649) have spectral overlap with mCherry.</p></body></sub-article></article>
