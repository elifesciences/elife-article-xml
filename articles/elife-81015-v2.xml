scientific pursuit. Here, we present a fast, cost-effective, and robust multicolor whole-organ 3D imaging method assisted with ultraviolet (UV) surface excitation and vibratomy-assisted sectioning, termed translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography (TRUST). With an inexpensive UV light-emitting diode (UV-LED) and a color camera, TRUST achieves widefield exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence imaging simultaneously while preserving low system complexity and system cost. Formalin-fixed specimens are stained layer by layer along with serial mechanical sectioning to achieve automated 3D imaging with high staining uniformity and time efficiency. 3D models of all vital organs in wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the 3D structure of their internal components (e.g., vessel network, glomeruli, and nerve tracts) can be reconstructed after imaging with TRUST to demonstrate its fast, robust, and high-content multicolor 3D imaging capability. Moreover, its potential for developmental biology has also been validated by imaging entire mouse embryos (~2 days for the embryo at the embryonic day of 15). TRUST offers a fast and cost-effective approach for high-resolution whole-organ multicolor 3D imaging while relieving researchers from the heavy sample preparation workload.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sectioning tomography</kwd><kwd>multicolor imaging</kwd><kwd>widefield microscopy</kwd><kwd>whole-organ imaging</kwd><kwd>embryology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16208620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Terence TW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26203619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Terence TW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TRUST, as a rapid and fully automated whole-organ imaging technique, enables high-resolution multicolor 3D imaging at low cost by using a UV-LED for widefield illumination and a color camera while relieving researchers from lengthy and laborious tissue processing protocols.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) whole-organ imaging with high fidelity has long been a scientific challenge. Mechanical sectioning followed by manual staining is a traditional approach for 3D histological imaging with almost no limitation on sample size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amunts et al., 2013</xref>. However, hundreds to thousands of slices must be mounted on glass slides, stained with dyes, and then imaged by a conventional bright-field microscope with a tile scanning to cover the whole slide. The entire procedure is highly labor-intensive and requires complicated image registration algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2006</xref> for 3D reconstruction. Moreover, sectioning before imaging could induce inevitable distortion in the reconstructed 3D image due to slice ruptures, which is impossible to be corrected by image processing approaches, hindering the broad applicability of this traditional method.</p><p>Over the past decade, many advanced tissue clearing protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ueda et al., 2020</xref> have been proposed to render opaque biological samples transparent and significantly reduce light scattering or absorption, thus facilitating volumetric imaging of thick tissue samples when combined with light microscopy approaches. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huisken et al., 2004</xref> is ideal for imaging large cleared specimens with its high acquisition speed, high spatial resolution, and high light efficiency. For example, single-cell resolution or subcellular-resolution imaging over the entire mouse brain has been achieved within hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref> or days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murakami et al., 2018</xref>, respectively. Many issues concerning tissue clearing have been resolved or mitigated recently. For example, the toxicity of solvents, particularly benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate, can be addressed by using its alternatives, like ethyl cinnamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henning et al., 2019</xref>, which also contributes to prolonged fluorescent protein emission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klingberg et al., 2017</xref>. Also, the active electrophoretic tissue clearing (ETC) device has been utilized in CLARITY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2013</xref> to accelerate the clearing process significantly. Perfusion-assisted agent release in situ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref> achieved much faster whole-body clearing without ETC, which may cause tissue degradation. In response to the potential tissue damage and molecular information loss, stabilization under harsh conditions via intramolecular epoxide linkages to prevent degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2018</xref> was proposed using a flexible polyepoxide to preserve the tissue architecture in organ-scale transparent tissues.</p><p>Although both tissue clearing and LSFM are still under active development, barriers remain despite the significant accomplishment. For instance, the detective objective lens with a long working distance is generally required by LSFM when imaging large-volume samples, limiting the highest attainable resolution due to the consequent reduction in numerical aperture (NA). Besides, tissue clearing, especially for large samples, still need to balance the clearing effect and time cost to avoid tissue degradation. For example, aqueous techniques show relatively high biocompatibility, biosafety, and preservation of protein function, which, however, may take a longer time. Therefore, despite the destructive nature of the imaging process, block-face serial sectioning tomography has also gained much attention for automated and registration-free 3D imaging of large specimens. In this imaging and sectioning scheme, tissue clearing is not needed. More importantly, the imaging volume is relatively easy to be scaled up through engineering modification of the sectioning system, e.g., enlarging the sample holder. By far, spinning disk-based confocal microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seiriki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seiriki et al., 2019</xref>, two-photon microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Economo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>, multiphoton microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdeladim et al., 2019</xref>, microscopy with ultraviolet surface excitation (MUSE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fereidouni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2019</xref>, optical coherence microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Min et al., 2020</xref>, and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2017</xref> have been utilized for block-face serial sectioning tomography. However, there are other challenges in this field, including high system cost, time-consuming tissue processing (e.g., staining or embedding), and the slow imaging speed with point-scanning-based imaging systems. To this end, wide-field large-volume tomography (WVT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2016</xref> proposed real-time labeling to reduce the time cost of sample staining significantly. However, the imaged sample must be embedded into a resin block after several days of processing to achieve fine sectioning by a microtome, which can also induce apparent tissue shrinkage due to dehydration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong et al., 2013</xref> and is detrimental in high-resolution whole-organ imaging.</p><p>By far, numerous organ-scale imaging systems have been proposed with different focuses and strengths. With the goal of time-efficient, inexpensive, and multicolor large-volume 3D imaging, we developed translational rapid ultraviolet-excited sectioning tomography (TRUST) with the merits of both MUSE and WVT while bypassing the need for additional sample processing and keeping the entire system setup simple and cost-effective. More specifically, the short penetration depth of the UV light is utilized in TRUST for fast widefield block-face imaging. Meanwhile, formalin-fixed samples can be directly imaged by TRUST, and the tissue will be labeled layer by layer along with vibratomy-assisted serial sectioning. Compared with whole-organ pre-staining, real-time staining can tremendously reduce the overall staining time, considering that the diffusion timescale correlates quadratically with the tissue thickness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>. Furthermore, the real-time staining is well fitted with the shallow penetration depth of the UV light.</p><p>While TRUST does achieve rapid 3D imaging with subcellular resolution, its unique strength lies in its high-content imaging ability with a cost-effective and straightforward setup. Oblique illumination using an inexpensive ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV-LED) is implemented as the light source to simultaneously excite molecular-specific fluorescence and autofluorescence signals, which can then be collectively captured by a color camera. Many fluorescent dyes with different emission spectra can be excited simultaneously by the UV light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fereidouni et al., 2017</xref>, providing a broad and informative color palette. In TRUST, we mainly applied two fluorogenic dyes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref> (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole [DAPI] and propidium iodide [PI]) together for double labeling to provide high color contrast and reveal rich biological information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nile red and Dil have also been applied for lipid staining in TRUST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To characterize the performance and examine the robustness of the proposed system, all vital organs in mice were imaged. To further show the full potential of TRUST, whole mouse embryos at different stages have also been imaged. The detailed image comparison demonstrates that TRUST is highly desirable for large sample imaging, showing great promise as a tool for developmental biology studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRUST system setup and workflow</title><p>In TRUST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>), the short penetration depth in tissue of obliquely illuminated light from UV-LED (~285 nm) is the key to achieving widefield block-face imaging.

Besides, it can prevent the objective lens from being affected by liquid evaporation or fluctuation, ensuring high-quality imaging throughout the entire whole-organ imaging process. Two pieces of quartz mounted on the waterproof case are used to transmit the UV illumination beam and the excited fluorescence signal.</p><p>The workflow of the whole system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) can be simplified as a loop of three steps: (1) the surface layer of the sample immersed under chemical dyes will be labeled within ~150 s <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>; (2) the region of interest of the current layer, which consists of multiple fields of view (FOVs), will be acquired through motorized raster-scanning and subsequently stitched in parallel by a lab-built program; and (3) the vibratome will cut off the imaged layer and expose the layer underneath to the staining solutions. This loop will end when the whole organ has been imaged completely. To realize fully automated serial imaging, triggering circuits and corresponding control programs have been developed for synchronizing the entire TRUST system.</p><p>Because the sample is stained during the imaging step in TRUST, the labeling protocol can be thought of as real-time staining.

Apart from the high time cost, traditional staining protocols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seiriki et al., 2019</xref> may also lead to uneven staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) due to the nature of passive diffusion. More importantly, agents like Triton X-100, which is used for increasing the permeability of tissue and accelerating the staining speed, can increase the transparency of the sample by washing away the lipids inside the tissue. Then, the imaging contrast of TRUST will be deteriorated due to the increased penetration depth of UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–g</xref>). In comparison, four coronal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>) with positions indicated by the white dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> show the stable sectioning performance of vibratome and uniform staining throughout the whole-brain imaging process.</p><p>When compared with other advanced 3D imaging systems, the advantages of TRUST are more related to its high-content multicolor imaging capability with an outstanding balance in terms of time-efficiency (sample preparation time and imaging speed), imaging resolution, and cost-effectiveness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), by enjoying the benefits of the UV surface excitation and double labeling. Unlike the staining protocol used in MUSE or WVT, we developed a real-time double-labeling protocol that perfectly fits our TRUST system. The double labeling with DAPI and PI helps to reveal more biological information and achieve better image quality than that of staining with only PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, PI staining can clearly reveal cytomorphological details of neurons while the cell bodies of glial cells are only slightly labeled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hezel et al., 2012</xref>, hence differentiating neurons from glial cells in the brain through morphological differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In contrast, DAPI almost only stains cell nuclei. As a result, with the combination of DAPI and PI, TRUST can provide similar imaging contrast as Nissl stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), where the Purkinje cell layer can be easily differentiated from the granular layer or molecular layer. Furthermore, the color contrast of images can be improved by double labeling, especially for regions with a high density of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and h</xref>) because the cytoplasm stained by PI (red) can act as a background for DAPI-labeled cell nuclei to stand out (green and blue).</p><p>Although intrinsic autofluorescence is unwanted information in many cases, which can be regarded as background signals, much effort has been spent to reveal meaningful biological information in 2D label-free imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ojaghi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhartia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costantini et al., 2021</xref>, which can also be utilized in TRUST. For example, the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), nerve tracts (e.g., lateral olfactory tract <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref> or anterior commissure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), and myelinated fiber bundles in the caudate putamen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>) have been identified with TRUST even without any labeling. Also, blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>) can be identified based on negative contrast because their autofluorescence signal intensity is lower than that of the surrounding tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mehrvar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Staniszewski et al., 2013</xref>. To further enhance the contrast of the vessel network in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2w and x</xref>), the mouse was perfused transcardially with a mixture of black ink and 3% w/v gelatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In TRUST, the mixed dyes with a broad emission spectrum (blue to red) make the fluorescence signals less affected by the autofluorescence background by extracting signals from different color channels for different types of tissue components. For example, although hepatocytes in liver tissue are hard to be differentiated from the autofluorescence background in the red channel, the image contrast is high in the green and blue channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a–d</xref>). Also, although the autofluorescence background is strong in the green and blue channels for some regions in the mouse brain, the cells remain evident in the red channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4e–h</xref>). With background subtraction and dynamic range adjustment in different color channels of TRUST images, the 3D distribution of cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1q-s</xref>) and nerve fiber bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2t–v</xref>) in the brain can be digitally extracted.

Therefore, 3D imaging of a whole mouse embryo is vitally essential to assist biologists in understanding any anatomical and functional changes. However, imaging the whole embryo is still a scientific challenge and suffers from issues like low imaging resolution (micro-CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wong et al., 2012</xref> and optical projection tomography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ban et al., 2019</xref>) or a limited number of sections (histological imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In the above, we have already demonstrated the advantages of our TRUST system, especially its ability for handling various types of organs regardless of their sizes, and its high imaging speed due to the real-time staining and widefield imaging configuration. Therefore, the TRUST system theoretically has the potential to address the needs of developmental biology.</p><p>We first imaged two heads from two mouse embryos with intact skulls (embryonic day (E) 15: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–f</xref>; E18: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g–l</xref>). The whole imaging procedure (including staining, scanning, and sectioning) for the embryo head at E15 (9.9 mm × 9 mm × 6.9 mm, 2.6×10<sup>11</sup> voxels with 24 bits RGB channels, 137 sections) took ~20 hr, and the reconstructed 3D model from different viewing angles is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. The skin outside the embryo head at E18 was manually removed to achieve better sectioning performance with the vibratome. It took ~32 hr for both imaging and staining (9.4 mm × 7.8 mm × 10 mm, 3.1×10<sup>11</sup> voxels with 24 bits RGB channels, 201 sections). Comparing the two datasets makes it possible to determine the evolution of main morphological features over different developing stages. For example, close-up images of the retina areas from the two embryos are compared, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> (E15) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref> (E18). It can be observed that the inner plexiform layer (IPL) becomes apparent only in the E18 embryo, which is consistent with the neural differentiation status of the retinal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2016</xref>. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref> correspond to the cerebral cortex regions in the brain of the E15 embryo and E18 embryo, respectively.

The total imaging and staining process for the E15 embryo (9.9 mm × 7.8 mm × 12.8 mm, 4.2×10<sup>11</sup> voxels with 24 bits RGB channels, 256 sections) took ~2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m–r</xref>).

The acquired datasets clearly visualized the morphology of whole mouse embryos and can be further processed to deliver quantitative 3D information. For example, a quantitative volume comparison between embryos at different stages has been made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Also, anatomical differences can be found between the E15 and E18 embryos. For example, close-up images of the cartilage primordium regions from the E15 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4p</xref>) and E18 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4v</xref>) show noticeable anatomical differences due to the ossification. Also, the morphological difference between the submandibular gland in the E15 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4q</xref>) and E18 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4w</xref>) is consistent with the fact that the acini in a mouse embryo will not complete lumenization until E17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsen et al., 2010</xref>. Finally, because of differentiation, cell nuclei in the thymic rudiment regions of the E15 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4r</xref>) are obviously larger than that in the E18 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4x</xref>), which is also consistent with the histological images in eHistology Atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To better illustrate the difference between the two embryos, two whole sections from two embryos with positions marked by the orange solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1s</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

UV light excited exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence signals can be collectively captured by a color camera, providing a broad and informative color palette. The entire brain and all vital organs from adult mice have been imaged by TRUST with high quality and free of distortion, demonstrating its high performance and robustness. Also, the structural and morphological comparison of the two sets of images from two whole mouse embryos at the developing stages of E15 and E18 shows that TRUST is a promising tool for embryonic developmental study.</p><p>TRUST is at its early developing stage. To further improve the performance of the system, future research development can be carried out in the following aspects: First, the imaging resolution of TRUST is anisotropic. The lateral resolution of TRUST with a 0.25 NA objective lens is ~1.25 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). However, the axial resolution of TRUST can be 10–50 µm, which is a major limitation when compared with other 3D imaging techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>, caused by (1) the sectioning thickness of the vibratome or (2) the optical-sectioning thickness provided by UV surface excitation. For the sectioning thickness, although a small block of the liver has been successfully imaged by TRUST with a 10 µm interval, to produce even and consistent sections, the sectioning thickness for other samples is all set as 50 µm. In the future, a more advanced vibratome with better performance (e.g., VF-300-0Z, Precisionary Instruments Inc) can be used to alleviate this problem. The optical-sectioning thickness provided by the UV surface excitation (~10–20 µm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fereidouni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yoshitake et al., 2018</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2019</xref>) can be decreased to ~1 μm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2019</xref> by doping the sample with UV-absorbing dyes. However, this method will impose more stringent requirements on mechanical sectioning. Therefore, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, using an objective lens with high NA and applying a deconvolution algorithm (e.g., Lucy–Richardson deconvolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lucy, 1974</xref>) could be a simple and sufficient way to improve the lateral and axial resolutions while relaxing the requirement of the mechanical sectioning.</p><p>Besides, the total scanning time (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) for each section of the TRUST system can be further reduced, which is calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the exposure time for each FOV, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the motor scanning time required to move from the first FOV to the next FOV, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the total number of FOVs.

Moreover, the FOV is relatively small (600 µm × 450 µm) with the current camera (DS-Fi3, Nikon Corp.; chip size: 6.91 mm × 4.92 mm) and 10×objective lens. Upgrading the camera with a large chip size (e.g., GS3-U3-123S6C-C, Edmund Optics Inc; chip size: 14.13 mm × 10.35 mm) and using a low magnification (e.g., 4×) objective lens can reduce the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> by a factor of ~25. As for the degraded imaging resolution, it can be later recovered with the help of deep-learning-based super-resolution networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).

Although preliminary imaging results of the fresh mouse brain with real-time staining by Hoechst 33342 at the concentration of 20 µg/ml have been acquired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), a more advanced vibratome (e.g., VF-300-0Z, Precisionary Instruments Inc) specifically for fresh tissue sectioning is needed in the future to improve the sectioning quality. Deconvolution and extended depth of focus algorithms applied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref> may also be applied together to relieve the issue.</p><p>In addition, by leveraging the fact that TRUST provides exogenous molecular-specific fluorescence and endogenous content-rich autofluorescence imaging simultaneously, the high-content imaging capability of TRUST can be further improved. Firstly, more types of fluorogenic probes targeting components other than the cell nucleus can further enrich the imaging contents of TRUST. For example, protein (8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid, Sigma-Aldrich) and lipids (Nile red or Dil, Sigma-Aldrich, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) can also be labeled. Besides, immunostaining, as one of the most powerful techniques for labeling cells/tissue with high molecular specificity, could be directly applied to each sectioned layer for a follow-up study because vibratome sectioning does not involve any harsh organic solvents. Also, minor modifications can be made to the current TRUST system in order to automate the whole immunostaining process. For example, prior to imaging the exposed surface layer of the tissue block, several water pumps can be used to vary the chemical solutions in the water tank of the vibratome to mimic the general staining procedures applied in immunostaining. To reduce the number of antibodies needed, a spray can be utilized to deliver the antibody onto the surface of the sample, instead of directly submerging the sample into the antibody solutions. Second, autofluorescence spectra of some tissue components can overlap with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jamme et al., 2013</xref>, making them hard to be differentiated. Automatically switching between different spectral windows according to the desired imaging targets by electrically tunable band-pass filters (e.g., KURIOS-VB1, Thorlabs Inc) is one possible solution, despite the exposure time for each FOV could increase because of time multiplexing.</p><p>Finally, the staining protocols can be optimized. Choosing dye with high fluorescence enhancement factors upon binding to its target, e.g., SYTOX Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, 500-fold improvement) and YOYO-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc,&gt;1000 fold improvement), can further decrease the background signal caused by the staining solutions. Another benefit that comes with it is that the concentration of the staining solutions can be further increased to accelerate the staining speed. Also, the speed control of adding additional dyes with the pump for maintaining the concentration of the stains can be more accurate through negative feedback: the pumping speed will be automatically adjusted with the change of average brightness of each 2D TRUST image.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>TRUST imaging system</title><p>The short penetration depth of UV light is utilized for 2D block-face imaging. By combining with a vibratome, the TRUST system can realize serial surface imaging followed by sectioning for the whole sample. The schematic of the TRUST system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>. Firstly, UV light from a mounted LED (M285L5, Thorlabs Inc) is slightly focused on the surface of the specimen by a pair of lenses (#67–270, Edmund Optics Inc; LA4306-UV, Thorlabs Inc) with an oblique orientation. Then, excited fluorescence and autofluorescence signals will be collected by an objective lens (Plan N 10× / 0.25 NA, Air, RMS10X, Olympus Corp.), refocused by an infinity-corrected tube lens (ACA254-200-A, Thorlabs Inc), reflected by an aluminum mirror (PF10-03-G01, Thorlabs Inc), and finally detected by a color camera (DS-Fi3, Nikon Inc). An optical long-pass filter can be placed before the tube lens to further reduce the backscattered UV light. A custom-built 2-axis angle adjustable platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) under the vibratome (VF-700-0Z, Precisionary Instruments Inc) ensures the focal plane of the objective lens is parallel with the surface of the sample sectioned by the vibratome. The selected vibratome can slice samples up to 20 mm in diameter, and another model (VF-800-0Z, Precision Instruments Inc) can be used when imaging and slicing even larger samples (up to 100 mm in diameter). Two motorized stages (Motor-<italic>x</italic>: L-509.20SD00, Motor-<italic>y</italic>: L-509.40SD00; PI miCos GmbH) and a manually tunable <italic>z</italic>-axis stage are used for 2D raster-scanning and objective lens focusing, respectively. A 3D printed plastic waterproof case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) can reduce the fluorescence background from the staining solutions, hence improving the imaging contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), by keeping most of the space between the objective lens and sample surface filled with air instead of staining solutions. A waterproof case can also keep the imaging plane uninfluenced by the fluid level fluctuations induced by mechanical scanning and liquid evaporation. Two pieces of quartz mounted on the waterproof case are used for the transmission of both UV light and excited signals.</p><p>The workflow of the whole imaging system is basically the repetition of three steps as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>: Step (1) the surface layer of the sample with an optical-sectioning thickness provided by UV surface excitation will be quickly stained by the chemical dyes (DAPI and PI) with ~150 s; Step (2) during imaging mode, the motor-<italic>y</italic> will move rightwards until the objective lens is located above the imaged sample. Then, the surface layer will be 2D raster-scanned by the 2-axis motorized stages, and all obtained tiles will be automatically stitched in parallel by our lab-developed programs based on MATLAB (MathWorks Inc); Step (3) during the sectioning mode, the motor-<italic>y</italic> will move leftwards to its original position, leaving enough space for vibratome sectioning. At the same time, the sample holder will move upwards at the same distance as the slicing thickness to maintain the sample surface always at the focal plane of the objective lens. The above three steps will be repeated until the whole organ has been completely imaged. To realize fully automated serial imaging and sectioning, a custom driving system based on a low-cost microcontroller unit (MCU) (Mega 2560, Arduino) has been developed to trigger and synchronize all hardware, including the 2-axis motorized stages, vibratome, and color camera. A corresponding control interface based on LabVIEW (National Instruments Corp.) has also been developed to adjust key scanning parameters such as the step size and travel range of the motorized stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Once mice (wild-type C57BL/6, 2 months old) were sacrificed, organs or embryos inside were harvested immediately and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution for a minute. Then, the organs or embryos will be submerged under 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at room temperature for 24 hr for fixation.</p><p>To achieve high sectioning quality, it is common to embed the tissue samples into agarose. For different types of tissues, the suggested concentration of the agarose and the corresponding working parameters of the vibratome will be varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Precisionary Instruments LLC, 2022</xref>). To realize stable performance when sectioning hard organs (e.g., a fixed mouse spleen), 10% (w/v) gelatin is preferred for embedding because post-fixation by NBF overnight can tighten the connection between the sample surface and surrounding gelatin after crosslinking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Treiber et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffioen et al., 1992</xref>. Otherwise, the sample can be pulled out from the embedding medium during sectioning. Moreover, because of the porous structure of lung tissue, perfusing it with low-temperature agarose or gelatin through its trachea is necessary to provide adequate support inside the tissue.</p><p>All animal experiments were conducted in conformity with a laboratory animal protocol approved by the Health, Safety and Environment Office of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (license number: AEP16212921).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Real-time molecular staining</title><p>Typically, a specimen should be washed after staining to remove residual unbonded probes on its surface and avoid strong fluorescence background. In TRUST, samples need to be immersed into the staining solutions during the whole experiment for real-time staining. Therefore, the dyes we used should have high specificity, and the intensity of the excited fluorescence signal should only be strong when the probes have been attached to the targets. Fluorogenic probes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Werther et al., 2021</xref> show increased fluorescence upon target binding.

Obviously, fluorogenic probes are naturally suited for real-time staining. Lots of different fluorogenic probes have been synthesized for targeting various components, like proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Werther et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2017</xref>, lipid droplets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fam et al., 2018</xref>, cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lukinavičius et al., 2014</xref>, and mitochondrial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2020</xref>. DAPI and PI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barcellona et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Unal Cevik and Dalkara, 2003</xref> are two of the most commonly used and commercially available fluorogenic probes used together in TRUST for double-labeling to improve image color contrast and reveal more biological information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the staining speed of PI is much faster when compared with DAPI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2016</xref>, the staining time needed for each round can be simply quantified by analyzing changes in the total number of cells labeled by DAPI over time, which is approximately 150 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Nile red and Dil are two common lipids staining dyes that are almost nonfluorescent in polar solvents (e.g., water) but undergo fluorescence enhancement in nonpolar environments. Their compatibility has also been tested with TRUST by imaging the brain and liver tissue without washing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>For small samples, the concentration of the staining solutions in the tank will not change significantly throughout the entire imaging process. However, for a large sample, e.g., a whole mouse brain, additional chemical dyes should be added into the water tank by a pump during imaging to maintain the concentration of the solution to be stable. The starting concentration of the staining solutions and the pumping rate applied for different samples are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. Because the change of the concentration of solutions is relatively slow, in practice, the control of the pumping rate can be manually tuned based on the average brightness of the imaged sections. In the future, a negative feedback control system can be developed to automatically adjust the pumping rate according to the brightness of the imaged section in real-time. It is also possible to simply replace the water tank of the vibratome with one that can hold a larger volume of staining solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image processing and statistical analysis</title><p>The electrical signal from MCU synchronizes the motor scanning and triggers the color camera to capture and save the current FOV as a binary file through its built-in program. A lab-built program based on MATLAB has been developed to further convert binary files to TIFF images and downsize them into different scales (4×, 25×, and 50×) in real-time to facilitate the low-resolution 3D rendering later. Also, the program will automatically start to stitch all mosaic FOVs since the current section of the sample has been fully scanned in order to monitor imaging results during the experiment. This feature could highly improve the image processing efficiency, considering the large size of the whole dataset (e.g.,~2 TB for a whole mouse brain).</p><p>Image registration is not necessary for stitching because relative positions between FOVs are well determined by the driving parameters of the high-precision stages. Another reason is that the cross-sections are mostly flat due to the reliable performance of the vibratome. To avoid a grid-like shading pattern on the stitched section due to uneven illumination, conventional flat-field correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seibert et al., 1998</xref> and linear blending algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Solina and Leonardis, 1999</xref> have been applied. If necessary, notch filters in the frequency domain can be used to further eliminate the periodic stripes. The color dynamic range of images can also be further adjusted to enhance the contrast. The removal of the background surrounding the sample can be realized by manual masking to achieve high accuracy and minimize artifacts. The extraction of all glomeruli (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>) in the 3D dataset of the mouse kidney was enabled with the assistance of a machine learning library, Detectron2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2019</xref>, where TRUST images of two sections of a mouse kidney were manually labeled for the network training.</p><p>To render the 3D model, acquired 2D sections can be directly input to Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) or ImageJ (NIH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schneider et al., 2012</xref> with a <italic>z</italic>-axis interval set as the sectioning thickness. Limited by the computational power, a low-resolution mode is generally applied when rendering the whole block, and only a small zoomed-in region will be rendered in high resolution to show more details. 3D structures of some biological components can be extracted based on their colors or signal intensities. For example, nerve fibers in the brain appear to be bright in blue/green channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2t–v</xref>), cell nuclei appear to be bright in the red channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1q–s</xref>), and white pulp regions in the spleen appear to be bright in blue/green channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3v</xref>). Also, the excited signal from vessels is obviously lower than that from surrounding tissues. Therefore, the negative contrast of the vessel network in organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2w, x</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j, o</xref>) can be utilized for segmentation. All extracted structures have been rendered with pseudo color to enhance their visibility. Lookup tables of pseudo colors mostly represent the normalized intensity, except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2w</xref>, where the color varies with the axis perpendicular to the coronal plane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Code availability</title><p>The code for detectron2 is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2">https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>has applied for a patent (US Provisional Patent Application No.: 63/254,546) related to the work reported in this manuscript</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>has a financial interest in PhoMedics Limited, which, however, did not support this work</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has a financial interest in V Path Limited, which, however, did not support this work</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>has a financial interest in PhoMedics Limited, which, however, did not support this work.

By combining iterative mechanical sectioning, automated labeling with fluorogenic dyes, UV-based surface illumination, and widefield multicolor detection, entire late gestation mouse embryos and terminally developed tissues can be imaged at cellular-scale resolution. Importantly, the strengths and weaknesses of the method are forthrightly presented. Ultimately, this work will be of great interest to developmental biologists, medical biologists, and clinicians, all of whom routinely work with specimens that are prohibitively large for labeling and imaging using classical mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81015.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dean</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00t9vx427</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.11.468237">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.11.468237v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see below, both reviewers agreed that the presented technique is interesting and provides significant advantages over existing methods. As such, the reviewers found the paper appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. That being said, both reviewers thought that additional quantitative analyses were necessary to evaluate the merits and potential of the method. This includes the lateral and axial resolution, the penetration depth of the UV illumination, registration accuracy, the accuracy of the segmented results. Furthermore, greater effort could be made to discuss in the manuscript how this method is a significant advance over previous methods that also used ultraviolet surface excitation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific Comments</p><p>1.

On the one side, we believe that the potential of TRUST has not yet been fully exploited as mentioned in the <italic>Discussion</italic>, and the imaging speed of TRUST can be further improved by a factor of tens, thus reducing the UV illumination time. On the other side, regarding the stability of the light source in TRUST, the typical lifetime of the UV-LED (M285L5, Thorlabs Inc) used can be over 10,000 hours, which is much longer than the typical imaging time (tens of hours). From our experimental results, we also successfully acquired high-quality TRUST images with high uniformity, further validating the high stability of the UV-LED. Furthermore, we used the compatible and matching LED driver (LEDD1B, Thorlabs Inc) for stable and reliable control of the driving current of the LED.</p><p>Deep-UV light sources have been used in many biological imaging systems<sup>1–3</sup>. For example, TRUST is developed from MUSE<sup>3–5</sup> which is also a method based on ultraviolet surface excitation. From the previous findings, the biological samples do not have any biochemical differences with or without MUSE staining and imaging<sup>3</sup>. The MUSE system with a dual-UV-LED setup has also been demonstrated previously<sup>4</sup>. Besides, although the imaging time for the whole mouse brain by TRUST can take tens of hours, due to the short penetration depth of the UV light, the exposure time of UV light for each imaged field of view (FOV) is short (~250 ms).</p><p>However, we agree that UV can still be hazardous to the sample being exposed, especially with multiple UV-LEDs<italic>.</italic> To relieve the issue while maintaining the high scanning speed, motors with high speed and/or cameras with a large chip size can be used. For example, by using the color camera (Digital Sight 10, Nikon) with a much larger chip size (35.8 mm ´ 23.8 mm) and with the help of super-resolution networks as mentioned in the <italic>Discussion</italic>, the total improvement factor can be over 150 times even with the original motors and one UV-LED setup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In system configuration, the light was illuminated oblique. Why not configure it coaxially?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your question. Coaxial illumination is commonly utilized in fluorescence microscopy, which facilitates the use of high NA and short working distance objective lenses in order to improve the achievable imaging resolution.</p><p>However, in TRUST, deep-UV light (~285 nm) is used as the excitation source and the excitation signals mostly fall in visible spectra (considering both the sensing spectra of the used color camera and also the applied fluorescent probes). Therefore, optical elements that perform well in both deep-UV and visible range are needed for coaxial configuration. However, these elements can be more expensive. Also, the working distance of the objective lens used in TRUST for subcellular imaging is fairly enough for the oblique illumination. If high NA and short working distance objective lenses are needed for better imaging resolution, sapphire light guides could be used to save the space needed for oblique illumination<sup>6</sup>. Moreover, as demonstrated previously<sup>6</sup>, the water immersion and the oblique illumination are helpful for further reducing the penetration depth of light (better axial resolution). Finally, due to the oblique illumination, traditional brightfield microscopes can be easily adapted to the 2D version of the TRUST system by simply adding a low-cost UV-LED, showing the high translational value of TRUST.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In organ-level imaging, important internal components have been visually extracted with a post-processing. However, in spleen imaging, vascular networks including veins and arteries were not reconstructed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. In general, although much effort has been spent to reveal meaningful biological information in autofluorescence imaging<sup>7–9</sup>, relatively low imaging specificity is still one major limitation when compared with fluorescence imaging. For example, autofluorescence spectra of tissue components can overlap with each other and the signal intensity of individual components can be different even under the same excitation source. And that is the key reason why fluorescent dyes are also applied in TRUST for high-content imaging.</p><p>In the case of vascular networks, they can be well extracted when the surrounding tissue shows higher autofluorescence signal intensity than that of blood vessels<sup>10</sup>, as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. However, in the case of spleen imaging, unfortunately, the background cannot provide sufficient contrast for the blood vessels’ digital extraction as shown in Figure 3x,y. Therefore, when high imaging specificity for vessels is required, instead of black ink perfusion as we demonstrated for brain vessel painting (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), the perfusion of fluorescent dyes as previously demonstrated<sup>11</sup> should be used to realize better imaging specificity and ease the procedure for vessel extraction. Importantly, the perfusion protocol is compatible with TRUST and will not add much time cost.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In this paper, the results were visualized and evaluated qualitatively. Authors are encouraged to provide the quantitative results. Especially for the case of whole mouse embryos, the biological changes over time can be quantified with various parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable recommendation. We agree that more effort should be made on quantitative analysis to fully explore the potential of TRUST. To show the potential of TRUST for facilitating biological study, for example, as shown in the newly added Figure 4—figure supplement 1, we can achieve volume quantification and comparison between embryos with different developmental stages. For simplicity of the demonstration, only two datasets were used. However, it already shows that TRUST is able to provide the possibility for developmental biology study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Not only the soft tissues, can it be applied to hard tissues such as bones or teeth? Is there any difference in the solution supply and the vibratomy operation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your questions. Relieving researchers from laborious and time-consuming tissue preparation work is one of the goals that we are aiming for. We select the vibratome on purpose because the major of biological tissues are relatively soft and can be directly sectioned by vibratome. All vital organs in mice and even the skull/spinal cord in mouse embryos have been sectioned and imaged successfully using TRUST with high quality. In case, when extremely hard biological samples (e.g., bones in adult mice) are needed for sectioning, protocols (e.g., decalcification) can be applied to soften the specimen. Besides, with the overall working principle of TRUST unchanged, a microtome can be used to replace the vibratome for hard tissue sectioning.</p><p>We provided a table (supplementary file 1a) about the parameters of the staining solutions, including the pumping rate for two chemical dyes based on the organs. Replacing the water tank of the vibratome with one that can hold a larger volume of staining solutions can also keep the chemical concentration relatively constant. For different types of tissues, the operation parameters of the vibratome will be varied to achieve the best sectioning performance as suggested by <italic>Precisionary Instruments Inc</italic> (https://github.com/HEY-SAI/Cutting-parameters/files/9595073/Cutting.parameters.pdf).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Is there any spatial error during the mechanical sectioning? If so, does it depend on the size and hardness of the sample or thickness of the slide? How do you correct this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your questions. Compared with the microtome or cryostat, the advantage of the vibratome is that it can be used in serial sectioning-based 3D imaging systems<sup>12–15</sup> for fixed or even fresh tissue, but we may need to pay more attention to achieve good slice quality.</p><p>For optimal sectioning quality, we directly integrated the high-end commercial vibratome (VF-700-0Z, Precisionary Instruments Inc) into TRUST. The slicing thickness and the hardness of the sample could certainly affect the sectioning quality. Therefore, although the claimed minimal sectioning thickness of the vibratome used is 10 µm, the sectioning thickness is mostly set as 50 µm to avoid imperfect sectioning and to produce even sections, which can also be shown in rendered supplementary videos (e.g., Figure 3-Video 1) where all sections of the heart have been rendered in high quality. In short, we did not observe any spatial error during the mechanical sectioning.</p><p>In addition, for samples with high toughness (e.g., fixed mouse heart or spleen), instead of agarose, 10% (w/v) gelatin is preferred as the embedding material because post-fixation by formalin overnight can tighten the connection between the sample surface and surrounding gelatin after cross-linking. Otherwise, the sample can be pulled out from the embedding medium during sectioning. As for porous tissue (e.g., lung tissue), perfusion or infiltration with low-temperature agarose or gelatin can provide adequate support inside the tissue after cooling and guarantee nice sectioning quality.</p><p>As for errors from spatial registration, lateral or axial registration of different layers is not necessary due to the high bidirectional repeatability (±0.2 µm) of the employed translation stages.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
