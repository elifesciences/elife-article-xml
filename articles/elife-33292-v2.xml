While considerable information has accumulated regarding recognition of the premature stop codon, less is known about the ensuing mRNA suppression. During the characterization of a second, distinct translational surveillance pathway (nonstop mRNA decay), we trapped intermediates in nonsense mRNA degradation.

Specifically, our results point to SKI-exosome decay and pelota-based ribosome removal as key steps facilitating suppression and clearance of prematurely-terminated translation complexes.

In NMD, recognition of an early stop codon destabilizes an mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morse and Yanofsky, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baserga and Benz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Losson and Lacroute, 1979</xref>). Foundational studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> revealed protein factors responsible for NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leeds et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hodgkin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pulak and Anderson, 1993</xref>). In the decades since, a large body of literature has highlighted similarities and differences in NMD between yeast and metazoans. For example, while both yeast and metazoan NMD involve a core set of three proteins (UPF1-3 in yeast, SMG-2–4 in metazoans), metazoans require additional proteins for NMD (e.g. SMG-1, –5, and −6). Additionally, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> NMD is thought to occur predominantly through decapping and 5’&gt;3’ exonucleolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muhlrad and Parker, 1994</xref>), while studies across metazoans have implicated both exo- and endonucleolytic machineries (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lykke-Andersen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lejeune et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gatfield and Izaurralde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glavan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huntzinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eberle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lykke-Andersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ottens et al., 2017</xref>]).</p><p>Although protective under many circumstances, the NMD pathway also contributes to pathological suppression of expression from numerous disease-causing mutations (about 11% of point mutations responsible for human disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mort et al., 2008</xref>]). Given the substantial pathological and protective significance of nonsense surveillance and the extensive degree to which the initial premature-stop-recognition machinery has been characterized, it is surprising that understanding of the downstream events leading to suppression of gene expression remains limited. Sources for the uncertainty include technical complications (e.g. the transient nature of RNA decay intermediates, loss of RNA decay machinery is lethal in many organisms) and differences in the NMD machinery between organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He and Jacobson, 2015</xref>). Further complicating the picture is the question of how degradative processes intersect with ongoing translation during NMD; as NMD is a translation-dependent process, at least one ribosome must be on the nonsense transcript when NMD initiates. Insight into these questions comes from a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where transient knockdown of nonstop decay factors stabilized nonsense mRNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashimoto et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Nonstop decay is a second translational surveillance pathway in which cells repress the activity of mRNAs lacking stop codons through both mRNA and protein decay mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>). The dual mRNA and protein decay arms of this response are referred to (in aggregate) as nonstop decay. These confer a functional redundancy to nonstop decay that has hampered genetic approaches. Despite this redundancy, nearly two decades of work has illuminated some of the molecular players and mechanisms involved (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klauer and van Hoof, 2012</xref>]). Many of these players were initially implicated in nonstop from seminal work in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frischmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doma and Parker, 2006</xref>]). Among these players is the SKI complex, thought to load a 3’&gt;5’ exonuclease on nonstop mRNAs, and a specialized ribosome rescue factor, <italic>dom34</italic>/<italic>pelota</italic>. Confounding metazoan analysis, mutations in <italic>dom34/pelota</italic> are lethal or sterile in two major metazoan systems (mammals and flies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castrillon et al., 1993</xref>). Contributions from a metazoan system where nonstop surveillance is active but nonessential would shed light on the evolutionary conservation, mechanisms, and roles of nonstop decay. Specifically, such a system could shed direct light on the intersection of RNA degradation and translation in metazoans.</p><p>Here, we report a metazoan system (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) where nonstop decay can be genetically manipulated. During our characterization of <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ nonstop, we uncovered an unexpected link with NMD. Our subsequent results support a nonsense-mediated decay model in which recognition of premature stop codons results in cleavage of mRNAs at stop codons, generating truncated mRNAs which are further repressed by nonstop decay.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> has nonstop mRNA decay</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is a genetically tractable animal system that has been instrumental in studying gene expression pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">The C. elegans Research Community, 2005</xref>). Our reading suggested that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has a nonstop mRNA decay pathway, although previous efforts were unable to identify molecular players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parvaz and Anderson, 2007</xref>). We set out to characterize nonstop decay in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>First, we sought to determine the consequences for gene expression upon loss of all stop codons from a transcript. We selected the <italic>unc-54</italic> locus for our experiments as it has been extensively analyzed via molecular biology and genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epstein et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dibb et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibb et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moerman et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bejsovec and Anderson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Brenner, 1984</xref>). We started with a strain bearing a C-terminally integrated GFP lacking all but one stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arribere et al., 2016</xref>]). These animals were grossly wild type, with robust body wall muscle fluorescence and GFP localization at the periphery of muscle thick filaments, consistent with the known UNC-54 expression pattern. When we removed the last stop codon via CRISPR/Cas9, generating an <italic>unc-54::gfp</italic> locus lacking all stop codons <italic>unc-54(cc2865)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the animals exhibited a profound Unc (uncoordinated) phenotype characteristic of strong loss-of-function alleles of <italic>unc-54</italic>. Examining RNA by RNA-seq for strains grown at 23C, we saw a ~6-fold loss of <italic>unc-54</italic> RNA for the nonstop allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To control for any secondary effect that muscular atrophy may have on <italic>unc-54</italic> levels in the nonstop strain, we also sequenced RNA from an <italic>unc-54</italic> mutant at 23C (<italic>e1301</italic>, which confers temperature-sensitive inactivation of UNC-54 protein at the nonpermissive temperature of 23C). Again, we observed a ~6-fold loss of the nonstop mRNA, suggesting the changes in <italic>unc-54</italic> mRNA level are not a secondary consequence of the Unc phenotype. At the protein level, we observed a &gt; 100-fold loss of the UNC-54 nonstop protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), and a lack of detectable GFP fluorescence, even under high-powered magnification. We thus conclude that a lack of stop codons destabilizes mRNA and is detrimental to protein expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33292.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of all stop codons is detrimental to mRNA and protein expression in <italic>C.</italic></title><p><italic>elegans</italic>.

Reporter protein levels, however, would still be tied to mRNA decay mechanisms. The 15 amino acid ‘stop-and-go’ T2A peptide co-translationally releases the upstream peptide, after which the ribosome resumes translation of downstream sequences. Indeed, a T2A peptide can liberate upstream protein from 3’UTR- or poly(A)-encoded protein repressive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arribere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore integrated a T2A peptide downstream of <italic>unc-54::gfp</italic>, generating <italic>unc-54(cc4092)</italic> a ‘T2A-nonstop reporter’. While this strain exhibited little difference in RNA levels compared to the T2A-less version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), protein expression was increased: animals had a faint but detectable GFP fluorescence, and UNC-54::GFP protein was detectable by immunoblot as 50–100-fold down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations are consistent with the notion that the T2A peptide liberated UNC-54::GFP from some repression. We reasoned that a deficit in the nonstop mRNA decay pathway might be observed through phenotypic changes (an increase in movement and/or GFP fluorescence) in the T2A-nonstop reporter background.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The SKI complex and <italic>pelo-1</italic> are required for nonstop mRNA decay in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We used the <italic>unc-54(cc4092)</italic> T2A-nonstop reporter to screen for mutants that restored reporter protein expression.

It is notable that no mutant completely rescued the reporter, suggesting that the alleles recovered only partially restored UNC-54::GFP reporter expression.</p><p>Genetic mapping linked 14 mutants to a region of chrIV, and the remaining three mutants to a region of chrV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The increase in 15-18nt footprints on the nonstop reporter is consistent with a model where the PELO-1 ribosome rescue factor is required for the efficient rescue of ribosomes with partial or empty A-sites.

Truncation at a stop codon would be expected to yield an inefficient substrate for eukaryotic Release Factor-1-mediated translation termination: eRF1 protein makes contacts with all three stop codon nucleotides, as well as the +1 nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, stop codon truncation would yield eRF1-resistant stalled ribosomes. While the precise substrate for PELO-1 is not known, previous work suggests that mammalian <italic>pelota</italic> can dissociate ribosomes with 0, 1, 2, or three nts (including UAG) in the A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pisareva et al., 2011</xref>). The increased detection of stop codon truncations in the <italic>pelo-1</italic> mutant is consistent with the idea that such complexes are substrates for PELO-1 rather than eRF1. Under this model, nonstop decay would be required to remove mRNAs truncated at their stop codon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nonsense-mediated decay creates nonstop targets</title><p>Why do some mRNAs accumulate nonstop fragments to a much greater extent than the genome-wide average?

In each case, 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads accumulated preferentially at the stop codon of the mRNA isoform annotated as a nonsense decay target.

However, the above observations led us to consider the possibility that nonstop decay substrates are generated as part of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. We set out to test this possibility.</p><p>First, we tested whether activation of nonsense decay is sufficient to target an mRNA to nonstop.

The phased second peak is consistent with the idea that ribosomes stall at the <italic>e1092</italic> premature stop codon, triggering upstream endonucleolytic cleavage and a second nonstop substrate one ribosome upstream of the <italic>e1092</italic> site. This is similar to the pattern observed on the <italic>unc-54(cc4092)</italic> nonstop reporter.

In the <italic>skih-2/pelo-1</italic> mutant, nonstop degradation of the truncated <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic> open-reading frame is inefficient, and stalled ribosomes stabilize the degradation fragments generated by nonsense decay.</p><p>Second, we tested whether induction of nonstop at an early stop codon depended on known nonsense factors. <italic>Smg-1</italic> is important for nonsense-mediated decay, and loss of <italic>smg-1</italic> stabilizes nonsense mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hodgkin et al., 1989</xref>). We thus generated and profiled the quadruple mutant <italic>skih-2(cc2854) pelo-1(cc2849) unc-54(e1092) smg-1(e1228)</italic>. In the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> mutant there was a net reduction in 15-18nt Ribo-seq footprints on the <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The distribution of RNA-seq reads on <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic> also evened out in the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> mutant. Thus loss of an intact nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway accompanies an apparent loss of targeting of the <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic> nonsense mRNA via nonstop decay. We noted that a minority of 15-18nt Ribo-seq fragments overlapping <italic>e1092</italic> remained in the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> mutant. The source of this residual population of fragments is unclear, although possibilities include (1) residual activity of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway in the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> background, whether from truncated SMG-1 protein or readthrough of <italic>e1228</italic>, (2) SMG-1-independent nonsense-mediated decay activity, or (3) a low level of nonsense-mediated decay-independent generation of nonstop fragments.</p><p>Third, we tested whether endogenous SKI/PELO targets were relieved from nonstop targeting upon loss of nonsense-mediated decay. We examined the behavior of endogenous SKI/PELO targets with and without <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic>. As with <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic>, the endogenous SKI/PELO targets exhibited a loss of 15-18nt Ribo-seq footprints relative to 28-30nt Ribo-seq footprints in the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, the nonsense decay pathway is generally required to elicit nonstop for several hundred endogenous SKI/PELO targets. Examining the distribution of 15-18nt Ribo-seq footprints revealed that <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> conferred a loss of 15-18nt Ribo-seq footprints specifically over the stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The loss of stop codon footprints was even greater for endogenous SKI/PELO targets. As with <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic>, a residue of stop codon footprints persisted even in the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> mutant (see preceding paragraph).</p><p>A gene-by-gene comparison of 15-18nt Ribo-seq read counts in <italic>skih-2</italic>/<italic>pelo-1</italic> with <italic>smg-1(+)</italic> or <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> revealed that the majority of endogenous SKI/PELO targets lose short footprints in the <italic>smg</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistent with the idea that SKI/PELO targets express transcripts that are degraded by NMD, steady-state mRNA levels of many of these genes increased in a <italic>smg-1(r910)</italic> mutant (using a previously published dataset from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Muir et al., 2018</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Many SKI/PELO targets exhibited a strong (&gt;20-fold) <italic>smg-</italic>dependent change in 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads, and yet exhibited modest, if any, changes in total mRNA levels in the <italic>smg-1(r910)</italic> data. One explanation for this is that the short footprint assay is capable of identifying relatively minor transcript isoforms that are targeted by NMD relative to the background of 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads. If such isoforms are sufficiently rare, even a large fold de-repression in a <italic>smg</italic> mutant would be masked in RNA-seq by a lack of change in more abundant isoforms produced from the same gene. Consistent with this idea, we manually inspected several SKI/PELO targets and observed 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads accumulated at out-of-frame stop codons, although often without a transcript annotation that would explain such a translation termination event.</p><p>A few endogenous SKI/PELO targets still exhibited a high number of 15-18nt Ribo-seq fragments in <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic>, among them <italic>xbp-1</italic>. Examination of <italic>xbp-1</italic> revealed that while the bulk of 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads over the early stop codon were lost in the <italic>smg-1</italic> mutant, some internal reads remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The reads that remained coincided with the known tRNA endonuclease cleavage sites in <italic>xbp-1</italic>. Thus, loss of the nonsense machinery specifically leads to loss of 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads over stop codons, but not for other classes of nonstop-targeting features.</p><p>Among the remaining ~20 largely <italic>smg-</italic>independent SKI/PELO targets, we observed untemplated adenosines in two genes: <italic>y48e1b.8</italic> (...TTACGGGTAAAA^) and <italic>f38e11.9</italic> (...ACACTTCTCCCAAAAA^), where ^ indicates the site of untemplated A’s. Our ability to identify premature polyadenylation sites was likely hampered by an apparent bias in our short read libraries against A/T-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the course of generating the above strains, we noted that introduction of the <italic>smg-1(e1228)</italic> allele into the <italic>skih-2(cc2854) pelo-1(cc2849)</italic> background improved animal health. This was most readily manifest in a partial rescue of fertility defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). A model to explain this observation is as follows: A <italic>skih-2/pelo-1</italic> double mutant suffers as a result of an inability to deal with ribosomes stalled at the 3’end of cleaved RNAs. Many of these stuck ribosomes are generated via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway (<italic>i.e.</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Loss of <italic>smg</italic> activity in the <italic>skih-2</italic>/<italic>pelo-1</italic> background reduces the number of stalled ribosomes and thus improves animal health.</p><p>Thus, the activity of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is coupled to the accumulation of nonstop RNA fragments at and upstream of the stop codon. The coupling of nonsense to nonstop (1) holds true for an engineered premature stop codon (<italic>e1092</italic>), (2) holds true for endogenous nonsense targets, and (3) depends on the known nonsense factor SMG-1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Lessons from <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ nonstop decay</title><p>Several features have hampered the study of nonstop mRNA decay in vivo.

The conceptual divide between nonsense and nonstop in the literature likely stems from the mechanistic dissimilarity of the pathways (one recognizes an early stop codon, the other an absence of stop codons), and the lack of overlap in molecular players identified by genetic screens (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leeds et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hodgkin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pulak and Anderson, 1993</xref>]).

This model may serve generally useful for understanding how mutations in SKI homologs elicit trichohepatoenteric syndrome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fabre et al., 2012</xref>), loss of pelota/dom34 yields embryonic lethality in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adham et al., 2003</xref>), loss of a nonstop protein decay factor (<italic>lister</italic>) yields neurodegenerative phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2009</xref>), and dysregulation of nonsense decay contributes to tumorigenicity in humans and mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Popp and Maquat, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Nonsense-mediated decay is often championed as a translational surveillance mechanism to mitigate production of truncated protein isoforms. However, nonsense-mediated decay requires translation to detect the premature stop codon, paradoxically generating a truncated protein to mitigate truncated protein production. The coupling of nonsense to nonstop may solve this problem: as nonstop is known to target both the RNA and nascent protein, the product from the initial round(s) of protein production may be degraded by nonstop protein decay. Under this model, the expression and toxicity of a prematurely truncated protein would be mitigated by nonstop decay. This has implications for genetic studies where nonsense alleles are used as loss-of-function alleles for a given protein of interest, as well as the ~11% of human inherited disease that occurs due to premature stop codon mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mort et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain construction and maintenance</title><p>All strains were derived from ‘N2’ (VC2010) background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1974</xref>) unless otherwise indicated.

For brood size calculations at 23C, we found that shifting <italic>skih-2</italic>/<italic>pelo-1</italic> double mutant larvae from 16C to 23C allowed that animal to produce a handful of progeny prior to becoming sterile. The resultant progeny spent their entire lives at 23C, and we analyzed their brood size as described above. No power analysis was performed to determine the number of animal broods to assay.

For strains bearing <italic>unc-54</italic> mutations (e.g. <italic>unc-54(cc4092)</italic>, <italic>unc-54(e1092)</italic>, etc.), we created custom versions of the genome with a modified <italic>unc-54</italic> locus and annotations. Prior to mapping, reads were collapsed to remove PCR duplicates, using the unique molecular adaptor (NNNNNN) ligated on the RNA with AF-JA-34. PCR duplicates consisted of no more than a few percent of reads for any given library. Collapsed reads were mapped to the genome with STAR (v2.4.2a) allowing for one mismatch.

Unless otherwise indicated, reads were counted based on the position of the read 5’end. For the metacodon plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the frequency of read 3’ends terminating at each position was shown.

Loosening this restriction to include non-coding sequence-mapping reads produced similar results. For each nucleotide of each codon, we counted the number of times a 15-18nt Ribo-seq read terminated at that position. To normalize for codon usage and read coverage, we also counted the number of times a read terminated near that codon, up to nine bases upstream, and up to three bases downstream. We calculated the frequency of 3’ends at each position using the codon and the upstream three codons (ignoring the downstream codon so as to not skew stop codons because very few 15-18nt Ribo-seq reads terminate downstream of stop codons).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mutagenesis and suppressor screen</title><p>A large population of Unc animals were grown to ~L4, washed off plates, and incubated in 50 mM NaCl with mutagen at room temperature with rocking for 4 hr.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers found the manuscript to tell a compelling and interesting story about a direct connection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> between NMD and NSD and all three are enthusiastic about publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition to addressing the relatively minor concerns of the reviewers, detailed below, all three agreed that a somewhat more detailed analysis of the 723 targets identified in the SKI/PELO background should be performed. What fraction of these are true NMD targets (which correlate with RNA-Seq data from an appropriate NMD-background, for example) and what fraction represent prematurely polyadenylated genes, or others (such as Xbp1). Also, several reviewers suggested that experiments in a Smg6 delete background might add closure to the story, though they agreed that this is not necessary for publication. Once these changes are incorporated, the manuscript should be ready for acceptance and publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Arribere and Fire offer strong evidence that the NMD pathway feeds into the NSD/NGD pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While this idea has been proposed before, the evidence presented here is very clear and appealing. While it would have been nice to see additional experiments to explore the role of other NMD factors with their novel short footprint assay, the story here is compelling.</p><p>While the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> show the 723 endogenous targets of SKI/PELO are generally targets of the NMD pathway, it's possible that there could be other (minor) classes of targets (several sites remain enriched in short footprints in the <italic>smg-1</italic> animal). Did the authors check for premature polyadenylation on these genes, for example, by looking at the 3' end sequences of footprints that failed to align anywhere? It has been argued that sites of cryptic polyadenylation are also targets of SKI/PELO. Moreover, what fraction of the 723 genes did not have the stop codon as the major locus for short read enrichment?</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Introduction and the third paragraph of the subsection “The SKI complex and <italic>pelo-1</italic> are required for Nonstop mRNA decay in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”, the authors refer to <italic>dom34/pelota</italic> as a &quot;release factor.&quot; This is incorrect since it is incapable of hydrolyzing the peptidyl-tRNA bond. It would be more accurate to call it a &quot;ribosome rescue factor.&quot;</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “A nonstop decay mechanism conserved from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to <italic>C. elegans</italic>”, the authors describe ~30 nt periodicity. However, some peaks occur at shorter intervals. Similarly, the metagene plot for endogenous targets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows a secondary peak only 18 nt behind the main stop peak. The authors should be cautious about specifying period length in the absence of more precise analysis. A short periodicity in the 15-18 footprint data might actually be expected for sequential ribosome-templated cleavages.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is generally unclear and very difficult to follow. The naming scheme for reporter constructs (<italic>cc2859, cc2865</italic>, etc.) is cryptic and would benefit from intuitive shorthand names. Some lanes on the gels are not described in the main text (<italic>r259, r293</italic>), making the figure a challenge to decipher. It's not clear how deletion of a 3'UTR in <italic>r293</italic> makes it a nonsense allele. Moreover, the use of <italic>unc-54 (cc2882</italic>) carrying the <italic>e1301</italic> temperature-sensitive Unc mutation isn't explained. Are any of the experiments carried out at the non-permissive temperature? Why is the right-hand panel of 1B or center panel of 1F required? Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> is never referenced in the text. It would appear that it should have been referenced just prior to 1E in the same sentence (panels should probably be reordered).</p><p>Why wasn't the third component of the SKI complex, SKI8, detected in the screen? Wilson et al. (2007) detected all three SKI complex components in their non-stop screen. Perhaps the authors could comment on this.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection “The SKI complex and <italic>pelo-1</italic> are required for Nonstop mRNA decay in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”, the authors imply that loss of <italic>dom34/pelota</italic> should have given a large increase in mRNA levels and therefore have appeared in the screen. However, there are many cases in the literature where the effects are modest, consistent with results here, and the authors could note this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Arribere and Fire describe the development of a genetic screen to identify genes involved in nonstop decay (NSD) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Similar to other organisms where NSD has been studied, they identify the SKI complex and <italic>pelo-1</italic> as being involved. During their transcriptome-wide search for NSD-substrates they discover that RNA substrates of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD) are also NSD substrates. More specifically, NSD degrades the upstream fragment produced after endonucleolytic cleavage at the premature termination codon that signifies NMD substrates.</p><p>The study is well-designed and well-described. I have only a few comments:</p><p>1) Based on knowledge from other organisms, the authors speculate that SMG6 is responsible for the endonucleolytic cleavage at the premature termination codon in NMD substrates in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors should test if this is true to finalize their model.</p><p>2) The authors speculate that NSD may also be involved in the degradation of the upstream fragments produced by NMD in other organisms. Is this likely? There are some papers that have identified endonucleolytic cleavages by SMG6 transcriptome-wide at nucleotide resolution in human cell lines (Ottens et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2015; Lykke-Andersen et al., 2014). Often cleavage sites cluster downstream of the premature termination codon, which would mean that the upstream fragment would still contain a stop codon. This does not appear to be the case in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and should be considered by the authors.</p><p>3) The authors should also consider mentioning the study by Orban and Izaurralde, 2005, where it is implied that NSD is responsible for the degradation of upstream fragments produced after siRNA mediated endonucleolytic cleavage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript from Arribere and Fire, the authors present novel data demonstrating a functional nonstop mRNA decay (NSD) pathway in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In screening for mutants that suppressed NSD (using a very clever construct that deconvoluted the dual impacts of protein and RNA targeting systems), components of the SKI complex (specifically affect the RNA decay component) were discovered demonstrating conservation between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other eukaryotes. The authors also identify an ortholog of ribosome rescue factor Pelota and demonstrate that genetic ablation of Pelota results in characteristic short ribosome protected fragments by ribosome profiling.</p><p>The key genome wide experiment is the observation of a substantial enrichment in short ribosome reads in the <italic>skih-2/pelo-1</italic> mutant animals for a large set of genes. When the distribution of short reads is evaluated, a large accumulation of reads is found directly at the stop codon with the 3' end of these reads located precisely at the +2 or +3 position of the stop codons (with the strong preference for the +2 position at UGA codons being particularly striking). Building on these observations, when the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway was disabled through mutation of <italic>smg-1</italic>, the signal of short reads at stop codons was lost. The authors reason that these short reads are generated by endonucleolytic cleavage during NMD (initiating perhaps through the initial cleavage at the stop codon following peptide release by eRF1/3) and the resulting upstream fragments are targeted and cleared by the canonical NSD pathway dependent on degradation by the SKI-exosome complex and ribosome rescue by pelota.</p><p>Both the data and conclusions presented here are sound and present a cohesive and interesting story. As detailed by the authors, in terms of the novelty, short ribosome footprints have previously been found enriched on truncated mRNAs when <italic>ski2</italic> and <italic>dom34</italic> (pelota) were deleted in yeast (Guydosh and Green 2014) and on NSD targets in the same background (Guydosh and Green, 2017). Endonucleolytic cleavage has been demonstrated during NMD in eukaryotes (Eberle 2008, Lykke-Andersen 2014) and this cleavage has even been shown to occur directly at stop codons (see Lykke-Anderson 2014 – Figure S2H). And, SMG-6 has been proposed to be the endonuclease responsible for cleaving NMD targets at stop codons and specificity for the +2 position of UGA codons has previously been identified (Schmidt et al., 2014).</p><p>Importantly, this paper does expand on the biological targets (in a new organism) for the exosome and ribosome rescue acting to clear RNA fragments generated by NMD, and this large cohort was not observed in yeast where NMD may not involve the actions of an endonuclease. And while this connection has been previously identified (Hashimoto, 2017), as referenced by the authors, the analysis here is more complete and in particular includes a genome-wide analysis and identification of targets.</p><p>In light of previous publications, it might be interesting to categorize the annotated endogenous SKI/PELO-1 targets into different groups that might include previously identified NMD targets (i.e. found in a screen for mRNA levels in a UPF1/SMG1 delete), prematurely polyadenylated mRNAs (if they have been documented in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or by looking for reads possessing iterated As at their 3' ends), or some other group.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33292.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Arribere and Fire offer strong evidence that the NMD pathway feeds into the NSD/NGD pathway in C. elegans.

As can be seen in the updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, the vast majority of the 723 SKI/PELO targets exhibit <italic>smg</italic>-dependent accumulation of short ribosome footprints. We note, however, that many of these SKI/PELO targets exist as isoforms that are a small minority compared to other mRNAs expressed from their gene. Thus, for many SKI/PELO targets that exhibit a <italic>smg-</italic>dependent Ribo-seq accumulation, we see modest fold changes in total mRNA abundance by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>The remaining ~20 genes that have a largely <italic>smg</italic>-independent accumulation of short ribosome footprints would be good candidates for mRNAs that are endonucleolytically cleaved or that are prematurely polyadenylated.

Perhaps the authors could comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t know why a <italic>ski8</italic> homolog was not identified in the screen. There are at least two non-mutually exclusive possibilities: (1) <italic>ski8</italic> is smaller than <italic>ski2</italic> or <italic>ski3</italic>. We expect our screen to identify longer genes more frequently than smaller ones because longer genes are easier to inactivate via mutagenesis. (2) <italic>ski8</italic> is known to have functions in meiosis (specifically DSB formation, see [Arora et al., 2004, Mol Cell]), and it is possible some essential phenotype of <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ <italic>ski8</italic> precluded its isolation in our screen. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has sequence homologs of <italic>ski8</italic>, and future work will test whether these have a phenotype with our nonstop reporter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection “The SKI complex and pelo-1 are required for Nonstop mRNA decay in C. elegans”, the authors imply that loss of dom34/pelota should have given a large increase in mRNA levels and therefore have appeared in the screen. However, there are many cases in the literature where the effects are modest, consistent with results here, and the authors could note this.</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with the previous literature, we expect a modest increase in nonstop mRNA levels upon loss of <italic>pelo-1</italic>. We have clarified the manuscript to indicate this (subsection “The SKI complex and <italic>pelo-1</italic> are required for Nonstop mRNA decay in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2: […] 1) Based on knowledge from other organisms, the authors speculate that SMG6 is responsible for the endonucleolytic cleavage at the premature termination codon in NMD substrates in C. elegans. The authors should test if this is true to finalize their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered profiling a <italic>smg-6/skih-2/pelo-1</italic> triple mutant. The expectation from that experiment is the same whether <italic>smg-6</italic> is the causative nuclease or not (see <italic>smg-1</italic> experiment). We expect loss of any of <italic>smg-1</italic> through <italic>smg-7</italic> to yield the same effect on the distribution of short ribosome footprints. In any <italic>smg</italic> mutant the SMG machinery has lost the ability to detect (and presumably, cleave) premature stop codons. (An added complication is that <italic>smg-6</italic> null mutations are lethal in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, so only hypomorphs are available.) Definitive testing of SMG-6 as the nuclease will be done by us and others in future studies by other means (i.e., biochemistry and molecular biology).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors speculate that NSD may also be involved in the degradation of the upstream fragments produced by NMD in other organisms. Is this likely? There are some papers that have identified endonucleolytic cleavages by SMG6 transcriptome-wide at nucleotide resolution in human cell lines (Ottens et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2015; Lykke-Andersen et al., 2014). Often cleavage sites cluster downstream of the premature termination codon, which would mean that the upstream fragment would still contain a stop codon. This does not appear to be the case in C. elegans and should be considered by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Most studies on NMD cleavage sites have been conducted in cells with an intact nonstop decay system. Because we would expect SKI/PELO to clear cleavages within or upstream of the stop codon, one would expect to detect only those cleavages outside of ORFs (i.e., downstream of the stop codon). We expect that future studies in diverse systems (e.g., flies, mammalian cells) after SKI and PELO activity have been ablated will clarify whether this is the case.</p><p>Another group (working in flies), detected endonucleolytic cleavage near stop codons, and demonstrated that the upstream RNA fragment is subject to nonstop decay (Hashimoto et al., 2017). We note that at least some studies in mammalian cells have detected cleavage within the stop codon (e.g., Schmidt et al., 2015) similar to what we observe in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Determining the full extent to which NMD is coupled to nonstop across organisms is beyond the scope of this current study, though we have referenced the above work in our manuscript (e.g., subsection “Mechanistic implications for nonsense from nonsense/nonstop coupling”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] In light of previous publications, it might be interesting to categorize the annotated endogenous SKI/PELO-1 targets into different groups that might include previously identified NMD targets (i.e. found in a screen for mRNA levels in a UPF1/SMG1 delete), prematurely polyadenylated mRNAs (if they have been documented in C. elegans or by looking for reads possessing iterated As at their 3' ends), or some other group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a more in-depth analysis of the SKI/PELO targets in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (see first comment for review #1, updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
