It gets assimilated via the canonical biosynthetic routes to glutamate and is further distributed throughout metabolism via a network of transaminases. To study the flexibility of this network, we constructed an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> glutamate auxotrophic strain. This strain allowed us to systematically study which amino acids serve as amine sources. We found that several amino acids complemented the auxotrophy either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, we identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, we extended the transaminase network by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified <sc>d</sc>-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine were introduced. Our study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nitrogen is an essential part of many of the cell’s building blocks, including amino acids and nucleotides, which form proteins and DNA respectively. Therefore, nitrogen has to be available to cells so that they can survive and grow. In nature, some microorganisms convert the gaseous form of nitrogen into ammonium, which then acts as the nitrogen source of most organisms, including bacteria, plants and animals. Once cells take up ammonium, it is ‘fixed’ by becoming part of an amino acid called glutamate, which has a so-called ‘amine group’ that contains a nitrogen. Glutamate then becomes the central source for passing these amines on to other molecules, distributing nitrogen throughout the cell.</p><p>This coupling between ammonium fixation and glutamate production evolved over millions of years and occurs in all organisms. However, the complete metabolic network that underlies the distribution of amines remains poorly understood despite decades of research. Furthermore, it is not clear whether ammonium can be fixed in a way that is independent of glutamate.</p><p>To answer these questions, Schulz-Mirbach et al. used genetic engineering to create a strain of the bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> that was unable to make glutamate. These mutant cells could only grow in the presence of certain amino acids, which acted as alternative amine sources. Schulz-Mirbach et al. found that enzymes called transaminases, and one called AspC in particular, were required for the cells to be able to produce glutamate using the amine groups from other amino acids. Notably, Schulz-Mirbach et al. showed that AspC, which had previously been shown to use an amino acid called aspartate as a source of amine groups, is indispensable if the cell is to use the amine groups from other amino acids – including histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, isoleucine and leucine.</p><p>Schulz-Mirbach et al. also discovered that if they engineered the <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to produce transaminases from other species, the repertoire of molecules that the cells could use as the source of amines to generate glutamate increased. In a final set of experiments, Schulz-Mirbach et al. were able to engineer the cells to fix ammonium by producing aspartate and leucine, thus entirely bypassing the deleted routes of glutamate synthesis. These data suggest that fixing ammonium and distributing nitrogen in <italic>E. coli</italic> can be very flexible.</p><p>The results from these experiments may shed light on how cells adapt when there is not a lot of ammonium available. Moreover, this study could advance efforts at metabolic engineering, for example, to create molecules through new pathways or to boost the production of amino acids needed for industrial purposes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ammonium fixation</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>synthetic ammonium assimilation</kwd><kwd>transaminase</kwd><kwd>amination network</kwd><kwd>auxotrophs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>031B0825B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindner</surname><given-names>Steffen N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Tobias J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schulz-Mirbach</surname><given-names>Helena</given-names></name><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Tong</given-names></name><name><surname>Aslan</surname><given-names>Selçuk</given-names></name><name><surname>Bar-Even</surname><given-names>Arren</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindner</surname><given-names>Steffen N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007769</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfister</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The amination network for the distribution of assimilated ammonium throughout metabolism is defined by promiscuous transaminases, allowing a high flexibility of the network that supported engineering novel connections and even alternative ammonium assimilation entry points.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nitrogen is essential for all forms of life as it is part of 75% of the cell’s building blocks (mainly in proteins and nucleic acids) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milo and Phillips, 2015</xref>). The conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) by diazotrophic bacteria or industrially by the Haber–Bosch process is essential to make it available for assimilation by plants and other organisms to produce nitrogenous compounds.</p><p>While carbon fixation has evolved several times, resulting in versatile naturally occurring ways of carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Löwe and Kremling, 2021</xref>), the introduction of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, protonated form of ammonia) into the building blocks of life is similar in all organisms and limited to the fixation of ammonium at the node between 2-ketoglutarate, glutamate, and glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, three cooperating canonical enzymes assimilate ammonium in two distinct ways. In the first reaction, glutamate is the direct product of glutamate dehydrogenase (<italic>gdhA,</italic> GDH). In the second pathway, the combined activity of glutamine synthetase (<italic>glnA,</italic> GS) and glutamate synthase (glutamine 2-ketoglutarate aminotransferase, <italic>gltBD</italic>, GOGAT) fixes another ammonium and converts glutamate into glutamine, which then donates one amine to 2-ketoglutarate to form two glutamate molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar and Shimizu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To make all essential amino acids and other aminated compounds, glutamate and glutamine then donate their amines to specific keto acids or other amino acid precursors in reversible transferase reactions. As ammonium enters metabolism solely via these two routes, all cellular nitrogen is provided by either glutamate (75%) or glutamine (25%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Canonical ammonium assimilation via glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (blue arrow) or glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamine 2-ketoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) (pink arrows).</title><p>One pathway for ammonium (green boxes) assimilation is the amination of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate 2-ketoglutarate by GDH to form glutamate (blue arrow). A second pathway requires joint action of GS and GOGAT, which first aminate glutamate to form glutamine (GS), which donates one amine to 2-ketoglutarate (GOGAT) to form two glutamate molecules, which further provide amines (green circles) for biosynthesis of amino acids and other nitrogenous compounds (pink arrows). Growth of the glutamate auxotrophic (glut-aux) strain deleted in GDH and GOGAT (red crosses) by a supplemented amine source is possible via the following mechanisms. The amine donor either (I) replaces glutamate as an amine source for the production of amino acids and nitrogenous compounds, (II) donates an amine to 2-ketoglutarate to form glutamate, (III) is converted to an intermediate donating an amine to 2-ketoglutarate, or (IV) is metabolically converted into glutamate. Green arrows indicate these cases.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77492-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Besides the glutamate biosynthesis node, alternative entry points for ammonium theoretically exist, for example, alanine dehydrogenase or aspartate ammonia lyase, but these are not relevant for ammonium assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim and Hollocher, 1982</xref>). Evolution has developed a system for ammonium assimilation, which is controlled by its intracellular availability. The ATP investment driving GS activity makes amination reactions favorable even at low ammonium concentrations. Additionally, most of the GS orthologs have evolved kinetic parameters optimized for lower ammonium concentrations with an apparent <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> of 0.1 mM for ammonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reitzer, 2014</xref>). At high ammonium concentrations, the NADPH-dependent (and thus energetically cheaper) GDH allows more efficient ammonium assimilation than GS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reitzer, 2014</xref>). This metabolic switch might explain the prominence of glutamate-based ammonium assimilation as opposed to other ammonia entry points in nature. To generate the NADPH required for GDH, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> mostly uses the membrane-bound proton-translocating transhydrogenase (PntAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauer et al., 2004</xref>). This enzyme exploits the proton motif force to drive proton translocation from NADH to NADP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spaans et al., 2015</xref>), and thereby indirectly competes with ATP synthesis. Therefore, when growing under high ammonium concentrations, growth of this microorganism might benefit from ammonium assimilation via NADH-dependent dehydrogenases.</p><p>Following these thoughts, we tried to assess whether alternative routes for ammonium assimilation can arise from the metabolic network of <italic>E. coli</italic>. For this purpose, we systematically investigated the flexibility of the amination network in a glutamate auxotrophic – and hence ammonium assimilation deficient – <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. This study provides fundamental knowledge on the plasticity of ammonium metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic> and moreover addresses industrial interests by providing a versatile bacterial <italic>chassis</italic> for screening and optimization of ammonium assimilation and transamination reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Only some amino acids serve as an amine source</title><p>To study the flexibility of <italic>E. coli</italic>’s cellular amination network, we first generated a strain in which both canonical ammonia assimilation routes were disrupted. Accordingly, we deleted the genes encoding GDH (<italic>gdhA</italic>) and GOGAT (<italic>gltBD</italic>), which are responsible for 2-ketoglutarate amination under high and low ammonia concentrations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helling, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar and Shimizu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The resulting glutamate auxotrophic strain (glut-aux, Δ<italic>gdhA</italic> Δ<italic>gltBD</italic>) was not able to grow in minimal medium with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source unless an amine group donor, such as glutamate, was provided in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While <sc>d</sc>-glutamate-requiring <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants had been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dougherty et al., 1993</xref>), our strain lacking glutamate biosynthetic pathways represents the first strain for a systematic investigation of the metabolic network for amine distribution. To this end, we first tested whether other amino acids can replace glutamate as an amine source allowing growth of the glut-aux. We therefore characterized growth of the glut-aux strain when supplemented with one of the proteinogenic amino acids. We note that this growth experiment is different from the experiments commonly described in the literature, where amino acids were added to the medium without ammonium to serve as the sole nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neidhardt et al., 1996</xref>). In these experiments, the metabolic degradation of the amino acids to release ammonia suffices to enable growth. Conversely, for the glut-aux strain, growth complementation through the supplemented amino acids as an amine source must follow one of these options: (i) substitute glutamate as an amine source for the production of other nitrogenous compounds; (ii) serve as an amine group donor for 2-ketoglutarate to generate glutamate as an amine source; (iii) be further converted to compounds to serve as an amine group donor for 2-ketoglutarate amination; or (iv) be directly converted to glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the first three cases, the amination network of the cell needs to be flexible enough to adapt to different directionalities of at least some of the transamination reactions. As utilization of amino acids as amine source in the glut-aux strain might be dependent on the nitrogen-regulated (Ntr) response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reitzer, 2003</xref>), we performed growth experiments with and without ammonia in the medium (light blue and magenta lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As a control, we repeated the classical experiments of testing each amino acid as the sole nitrogen source with a wildtype strain. Here, amino acids are not required to directly donate their amine group but can rather support growth by releasing ammonia through their degradation (black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Besides the proteinogenic amino acids, we also sought to investigate whether the naturally occurring, non-proteinogenic amino acids β-alanine and ornithine could rescue the growth of the glut-aux strain. These amino acids are derived from aspartate or glutamate, respectively, which, due to the presence of respective transaminases, were amine sources for both glut-aux and wildtype. Thus, β-alanine and ornithine are directly connected to the amination network. In our experiments, we chose to use glycerol rather than glucose as a carbon source to avoid interference of glucose-dependent inducer exclusion and catabolite repression with amino acid utilization. Moreover, previous studies showed that <italic>E. coli</italic> acquires higher growth rates with glycerol as carbon and energy source when amino acids are provided as amine sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bren et al., 2016</xref>). To minimize selective pressure in the preculture and avoid accumulation of mutations prior to the experiment, all experiments were inoculated from cultures grown in glycerol minimal medium supplemented with 5 mM aspartate, the amino acid immediately supporting fastest growth of the glut-aux strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of amino acids that rescue growth of the glutamate auxotrophic (glut-aux) strain.</title><p>The glut-aux strain was grown in M9 medium with (blue line) or without ammonium (magenta line) and 20 mM glycerol as carbon source. <italic>E. coli</italic> wildtype (WT) was grown in M9 medium without ammonium (black line) and 20 mM glycerol as carbon source. 5 mM of the indicated amino acids or no amino acid as negative control were supplemented to test whether they can serve as an amine source (glut-aux strain) or an ammonium source (WT).

This generally correlated with the existence of known transaminase enzymes that enable glutamate production from the respective amino acids in <italic>E. coli</italic> (rescue mechanisms II and III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For example, aspartate, leucine, and tyrosine serving as cellular amine donor for glutamate generation from 2-ketoglutarate (rescue mechanism II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) could be attributed to the activity of aspartate transaminase (AspC), tyrosine transaminase (TryB), and branched-chain amino acid transaminase (IlvE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelfand and Steinberg, 1977</xref>). As these transaminases display considerable cross-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelfand and Steinberg, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 1988</xref>), each of these three amino acids might support the production of the others directly, without the need for glutamate as an amine donor. However, glutamate here still likely serves as the primary amine donor for most cellular nitrogenous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, AspC, TryB, and IlvE must also be fully reversible in the glut-aux strain to aminate 2-ketoglutarate to glutamate. While transaminases are generally reversible enzymes, their ability to effectively operate reversibly in vivo is not trivial as the [glutamate]/[2-ketoglutarate] ratio is very high (above 100) under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2009</xref>), making the reverse amine transfer onto 2-ketoglutarate to form glutamate thermodynamically challenging. Since the glut-aux strain grew with several amino acids as an amine source, we conclude that the cellular amination network must be sufficiently flexible to accept amine sources other than glutamate despite the potential thermodynamic barriers. However, since metabolite concentrations and especially the [glutamate]/[2-ketoglutarate] ratio in the glut-aux strain likely differ from that in a wildtype strain, the reverse transaminase activities might be favored in this synthetic strain. Of the supplied non-proteinogenic amino acids, ornithine rescued growth of the glut-aux strain in the absence of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (and was used as a nitrogen source by the WT). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> ornithine is degraded to putrescine, which is used by the transaminase PatA to aminate 2-ketoglutarate to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider and Reitzer, 2012</xref>). Expression of this degradation pathway is induced by nitrogen limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimmer et al., 2000</xref>) and allows growth with ornithine (rescue mechanism III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, β-alanine was neither an amine source of the glut-aux strain nor served as a nitrogen source for the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To prove amine transfer from the provided amino acids, we cultivated the glut-aux strain with 5 mM of one of five (unlabeled) representative amino acids that can serve as an amine donor – glutamate, proline, aspartate, tryptophan, and leucine – in medium containing 20 mM <sup>15</sup>N-ammonium. We subsequently measured the <sup>15</sup>N labeling in some proteinogenic amino acids (‘Materials and methods’) that represent a broad range of amino acids. We chose alanine (A), the direct product of pyruvate amination, phenylalanine (F) as an example of an aromatic amino acid, leucine (L), representing branched-chain amino acids, methionine (M) and threonine (T), representing aspartate-family amino acids, proline (P) as part of the glutamate-family amino acids, serine (S), representing serine-family amino acids, and arginine (R), which, additionally to glutamate-derived amines, uniquely carries an amine from carbamoyl phosphate that originated from the δ-amino group of glutamine that was initially formed from free ammonium by glutamine synthetase. In these experiments, we found that most of the amino acids were completely unlabeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), confirming that their amine group was transferred from the respective amine-donating amino acid rather than from free (<sup>15</sup>N labeled) ammonia in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In these experiments, arginine appeared single-labeled (R, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as one of its nitrogen atoms originates from the amide nitrogen of glutamine that is derived from ammonia fixed by GS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Overall, these results confirm that the amino acids added to the medium were the only amine sources allowing growth of the glut-aux strain, rather than allowing amination of amino acid-derived backbones with free ammonium in the medium.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><sup>15</sup>N labeling confirms amine assimilation from the supplied amino acid in the glutamate auxotrophic (glut-aux) strain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The glut-aux strain was incubated in <sup>15</sup>N-NH<sub>4</sub>Cl M9 medium with 20 mM glycerol as carbon source. <sup>15</sup>N labeling pattern in analyzed proteinogenic amino acids (single letter code) upon feeding with 5 mM of unlabeled amino acids glutamate, proline, aspartate, tryptophan, or leucine as amine donors (three-letter code).

As expected, we found that biomass yield, as indicated by the maximal OD<sub>600</sub>, directly correlated with the concentration of the supplemented amino acid. All amino acids showed the same dependency of biomass yield on concentration, with the exception of ornithine, which supported roughly double the yield for each concentration. This is in line with the fact that transaminases can transfer both amine groups from the ornithine degradation intermediate putrescine to 2-ketoglutarate to form glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prieto-Santos et al., 1986</xref>) (rescue mechanism III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As this ornithine degradation pathway is induced by nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider and Reitzer, 2012</xref>), growth of the glut-aux strain with ornithine as amine group donor was observed only when ammonia was omitted in the medium. The correlation of maximal OD<sub>600</sub> to amino acid concentration confirms that amine supply from the amino acid limits biomass yield in the glut-aux strain in the same manner for all tested amino acids. To our surprise, glutamate was not the amine donor supporting fastest growth of the glut-aux strain. Even proline, which, in order to donate its amine group, needs to be converted to glutamate (rescue mechanism IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), supported faster growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This, together with the fact that the growth rate increased proportionally with the glutamate concentration, indicates that glutamate uptake is limiting growth of the glut-aux strain.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Growth dependency of the glutamate auxotrophic (glut-aux) strain on amino acid concentration.</title><p>Cells were grown in ammonium-free M9 medium with 20 mM glycerol and the indicated concentrations of the amino acids glutamate, aspartate, proline, tryptophan, ornithine, and asparagine.

We specifically deleted genes encoding proteins essential for the certain glutamate-forming degradation pathways based on available documentation in the database Ecocyc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keseler et al., 2021</xref>). First, we explored the use of proline as an amine source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We did not expect this amino acid to donate its amine group directly, but rather to be metabolized by PutA, encoding for a bifunctional flavoenzyme with proline dehydrogenase and 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moxley et al., 2014</xref>), to glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank and Ranhand, 1964</xref>), which would serve as an amine source (rescue mechanism IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, upon deletion of <italic>putA,</italic> growth of the WT and glut-aux strain on proline as the sole ammonium source was abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This confirmed that proline could only support growth via its native degradation pathway and was unable to serve as an amine source via a different pathway. We then focused on amino acids that are expected to directly donate their amine groups. For example, methionine, which could serve as an amine source, was previously found to be the main substrate for only a single transaminase: YbdL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolzan et al., 2004</xref>). However, deletion of <italic>ybdL</italic> in the Δ<italic>gdhA</italic> Δ<italic>gltBD</italic> strain did not affect growth with methionine as an amine donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the physiological contribution of this transaminase to the use of methionine as an amine source is negligible. YbdL was also shown to be the only transaminase able to efficiently accept histidine and phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolzan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 1988</xref>). Yet, the glut-aux Δ<italic>ybdL</italic> strain did not show any growth retardation when using histidine or phenylalanine as an amine donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, other transaminases are known to accept methionine and histidine, albeit at a substantially lower affinity and rate than their primary substrate, for example, aspartate transaminase AspC, tyrosine transaminase TyrB, and branched-chain amino acid transaminase IlvE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mavrides, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Powell and Morrison, 1978</xref>). It therefore seems that the promiscuity of such transaminases enables effective use of methionine as an amine donor even in the absence of the enzyme preferring it as substrate. While previous studies already reported high enzymatic redundancy as a characteristic feature of transaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lal et al., 2014</xref>), we aimed to further investigate the relevance of promiscuous transaminase activities for the utilization of external amine donors. Here, we focused on AspC, which is known to accept a range of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lal et al., 2014</xref>). After constructing the glut-aux Δ<italic>aspC</italic> strain, we analyzed its growth on all previously tested 22 amino acids. We found that the glut-aux Δ<italic>aspC</italic> strain was unable to grow with histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, isoleucine, and leucine as amine donors, which all allowed growth of the glut-aux strain (gray lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This demonstrates promiscuity of AspC and reveals that, in its physiological context, this transaminase is even more versatile than previously reported. Although AspC had shown low specific transaminase activity with histidine, methionine, isoleucine, and leucine in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 1993</xref>), our experiments suggest, however, that the enzyme is essential for the utilization of these amino acids as amine donors in vivo (rescue mechanisms II or III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, TyrB and IlvE, which had shown higher specific in vitro activities with tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan compared to AspC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 1993</xref>), apparently did not complement the <italic>aspC</italic> deletion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proline is converted to glutamate to serve as an amine source.</title><p>Aspartate transaminase (AspC) is responsible for the utilization of several amino acids.

In both cases, the mutations resulted in a frameshift, indicating a loss of function of DadX. Alanine racemase diverts flux from <sc>l</sc>-alanine to <sc>d</sc>-alanine, which is either used for cell wall biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walsh, 1989</xref>) or degraded to pyruvate via <sc>d</sc>-alanine:quinone oxidoreductase (DadA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin and Venables, 1976</xref>).

Hence, engineering the use of β-alanine as an amine donor for the glut-aux strain could potentially open new routes for selective 3-hydroxypropionate production. In order to test whether β-alanine usage can be engineered, two different β-alanine transaminases were overexpressed in the glut-aux and WT strains.

Transamination of glycine or serine instead of deamination can improve efficiency of the formate assimilation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claassens et al., 2022</xref>). As <italic>E. coli</italic> lacks a glycine transaminase, this amino acid cannot be directly generated by transamination of the respective ketoacid (glyoxylate). Instead, it is obtained from serine via the serine hydroxymethyl transferase reactions. To engineer the usage of glycine as an amine donor, we overexpressed the glycine-oxaloacetate transaminase from <italic>Paracoccus denitrificans</italic> (BhcA, UniProt ID A1B8Z3) in the glut-aux strain to form aspartate, which we have shown to support fast growth of the glut-aux strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>However, growth of the glut-aux strain overexpressing BhcA was not restored upon supplying the medium with glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). We speculated that, similar to our results with alanine as an amine donor described above, the provided glycine is further diverted into a sink. Hence, we directed our efforts towards the potential promiscuous activity of the <sc>d</sc>-alanine:quinone oxidoreductase DadA with glycine and the glycine cleavage system. DadA has been reported to be active with a variety of <sc>d</sc>-amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wild and Klopotowski, 1981</xref>) and might potentially use glycine as a substrate as well. Indeed, the deletion of <italic>dadA</italic> allowed the strain to grow slowly with glycine as an amine donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), at first indicating glycine removal via promiscuous activity of DadA. However, in vitro, DadA showed only a very low specific activity with glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>) and an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> &gt; 500 mM for this amino acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which strongly suggested that the catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> of 0.275 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was insufficient to provide a strong glycine sink in vivo. Notably, DadA was previously reported to efficiently convert <sc>d</sc>-serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wild and Klopotowski, 1981</xref>), the product of alanine racemase Alr, which also acts on <sc>l</sc>-serine besides <sc>l</sc>-alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ju et al., 2005</xref>). In vitro measurements of DadA confirmed a higher catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> of 5.71 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) of DadA with <sc>d</sc>-serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>) than previously measured with glycine. BhcA exhibits much better kinetic properties with serine (tested with glyoxylate as the acceptor [<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> 2.1 mM; <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> 8.8 s<sup>–1</sup>]) than with glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schada von Borzyskowski et al., 2019</xref>). We thus concluded that glycine needed to be converted to serine via combined activities of the glycine cleavage system (GCV), cleaving one glycine molecule to ammonium, CO<sub>2</sub>, and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, and serine hydroxymethyl transferase subsequently condensing the latter with a second glycine molecule to form serine. This pathway is used by <italic>E. coli</italic> when utilizing glycine as the sole source of nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newman et al., 1976</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, the deletion of the GCV subunits <italic>gcvTHP</italic> in the glut-aux strain overexpressing BhcA did not allow growth with glycine. Moreover, deletion of <italic>gcvTHP</italic> in the glut-aux ∆<italic>dadA</italic> strain overexpressing BhcA abolished growth with glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), providing strong evidence that glycine is converted to serine to utilize it as an amine donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). Moreover, compared to other amine donors tested the growth supported by glycine was very slow (stationary phase reached after 200 hr).</p><p>Next, we tested whether serine (not an amine source for the glut-aux strain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) served as an amine donor for the glut-aux strain overexpressing BhcA. In good agreement with the conclusion of our glycine trials, we found that the growth of the glut-aux, glut-aux ∆<italic>dadA</italic>, glut-aux ∆<italic>gcvTHP,</italic> and glut-aux ∆<italic>dadA</italic> ∆<italic>gcvTHP</italic> strains (all overexpressing BhcA) was restored upon addition of low serine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In our growth experiments, serine concentrations above 1.7 mM seemed to be toxic to the strain, which can be explained by the inhibition of isoleucine and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis by serine-derived hydroxypyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hama et al., 1990</xref>). The glut-aux ∆<italic>dadA</italic> reached the highest OD<sub>600</sub> on all tested serine concentrations, indicating that also here deletion of DadA is beneficial as it removes a sink for either glycine or serine directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To further demonstrate serine transamination catalyzed by BhcA with oxaloacetate as amine acceptor, we conducted in vitro measurements with purified BhcA. The enzymatic coupling assay indeed confirmed amine transfer from serine to oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The resulting <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> of 7 mM and a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 25.9 s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) indicated a sufficient turnover of serine and oxaloacetate into aspartate and hydroxypyruvate. To further verify that the strain is indeed using the amine from glycine or serine, respectively, we conducted a labeling experiment growing the glut-aux Δ<italic>dadA</italic> overexpressing BhcA and a WT control on M9 with <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub> or M9 with <sup>14</sup>NH<sub>4</sub> supplemented with 20 mM glycerol and 20 mM glycine, or 1.7 mM serine. Aspartate, proline, serine, alanine, and glycine were unlabeled in the glut-aux Δ<italic>dadA</italic> strain overexpressing BhcA, confirming that indeed all amines were derived only from the provided amino acid and not from free ammonium in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Exploring alternative routes of ammonium assimilation</title><p>After testing and engineering the glut-aux strain to use amino acids as amine group donors, we aimed to explore alternative ammonium assimilation pathways, thus rewiring canonical ammonium assimilation via glutamate. For this, we used the ammonium assimilation-deficient glut-aux strain to test the enzymes aspartate ammonia lyase (AspA) and leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) for their activity to supply all cellular amines for growth. Both aspartate and leucine previously were amine sources for the glut-aux strain, but while aspartate allowed fastest growth of all amino acids tested, leucine supported only very slow growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Aspartate ammonia lyase</title><p>Since aspartate served as an efficient amine donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we investigated whether it could also replace glutamate as the formation product of ammonium assimilation via the reverse activity of aspartate ammonia lyase (AspA; UniProt ID P0AC38, fumarate + NH<sub>4</sub> = aspartate), an <italic>E. coli</italic> native reaction. This enzyme canonically operates as part of the aspartate utilization/degradation pathway releasing ammonia. However, the thermodynamics of this reaction reveal a full reversibility with a Δ<sub>r</sub>G<sup>’m</sup> of 4 [kJ/mol] (in the aspartate-forming direction at a concentration of 1 mM for all reactants; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/">http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/</ext-link>). We hence overexpressed AspA in the glut-aux strain and analyzed its growth on a variety of carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Here, growth of the strain is dependent on both the ammonium assimilation activity to form aspartate and the subsequent aminotransferase activity to rescue the glut-aux strain (via rescue mechanism II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Growth of the glut-aux strain overexpressing AspA (+AspA) was indeed observed on all tested carbon sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that aspartate and AspA can replace the canonical glutamate-based ammonium assimilation pathway. The glut-aux + AspA strain grew fastest on carbon sources closest to fumarate, the substrate of AspA (2-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate, fumarate). Other carbon sources (glucose, xylose, glycerol, acetate), which do not directly generate fumarate, also supported growth, but with much higher doubling times. Assimilation of free ammonium from the medium by the glut-aux + AspA strain was confirmed by a <sup>15</sup>N labeling experiment comparing proteinogenic amino acid labeling of the glut-aux + AspA strain with the WT (serving as a positive control) upon growth on 20 mM succinate with either <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub> or <sup>14</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>.

To test whether we can engineer the glut-aux strain to produce leucine for the concomitant transaminase reactions, we overexpressed leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH), which catalyzes the reductive amination of 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (MOP) to leucine. LeuDH is absent in the repertoire of <italic>E. coli’s</italic> enzymes, hence we separately overexpressed two LeuDH genes, one from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and the other from <italic>Lysinibacillus sphaericus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). In initial experiments, the glut-aux + LeuDH did not grow in minimal media with 20 mM glycerol. As MOP is not a central metabolite, its concentration might be limiting the activity of the enzyme. Consequently, we observed growth of the glut-aux strain only upon supplementation with catalytic amounts of MOP, which served as ammonium acceptor in the amination reaction catalyzed by LeuDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We note that the MOP concentrations supplemented to the medium were at least tenfold lower compared to the 5 mM leucine addition, which served as a positive control in the experiments. The glut-aux strain overexpressing <italic>B. cereus</italic> LeuDH growing on glycerol and 0.2 and 0.5 mM MOP reached twice the OD<sub>600</sub> obtained for the glut-aux strain growing on glycerol and 5 mM leucine. This yield difference indicates a recycling of MOP through alternating activities of LeuDH and transaminases, fixing ammonium and transferring amine groups to other ketoacids. Growth of the glut-aux strain overexpressing <italic>L. sphaericus</italic> LeuDH resulted in lower yields than achieved with <italic>B. cereus</italic> LeuDH overexpression, and also lower yields than seen for the glut-aux with 5 mM leucine, indicating lower enzyme efficiency under the tested conditions.

The observed single label for the analyzed amino acids alanine, phenylalanine, methionine, proline, serine, and threonine once again confirms operation of the LeuDH’s ammonium entry point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study provides a broad investigation of amino acid and ammonium metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To examine which amino acids can be used as an amine source to compensate for the absence of canonical glutamate production, we created a glutamate auxotrophic (glut-aux) strain and tested its ability to grow on different amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, supportive summary in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our experiments revealed that the glut-aux did not grow on all tested amino acids. Here, we note that the substrate spectrum of the underlying amination network might be larger than identified by our experiments since for some amino acids we cannot rule out that their uptake limits their intracellular availability to the network. Specifically, this might be the case for valine, threonine, and β-alanine, which did not support growth of any strain. However, for some of these, previous studies identified the mechanisms preventing utilization as an amine source. For example, use of threonine as nitrogen source would require induction of threonine dehydrogenase by the presence of leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Potter et al., 1977</xref>). Growth in the presence of valine was shown to be inhibited due to valine-dependent inhibition of acetohydroxy acid synthase essential to isoleucine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tuite et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, other amino acids known to be suitable nitrogen sources for the wildtype and canonical transamination products of glutamate did not rescue growth of the glut-aux strain via the reverse reaction (i.e., alanine). For this amino acid, we identified alanine degradation as the counteracting pathway. The glut-aux strain was capable of growth on most amino acids (proline, aspartate, asparagine, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, glutamate, glutamine, ornithine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and histidine). As absence of nitrogen from the medium only affected growth of the glut-aux on ornithine, we concluded that nitrogen response-dependent regulation was of minor relevance for amino acid metabolism. We assumed that in order for the glut-aux strain to grow, amino acids could either (i) fully replace glutamate as an amine donor, (ii) donate their amine directly to 2-ketoglutarate, (iii) be converted into an intermediate donating an amine to 2-ketoglutarate to form glutamate, or (iv) be direct glutamate precursors. Given the inability of the selection strain to synthesize glutamate, intracellular glutamate levels are expected to be lower than in a wildtype strain under saturating nitrogen availability. Therefore, some of the identified rescue mechanisms might not be the universally favored metabolic options. However, defining the mechanisms of growth restoration in the glut-aux strain might give insights into strategies of adaptation to limiting ammonium availability. To investigate which reactions allowed amine utilization from amino acids, we deleted several genes responsible for the respective amino acid degradation pathway. While proline was directly converted to glutamate (rescue mechanism IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), utilization of histidine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, isoleucine, and leucine depended on transamination mediated by AspC, one of the three main transaminases in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelfand and Steinberg, 1977</xref>; rescue mechanism II, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Three aspects of this finding were surprising to us. First, deletion of AspC alone was sufficient to abolish growth of the glut-aux strain on tyrosine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, and leucine. This was unexpected since the other two main transaminases TyrB and IlvE share cross-reactivities with these amino acids and indicates that in spite of their cross-reactivity they cannot fully replace AspC in vivo. Residual tyrosine and phenylalanine aminotransferase activity in <italic>tyrB</italic> and <italic>ilvE</italic> knockout strains in previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelfand and Steinberg, 1977</xref>) led to the hypothesis that AspC was mainly exhibiting these activities, which herewith is further supported. Second, deletion of AspC abolished growth on histidine, methionine, isoleucine, and leucine for which only low or no specific activity of AspC was reported in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Powell and Morrison, 1978</xref>). Under physiological conditions, the substrate range of AspC thus seems to be broader than previously anticipated. Third, the glut-aux Δ<italic>aspC</italic> strain was unable to grow with tryptophan as an amine source. Although activity of ΑspC with tryptophan was demonstrated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Powell and Morrison, 1978</xref>), transamination is not a known tryptophan degradation pathway in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reitzer, 2014</xref>). We hence conclude that in the glut-aux strain, tryptophan is the direct substrate of AspC to form (indole-3-yl)-pyruvate and glutamate as in some bacteria (e.g., <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bortolotti et al., 2016</xref>], <italic>Clostridium sporogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Neil and DeMoss, 1968</xref>]), protozoa (<italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lowe and Rowe, 1985</xref>]), or mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shrawder and Martinez-Carrion, 1972</xref>). Grouping amino acids by expected rescue mechanism and rescue phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed that the majority of amino acids we suggest to be used via direct transamination rescued the glut-aux strain, but were not a good amine source for the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, we found AspC to be essential for the growth of the glut-aux on all amino acids not supporting WT growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, we suggest promiscuous transaminase activity here rescuing growth of the glut-aux. strain to be one mechanism for adaptation to lacking glutamate availability. Hence, our study expands previous knowledge by several novel transamination routes in <italic>E. coli,</italic> which need to be considered in contexts of low amine or glutamate availability.</p><p>In addition to identifying natively present routes of amino acid metabolism, we demonstrated how amino acid metabolism can be rewired to allow utilization of new amine sources. Overexpression of alanine-2-ketoglutarate aminotransferase, together with the removal of an alanine sink, allowed usage of alanine as an amine source. By overexpressing transaminases that transfer amines from β-alanine to 2-ketoglutarate, we engineered usage of the non-proteinogenic amino acid β-alanine as amine source. Following the same logic, we expressed an aspartate-glyoxylate aminotransferase to select for its reverse activity with glycine or serine. Upon deletion of the <sc>d</sc>-amino acid dehydrogenase gene <italic>dadA</italic> as potential internal sink for glycine and serine, the engineered strain was able to use the amine from glycine to support growth. Surprisingly, we discovered that the strain did not use glycine directly, but converted it to serine, which was yet another substrate of the transaminase showing high activity for serine (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of 25.87 s<sup>–1</sup>) with oxaloacetate as amine acceptor. In principle, the newly discovered serine-oxaloacetate transaminase activity can be coupled to formate assimilation via the reductive glycine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), which fixes ammonium by reverse activity of the glycine cleavage system. This allows ammonium transfer to make aspartate and convert serine to hydroxypyruvate instead of pyruvate (generated via serine deaminase activity in the reductive glycine pathway), hence saving ATP needed to convert pyruvate into PEP, essential for anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis. The usage of alanine, β-alanine, glycine, and serine as amine donors was engineered in the glut-aux strain by transaminase overexpression and (if necessary) removal of intracellular substrate sinks. Thus, we conclude that for these amino acids, transaminase availability was the main bottleneck rather than transport or regulatory issues. In addition to this finding, these examples demonstrate the glut-aux strain as an excellent selection platform to screen for any reaction that produces amino acids which can rescue growth. This potentially allows the discovery of new amine sources.</p><p>The function of glutamate as a universal amine transfer molecule originates in its role as canonical entry point of ammonium into metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumada et al., 1993</xref>). We were interested in finding out whether the prominence of this ammonium assimilation mechanism can be explained by a significant advantage compared to other mechanisms of ammonium assimilation. To investigate this, we replaced canonical ammonium assimilation via glutamate biosynthesis with two alternative pathways. Both fumarate amination to aspartate and MOP amination to leucine reconstituted the ability of the glut-aux strain to assimilate free ammonium. Growth dependent on ammonium assimilation via AspA was fastest when a carbon source metabolically close to fumarate was provided. We note that assimilation of ammonium via aspartate ammonia lyase is energetically different from ammonium assimilation via glutamate. While a glutamate-dependent amination network requires NADPH consumption by glutamate dehydrogenase, an aspartate ammonia lyase-dependent network requires NADH for the reduction of oxaloacetate back to fumarate; oxaloacetate being the transamination product of <italic>aspC</italic>. NADH is energetically cheaper compared to NADPH as the recovery of the latter from NADH wastes some proton motive force through the membrane-bound transhydrogenase, and hence comes with the indirect cost of ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spaans et al., 2015</xref>). Although ammonium assimilation via aspartate or leucine biosynthesis led to immediate growth of the glut-aux strain in growth-optimized laboratory conditions, these do not reflect natural conditions under which glutamate-based ammonium assimilation might have evolved and become prominent. Under ammonium-limiting conditions, GDH and GS are kinetically superior with a <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> of 2 mM and 0.1 mM for ammonia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reitzer, 2014</xref>), compared to AspA or LeuDH from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cereus</italic> with <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values of 20 mM and 13 mM for ammonia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suzuki et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanwal and Zink, 1961</xref>). Additionally, the availability of two different systems (GDH and GS/GOGAT), which are each optimal for different growth conditions but generate the same molecule, is unique to glutamate-based ammonium assimilation. Ammonium assimilation as metabolic link between energy, carbon, and nitrogen metabolism requires a tight multilayer regulation of GDH and GS. Thus, immediate growth via alternative ammonium assimilation routes that are independent of native transcriptional regulation, as achieved via aspartate and leucine in our study, is nontrivial. On the other hand, the laboratory cultivation conditions that allow this immediate growth do not require the metabolic flexibility and control given by the interplay and regulation of GDH and GS. It is even likely that growth of the engineered strains under nonoptimal conditions would be impaired by a lack of flexible metabolic responses to varying nitrogen and energy availability. This might explain the conservation of glutamate-coupled ammonium assimilation as opposed to alternative ammonium assimilation pathways. Furthermore, regulatory effects, for example, GS inhibition by several amino acids (e.g., tryptophan, histidine, alanine, glycine), might explain why some amino acids only supported slow growth of the glut-aux strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubbard and Stadtman, 1967</xref>).</p><p>The possibility to modify ammonium assimilation and metabolism by metabolic engineering indicates that the underlying metabolic network is highly flexible, which is supported by highly promiscuous transaminases. However, transaminases are a limiting factor that defines the amination network, which implies the presence of different amination networks in different organisms that express different transaminases. That said, our study demonstrates how amino acid usage and even ammonium assimilation mechanisms are transferable by expressing heterologous genes. In this, we find that to allow such transferability between apparently different amination networks, the amine distribution network around the universally conserved core principle of glutamate-based amine assimilation must be highly flexible. Additionally, these engineering possibilities might have relevance for the metabolic engineering of synthetic pathways, for example, for growth-coupled selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Orsi et al., 2021</xref>) or the production of certain amino acids or their derivatives. By engineering ammonium assimilation via non-glutamate-producing reactions, the cellular ammonium assimilation can be decoupled from glutamate biosynthesis for the production of nitrogenous compounds. Such decoupling follows the paradigm of modular design for bioengineering, which can support new endeavors for strain creation for biotechnological production processes. Here, the most obvious impact could be made on the million-ton-scale industrial amino acid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wendisch, 2020</xref>). Engineering new ammonium entry points as well as extending the amination network could positively affect these processes. For example, such metabolic network optimization was previously demonstrated by increased arginine production yields in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> upon expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> AspA and GlnA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our research addressed three distinct and complementary aspects regarding amino acid and ammonium metabolism. We provided a comprehensive overview of the options and limitations of the cellular amination network. Then, we showed its flexibility when engineering the network towards the use of new amine sources. Finally, by engineering new ammonium entry points, we increased the potential design space for engineering ammonium assimilation and dissimilation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

exploring possible ways by which <italic>E. coli</italic> is able to assimilate nitrogen. The work reveals that some amination reactions can be reversed and redirected with strain engineering, thus introducing the novel concept of a cellular amination network (reversible nitrogen transfer). In addition to furthering a fundamental understanding of metabolism, this work provides a modular platform for the metabolic engineering of ammonium assimilation and dissimilation, which has potential for the industrial bioproduction of nitrogenous compounds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77492.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Khalil</surname><given-names>Ahmad S</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05qwgg493</institution-id><institution>Boston University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Reitzer</surname><given-names>Lawrence</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/049emcs32</institution-id><institution>The University of Texas at Dallas</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Segre</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05qwgg493</institution-id><institution>Boston University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.25.477661">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.25.477661v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lawrence Reitzer (Reviewer #2); Daniel Segre (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 3 provide many suggestions for improving the clarity of the text and figures.</p><p>2) Reviewer 2 highlights the need for expanded discussion of relevant topics, including metabolite levels, transaminases, regulation of enzymes, etc.</p><p>3) The authors are asked to address a lingering concern regarding the physiological relevance of the results, i.e. the fact that this result may be limited to a highly engineered strain and specific growth conditions and not observed in nature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 1 is confusing to read as it is first referenced in the introduction, referring to amination on the right side of the figure, and then again referenced in the Results section, referring to amine donation routes on the left side. Figures are generally read from left to right, so simply inverting the figure will help bring the reader's attention to canonical ammonium assimilation first. Also, further distinguishing ammonium molecules and amine groups, possibly with different shapes, would be beneficial.</p><p>– Interchanging 2-ketoglutarate and 2-oxoglutarate in the text is confusing, as not all readers will recognize that they refer to the same molecule. Please pick one and stick with it.</p><p>– For making additional comparisons between strains and amine donors, it would be beneficial to see a table of calculated growth rates in the supplementary material, when relevant (proline supporting a higher growth rate than glutamate, line 165, for example). This may also support claims of certain amine donors or engineered strains being more efficient than others.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the paper is very well written, is also fairly complex. Figure 1 is very useful to help the readers orient themselves. The numbers associated with the different paths through which amines could enter the network are also a helpful way of classifying the different modalities. What I would like to suggest is for the authors to refer more often and more explicitly to these modalities throughout the manuscript, by referring to those same four categories. I think this would help readers reconnect to Figure 1, especially when reaching the section on alternative routes of ammonium assimilation (page 14).</p><p>I am also wondering whether there is a way to display the overall relationship of the different amino acids to each other. I understand that it would be too complicated to display the complete metabolic network with the different amino acids. However, perhaps it is possible and useful to encode the relationship through a network of similarity of phenotypic behavior (e.g. draw a link between two amino acids if the amine assimilation behavior on those two amino acids is similar). This map could serve as an illustration of the overall structure of the dataset, and could reveal structural features difficult to infer from individual growth curves. I would invite the authors to consider generating such a map and potentially including it in the manuscript if it seems informative.</p><p>There are two broad questions that I found myself asking after reading this paper. They are both beyond the scope of the current paper, but I (and the readers) might be interested in hearing if you have thoughts you would be willing to share (e.g. in the discussion) on these points. The first question is whether you expect some or all of the patterns observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> to be broadly shared by other bacteria, or if – on the contrary – you think that radically different amination networks may be found in other bacteria (even closely related ones, which may have similar metabolism, but different regulatory networks) or other organisms. The second question is whether in your opinion the specific architecture you discovered can teach us something about the evolutionary history of nitrogen assimilation strategies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77492.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Figure 1 is confusing to read as it is first referenced in the introduction, referring to amination on the right side of the figure, and then again referenced in the Results section, referring to amine donation routes on the left side.
