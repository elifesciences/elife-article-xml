hallmark of the carcinoma cell as it bestows it with the capacity of transiently altering its morphological and functional features while <italic>en route</italic> to the metastatic site. However, the study of phenotypic plasticity is hindered by the rarity of these events within primary lesions and by the lack of experimental models. Here, we identified a subpopulation of phenotypic plastic colon cancer cells: EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells are motile, invasive, chemo-resistant, and highly metastatic. EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> bulk and single-cell RNAseq analysis indicated (1) enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling, (2) a broad spectrum of degrees of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) activation including hybrid E/M states (partial EMT) with highly plastic features, and (3) high correlation with the CMS4 subtype, accounting for colon cancer cases with poor prognosis and a pronounced stromal component. Of note, a signature of genes specifically expressed in EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cancer cells is highly predictive of overall survival in tumors other than CMS4, thus highlighting the relevance of quasi-mesenchymal tumor cells across the spectrum of colon cancers. Enhanced Wnt and the downstream EMT activation represent key events in eliciting phenotypic plasticity along the invasive front of primary colon carcinomas. Distinct sets of epithelial and mesenchymal genes define transcriptional trajectories through which state transitions arise. pEMT cells, often earmarked by the extracellular matrix glycoprotein SPARC together with nuclear ZEB1 and β-catenin along the invasive front of primary colon carcinomas, are predicted to represent the origin of these (de)differentiation routes through biologically distinct cellular states and to underlie the phenotypic plasticity of colon cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>partial EMT</kwd><kwd>colon cancer</kwd><kwd>phenotypic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008359</institution-id><institution>Maag Lever Darm Stichting</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP 15-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fodde</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMCR 2015-8090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fodde</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A17196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansom</surname><given-names>Owen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A21139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sansom</surname><given-names>Owen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Colon cancer cells disseminate and colonize distant organ sites along the invasion-metastasis cascade by transiently activating intermediate epithelial to mesenchymal transition states through distinct transcriptional trajectories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancers of epithelial origin such as breast, prostate, pancreas, lung, and colon carcinomas are thought to develop from normal tissues through a multistep sequence of genetic events from benign precursor lesions to increasingly more malignant stages. This is exemplarily illustrated by the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in colon cancer where a stepwise buildup of genetic alterations in specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes underlies tumor initiation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990</xref>). These alterations result in well-defined cellular changes largely reflecting the so-called ‘hallmarks of cancer,’ which provide different selective advantages to the developing tumor and represent essential requirements for carcinoma formation at the primary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>). However, with regard to the capacity to disseminate through the tumor microenvironment and establish metastases in distant organ sites, epigenetic changes, rather than genetic mutations, underlie what is the most clinically relevant hallmark of cancer, namely phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varga and Greten, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Teeuwssen and Fodde, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Malignant cells, and in particular those responsible for local dissemination and distant metastasis, are often endowed with the capacity to undergo transient and reversible morphological and functional changes. In particular, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), that is, the progressive loss of epithelial features and the acquirement of a more migratory and mesenchymal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>), is regarded as a crucial event in tumor cell invasion and dissemination at the primary site. EMT bestows cancer cells with stem-like plastic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mani et al., 2008</xref>) needed to acquire quasi-mesenchymal features at the invasive front of the primary tumor, disseminate and attain therapy resistance, and to revert back to more epithelial states (mesenchymal to epithelial transition [MET]) at the organ site of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>). Epigenetic activation and silencing of EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs) underlies the transient nature of these cellular modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skrypek et al., 2017</xref>). Notwithstanding these ground rules, a very broad spectrum of molecular and cellular routes underlies EMT and the resulting phenotypic plasticity in a context-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook and Vanderhyden, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The ‘migrating cancer stem cell’ (mCSC) model has been first proposed for colon cancer by T. Brabletz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>), also as a solution to the so-called ‘β-catenin paradox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fodde and Brabletz, 2007</xref>). In the majority of sporadic colorectal cancer cases, the rate-limiting loss of the <italic>APC</italic> tumor suppressor is predicted to lead to nuclear β-catenin translocation and full-blown Wnt signaling activation. Notwithstanding these predictions, tumor cells with nuclear β-catenin represent only a small minority of the primary lesion and tend to cluster non-randomly at the invasive front of colon carcinomas where they gain mesenchymal features to detach and disseminate into the adjacent stromal tissues. In view of these observations, it is plausible that cues secreted from the tumor microenvironment elicit EMT downstream of full-blown Wnt signaling activation, earmarked by nuclear β-catenin, in a subset of cells located at the invasive front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fodde and Brabletz, 2007</xref>). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Wnt and EMT activation at the invasive front of colon cancers are yet largely unknown also due to a lack of robust in vitro and in vivo models.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that human immortalized breast cancer cell lines encompass different subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypic states and functional characteristics maintained in a dynamic equilibrium through stochastic transitions between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). Similar observations were made in oral squamous carcinoma cell lines where distinct CSC phenotypes are present: whereas non-EMT CSCs are proliferative and retain epithelial characteristics, the EMT-competent CSC fraction is (quasi)mesenchymal and of increased cellular motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biddle et al., 2011</xref>). As such, conventional immortalized cancer cell lines may offer a valid model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in cancer and to identify novel EMT/CSC-related therapeutic targets.</p><p>Here, we identified and extensively characterized a subpopulation of quasi-mesenchymal colon cancer cells endowed with phenotypic plasticity that underlie local invasion and distant metastasis, and whose expression signature is predictive of reduced disease-free survival among colon cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conventional colon cancer cell lines encompass a subpopulation of ZEB1-driven quasi-mesenchymal, highly metastatic, and chemo-resistant cells</title><p>To assess whether, as observed for breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>), commonly employed colon cancer cell lines encompass distinct differentiated and more stem-like subpopulations of cancer cells, we first analyzed a broad panel of cell lines by FACS with antibodies directed against different (cancer) stem cell markers (CD44, CD133, CD24, ALDEFLUOR) in combination with the epithelial marker EpCAM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for HCT116 and SW480, the CD44/EpCAM combination best highlighted the presence of distinct subpopulations with a predominant CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>high</sup> cluster and a minority of CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>low</sup> cells. The same CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>low</sup> cells were identified at similarly variable percentages in other commonly employed colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Here, we mainly focused on the HCT116 and SW480 lines as they are representative of the two main colon cancer subtypes earmarked by microsatellite instability (MIN) and chromosomal instability (CIN; also known as microsatellite stable [MSS]), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lengauer et al., 1997</xref>). For the sake of clarity and readability, from this point on we will refer to the CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>low</sup> and CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>high</sup> subpopulations of colon cancer cells as EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> and EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification and characterization of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells in colon cancer cell lines.</title><p>(A) Flow cytometric analysis of the colon cancer cell lines HCT116 (left panel) and SW480 (right panel) with antibodies directed against CD44 and EpCAM. EpCAM/CD44-positive and -negative regions (gray quadrants) were defined as in Figure supplement 1 using multiple isotype controls and are shown by the quadrants in the plots. Notably, both HCT116 and SW480 revealed a continuum of different EpCAM and CD44 expression levels with a large CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>high</sup> (EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>) cluster followed by a tail of gradually decreasing EpCAM and increasing CD44 levels. By applying specific gates, cells were divided in a large EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> cluster, together with a considerably smaller CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>low</sup> (EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>) subpopulation. To ensure good separation from the large EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> cluster and maximal sorting purity, EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells were gated as CD44<sup>hi</sup> events ≤ 60% of the EpCAM fluorescence intensity of the left border of the EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> gate and sorted from ≤50% of that value. Variable percentages of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells were found to feature the HCT116 (5.0% ± 2.5%) and SW480 (16.7% ± 13%) cell lines, respectively.

Next, we employed least-square optimization to estimate the transition probabilities that best fit the observed population dynamics. The fitted model predicts that both subpopulations have a high probability to retain their cell identity, with minor though significant likelihood to transit to the other state. Of note, EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells show a higher transition probability compared to EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> (8.1- and 4.0-fold in HCT116 and SW480, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Due to the observed differences in doubling times between the two states, subclones with a lower EpCAM<sup>hi&gt;lo</sup> transition probability will experience a slight growth advantage, which will become prevalent in the long run.

Colon cancer provides a unique example for this conundrum: although it is well-established that a sequence of gene mutations underlies the adenoma-carcinoma sequence at the primary site, no alterations have been identified in genes potentially able to underlie local invasion and distant metastasis. Hence, the capacity to metastasize could already be predetermined by specific mutations acquired by tumor cells at relatively early stages of tumorigenesis. However, this does not yet explain why and how only rare cells within the primary lesion acquire a metastatic phenotype that endows them with increased cell motility and with the capacity to invade the stromal microenvironment to eventually home at distant organ sites and form metastases. From this perspective, phenotypic plasticity likely represents a relevant mechanism for metastasizing colon carcinoma cells to transiently and reversibly change their cellular identity along the invasion-metastasis cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varga and Greten, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Teeuwssen and Fodde, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of colon cancers are initiated by mutations at the <italic>APC</italic> gene predicted to lead to constitutive Wnt signaling by β-catenin nuclear translocation. However, IHC analysis has shown that nuclear accumulation of β-catenin is exclusively observed at the invasive front where tumor cells are exposed to growth factors and cytokines secreted by the stromal microenvironment likely to further enhance Wnt signaling in a localized fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fodde and Brabletz, 2007</xref>). As different levels of Wnt/β-catenin signaling are associated with distinct cellular outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaspar and Fodde, 2004</xref>), it is plausible to think that the ‘full-blown’ activation of this pathway, earmarked by nuclear β-catenin, may trigger EMT and endow phenotypic plasticity in a minority of colon cancer cells located at the invasive front. The transient and reversible nature of these cellular modifications is likely driven by epigenetic changes at EMT-TFs.</p><p>Here, we have taken advantage of the coexistence of biologically distinct cellular phenotypes within commonly employed colon cancer cell lines to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie phenotypic plasticity and the acquisition of invasive and metastatic capacity. While the bulk of the cancer cells have a characteristic epithelial phenotype (here referred to as EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>), a minority of cells with mesenchymal morphology and plastic features (EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>) coexist in a dynamic equilibrium through stochastic state transitions with their more committed counterpart. Similar observations have been previously made in breast cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biddle et al., 2011</xref>), which underlines their relevance for the study of phenotypic plasticity in a broad spectrum of malignancies.</p><p>As predicted by their morphology, EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells feature increased invasive and metastatic capacity and a distinct gene expression profile when compared to their epithelial counterpart. In particular, EMT activation resulting from enhanced Wnt signaling and <italic>ZEB1</italic> upregulation are distinctive features of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> transcriptome. Of note, <italic>ZEB1</italic> plays many pleiotropic roles ranging from the modulation of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways, cell-fate determination, stemness, and cell plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caramel et al., 2017</xref>) and is as such likely to be a determinant in colon cancer invasion and metastasis. From this perspective, the recent debate on EMT as an essential requirement for metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maheswaran and Haber, 2015</xref>) likely mirrors the complexity of transcription factors and their downstream targets involved in these processes. Moreover, a recent scRNAseq comparative study of various time-course EMT models has revealed very limited overlap among differentially expressed genes indicative of the vastly context-dependent nature of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook and Vanderhyden, 2020</xref>). The here presented data emphasize the key role played by EMT and its reverse MET in colon tumor cell dissemination and distant metastasis formation.</p><p>The observed role of enhanced Wnt signaling in EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells is of interest in view of the presence of <italic>APC</italic> and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (β-catenin) gene mutations in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishisho et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ilyas et al., 1997</xref>). Further enhancement of Wnt signaling is likely to result in EMT activation through <italic>ZEB1</italic> upregulation and its conversion from a repressor to activator state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez-Tilló et al., 2011</xref>). On its turn, increased <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression was also shown to enhance Wnt, possibly in an autocrine stimulatory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sánchez-Tilló et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, Wnt ‘super-activation’ by GSK3β inhibition (i.e., Chiron) in the <italic>APC</italic>/<italic>CTNNB1</italic>-mutated colon cancer cell lines results in a significant expansion of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells and increased <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression. Vice versa, <italic>ZEB1</italic> downregulation by shRNA leads to a dramatic contraction of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation. Notably, isogenic subclones of HCT116 carrying wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutations at the β-catenin locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) show a progressive increase in the size of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation. These observations highlight the relevance of Wnt dosages in the downstream activation of EMT.</p><p>Transcriptional regulation of EMT-TFs has been shown to be controlled by miRNAs binding to specific 3´UTR sequences. In particular, members of the miR-200 family inhibit EMT and cancer cell motility by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling and directly interfering with the expression of EMT-TFs and in particular of <italic>ZEB1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghahhari and Babashah, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we have shown that the expression of different members of the miR-200 family is downregulated in EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> colon cancer cells when compared with their epithelial counterpart. Moreover, the RKO cell line, composed entirely of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells, was previously reported to be characterized by epigenetic downregulation of miR-200a/b/c, leading to high <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davalos et al., 2012</xref>) in the absence of Wnt-activating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sparks et al., 1998</xref>). As the epigenetic activation/silencing of the miR-200 locus is dynamically regulated by common EMT-inducers such as TGFβ and Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghahhari and Babashah, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davalos et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that phenotypic plasticity is triggered in vivo in cells located at the invasive front of colon carcinomas as a result of a complex interplay between their specific mutation spectra and epigenetic profiles modulated by different signaling cues from the microenvironment. The consistent presence of cells with nuclear co-localization of ZEB1 and β-catenin located at the invasive front of patient-derived colon carcinomas validates these observations. Other EMT-TFs like ZEB2 are likely to be upregulated in ZEB1-negative cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kahlert et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The clinical relevance of our results, originated from the analysis of immortalized cancer cell lines, came from the bioinformatic mining of bulk and scRNAseq data from patient-derived colon cancers. First, EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> expression signatures are highly correlated with the CMS4 signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>) and with shorter disease-free and overall survival. The mesenchymal CMS4 subtype accounts for approximately 25% of the cases and is associated with the greatest propensity to form metastases. While the CMS4 signature was initially attributed to the presence of tumor-associated stroma and not to a cancer cell-intrinsic property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isella et al., 2015</xref>), it has been shown that <italic>bona fide</italic> tumor cells from stroma-rich cancers have a markedly mesenchymal gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vellinga et al., 2016</xref>). By taking advantage of the Lee et al. scRNAseq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), we derived a tumor-specific signature (<italic>CMS4_TC</italic>) by selecting epithelial-specific genes from the original CMS4_RF signature that outperforms other commonly employed prognostic and predictive markers (e.g., <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation and MSI; <italic>data not shown</italic>) in stratifying CMS1, 3, and 4 colon cancer patients based on overall survival. These results highlight the relevance of our study in the identification of a quasi-mesenchymal cellular state with plastic, invasive, and metastatic properties predictive of poor prognosis in colon cancer patients regardless of their CMS classification.</p><p>Recent studies on the role of EMT in eliciting phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells have highlighted the relevance of intermediate cellular stages co-expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal genes for tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jolly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pastushenko et al., 2018</xref>). These hybrid E/M or partial EMT cells are thought to be endowed with increased invasive and metastatic capacity. Our scRNAseq analysis of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> colon cancer cells has revealed not only fully mesenchymal but also hybrid E/M subclusters, the latter predicted in silico to underlie the observed transcriptional heterogeneity. Of note, transcriptional activation of specific arrays of E- (epi1/2) and M- (mes1/2) genes accompanies the transition between cellular states. Partial EMT cells, predicted by RNAvelocity to transit between states, are characterized not only by the co-expression of E- and M-specific genes at intermediate levels, but also by increased expression of specific genes like <italic>SPARC</italic> (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine, also known as osteonectin), encoding for a matricellular protein involved in the modulation of cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions and known as a prognostic marker in colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). The role of SPARC in cancer is controversial as it has been shown to promote EMT and metastasis, but also to encompass tumor-suppressive functions in a context-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Podhajcer et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, SPARC triggers EMT through direct cell-to-cell contact and upregulation of other EMT-inducers like fibronectin (FN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takigawa et al., 2017</xref>), reminiscent of the interactions occurring between parenchymal and stromal cells at the invasive front in colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fodde and Brabletz, 2007</xref>) where pEMT is expected to underlie plasticity and invasion through the ECM. Although SPARC is unique in its expression peaking at pEMT states and earmarking the transition between EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> and EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> in both cell lines and in mes-like cells from patient-derived colon cancers, it seems unlikely that specific genes exist that can independently elicit pEMT. Instead, tumor-specific and context-dependent activation of subset of genes with distinct functions (e.g., <italic>SPARC</italic>, <italic>FN1</italic>, <italic>MMP7</italic>, <italic>ZEB1</italic>, <italic>ECM1</italic>) synergistically promoting, for example, collective cell migration upon interaction with the stromal microenvironment, may represent a more likely scenario.</p><p>The metastable and plastic features of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells were further highlighted by their striking capacity of giving rise to distant metastases reminiscent of the primary tumors both in the prevalence of EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> cells and in the distinct patterns of β-catenin intracellular localization between the periphery and center of the lesions. These observations are in agreement with the key role of MET for the onset of distant metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>). The admittedly marginal increase in liver and lung metastases upon continuous induction of <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression is likely to result from MET inhibition. From this perspective, our results provide support to the ‘migrating CSC’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brabletz et al., 2005</xref>) and ‘β-catenin paradox’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fodde and Brabletz, 2007</xref>) models and shed light on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt super-activation, (p)EMT induction, and cell dissemination along the invasive front of colon carcinomas.</p><p>The characterization of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity in colon cancer cells along the invasion-metastasis cascade has great relevance for the development of future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches based on circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Although current detection methodologies mainly rely on their epithelial features, more recent studies have indicated that CTCs with less pronounced epithelial characteristics are likely to underlie metastasis at distant organ sites. In breast and oral cancer, hybrid E/M tumor cells feature the highest degree of phenotypic plasticity coupling the capacity of undergoing EMT/MET with therapy resistance and other stem cells features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biddle et al., 2016</xref>). Further single-cell RNAseq and functional analyses of extensive cohorts of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells from matched primary tumors, CTCs, and the corresponding distant metastases will open new avenues for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HCT116(adult colorectal carcinoma)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ECACC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 91091005, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For sorting of subpopulations;

The stained cells were then FACS-analyzed using a 655 LP and a 695/40 BP filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell viability assays</title><p>For the chemoresistance assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 15,000 cells/well and left overnight to adhere. Three technical replicates were plated per tested condition. Both oxaliplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5-fluorouacil (5-FU; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in DMSO. HCT116 cells were incubated for 3 or 5 days with 5-FU and oxaliplatin, respectively, whereas SW480 cells were treated with 5-FU or oxaliplatin for 7 days (calibrated on the response of the parental line in terms of viability). After removal of the chemotherapeutic drug, cells were washed with PBS and left to regrow in standard culture medium. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)–2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma-Aldrich) assay at time 0, that is, upon removal of the drug, and after regrowth (range 1–36 days). Briefly, cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 3 hr in culture medium supplemented with 0.45 mg/mL MTT. The 96-well plates were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5′ and the culture medium removed. MTT formazan precipitates were solubilized with DMSO. O.D. reading was performed at 595 nm with a Microplate Reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad). Background measurements were subtracted from each data point. MTT-based results were also validated by manual count of trypan blue-positive cells using cells harvested from additional 96 wells. At least two biological experiments were performed for each individual cell line and drug.</p><p>Selection of oxaliplatin and 5-FU concentrations and administration times for chemo-resistance assays was as follows. In a predefined range of concentrations (1.5–100 μg/mL for 5-FU and 0.6–50 μg/mL for oxaliplatin) based on previous data, the maximal concentration and length of treatment were selected as the combination able to induce cell death in approximately 80% of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells. From that concentration, the curve was scaled down by 50% at least three times to reach the lowest concentration to be tested. The minimal treatment length was 72 hr, while the maximal duration was 1 week. Oxaliplatin was considerably slower than 5-FU in its cytotoxicity with HCT116 cells. The difference was less relevant in SW480 cells where numerous cells, although irreversibly damaged, remained viable for several days. For the latter reason, treatment was longer in SW480 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Migration and invasion assays</title><p>For the ‘transwell’ (modified Boyden chamber) migration and invasion assays, cells were starved for 24 hr in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS. For each tested subpopulation, 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were harvested, resuspended in 1% FBS medium, and plated in transwell tissue culture inserts (8 µm polycarbonate membrane, 24 well, 3428; Corning). For the invasion assays, 1.5 µg/mL Matrigel dissolved in serum-free medium was pipetted on top of the transwell membrane and left to set at 37°C for several hours before plating the cells. DMEM medium with 10% FBS was then placed in the lower compartment of the transwell chamber. For both assays, three technical replicates were plated for each subpopulation. Plates were incubated for 24 hr at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>, after which the cells and membranes were fixed in methanol and stained with crystal violet. The non-migrated cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton-wool bud and the cells migrated to the lower surface of the membrane counted. For both assays, two independent experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol Reagent (15596018, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

characterises a sub-population of colon cancer cells that display phenotypic plasticity. These so-called EopCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells are motile, invasive, chemo-resistant and metastatic. RNA sequencing showed they are associated with enhanced Wnt/b-catenin signalling, plastic (partial) epithelial/mesenchymal state, and subtypes of colon cancer that have poor prognosis. Therefore, distinct sets of epithelial and mesenchymal genes in cells at the invasive front, and in metastasis, define transcriptional trajectories, the epithelial-mesenchymal state, and disease outcome.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phenotypic plasticity and partial EMT underlie local invasion and distant metastasis in colon cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper has now been reviewed by three reviewers and myself. While all reviewers see merit in aspects of the work, and indeed the consensus that there were elements of novelty and interest in this manuscript, they felt that novel advances were limited as presented. Briefly, the manuscript falls into two parts; it is too long with too much data presented and we recommend focus on potentially the most exciting/novel part, ie. the RNAseq / sc and computational analyses, and extending this to provide further functional validation. Some of the earlier figures reflect quite well understood biology (EMT, Zeb1, Wnt etc in EMT), and would require much more work to tighten up the conclusions (see Essential revisions below); therefore, it was felt that even if these were improved, the data would likely confirm this confirmed a lot of what we know already. It is true that the role of EMT is controversial – but what is presented in the first part of the manuscript does not add much definitive new data to inform that debate, and indeed the authors' submission letter refers to their 'confirmatory' nature.</p><p>We encourage the authors to substantially revise the submission to present a lower number of Figures that focus on the more novel and exciting aspects of the work; perhaps one or two figures defining the cells and their states that they subsequently use for the detailed RNAseq molecular analyses, and then prioritise the molecular and computational analyses, but with a requirement that they take this further and perform some functional validation of molecular signatures, testing whether they have biological meaning as regards defining plasticity or its role – which would be important and novel. The authors should consider whether, and which, earlier figures, and related supplementary figures, could be left out or to streamline and focus the paper. The major points that the authors might consider (below) therefore relate mainly to the definitions of cell sub-populations and enhancing findings and their biological meaning of the scRNA analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Could the authors introduce plasticity and what they think means in the Introduction. Is reversibility of EMT really an adequate description?</p><p>2. Regarding the EpCAM-low cells, why do these get lost during long-term culture and turn into EpCAM-high, E-cadherin-high cells? How then is the homeostasis between the EpCAM-high and -low populations maintained in the parental cells which have been cultured for decades? Also, it seems that almost all single cell cones of EpCAM-low cells turn into EpCAM-high over time. Why are some maintaining the EpCAM-low status? Is there a difference in gene expression or epigenetic imprints?</p><p>3. Is there any evidence of EpCAM-low cells in primary tumours in human or mice models? For example, recent work in colon showed that Notch signalling drives colonic to liver metastasis (Jackstadt et al. 2019) – might the Notch-active cells in this model have lower EpCam levels?</p><p>4. If the authors choose to retain the metastasis experiments in a revised submission, then they should test the effect of withdrawing Dox after metastatic colonisation to favour proliferation following metastatic seeding? It would be interesting to know whether the timing of Zeb1 expression is important. Does conditional depletion of ZEB1 result in death of these EpCAM-low cells?</p><p>5. In the AKP organoids, are the EpCAM-low cells also present and what is the endogenous expression status of ZEB1 in these? Why have the authors maintained the conditional expression of ZEB1 induced in the AKP-Z organoid transplantation experiments? This is likely driving the epithelial cells into a locked mesenchymal state – which is not compatible with the earlier observed 'plasticity' with the EpCAM-low cells in SW480 and HCT116 cells. Since EMT is generally believed to be essential for metastasis formation, the authors should consider temporal ZEB1 expression control in transplanted AKP-Z organoids if these experiments are to be retained in a revised submission.</p><p>6. In Figure 7, RNA sequencing identifies that Wnt signaling is likely enhanced in EpCAM-low cells. GSK inhibition induces the expression of ZEB1 (as known before), yet this works only in HCT116 and not in SW480 cells, which actually show an induction of Wnt signaling. The results seem to indicate that there is not just a mere enhancement of Wnt signaling and that other changes/pathways are required as well. Have the authors looked in other cell lines?</p><p>7. As Wnt signalling is proposed to be important in the establishment of the EpCam-low population, have the authors inhibited this pathway (either at the ligand level or though inhibiting b-catenin transcription) to confirm that the population is Wnt responsive?</p><p>8. The scRNA sequencing seems to reflect EMT full and hybrid stages. The computational analysis is impressive and exciting, the potential trajectories offer a working model which could be experimentally tested by functional validation of the subgroups to finally pinpoint the cell populations with the highest cell plasticity. Most importantly, what defines cell plasticity at the molecular and cellular level? Is it Wnt signaling or something in addition (see point 7 above)? The reader is left without a clear answer. In the scRNA seq, in the populations that have increased EMT and EMT-gene expression, does this correlate to a Wnt/B-catenin signature at a single cell level?</p><p>9. What is the mechanistic basis for the &quot;further enhancement&quot; of Wnt signaling? Is it the dose of Wnt signaling or is it the combination with other signaling pathways which cooperate with Wnt transcriptional control, such as Hippo or TGFb signaling? There could be a hint from the RNA sequencing data to distinguish these possibilities. Do the target gene lists change with the enhancement of Wnt signaling?</p><p>10. Is the prognostic and predictive value for the gene signature only true for CMS4 CRCs or for all subtypes? Does the EpCAM-low signature and the signatures of the various EMT stages correlate with CMS subtypes, therapy resistance or clinical outcome? This is not really clear from the data presented.</p><p>11. The data depicted in Figure 10A and B are confusing and deserve better explanation. How is it possible that EpCAM-low and EpCAM-high sorted cells show overlapping single cell expression profiles upon t-sne plotting in particular for the SW480 cells? This is contradictory to the earlier claims of the authors in the manuscript that EpCAM-low cells have a more mesenchymal gene expression profile. Is there a difference between EpCAM protein expression and EpCAM mRNA expression? Regarding the heatmap from the EMT signature shown in figure 10B, which cell line is represented?</p><p>12. The authors link the gene expression signature of EpCAM-low cells with the colon cancer consensus molecular subtype CMS4 which have the worst relapse free and overall survival (Dienstmann R et al. 2017; 17, Nat Rev Cancer 79-92). There are multiple lines of evidence that the mesenchymal signature in CMS4 colon cancers is due to profound infiltration of stromal cells (CAFs, immune cells), extracellular matrix remodeling, TGF-β pathway activation and not the consequence of EMT in cancers cells (e.g. Calon et al. 2015; DOI: 10.1038/ng.3225). It is of course possible that a few epithelial cells in this inflammatory context are undergoing a partial EMT but there is little evidence and this likely will happen in a minority of cells. Therefore, the authors should revise the manuscript manuscript regarding (partial) EMT and the CMS4 and put their findings in a more critical context of what is already in the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61461.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper has now been reviewed by three reviewers and myself.

Although we respectfully disagree with the statements according to which the data reflects on “<italic>well-understood biology</italic>” and “<italic>novel advances were limited as presented</italic>”, the first part of the Results section, i.e. the characterization of the EMT-competent EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation of colon cancer cells, is admittedly of confirmatory nature but nonetheless essential as that these data lay the very basis for the more novel RNAseq-based results. In response to the editors’ requests, we have accordingly shortened this part, drastically reduced the number of main figures (now 6), and moved much of the “incremental” evidence to supplementary figures. The revised manuscript is more focussed on the RNAseq analysis which has now been substantially extended and improved (also based on the reviewers’ comments and suggestions) with some novel and exciting results on partial EMT and phenotypic plasticity, and the role therein of specific genes like <italic>SPARC</italic> (osteonectin), and on the validation of the findings in patient-derived tumors through the generation of a novel classifier based on genes expressed in quasi-mesenchymal tumor cells that outperforms existing ones.</p><p>As for the in vivo transplantations, as also commented in reply to the reviewers’ major points, the essential issue that these experiments were meant to address was how <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression affects local invasion and distant metastasis formation in vivo, namely in a model unrelated to the two original cell lines (i.e. the cecum transplantations of AKP-Z mouse organoids). While <italic>ZEB1</italic> expression in the primary tumor does result in a substantial increase of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation of quasi-mesenchymal cells, long-term doxycycline administration increases only marginally the multiplicity of lung and liver metastases, likely to result from the <italic>ZEB1</italic>-driven inhibition of MET, i.e. the reacquisition of epithelial features essential for metastatic colonization. To date, our attempts to fine-tune dox administration so to enhance partial EMT and distant metastasis have not succeeded. This is due to the intrinsic variability of the orthotopic transplantation procedure and to the limited number of ‘pulsed’ administrations tested. Additional experiments will require a considerable period of time and very large numbers of mice. Therefore, in agreement with the reviewers’ proposal, we have moved these experiments to the first part of the Results (<bold>Figure S1-5C-E</bold>), and have concentrated on the single cell and bulk expression data, and the development of highly predictive gene signatures as an alternative approach to the clinical validation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Could the authors introduce plasticity and what they think means in the Introduction. Is reversibility of EMT really an adequate description?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have defined phenotypic plasticity as the cell’s ability to modify its phenotype (i.e. morphology, physiology, behaviour) in response to cues from the environment in a context-dependent fashion. More than “reversibility of EMT” which is quite restrictive to canonical EMT as we know it, it is the epigenetic (and as such reversible) nature of the global underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that is quintessential to plasticity. In support of this, a recent scRNAseq comparative analysis of various time-course EMT models has revealed very limited overlap among differentially expressed genes indicative of the vastly context-dependent nature of these processes (<italic>Nat Comm</italic> 2020, 11:2142). To quote from the paper’s abstract: “EMT is not simply a single, linear process, but is highly variable and modular, warranting quantitative frameworks for understanding nuances of the transition.” As such, plasticity may indeed overlap with EMT reversibility, provided its more comprehensive definition is in place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Regarding the EpCAM-low cells, why do these get lost during long-term culture and turn into EpCAM-high, E-cadherin-high cells? How then is the homeostasis between the EpCAM-high and -low populations maintained in the parental cells which have been cultured for decades? Also, it seems that almost all single cell cones of EpCAM-low cells turn into EpCAM-high over time. Why are some maintaining the EpCAM-low status? Is there a difference in gene expression or epigenetic imprints?</p></disp-quote><p>Many of the reviewer’s questions were originally addressed by the study by Eric Lander and colleagues (<italic>Cell</italic> 2011, 146:633) reporting for the first time on the existence of distinct subpopulations of cells with stemlike and more epithelial features within human breast cancer cell lines. According to this study, stochastic transitions between states, supported by a Markov model, underlie the phenotypic equilibrium among these subpopulations of cancer cells. The same type of heterogeneity and state transitions seem to apply for the SW480 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines as presented in our manuscript (<bold>Figure 2). Please note that EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells do not “<italic>get lost</italic>”: just like their EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> counterpart, they have the ability to modify their defining features and transit to the other identity, albeit with different transition probabilities which ensures that an equilibrium is maintained over time, independently of the initial proportions of the subpopulations. Based on our FACS data, we estimated the average transition probabilities with a two-state Markov model (Figure 2C and S2-1C-D). Notably, the model indicated that EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells have a slightly increased plasticity when compared with their EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> equivalents (HCT116: 8 fold, SW480: 4 fold). Due to the observed differences in doubling times between the two states, subclones with a lower EpCAMhi&gt;lo transition probability will experience a slight growth advantage which will become prevalent in the long run. We ran a simulation of this effect by starting from a culture with multiple subclones having distinct transition probabilities, indicating that subclones with lower plasticity gain dominance within a few months (Figure S2</bold>). Consequently, especially in the long run, the percentage of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells will decrease as observed in late cultures.</p><p>To elucidate on the plastic potential at the single cell level, we used <italic>RNA velocity</italic> to project the future cellstates. This analysis revealed that cells with partial EMT features has highly plastic capacity as evidenced by the opposing arrows on the RNA velocity plot (<bold>Figure 5E), and that both populations have a trajectory that could “lock” cells in their identity, therefore preventing plastic potential as observed in some of the clones (Figure 2B and S2-1C).</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is there any evidence of EpCAM-low cells in primary tumours in human or mice models?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the existence of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells in primary human or murine tumors is shown by several lines of evidence: 1. IHC analysis of ZEB1 (i.e. the main driver of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cellular identity), β-catenin (whose nuclear localization earmarks enhanced Wnt signalling, a distinctive EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> feature) revealed how colon cancer cells located at the invasive front express and activate these genes and their corresponding signalling pathway in coordinated fashion. 2. primary mouse tumors (obtained by orthotopic transplantation of genetically modified tumoroids, i.e. independent of the original SW480 and HCT116 cell lines) clearly show a pronounced EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation upon induction of ZEB1 expression (<bold>Figure S1-6C). 3. As now included in the revised manuscript, the epithelial-specific CMS4_TC signature, highly predictive of poor prognosis across the broad spectrum of colon cancers, highlight the existence of <italic>bona fide</italic> quasi-mesenchymal tumor cells that underlie local invasion and distant metastasis (Figure 6 and S6-1).</bold></p><p>Overall, when evaluating the relevance of our results for colon cancer as we see it in patients, one should always keep in mind that the original observation, i.e. the identification of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells, was based on two immortalized cell lines where, in the absence of the cues from the tumor microenvironment, plasticity is governed by cell-autonomous processes presumably arisen in vitro. These processes are nonetheless likely to reflect the paracrine interactions that occur between tumor cells and their direct microenvironment. Therefore, to validate their clinical relevance, one must extrapolate the results by looking at the activated pathways and their functional consequences, rather than by focusing on specific combination of genes found in the cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, recent work in colon showed that Notch signalling drives colonic to liver metastasis (Jackstadt et al. 2019) – might the Notch-active cells in this model have lower EpCam levels?</p></disp-quote><p>Although this is an interesting question, Notch signalling did not emerge from our RNAseq analyses and as such it does not directly address the issue of the existence of EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells in primary tumors. Nonetheless, together with our main collaborator and co-author Owen Sansom (senior author of the 2019 Jackstadt et al. study), we did mine RNAseq data from different tumor models and organoids mutant in <italic>Kras</italic>, <italic>Apc</italic>, <italic>Braf</italic>, and <italic>Notch</italic>. Notably, a variation in EpCAM expression levels across a number of these models was observed albeit with large deviations. Although we do agree that further investigations on the Notch-EpCAM correlation are of interest, these data would considerably enlarge the size of the revised manuscript without, in our opinion, directly addressing the question raised by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. If the authors choose to retain the metastasis experiments in a revised submission, then they should test the effect of withdrawing Dox after metastatic colonisation to favour proliferation following metastatic seeding? It would be interesting to know whether the timing of Zeb1 expression is important. Does conditional depletion of ZEB1 result in death of these EpCAM-low cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on the importance of the in vivo metastasis experiments. However, these are complicated by a number of logistic and intrinsic limitations. The proposed experiments would imply large number of different animal models to be treated under different experimental conditions. Although technically feasible, these experiments are likely to take an extremely long time to be completed (up to 1 year, if not longer) and, due to the intrinsic variability of the outcome of orthotopic organoid transplantations, of uncertain outcome. In our opinion, the essential issue that these experiments should address is whether and how Zeb1 expression affects local invasion and distant metastasis formation in the AKP-Z orthotopic model. As shown in the original manuscript, while ZEB1 expression in the primary tumor does result in a substantial increase of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation of quasi-mesenchymal cells, long-term doxycycline administration increases only marginally the multiplicity of lung and liver metastases, likely to stem from the Zeb1-driven inhibition of MET, i.e. the reacquisition of epithelial features essential for metastatic colonization. However, to date our attempts to fine-tune dox administration so to enhance partial EMT and distant metastasis have not succeeded. This is partly due to the intrinsic variability of the orthotopic transplantation procedure but also to the limited number of ‘pulsed’ administrations that one can test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rather than removing the metastasis experiments altogether from the revised manuscript, we have moved the AKP-Z orthotopic transplantation data to primarily show that in vivo Zeb1 expression result in a substantial increase of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation in a cell line-independent experimental setup. For the sake of honesty, we have also retained the results of the effects on metastatic incidence upon long-term dox administration.</p><p>5. In the AKP organoids, are the EpCAM-low cells also present and what is the endogenous expression status of ZEB1 in these?</p></disp-quote><p>Intestinal organoids (<italic>enteroids</italic>), when mutated in <italic>Apc</italic> or any other gene resulting in constitutive Wnt activation, or when cultured in Wnt3a-conditioned medium (or supplemented with the GSK3β-inhibitor Chiron), invariably grow as cystic <italic>spheroids</italic>, i.e. undifferentiated hollow 3D structures lined by a monolayer of <italic>Lgr5</italic><sup>low</sup> cells reminiscent of foetal intestinal progenitor cells. Only upon orthotopic transplantation of these spheroids into the cecum and the formation of the primary lesion, the organoid-derived cells acquire more pronounced epithelial features (EpCAM<sup>hi</sup>) and de-differentiate into EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> upon <italic>Zeb1</italic>-induction. Moreover, there is hardly any endogenous Zeb1 expression in the AKP organoids (<bold>Figure S1-5C</bold>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why have the authors maintained the conditional expression of ZEB1 induced in the AKP-Z organoid transplantation experiments? This is likely driving the epithelial cells into a locked mesenchymal state – which is not compatible with the earlier observed 'plasticity' with the EpCAM-low cells in SW480 and HCT116 cells. Since EMT is generally believed to be essential for metastasis formation, the authors should consider temporal ZEB1 expression control in transplanted AKP-Z organoids if these experiments are to be retained in a revised submission.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply to point #4. The identification of the ‘just-right’ experimental conditions for temporal Zeb1 expression in vivo to maximize metastasis induction (compared with continuous induction) is likely to take a considerable amount of time with uncertain outcomes due to the intrinsic variability of the orthotopic transplantation procedure. As stated before, in the revised manuscript. we have kept the transplantation experiments to show that in vivo Zeb1 expression result in a substantial increase of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation in a cell line-independent experimental setup, and focus on the RNAseq data and the newly implemented analyses, and their validation in patient-derived data sets. The admittedly marginal increase in lung and liver metastases is indeed explained by the Zeb1-driven inhibition of MET, i.e. the reacquisition of epithelial features essential for metastatic colonization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 7, RNA sequencing identifies that Wnt signaling is likely enhanced in EpCAM-low cells. GSK inhibition induces the expression of ZEB1 (as known before), yet this works only in HCT116 and not in SW480 cells, which actually show an induction of Wnt signaling. The results seem to indicate that there is not just a mere enhancement of Wnt signaling and that other changes/pathways are required as well. Have the authors looked in other lines?</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that the induction of ZEB<sub>1</sub> expression was observed in both cell lines and not only in SW480. This aside, the relationship between Zeb1 expression and Wnt signalling is not a straightforward one and we do agree on that additional pathways are likely to be involved. We looked into other colon cancer cell lines (mostly Apc- or β-catenin mutant and as such Wnt-on) merely to characterize the size of the EpCAM subpopulations (Source data 1) but have not looked into the differential levels of other pathways’ activation between EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> and EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> as this does not seem directly relevant for the ‘take-home’ message of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. As Wnt signalling is proposed to be important in the establishment of the EpCam-low population, have the authors inhibited this pathway (either at the ligand level or though inhibiting b-catenin transcription) to confirm that the population is Wnt responsive?</p></disp-quote><p>This type of evidence was delivered in genetic fashion, i.e. by generating wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous β-catenin mutant clones of the HCT116 cell line (<bold>Figure 3F</bold>). Conversion of the mutant gene into its wild type version reduces the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation from 29% to 4% of the total. If considered necessary, Wnt can be inhibited at the ligand level or by shRNA directed against β-catenin. This said, given the already provided evidence (including the central role of Zeb1, downstream of Wnt, in the maintenance of the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> subpopulation), the value of these additional experiments would be mainly incremental.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The scRNA sequencing seems to reflect EMT full and hybrid stages. The computational analysis is impressive and exciting, the potential trajectories offer a working model which could be experimentally tested by functional validation of the subgroups to finally pinpoint the cell populations with the highest cell plasticity. Most importantly, what defines cell plasticity at the molecular and cellular level? Is it Wnt signaling or something in addition (see point 7 above)? The reader is left without a clear answer. In the scRNA seq, in the populations that have increased EMT and EMT-gene expression, does this correlate to a Wnt/B-catenin signature at a single cell level?</p></disp-quote><p>What defines cell plasticity at the molecular and cellular level clearly represents a central question that we are trying to address using as experimental models colon cancer cell lines encompassing differentially plastic (and metastatic) subpopulations kept in equilibrium by stochastic state transitions. This should <italic>a priori</italic> be kept in mind taking into consideration that eliciting plasticity in vivo involves complex paracrine interactions between cancer cells located at the invasion front and their stromal microenvironment, which we believe are reproduced in cell-autonomous fashion in the cell lines.</p><p>In order to better address the reviewer’s question and further evaluate the correlation between Wnt and EMT at the single cell level, we have taken advantage of the Mesenchymal (Mes) and Epithelial (Epi) scores to rank the cells according to their level of EMT activation (<bold>Figure 5C</bold>) and correlate these with the activity of signalling pathways from the PID pathway database. From the N = 196 pathways encompassed in the PID database, Wnt signalling listed among those with highest correlation and showed significant increase in the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> population compared to the EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> cells. Moreover, the overall “Wnt” score together with specific downstream target genes such as <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>DKK1</italic>, showed positive correlation with the Mes-score (<bold>Figure 5D</bold>). Hence, given the intrinsic limits of our experimental approach, specific levels of canonical Wnt signaling are central to colon cancer cell plasticity and the manuscript accordingly focusses on this pathway. This does not of course imply that Wnt is the only pathway involved, especially in view of the role played by the tumor microenvironment in eliciting not only Wnt but also other synergistic pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. What is the mechanistic basis for the &quot;further enhancement&quot; of Wnt signaling? Is it the dose of Wnt signaling or is it the combination with other signaling pathways which cooperate with Wnt transcriptional control, such as Hippo or TGFb signaling? There could be a hint from the RNA sequencing data to distinguish these possibilities. Do the target gene lists change with the enhancement of Wnt signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>As it is likely to be the case for the majority of signalling pathways, Wnt is not a binary ON-OFF process but rather a dosage-dependent system where the level of the upstream signal is reflected by the downstream response not only in quantitative but also qualitative (i.e. different target genes) fashion. This is best illustrated by the so-called β-catenin paradox (<italic>Curr Opin Cell Biol</italic> 2007, 5:745-749): notwithstanding the loss of APC function (or oncogenic β-catenin activation) and the consequent constitutive activation of the Wnt signalling pathway, the majority of colon cancer cells do not show nuclear β-catenin accumulation with the only exception of those located along the invasive front. This shows that the original genetic defect is necessary but insufficient for full-blown pathway activation. The interaction with additional cues from the tumor microenvironment is likely to act synergistically to further enhance Wnt signalling levels. The latter is presumably the result of cooperation with other pathways as suggested by the reviewer and as supported by the scientific literature. As indicated above, our pathways analysis in correlation with EMT activity has indicated a number of candidate signalling routes likely to synergize with Wnt in eliciting plasticity. However, a more precise analysis of the key pathways such as Hippo or Tgf-β, is limited by the sequencing depth and the subset of genes whose activity is detectable by scRNAseq.</p><p>Next to synergistic pathways, incremental paracrine and autocrine Wnt stimulation may also underlie these observations. In our study, we have shown that when cultured in the presence of Wnt-conditioned medium or of Chiron, the <italic>APC</italic>- and β-catenin-mutant SW480 and HCT116 cell lines do respond by further increasing their intrinsically elevated level of Wnt activation and the EpCAM<sup>lo</sup>/Zeb1<sup>+</sup> subpopulation (<bold>Figure 3C-D</bold>). Accordingly, it has also been shown that cancer cells already carrying Wnt activating genetic mutations secrete Wnt ligands in autocrine fashion to further enhance constitutive pathway activation (<italic>Cancer Cell</italic> 2004, 6:497-506).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Is the prognostic and predictive value for the gene signature only true for CMS4 CRCs or for all subtypes? Does the EpCAM-low signature and the signatures of the various EMT stages correlate with CMS subtypes, therapy resistance or clinical outcome? This is not really clear from the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>As depicted in Figure 6, in the revised manuscript we developed a novel signature (CMS4_TC), obtained by selecting CMS4 genes exclusively expressed in epithelial cells, and compared with the CMS4_RF classifier. The CMS4_TC signature is preferentially expressed in tumors from CMS4 and the CMS1 subtype. Of note, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the CMS4_TC signature outperforms the CMS4_RF classifier when stratifying colon cancer patients according to relapse-free survival (Figure 6C,F), as it does for CMS1 and 3 patients (Figure S6-1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The data depicted in Figure 10A and B are confusing and deserve better explanation. How is it possible that EpCAM-low and EpCAM-high sorted cells show overlapping single cell expression profiles upon t-sne plotting in particular for the SW480 cells? This is contradictory to the earlier claims of the authors in the manuscript that EpCAM-low cells have a more mesenchymal gene expression profile. Is there a difference between EpCAM protein expression and EpCAM mRNA expression? Regarding the heatmap from the EMT signature shown in figure 10B, which cell line is represented?</p></disp-quote><p>The tSNE of SW480 cells (Figure 5A and S5-1A) show overlap between the two subpopulations due to the fact that the genes with highest variance (e.g. RPL genes in the first principal component) are not differentially expressed between EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> and EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> cells (Figure S5-1B). In HCT116, these genes are differentially expressed across the population. However, EMT related variance is still capable of resolving the SW480 subpopulations as evidenced by the supervised tSNE (Figure 5B).</p><p>The heatmap in Figure 5C in the revised manuscript. displays both cell lines. The tSNE plots are labeled with the respective cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors link the gene expression signature of EpCAM-low cells with the colon cancer consensus molecular subtype CMS4 which have the worst relapse free and overall survival (Dienstmann R et al. 2017; 17, Nat Rev Cancer 79-92). There are multiple lines of evidence that the mesenchymal signature in CMS4 colon cancers is due to profound infiltration of stromal cells (CAFs, immune cells), extracellular matrix remodeling, TGF-β pathway activation and not the consequence of EMT in cancers cells (e.g. Calon et al. 2015; DOI: 10.1038/ng.3225). It is of course possible that a few epithelial cells in this inflammatory context are undergoing a partial EMT but there is little evidence and this likely will happen in a minority of cells. Therefore, the authors should revise the manuscript manuscript regarding (partial) EMT and the CMS4 and put their findings in a more critical context of what is already in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>See also our reply to point #3. Indeed, many EMT-associated genes integral to the CMS4_RF classifier are highly expressed in stromal cells. To elucidate the role of EMT in tumor epithelial cells, we derived the CMS4_TC signature by selecting genes that correlate with the CMS4_RF signature within the epithelial fraction. Evaluation of both signature in all cell types (from Lee et al. Nat Genet 2020, 52:594–603) showed that CMS4_TC is specific for tumor cells (Figure 6D) while CMS4_RF shows highest expression in stromal cells (Figure 6A); also, CMS4_TC shows association with the CMS1 and CMS4 molecular subtypes (Figure 6G) and outperforms other classifiers (including CMS4_RF) in stratifying CMS patients other than 4 (CMS1 and 3) (Figure 6C,F and S6-1). Using the CMS4_TC signature, quasi-mesenchymal epithelial cells were found to have elevated expression levels of non-classical EMT genes. We then evaluated the marker genes from the mesenchymal-like epithelial cells in our sc- and bulk-RNAseq data from the two cell lines (Figure 5C). Notably, expression of SPARC appeared to be higher in the EpCAMlo cells when compared to the EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> population, and peaked in between the EMT axis, indicative of cells in partial EMT (Figure 5D). Accordingly, cells with the highest hybrid EMT score showed increased plastic potential as evidenced by the opposing arrows on the RNA velocity plot (Figure 5EG). In view of the role of SPARC in modifying the ECM and eliciting EMT through the upregulation of other genes like FN1 (fibronectin), MMP7, CD44 and others, it is likely that the pEMT state is earmarked by the coordinated expression of a subset of genes favoring local invasion through, for example, collective cell migration. Accordingly, overexpression of SPARC in the original HCT116 and SW480 cell lines results in the up- and downregulation of M- and E-markers respectively, and increase their invasive capacity (Figure 5H).</p><p>Taken together, while classical EMT genes may be scarcely and occasionally expressed in primary bona fide colon cancers, specific subsets exist featuring a quasi-mesenchymal state that correlates with poor survival and is preferentially observed not only in CMS4 tumors but also in a CMS1 and CMS3 cases. Of note, these epithelial cancer cells with mesenchymal features express increased levels of SPARC, a gene likely to earmark partial EMT in a subset of the cases.</p></body></sub-article></article>
