The functions of de novo SL synthesis in vascular endothelial cells (EC), which line the entire circulatory system, are not well understood. Here, we show that the de novo SL synthesis in EC not only regulates vascular development but also maintains circulatory and peripheral organ SL levels. Mice with an endothelial-specific gene knockout of SPTLC1 (<italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO), an essential subunit of the SPT complex, exhibited reduced EC proliferation and tip/stalk cell differentiation, resulting in delayed retinal vascular development. In addition, <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice had reduced retinal neovascularization in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model. Mechanistic studies suggest that EC SL produced from the de novo pathway are needed for lipid raft formation and efficient VEGF signaling. Post-natal deletion of the EC <italic>Sptlc1</italic> also showed rapid reduction of several SL metabolites in plasma, red blood cells, and peripheral organs (lung and liver) but not in the retina, part of the central nervous system (CNS). In the liver, EC de novo SL synthesis was important for acetaminophen-induced rapid ceramide elevation and hepatotoxicity. These results suggest that EC-derived SL metabolites are in constant flux between the vasculature, circulatory elements, and parenchymal cells of non-CNS organs. Taken together, our data point to the central role of the endothelial SL biosynthesis in maintaining vascular development, neovascular proliferation, non-CNS tissue metabolic homeostasis, and hepatocyte response to stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sphingolipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>lipid homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18POST33990339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL135821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY031715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hla</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endothelial sphingolipid biosynthesis is essential for maintaining vascular development, neovascular proliferation, non-CNS tissue sphingolipid levels, and hepatocyte response to stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingolipids (SL), which comprise ~10â€“20% of total cellular lipids, are involved in wide range of biological processes. Complex membrane SL, sphingomyelin (SM) and glycosphingolipids, are enriched in lipid rafts and caveolae, which provide an optimal platform for intracellular signaling and cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the secreted SL, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), acts as a ligand for G-protein coupled receptors (S1PR1-5) which regulate many physiological and pathological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Proia and Hla, 2015</xref>). While SL can be derived from dietary sources, most cellular SL are synthesized via the de novo pathway. This pathway is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the condensation of serine and fatty acyl-CoA to generate 3-ketosphinganine by the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex. The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is further converted into dihydrosphingosine (dhSph), dihydroceramide (dhCer), and ultimately ceramide (Cer), which is a substrate for the production of complex SL and metabolites such as sphingosine (Sph) and S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merrill, 2002</xref>). The SPT complex, which is composed of long chain subunit 1 (SPTLC1), subunit 2/3 (SPTLC2/3) and small subunit A/B (SPTSSA/B), catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo SL biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2009</xref>). Absence of any of the subunits abolishes the enzymatic activity of SPT, which is required for normal embryonic development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hojjati et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, SPT enzyme activity is controlled by interaction with ORMDL proteins, which respond to extracellular and cell-intrinsic cues to regulate the flux of SL synthesis by the de novo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of de novo SL biosynthetic pathway in organ function and diseases have been deduced from genome wide association studies and mouse genetic models. Mutations in the <italic>SPTLC1</italic> gene are associated with peripheral neuronal dysfunction including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bejaoui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawkins et al., 2001</xref>), childhood amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohassel et al., 2021</xref>) and macular telengectasia type-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantner et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Sptlc2</italic> haploinsufficiency in macrophages causes reduction of circulating SM and enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport in murine genetic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting the requirement of this pathway in maintaining systemic SL homeostasis. Loss of function of the SPT complex in hepatocytes reduces SM in the plasma membrane and suppresses the expression of E- and N-cadherin, adherens junction constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting the importance of this pathway in maintaining proper plasma membrane function. Collectively, these data reveal the plethora of cell-type-specific functions of SL derived from the de novo pathway.</p><p>Endothelial cells (EC) line the inner layer of the circulatory system and mediate vascular tone control, barrier integrity, oxygen supply, immune cell trafficking and waste removal. The vasculature of the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and retina, is unique in that EC help form a highly selective barrier for circulatory metabolites. Indeed, EC in CNS forms a specialized structure between the blood and the tissue, known as the blood brain barrier (BBB) and blood retinal barrier (BRB) that consist of cellular compartments including EC, pericytes, and neural cells (astrocytes, glia and neurons). SL metabolites, originally isolated from brain due to their relative abundance, are critical for CNS development, physiology and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olsen and FÃ¦rgeman, 2017</xref>). Metabolism of some lipids such as cholesterol are compartmentalized in CNS and non-CNS tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orth and Bellosta, 2012</xref>). Whether SL metabolism in CNS and non-CNS organs is compartmentalized and the role of SL in organotypic vascular beds is not known.</p><p>Our current knowledge about SL metabolism in EC has been centered around S1P, a key lipid mediator needed for developmental and pathological angiogenesis, and Cer, a mediator of stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cartier and Hla, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jernigan et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of S1P signaling in the EC S1PR1 suppresses vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) dependent vascular sprouting and maintains barrier integrity, resulting in stable and mature vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaengel et al., 2012</xref>). Upon irradiation, Cer aggregate to form Cer-enriched membrane domains within the cell membrane, which regulate physicochemical properties of membranes, leading to apoptosis and capillary leak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolesnick and Fuks, 2003</xref>). Moreover, VEGFR2 has been shown to colocalize with SL enriched lipid rafts on the plasma membrane and impact VEGF-induced intracellular signal transduction processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurenzana et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that multiple SL metabolites regulate vascular development (angiogenesis), homeostasis and diseases. Recently, it was that EC-specific deletion of <italic>Sptlc2</italic> results in lower blood pressure and reduced plasma Cer, implying the protective function of de novo SL biosynthetic pathway in vascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantalupo et al., 2020</xref>). However, the role of de novo SL biosynthetic pathway in metabolic flux of SL metabolites in various tissue compartments and vascular development is not known.</p><p>To address these questions, we generated a mouse model in which de novo synthesis of SL can be abolished by tamoxifen-induced <italic>Sptlc1</italic> gene deletion in endothelial cells (<italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO). <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice exhibited delayed retinal vascular development and reduced pathological angiogenesis in an oxygen-induced retinopathy model. This is due, at least in part, to defects in endothelial lipid rafts and impaired VEGF signaling. Moreover, <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice showed rapid decline of many SL, including dhSph, dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) and Cer in plasma and red blood cells (RBC), demonstrating SL metabolic flux from EC to circulation. SL content of peripheral tissues such as lung and liver were also reduced upon <italic>Sptlc1</italic> EC deletion. Reduced Cer levels in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice protected against acetaminophen-induced hepatoxicity, suggesting the functional importance of EC SL supply in liver response to stress. Collectively, our data not only demonstrate the role of de novo synthesis of SL during vascular development, but also reveal a novel function of EC as a source to provide SL to the circulation and peripheral tissues for their proper functions and response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endothelial SPT enzyme supplies sphingolipids to vascular and non-vascular cells in the lung</title><p>We generated a mouse strain in which <italic>Sptlc1</italic> floxed mice are crossed with tamoxifen-inducible VE-cadherin Cre recombinase mice (<italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Their concentrations in various cells and tissues are regulated stringently to maintain normal physiological functions. The numerous SL species are no exception. Altered SL levels due to mutations in biosynthetic or degradative enzymes lead to embryonic lethality or severe genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>). However, SL homeostatic mechanisms in various organ systems is poorly understood. For example, cell types which supply SL in various organ systems are not known. In this study, we show that SPT activity in EC regulates developmental and pathological angiogenesis. We also discover a novel function of EC as a major SL source of circulatory SL species, which determines the SL content of organs (the lung and the liver) and the response of liver hepatocytes to chemical injury.</p><p>The SPT enzyme complex catalyzes the first committed step in the de novo SL biosynthetic pathway. This step is highly regulated by ORMDL proteins and other poorly understood mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantalupo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Linn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siow et al., 2015</xref>). Since the vascular EC line blood vessels in all organ systems, we developed and analyzed a mouse genetic model in which S<italic>ptlc1</italic>, encoding the non-redundant subunit of SPT complex (SPTLC1) is disrupted in a tissue-specific manner using tamoxifen-induced gene deletion. This allowed us to precisely disrupt de novo SL synthesis in EC in a temporally manner. Our results revealed that lack of SPTLC1 protein in EC results in delayed vascular development. This phenotype was caused by reduced EC proliferation and tip cell formation in early angiogenic phases. In contrast, organotypic specialization of the developing vasculature was unaffected. This phenotype some similarities with the loss of VEGFR2 in the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarkada et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, in the OIR model, where pathological neovascularization is driven primarily by VEGF, inactivation of SPT activity in EC resulted in larger vaso-obliterated zones and reduced vascular tuft formation, again suggesting impaired VEGF signaling. Furthermore, intraocular administration of VEGF-A revealed that <italic>Sptlc1</italic> KO EC show attenuated response. Our in vitro studies in HUVEC demonstrated that SPT activity is necessary to maintain efficient VEGF signaling and its downstream substrate activation via lipid rafts. Supplementation of SL such as dhSph, Sph, and Cer is sufficient to rescue the inhibitory effects caused by Myriocin pretreatment, implicating active metabolic turnover of lipid raft constituents such as GM1. Our conclusion agrees with recent publications which described that the EC deletion of <italic>Sptlc2</italic> gene impaired VEGFR2-Akt signaling in vitro in adult arterial vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantalupo et al., 2020</xref>) and that lipid rafts enhance VEGFR2 signal transduction during angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zabroski and Nugent, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition to VEGFR2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) resides in SL-rich membrane domains such as lipid rafts or caveolae, suggesting that SPTLC1 loss of function could lead to modulation of eNOS activity.

We postulate that the discrepancy could results from isoform-selective functions between SPTLC1 and SPTLC2. Alternatively, stage-specific function of the SPT enzyme (early postnatal deletion in our study vs. adult stage deletion) or tissue-specific roles (retina EC vs. aorta EC) could explain these divergent effects of SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 on eNOS.</p><p>The decreased vascular development phenotype observed in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice does not resemble the hypersprouting phenotype nor is there down-regulation of BRB specific genes in mice that lack S1P receptors in EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yanagida et al., 2020</xref>).

These findings suggest that reduced plasma S1P in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice is not the cause of the vascular defects seen in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice.

Our results from <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice shows clear differences from the studies which characterized EC and RBC S1P transporter knockout mice. Having ruled out EC secretion of S1P as a possible mechanism, we next considered direct release of dhSph and Cer from EC into circulation, since such SL metabolites were reduced in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO plasma and RBC. While the existence of transporters for dhSph and Cer species have not been described, we do not believe that sphingoid bases and Cer species are directly secreted from EC into circulation. However, alternative ways of transfer may exist. One possibility is through direct contact of EC with lipoproteins and/or RBC. Given that acid sphingomyelinase and ceramidase activities have been reported in the plasma and RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LÃ³pez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), complex SL containing both reduced and unreduced sphingoid bases on the outer leaflet of the EC plasma membrane could be metabolized into Cer and sphingoid bases. SL species such as Sph can be taken up and further metabolized by circulating hematopoietic cells including RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). An alternative mechanism is that EC release of circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) or exosomes from plasma membranes into circulation. It has been reported that Cer, SM, and glycosphingolipids are enriched in EV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Llorente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verderio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akawi et al., 2021</xref>). It is thus possible that EV derived from EC can bind to RBC or lipoproteins and SL can be taken up and metabolized.</p><p>In addition, we observed reduced SL levels in non-EC and peripheral tissues from <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice. Specific organs and tissues may have different routes for SL transfer based on the unique barrier properties of the organ-specific endothelium. In the liver, EC form fenestrated capillaries with intercellular gaps and discontinuous basement membrane. This allows plasma and macroparticles, to cross EC barrier efficiently and access hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hennigs et al., 2021</xref>). SL exchange could therefore occur in the liver due to the porous nature of the liver sinusoidal endothelium. We postulate that the SL metabolic flux from EC to the plasma followed by hepatocyte uptake could explain the reduced liver SL content observed in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice. In the case of lung, pulmonary EC are non-fenestrated with tight junctions in between and serve as a semipermeable barrier separating circulation from lung interstitial spaces. To transport materials through lung capillaries, transcytosis acts as the primary route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones and Minshall, 2020</xref>). It is known to be mediated by caveolae, a critical vesicular structure, which are plasma membrane invaginations enriched in SL and sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harder and Simons, 1997</xref>). We speculate that the SL flux in the lung could be mediated by this process which is affected by loss of EC <italic>Sptlc1</italic> gene. This mechanism could account for the reduced lung SL species in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice. In contrast, caveolae-mediated transcytosis is minimal in the CNS EC which effectively compartmentalizes metabolism of lipids between the circulation and the CNS parenchyma. Our results show that retina SL species were unaffected by lack of de novo SL biosynthesis in EC. Thus, the strict barrier function of the CNS EC ensures compartmentalization of SL metabolism between the neural retina and circulatory/vascular elements.</p><p>Finally, we show that <italic>Sptlc</italic>1 ECKO liver is protected against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Increased GSH levels in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO liver suggests that glutathione synthesis, a primary detoxification agent of APAP, may be involved in mediating the protective phenotype. It remains to be determined whether hepatic SL levels regulate GSH levels directly or indirectly. We speculate that lack of SPT activity in EC may allow the unused serine to be converted to GSH since serine is a source of glycine and cysteine used to synthesize glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, our results show that SL provided by EC is needed for APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. Recently, Cer species increases has been reported to be involved in drug induced liver injury models in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Our liver lipidomic results further suggest a delayed accumulation of Cer in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO mice upon APAP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and H</xref>), which correlates with its protective phenotype at early time points. It is worth noting that administration of Fumonisin B1 (FB1), a Cer synthase inhibitor, does not alleviate APAP-induced liver damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2013</xref>). FB1 pretreatment reduces Cer content in the liver while accumulating dhSph, which is in contrast of what we observed in <italic>Sptlc1</italic> ECKO liver. Future experiments with myriocin, a direct inhibitor of SPT complex, would be warranted to determine the potential role of dhSph during APAP-induced liver injury.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies suggest that de novo SL synthesis pathway in EC is needed for normal and pathological angiogenesis. This is partially due to impaired VEGF responsiveness via modulation of lipid raft formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Secondly, we also reveal a novel function of the endothelium as a source of SL metabolites in circulation, lung and liver but not the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). This EC-derived SL flux mechanism may be impaired in EC dysfunction, a common mechanism in many cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Graphic abstract summarizing major findings of the study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Abrogation of SPT activity in EC leads to reduction of SL content, causing EC-intrinsic effects including disruption of lipid rafts.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Edward Morrisey as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jinlong He (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As outlined by the reviewers, additional mechanistic insight into the down-stream targets of sphingolipids and how these may be altered in your animal models is required for revision. These studies could take the form of assessing candidate genes/pathways (i.e. Vegf signaling) or through a more unbiased approach i.e. transcriptome analysis of animal mutants. Additional controls and manuscript editing as raised by the reviewers is also required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is not very clear why the authors want to include the APAP-induced liver injury in the present study. It's like an afterthought. It's better to remove this part or change it to other angiogenesis models, such as tumor angiogenesis, angiogenesis of post-myocardial infarction, or arteriogenesis.</p><p>2. There isn't enough N number for some experiments (Figure 2I, Figure 3A, Figure 3D, Figure 4C, Figure 4D, Figure 8, and Figure 2 supplement 1). Considering the variation of retinal angiogenesis in mice, it's better to have N more than five retinas in every group.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Schematic illustration for the metabolisms of sphingolipids would be helpful to non-expert readers.</p><p>New hypothesis by authors would become clear when graphically abstracted.

However, APAPinduced liver injury which is mediated in part by hepatocyte ceramide levels, is used to demonstrate that endothelial supply of SL to hepatocytes has a functional consequence in this model which occurs in response to hepatocyte stress. The other models that the reviewer suggested, i.e., tumor angiogenesis, angiogenesis post-myocardial infarction or arteriogenesis are of interest and will likely be pursued in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Even though Mendelian ratios are expected, in some cases skewing of various genotypes is observed. Specifically, we had the following animal numbers for each indicated experiment (Figure 2I â€“ 4 to 7; Figure 3A â€“ (4-5); Figure 3D â€“ (3-7); Figure 4C (3-6); Figure 4D (3-7); Figure 8 â€“ (3-6), and Figure 2 supplement 1 (3)).
