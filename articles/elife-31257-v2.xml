the Arabian Peninsula. The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while case-based and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here, we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31257.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Coronaviruses are one of many groups of viruses that cause the common cold, though some members of the group can cause more serious illnesses. The SARS coronavirus, for example, caused a widespread epidemic of pneumonia in 2003 that killed 774 people. In 2012, a new coronavirus was detected in patients from the Arabian Peninsula with severe respiratory symptoms known as Middle East respiratory syndrome (or MERS for short). To date the MERS coronavirus has also killed over 700 people (albeit over a number of years rather than months). Yet unlike the SARS coronavirus that spreads efficiently between humans, cases of MERS were rarely linked to each other or to contact with animals, with the exception of hospital outbreaks.</p><p>Though camels were later identified as the original source of MERS coronavirus infections in humans, the role of these animals in the epidemic was not well understood. Throughout the epidemic nearly 300 genomes of the MERS coronavirus had been sequenced, from both camels and humans. Previous attempts to understand the MERS epidemic had either relied on these data or reports of case numbers but led to conflicting results, at odds with other sources of evidence.</p><p>Dudas et al. wanted to work out how many times the MERS coronavirus had been introduced into humans from camels. If it happened once, this would indicate that the virus is good at spreading between humans and that treating human cases should be a priority. However, if every human case occurred as a new introduction of the MERS coronavirus from camels, this would mean that the human epidemic would not stop until the virus is controlled at the source, that is, in camels. Many scientists had argued that the second of these scenarios was most likely, but this had not been strongly demonstrated with data.</p><p>By looking at the already sequenced genomes, Dudas et al. worked out how the MERS coronaviruses were related to each other, and reconstructed their family tree. Information about the host from which each sequence was collected was then mapped on the tree. Unlike previous attempts to complete this kind of analysis, Dudas et al. took an approach that could deal with the viruses in camels being more diverse than those in humans.</p><p>Consistent with the scenario where human cases occurred as new introductions from camels, the analysis showed that the MERS coronavirus populations is maintained exclusively in camels and the viruses seen in humans are evolutionary dead-ends. This suggests that MERS coronavirus spreads poorly between humans, and has instead jumped from camels to humans hundreds of times since 2012.</p><p>As well as providing data to confirm a previously suspected hypothesis, these findings provide more support to the current plans to mitigate infections with MERS coronavirus in the Arabian Peninsula by focusing control efforts on camels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>phylodynamics</kwd><kwd>MERS</kwd><kwd>coronavirus</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd><kwd>structured coalescent</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM119774-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Biomedical Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedford</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>278433-PREDEMICS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rambaut</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206298/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rambaut</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005895</institution-id><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Mahan Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dudas</surname><given-names>Gytis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>725422-RESERVOIRDOCS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rambaut</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MERS-CoV infections in the Arabian Peninsula are the result of several hundred spillover events from viruses circulating in camels into the human population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), endemic in camels in the Arabian Peninsula, is the causative agent of zoonotic infections and limited outbreaks in humans. The virus, first discovered in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Boheemen et al., 2012</xref>), has caused more than 2000 infections and over 700 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). Its epidemiology remains obscure, largely because infections are observed among the most severely affected individuals, such as older males with comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Assiri et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">WHO MERS-Cov Research Group, 2013</xref>). While contact with camels is often reported, other patients do not recall contact with any livestock, suggesting an unobserved community contribution to the outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">WHO MERS-Cov Research Group, 2013</xref>). Previous studies on MERS-CoV epidemiology have used serology to identify factors associated with MERS-CoV exposure in potential risk groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reusken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reusken et al., 2013</xref>). Such data have shown high seroprevalence in camels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reusken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reusken et al., 2014</xref>) and evidence of contact with MERS-CoV in workers with occupational exposure to camels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reusken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). Separately, epidemiological modelling approaches have been used to look at incidence reports through time, space and across hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although such epidemiological approaches yield important clues about exposure patterns and potential for larger outbreaks, much inevitably remains opaque to such approaches due to difficulties in linking cases into transmission clusters in the absence of detailed information. Where sequence data are relatively cheap to produce, genomic epidemiological approaches can fill this critical gap in outbreak scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grubaugh et al., 2017</xref>). These data often yield a highly detailed picture of an epidemic when complete genome sequencing is performed consistently and appropriate metadata collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudas et al., 2017</xref>). Sequence data can help discriminate between multiple and single source scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quick et al., 2015</xref>), which are fundamental to quantifying risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grubaugh et al., 2017</xref>). Sequencing MERS-CoV has been performed as part of initial attempts to link human infections with the camel reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Memish et al., 2014</xref>), nosocomial outbreak investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Assiri et al., 2013b</xref>) and routine surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wernery et al., 2015</xref>). A large portion of MERS-CoV sequences come from outbreaks within hospitals, where sequence data have been used to determine whether infections were isolated introductions or were part of a larger hospital-associated outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fagbo et al., 2015</xref>). Similar studies on MERS-CoV have taken place at broader geographic scales, such as cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cotten et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is widely accepted that recorded human MERS-CoV infections are a result of at least several introductions of the virus into humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cotten et al., 2013</xref>) and that contact with camels is a major risk factor for developing MERS, per WHO guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). Previous studies attempting to quantify the actual number of spillover infections have either relied on case-based epidemiological approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cauchemez et al., 2016</xref>) or employed methods agnostic to signals of population structure within sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we use a dataset of 274 MERS-CoV genomes to investigate transmission patterns of the virus between humans and camels.</p><p>Here, we use an explicit model of metapopulation structure and migration between discrete subpopulations, referred to here as demes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>), derived from the structured coalescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Notohara, 1990</xref>). Unlike approaches that model host species as a discrete phylogenetic trait of the virus using continuous-time Markov processes (or simpler, parsimony based, approaches) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faria et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lycett et al., 2016</xref>), population structure models explicitly incorporate contrasts in deme effective population sizes and migration between demes. By estimating independent coalescence rates for MERS-CoV in humans and camels, as well as migration patterns between the two demes, we show that long-term viral evolution of MERS-CoV occurs exclusively in camels. Our results suggest that spillover events into humans are seasonal and might be associated with the calving season in camels. However, we find that MERS-CoV, once introduced into humans, follows transient transmission chains that soon abate. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> for MERS-CoV circulating in humans is much lower than the epidemic threshold of 1.0 and that correspondingly the virus has been introduced into humans hundreds of times.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MERS-CoV is predominantly a camel virus</title><p>The structured coalescent approach we employ (see Materials and methods) identifies camels as a reservoir host where most of MERS-CoV evolution takes place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), while human MERS outbreaks are transient and terminal with respect to long-term evolution of the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Across 174 MERS-CoV genomes collected from humans, we estimate a median of 56 separate camel-to-human cross-species transmissions (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 48–63). While we estimate a median of 3 (95% HPD: 0–12) human-to-camel migrations, the 95% HPD interval includes zero and we find that no such migrations are found in the maximum clade credibility tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Correspondingly, we observe substantially higher camel-to-human migration rate estimates than human-to-camel migration rate estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This inference derives from the tree structure wherein human viruses appear as clusters of highly related sequences nested within the diversity seen in camel viruses, which themselves show significantly higher diversity and less clustering. This manifests as different rates of coalescence with camel viruses showing a scaled effective population size <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of 3.49 years (95% HPD: 2.71–4.38) and human viruses showing a scaled effective population of 0.24 years (95% HPD: 0.14–0.34).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31257.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Typed maximum clade credibility tree of MERS-CoV genomes from 174 human viruses and 100 camel viruses.</title><p>Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree showing inferred ancestral hosts for MERS-CoV recovered with the structured coalescent.

The first sequences of MERS-CoV from camels do not appear in our data until November 2013. Our finding of negligible human-to-camel transmission is robust to choice of prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The repeated and asymmetric introductions of short-lived clusters of MERS-CoV sequences from camels into humans leads us to conclude that MERS-CoV epidemiology in humans is dominated by zoonotic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observe dense terminal clusters of MERS-CoV circulating in humans that are of no subsequent relevance to the evolution of the virus. These clusters of presumed human-to-human transmission are then embedded within extensive diversity of MERS-CoV lineages inferred to be circulating in camels, a classic pattern of source-sink dynamics. Our findings suggest that instances of human infection with MERS-CoV are more common than currently thought, with exceedingly short transmission chains mostly limited to primary cases that might be mild and ultimately not detected by surveillance or sequencing. Structured coalescent analyses recover the camel-centered picture of MERS-CoV evolution despite sequence data heavily skewed towards non-uniformly sampled human cases and are robust to choice of prior. Comparing these results with a currently standard discrete trait analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>) approach for ancestral state reconstruction shows dramatic differences in host reconstruction at internal nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Discrete trait analysis reconstruction identifies both camels and humans as important hosts for MERS-CoV persistence, but with humans as the ultimate source of camel infections. A similar approach has been attempted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), but this interpretation of MERS-CoV evolution disagrees with lack of continuing human transmission chains outside of Arabian peninsula, low seroprevalence in humans and very high seroprevalence in camels across Saudi Arabia. We suspect that this particular discrete trait analysis reconstruction is false due to biased data, that is, having nearly twice as many MERS-CoV sequences from humans (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>174</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) than from camels (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the inability of the model to account for and quantify vastly different rates of coalescence in the phylogenetic vicinity of both types of sequences.

First, we simulate case counts across multiple outbreaks totaling 2000 cases using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 1</xref> and then we subsample from each case cluster to simulate sequencing of a fraction of cases. Sequencing simulations are performed via a multivariate hypergeometric distribution, where the probability of sequencing from a particular cluster depends on available sequencing capacity (number of trials), numbers of cases in the cluster (number of successes) and number of cases outside the cluster (number of failures). In addition, each hypergeometric distribution used to simulate sequencing is concentrated via a bias parameter, that enriches for large sequence clusters at the expense of smaller ones (for its effects see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In order to quantify the degree to recombination has shaped MERS-CoV genetic diversity, we used two recombination detection approaches across partitions of taxa corresponding to inferred MERS-CoV clades. Both methods rely on sampling parental and recombinant alleles within the alignment, although each quantifies different signals of recombination. One hallmark of recombination is the ability to carry alleles derived via mutation from one lineage to another, which appear as repeated mutations taking place in the recipient lineage, somewhere else in the tree. The PHI (pairwise homoplasy index) test quantifies the appearance of these excessive repeat mutations (homoplasies) within an alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruen et al., 2006</xref>). Another hallmark of recombination is clustering of alleles along the genome, due to how template switching, the primary mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses, occurs. 3Seq relies on the clustering of nucleotide similarities along the genome between sequence triplets – two potential parent-donors and one candidate offspring-recipient sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boni et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Both tests can give spurious results in cases of extreme rate heterogeneity and sampling over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dudas and Rambaut, 2016</xref>), but both tests have not been reported to fail simultaneously. PHI and 3Seq methods consistently identify most of the apparent ‘backbone’ of the MERS-CoV phylogeny as encompassing sequences with evidence of recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neither method can identify where in the tree recombination occurred, but each full asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> should be interpreted as the minimum partition of data that still captures both donor and recipient alleles involved in a recombination event. This suggests a non-negligible contribution of recombination in shaping existing MERS-CoV diversity. As done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dudas and Rambaut, 2016</xref>), we show large numbers of homoplasies in MERS-CoV data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) with some evidence of genomic clustering of such alleles. These results are consistent with high incidence of MERS-CoV in camels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reusken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2017</xref>), allowing for co-infection with distinct genotypes and thus recombination to occur.</p><p>Owing to these findings, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which we partitioned the MERS-CoV genome into two fragments and identified human outbreak clusters within each fragment. We find strong similarity in the grouping of human cases into outbreak clusters between fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Between the two trees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> four (out of 54) ‘human’ clades are expanded where either singleton introductions or two-taxon clades in fragment 2 join other clades in fragment 1. For the reverse comparison, there are five ‘human’ clades (out of 53) in fragment 2 that are expanded. All such clades have low divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and thus incongruences in human clades are more likely to be caused by differences in deme assignment rather than actual recombination. And while we observe evidence of distinct phylogenetic trees from different parts of the MERS-CoV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), human clades are minimally affected and large portions of the posterior probability density in both parts of the genome are concentrated in shared clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

MERS-CoV evolution on the reservoir side is complicated by recombination, although is nonetheless still largely amenable to phylogenetic methods. Amongst other parameters of interest, recombination is expected to interfere with molecular clocks, where transferred genomic regions can give the impression of branches undergoing rapid evolution, or branches where recombination results in reversions appearing to evolve slow. In addition to its potential to influence tree topology, recombination in molecular sequence data is an erratic force with unpredictable effects. We suspect that the effects of recombination in MERS-CoV data are reigned in by a relatively small effective population size of the virus in Saudi Arabia (see next section) where haplotypes are fixed or nearly fixed, thus preventing an accumulation of genetic diversity that would then be reshuffled via recombination. Nevertheless the evolutionary rate of the virus appears to fall firmly within the expected range for RNA viruses: regression of nucleotide differences to Jordan-N3/2012 genome against sequence collection dates yields a rate of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4.59</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> subs/site/year, Bayesian structured coalescent estimate from primary analysis <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>9.57</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (95% HPDs: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>8.28</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10.9</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) subs/site/year.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MERS-CoV shows population turnover in camels</title><p>Here, we attempt to investigate MERS-CoV demographic patterns in the camel reservoir.

We showed that currently existing models of population structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>) can identify distinct demographic modes in MERS-CoV genomic data, where viruses continuously circulating in camels repeatedly jump into humans and cause small outbreaks doomed to extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This inference succeeds under different choices of priors for unknown demographic parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and in the presence of strong biases in sequence sampling schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). When rapid coalescence in the human deme is not allowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) structured coalescent inference loses power and ancestral state reconstruction is nearly identical to that of discrete trait analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). When allowed different deme-specific population sizes, the structured coalescent model succeeds because a large proportion of human sequences fall into tightly connected clusters, which informs a low estimate for the population size of the human deme. This in turn informs the inferred state of long ancestral branches in the phylogeny, that is, because these long branches are not immediately coalescing, they are most likely in camels.</p><p>From sequence data, we identify at least 50 zoonotic introductions of MERS-CoV into humans from the reservoir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), from which we extrapolate that hundreds more such introductions must have taken place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although we recover migration rates from our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), these only pertain to sequences and in no way reflect the epidemiologically relevant <italic>per capita</italic> rates of zoonotic spillover events. We also looked at potential seasonality in MERS-CoV spillover into humans. Our analyses indicated a period of three months where the odds of a sequenced spillover event are increased, with timing consistent with an enzootic amongst camel calves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As a result of our identification of large and asymmetric flow of viral lineages into humans we also find that the basic reproduction number for MERS-CoV in humans is well below the epidemic threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Having said that, there are highly customisable coalescent methods available that extend the methods used here to accommodate time varying migration rates and population sizes, integrate alternative sources of information and fit to stochastic nonlinear models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rasmussen et al., 2014</xref>), which would be more appropriate for MERS-CoV. Some distinct aspects of MERS-CoV epidemiology could not be captured in our methodology, such as hospital outbreaks where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is expected to be consistently closer to 1.0 compared to community transmission of MERS-CoV. Outside of coalescent-based models, there are population structure models that explicitly relate epidemiological parameters to the branching process observed in sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kühnert et al., 2016</xref>), but often rely on specifying numerous informative priors and can suffer from MCMC convergence issues.</p><p>Strong population structure in viruses often arises through limited gene flow, either due to geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudas et al., 2017</xref>), ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2009</xref>) or evolutionary forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dudas et al., 2015</xref>). On a smaller scale, population structure can unveil important details about transmission patterns, such as identifying reservoirs and understanding spillover trends and risk, much as we have done here. When properly understood naturally arising barriers to gene flow can be exploited for more efficient disease control and prevention, as well as risk management.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transmissibility differences between zoonoses and pandemics</title><p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a Betacoronavirus like MERS-CoV, caused a serious epidemic in humans in 2003, with over 8000 cases and nearly 800 deaths. Since MERS-CoV was also able to cause significant pathogenicity in the human host it was inevitable that parallels would be drawn between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at the time of MERS discovery in 2012. Although we describe the epidemiology of MERS-CoV from sequence data, indications that MERS-CoV has poor capacity to spread human-to-human existed prior to any sequence data. SARS-CoV swept through the world in a short period of time, but MERS cases trickled slowly and were restricted to the Arabian Peninsula or resulted in self-limiting outbreaks outside of the region, a pattern strongly indicative of repeat zoonotic spillover.

MERS-CoV may join the list of pathogens able to jump species barriers but not spread efficiently in the new host. Since its emergence in 2012, MERS-CoV has caused self-limiting outbreaks in humans with no evidence of worsening outbreaks over time. However, sustained evolution of the virus in the reservoir and continued flow of viral lineages into humans provides the substrate for a more transmissible variant of MERS-CoV to possibly emerge. Previous modelling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2013</xref>) suggest a positive relationship between initial <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in the human host and probability of evolutionary emergence of a novel strain which passes the supercritical threshold of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf63"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

With very little known about the fitness landscape or adaptive potential of MERS-CoV, it is incredibly challenging to predict the likelihood of the emergence more transmissible variants. In light of these difficulties, we encourage continued genomic surveillance of MERS-CoV in the camel reservoir and from sporadic human cases to rapidly identify a supercritical variant, if one does emerge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence data</title><p>All MERS-CoV sequences were downloaded from GenBank and accession numbers are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

As the default sampling scheme operates under equiprobable sequencing, we also simulated biased sequencing by using concentrated hypergeometric distributions where the probability mass function is squared (bias = 2) or cubed (bias = 3) and then normalized.

id="s4-5"><title>Demographic inference of MERS-CoV in the reservoir</title><p>In order to infer the demographic history of MERS-CoV in camels we used the results of structured coalescent analyses to identify introductions of the virus into humans. The oldest sequence from each cluster introduced into humans was kept for further analysis. This procedure removes lineages coalescing rapidly in humans, which would otherwise introduce a strong signal of low effective population size. These subsampled MERS-CoV sequences from humans were combined with existing sequence data from camels to give us a dataset with minimal demographic signal coming from epidemiological processes in humans. Sequences belonging to the outgroup clade where most of MERS-CoV sequences from Egypt fall were removed out of concern that MERS epidemics in Saudi Arabia and Egypt are distinct epidemics with relatively poor sampling in the latter. Were more sequences of MERS-CoV available from other parts of Africa we speculate they would fall outside of the diversity that has been sampled in Saudi Arabia and cluster with early MERS-CoV sequences from Jordan and sequences from Egyptian camels. However, currently there are no indications of what MERS-CoV diversity looks like in camels east of Saudi Arabia. A flexible skygrid tree prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gill et al., 2013</xref>) was used to recover estimates of scaled effective population size (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf129"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) at 50 evenly spaced grid points across six years, ending at the most recent tip in the tree (2015 August) in BEAST v1.8.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>), under a relaxed molecular clock with rates drawn from a lognormal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>) and codon position partitioned (positions <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf130"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf131"><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>) HKY <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf132"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasegawa et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang, 1994</xref>) nucleotide substitution models. At time of writing advanced flexible coalescent tree priors from the skyline family, such as skygrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gill et al., 2013</xref>) are available in BEAST v1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>) but not in BEAST v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>). We set up five independent MCMC chains to run for 500 million states, sampling every <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf133"><mml:mn>50 000</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> states. This analysis suffered from poor convergence, where two chains converged onto one stationary distribution, two to another and the last chain onto a third stationary distribution, with high effective sample sizes. Demographic trajectories recovered by the two main stationary distributions are very similar and differences between the two appear to be caused by convergence onto subtly different tree topologies. This non-convergence effect may have been masked previously by the use of all available MERS-CoV sequences from humans which may have lead MCMC towards one of the multiple stationary distributions.</p><p>To ensure that recombination was not interfering with the skygrid reconstruction, we also split our MERS-CoV alignment into ten parts 2937 nucleotides long. These were then used as separate partitions with independent trees and clock rates in BEAST v1.8.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>). Nucleotide substitution and relaxed clock models were set up identically to the whole genome skygrid analysis described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hasegawa et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang, 1994</xref>). Skygrid coalescent tree prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gill et al., 2013</xref>) was used jointly across all ten partitions for demographic inference. Five MCMC chains were set up, each running for 200 million states, sampling every 20,000 states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequence data and all analytical code is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/blab/mers-structure">https://github.com/blab/mers-structure</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dudas, 2017</xref>).

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Erik Volz (Reviewer #1); Christophe Fraser (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Dudas et al. perform a coalescent analysis of 274 MERS-Cov viruses. They conclude that 1) MERS is sustained in camels (R0&gt;1) and not in humans (R0&lt;1), and that most if not all cross species transmissions have been camel to human. 2) Cross species events are seasonal, but R0 in humans isn't. 3) The relatively low levels of genetic diversity in camel viruses can be explained by camel demography.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The population genetic model (the particular form of structured coalescent) is highly idealised and this may influence the quantitative conclusions, although we suspect the conclusions are quite robust qualitatively. This model specifically estimates the rate of a lineage moving between demes going backwards in time; the numbers cited for the camel-&gt;human rate is really the rate that a lineage in humans goes to a camel going down the tree. The relationship between these migration rates and the epidemiologically meaningful transmission rate is complex and depends among other things on the ratio of population sizes in both demes. Per-capita transmission rates could be estimated using an epidemiologically structured coalescent model (see e.g. papers by Volz and Rasmussen), which would ideally be stochastic due to bursty dynamics in humans. But this would be a large undertaking and so we suggest that for now the distinction is clarified. Overall, a little more discussion of the complexity and pitfalls when relating idealised population genetic models (like the island model used here) to a noisy nonlinear epidemic like this one might be merited.</p><p>2) 'Our analyses recover these results despite sequence data heavily skewed towards non-uniformly sampled human cases and are robust to choice of prior.' This is a quite nice result and raises the question if skewed sampling would bias estimates if using a substitution model approach ('discrete trait analysis', DTA). It would strengthen the paper to include a comparison of the structured coalescent estimates to another method for ancestral states; the most popular approach in beast has been substitution models (DTA). These may give divergent results because of skewed sampling. It would be rather easy for the authors to run a DTA and if biased, this would serve as a good cautionary example when sampling is highly skewed towards one deme.</p><p>3) A comparison to ML tree reconstruction could potentially be illuminating. We think you could be clearer about what drives the results in your paper. It is unusual for a phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction, that the results seem to be determined as much by the coalescent assumptions as by the tree topology. The two-patch model had a much higher coalescent rate in the human deme than in the camel deme – so long branches are only really possible in the camel deme. This may be why for example, staring at the top clade of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, one can see camel ancestry to a whole bunch of human sequences that are not topologically separated by camel sequences. If this is correct, these results may not necessarily be wrong, but it made us slightly uncomfortable that the results are driven by the coalescent model, not the tree topology. Please elaborate, either correcting us, or explaining better. A simple test of this hypothesis would be that an ML ancestral reconstruction on the ML tree would not give the same clusters. I don't think that would make the ML result correct, but it might be an enlightening comparison. Or you may prefer another way to address this.</p><p>4) Easily addressed, but important. The paper already sounds a strong voice of concern in the final paragraph, but we think this could be even stronger. Antia et al. Nature 2003 first showed, using a simple branching process, that for most genetic landscapes, the probability of a pathogen evolving to state with R0&gt;1 increases dramatically as a function of the wild-type R0. So R0~0.8 is much worse than R0~0.3. More sophisticated models have been done since, especially by Llyod-smith's group, but the basic result is sound. In the light of this theoretical work, your findings are not at all reassuring.</p><p>5) More generally, the model choices need better explaining. Why delve into a structured coalescent in BEAST2 for the ancestral reconstruction, but go back to the Skygrid in BEAST1 for computations of Ne? We assume this is a pragmatic choice, and for the latter you carefully reduced the human clusters to reduce bias, but we think the rationale for your choices need laying out more clearly. Even if pragmatic rather than principled, (e.g. there are no structure coalescent options in BEAST1), we think it still needs to be stated why you made the choices you did. Especially since there are other recently-developed BEAST2 packages that could be used to fit the same structured coalescent model: BASTA and MASCOT, as well as the very flexible PhyDyn package (which might offer improvements in computation time).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31257.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The population genetic model (the particular form of structured coalescent) is highly idealised and this may influence the quantitative conclusions, although we suspect the conclusions are quite robust qualitatively.

We have altered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> in the reviewed manuscript to reflect that the rates shown are backwards in time. We have added the following sentences to the Discussion to highlight the fact that the coalescent model employed is not ideal:</p><p>“Although we recover migration rates from our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), these only pertain to sequences and in no way reflect the epidemiologically relevant per capita rates of zoonotic spillover events. […] Outside of coalescent-based models there are population structure models that explicitly relate epidemiological parameters to the branching process observed in sequence data (Kuhnert et al., 2016), but often rely on specifying numerous informative priors and can suffer from MCMC convergence issues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) 'Our analyses recover these results despite sequence data heavily skewed towards non-uniformly sampled human cases and are robust to choice of prior.'

We have run this analysis and include the results as a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected, the skewed sampling results in a reconstruction of ancestral states that puts humans as the source of most MERS-CoV lineages in camels. We have added the appropriate description of methods as well as the following paragraph in Results:</p><p>“Our findings suggest that instances of human infection with MERS-CoV are more common than currently thought, with exceedingly short transmission chains mostly limited to primary cases that might be mild and ultimately not detected by surveillance or sequencing. […] We suspect that this particular discrete trait analysis reconstruction is false due to biased data, i.e. having nearly twice as many MERS-CoV sequences from humans (n = 174) than from camels (n = 100) and the inability of the model to account for and quantify vastly different rates of coalescence in the phylogenetic vicinity of both types of sequences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A comparison to ML tree reconstruction could potentially be illuminating.

We share the suspicion that the results are largely driven by contrasts in effective population sizes between demes. In addition to the requested maximum likelihood phylogeny (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) we also ran a structured coalescent analysis where deme sizes are enforced to be the same (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This model fails in a similar way to a DTA reconstruction shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. We now explain how the structured coalescent arrives at the tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the Discussion:</p><p>“When allowed different deme-specific population sizes, the structured coalescent model succeeds because a large proportion of human sequences fall into tightly connected clusters, which informs a low estimate for the population size of the human deme. This in turn informs the inferred state of long ancestral branches in the phylogeny, i.e. because these long branches are not immediately coalescing, they are most likely in camels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Easily addressed, but important.

We also believe that adaptive landscapes play a considerable role in emerging pandemics. We added an additional sentence to the Discussion and refer to the Antia et al. study:</p><p>“Previous modeling studies (Antia et al., 2003; Park et al., 2013) suggest a positive relationship between initial R0 in the human host and probability of evolutionary emergence of a novel strain which passes the supercritical threshold of R0 &gt; 1.0. […] In light of these difficulties, we encourage continued genomic surveillance of MERS-CoV in the camel reservoir and from sporadic human cases to rapidly identify a supercritical variant, if one does emerge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More generally, the model choices need better explaining.

Indeed all cases of using BEAST 1 vs. BEAST 2 came down to what models were implemented in which package. We have clarified our choices throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
