Identifying which neuron ensembles are involved and how they compare across different behavior states is critical for our understanding of brain circuitry and function. Traditional methods for identifying active neuron ensembles have relied on exploiting the cellular machinery that control expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as <italic>Egr1/Zif268</italic>, <italic>c-Fos</italic>, or <italic>Arc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morgan et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sheng and Greenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lyford et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawashima et al., 2014</xref>). However, the temporal resolution of these methods is poor, typically on the scale of tens of minutes to hours, and they do not correlate well with electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sallaz and Jourdan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sheng et al., 1993</xref>). More accurate and temporally precise methods are desired for identifying and comparing active neuron ensembles.</p><p>Calcium is an important second messenger in cell signaling pathways and neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>), which follows electrical activity more quantitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helmchen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajar et al., 2016</xref>). Over the past several decades, a wide range of tools have been developed to monitor and record calcium activity in cells, tissues, and live animals. For example, GCaMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) are single-wavelength calcium indicators that have enabled the visualization of calcium transients with fast kinetics, but their requirement for constant monitoring limit the size of the field of view, and recording neural activity in freely moving specimens is challenging. CaMPARIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moeyaert et al., 2018</xref>) are photoconvertible calcium integrators that have enabled optical selection and post-hoc analysis of the evoked calcium activity across large tissue volumes during a specific epoch of interest. Alternative approaches have coupled calcium activity with light activation in order to drive the activation of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These calcium sensors are powerful tools for identifying and comparing active neuron ensembles and there is continued demand for tools with improved or novel properties.</p><p>One major limitation of calcium sensors that rely on photoconversion or light activation is their irreversibility, which is useful when a permanent signal is desired; however, this irreversibility also hinders reuse of the tool, especially when multiple snapshots of activity are desired from the same sample preparation. Multiple snapshots are desirable when comparing active neuron ensembles in non-stereotyped organisms where there is variability in neural circuitry across different individuals, or where there is variability from trial to trial in the same individual. Thus, one desirable property for a calcium sensor would be the ability to mark, erase, and then re-mark calcium activity during specified time periods over large scales. Such an erasable calcium marker would enable multiple snapshots of neuronal activity to be captured quickly within the same sample preparation.</p><p>To develop an erasable calcium marker, we used protein engineering to combine calcium sensing with the properties of reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins. These proteins can be toggled between a fluorescent state (on) and a non-fluorescent state (off) depending on the wavelength of light used for illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou and Lin, 2013</xref>). For example, Dronpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2004</xref>), rsEGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grotjohann et al., 2011</xref>), and mGeos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2012</xref>) are bright green fluorescent proteins that can be off-switched with blue light illumination. Subsequent illumination with violet light reverts them back to the on-state. The structural mechanism underlying this reversible switching behavior is a cis/trans isomerization of the chromophore, which is coupled to the chromophore’s protonation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andresen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andresen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that reversible photoswitching could provide a mechanism for marking, erasing, and remarking calcium activity using light. Specifically, we aimed to engineer an erasable calcium marker such that the photoswitching kinetics are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and that the final magnitude of fluorescence change provides a stable but erasable readout for the relative amount of calcium activity during a user-defined time window of light illumination; reverse photoswitching could then quickly erase the signal and reset the tool for immediate reuse. Here, we report development of a new type of erasable calcium marker called rsCaMPARI (reversibly switchable CaMPARI)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Using directed evolution methods, we engineered the off-switching kinetics of rsCaMPARI under blue light illumination to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, which allows reversible calcium activity marking with cellular resolution. The fluorescence can be easily recovered with violet light for immediate reuse and enables erasable and repeatable calcium activity marking over practical timescales of a few seconds. We demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking, erasing, and re-marking cells with elevated calcium in primary neuron cultures and freely swimming zebrafish.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Engineering and in vitro characterization of rsCaMPARI.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of rsCaMPARI function.

We introduced CaMPARI2 mutations onto a mEos3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) scaffold and converted the protein from a green-to-red photoconvertible FP to a reversibly switchable FP that cycles between bright green and dim states via an H62L substitution within the chromophore, as was previously demonstrated by the production of the mGeos FPs from EosFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). After photoswitching to the off-state, the H62L mutant exhibited slow spontaneous recovery to the on-state with a half-time of several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). We reasoned that the stability of the switched fluorescent signal would be beneficial for stable and precise readout of the final fluorescence signal following photoswitching.</p><p>We next engineered libraries of insertions of a calcium-binding domain (calmodulin) and calmodulin-binding peptide into the H62L-substituted FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Guided by crystal structures of CaMPARI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>) and the cis/trans isomers of IrisFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2008</xref>), we targeted the insertion of calcium-binding domains to the middle of β-strands 8 and 9 to efficiently propagate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced conformational changes to amino acids around Y63 of the chromophore, which undergoes cis/trans isomerization during reversible photoswitching. The libraries included both possible orientations of the calcium-binding domains and had diversity in the length and composition of linkers connecting the calcium-binding and FP domains. A red fluorescent protein, mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>), was fused in frame at the C-terminus to normalize for expression and photoswitching. Screening in <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), we aimed to optimize four parameters: (1) difference in green fluorescence following 490 nm light illumination +/- Ca<sup>2+</sup>, (2) recovery of fluorescence intensity following 400 nm light illumination, (3) minimum fluorescence change due to calcium binding in the absence of light illumination (‘indicator behavior’), and (4) green brightness. Ninety-six clones were selected and sequenced, resulting in 19 unique clones that exhibited a variety of photoswitching kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>One variant with an insertion of calcium-binding domains in β-strand nine was selected for further characterization due to its &gt; 10 fold photoswitching rate contrast, relatively small indicator behavior, and high brightness. We named this variant rsCaMPARI (reversibly switchable CaMPARI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Additional site-saturation mutagenesis to improve rsCaMPARI contrast did not identify improved variants without compromising other desired traits. In particular, we observed that any improved fluorescence contrast appeared to be tightly coupled to increased indicator behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>rsCaMPARI is a bright green and calcium-dependent photoswitchable FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). We observed a strong dependence of the extent of photoswitching and the rate contrast on the wavelength of light applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8a–d</xref>). During illumination with blue ‘marking light’ (470–490 nm, 200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8e</xref>), rsCaMPARI exhibited ~17 fold faster off-switching kinetics in high calcium compared to low calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and the off-switching rate was linear with respect to the light power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). When exposed to violet ‘erasing light’ (390–410 nm, 200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), the recovery of rsCaMPARI fluorescence back to the bright on-state was very efficient and had similar on-switching kinetics in either high- or low-calcium conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Measurement of green fluorescence intensity as a function of free calcium concentration showed that the calcium-free state was ~2-fold brighter than the calcium-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e,f</xref>), and indicated an apparent dissociation constant of 167 ± 6 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Measurement of the off-switching rate vs. free calcium concentration gave a similar apparent dissociation constant of 181 ± 11 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

The mCherry tag was replaced with mRuby3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajar et al., 2016</xref>). mCherry is derived from DsRed, which is known to accumulate and form bright puncta in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Katayama et al., 2008</xref>). We used field electrode stimulation to induce action potential firing at 80 Hz during continuous illumination with marking light (200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) on an epifluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neurons illuminated with 10 s of marking light accompanied by field stimulation exhibited strong dimming of the green fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, cycle 1), which could later be recovered by a 3-s pulse of erasing light. When the same neuron was subsequently illuminated with marking light but without field stimulation, only modest dimming of the green fluorescence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, cycle 2). The same neuron could be repeatedly marked and erased over several cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, cycles 3–6). To assess rsCaMPARI sensitivity, we quantified green fluorescence changes during a 2 s pulse of marking light over a range of stimulation frequencies from 5 to 80 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). While the non-stimulated neurons exhibited minimal photoswitching, we observed significantly more photoswitching in stimulated neurons and higher frequencies resulted in more photoswitching. The broad variability we observed in the marked signal is presumably due to the natural variability among neurons and this variability was previously observed for GCaMP in similar neuron preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wardill et al., 2013</xref>). Monitoring green fluorescence of the neurons over time showed a shift to more rapid off-switching that correlated with the onset of field stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In response to three trains of 160 action potentials during marking light, we observed the largest fluorescence change during the first train (~40–60% green fluorescence decrease compared to ~10% in non-stimulated neurons). Smaller fluorescence changes were observed during the second and third field pulse trains as the sensor approached near complete off-switching.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>rsCaMPARI reversibly and selectively marks activity in primary neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fluorescence images of a representative primary rat hippocampal neuron undergoing multiple cycles of exposure to a 10 s window of marking light (224 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) ± field stimulation (2 × 160 stimulations at 80 Hz).

We tracked the fluorescence of neurons that had previously been illuminated with marking light and found that rsCaMPARI green fluorescence is stable in the dark for more than 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), even during ongoing calcium activity. This provides sufficient time for readout of the recorded signal, for example with high-resolution microscopy techniques over large volumes of tissue, and demonstrates that rsCaMPARI is sufficiently stable for post-hoc analysis.</p><p>Next, we characterized photofatigue of rsCaMPARI in neurons from multiple rounds of marking and erasing to understand how many times activity patterns could be marked. Fluorescence was monitored before and after marking light illumination, then recovered with erasing light over successive cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). The neurons were stimulated during odd-numbered cycles, but not during even-numbered cycles. We observed that rsCaMPARI lost ~50% of its initial fluorescence after 20 cycles. The fluorescence contrast between ‘stimulated’ and ‘not stimulated’ was reduced to ~50% of the initial difference after 10 cycles, but still allowed discrimination between marked and unmarked cells. rsCaMPARI may therefore be erased and reused for at least 10 cycles of marking activity.</p><p>To demonstrate that rsCaMPARI can mark an active subset of neurons within a population, we first performed whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology on a single rsCaMPARI-expressing neuron, delivering current injections to produce controlled action potential firing during marking light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Other neurons in the same field of view were not active due to application of drugs to block synaptic release. The patched neuron became much dimmer during the marking light illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, bottom panels), providing threefold contrast when compared to surrounding neurons that were not patched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), and more rapid off-switching correlated well with action potential firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). The green rsCaMPARI fluorescence could be quickly recovered by subsequent illumination with erasing light and selective marking of the patched neuron could be repeated several times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, cycles 2 and 3). We also drove activity in a subset of neurons using a channelrhodopsin. We sparsely co-expressed ChrimsonR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) channelrhodopsin in neurons expressing rsCaMPARI and acquired images before and after illumination with marking light and pulsed 560 nm light to fully drive the channelrhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i–j</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). A subset of neurons became much dimmer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, bottom panels), primarily corresponding to neurons that were positive for channelrhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a</xref>, bottom panels) and showed more than twofold contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). The same subset of neurons could be repeatedly erased and marked again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>, cycles 2 and 3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Marking activity patterns in freely swimming zebrafish</title><p>To demonstrate the utility of rsCaMPARI for marking active neurons in vivo, we generated stable transgenic zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) expressing rsCaMPARI from a neuron-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). We developed an imaging protocol for rsCaMPARI in the zebrafish brain using light sheet fluorescence microscopy for rapid acquisition and to minimize out-of-plane excitation light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Zebrafish larvae (4–5 days post fertilization) experiencing a variety of stimuli were exposed to 10 s of marking light (400 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>); 10 s exposure at similar light intensities gave good contrast under high- and low-calcium conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and was sufficient to observe distinct calcium activity patterns in the zebrafish brain using similar tools such as CaMPARI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>). Light sheet z-stacks were acquired in the following order: (1) acquire the post-marking signal as a ‘marked’ stack, (2) reset to the bright on-state with erasing light, and (3) acquire the post-erased signal as a ‘reference’ stack. Comparison between the marked and reference stacks thus revealed the relative magnitude of rsCaMPARI photoswitching, which we quantitated and normalized as a ΔF/F metric. When the fish were anesthetized with the sodium channel blocker tricaine methanosulfonate (MS-222) to block brain activity during exposure to marking light, there was low and uniform labeling across the brain, consistent with a small amount of background photoswitching in the absence of calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in freely swimming zebrafish, we observed neuron-specific labeling patterns, particularly in the forebrain, habenula, and hindbrain. Additional stimulation with cold or warm water, or the proconvulsant potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) also produced distinct and reproducible patterns of labeling. Generally, rsCaMPARI marked calcium activity patterns across brain areas similar to those observed previously with CaMPARI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), although some differences exist presumably due to variability across freely swimming fish. This variability may arise due to several sources, including differences in transgene expression patterns, differences in the zebrafish’s perception of blue light versus violet light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guggiana-Nilo and Engert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>) used to mark calcium activity, image processing and analysis (comparison between rsCaMPARI ΔF/F images versus CaMPARI red images), and inherent variability from animal to animal and trial to trial that arise from the fish’s current brain state leading up to and during the behavioral response.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>rsCaMPARI reversibly marks patterns of elevated calcium in the freely moving larval zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) rsCaMPARI expression in the Tg[<italic>elavl3:</italic>rsCaMPARI-mRuby3]<sup>jf93</sup> zebrafish.

We observed stimulus-specific labeling across multiple marking cycles for neurons located in the zebrafish pallium. For example, over six marking cycles (alternating cold and warm water), specific neurons were strongly and repeatedly labeled during cold water exposures, but not during warm water stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, upper panels). We also observed some variability across trials when using the same stimulus, presumably due to variability in the ongoing brain activity leading up to the stimulus and the variability in the perception to the stimulus experienced by freely swimming fish. Overall, the patterns of labeling across the pallium in response to either cold or warm water were specific to the stimulus: activity patterns in response to cold water showed higher mean correlation with other cold response patterns, and activity patterns in response to warm water showed higher mean correlation with other warm response patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, bottom-right panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate that rsCaMPARI is able to consistently capture patterns of neurons with elevated calcium from specific stimuli over multiple cycles in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The development of novel and improved calcium sensors continues to be immensely transformative for neuroscience, enabling experimental efforts toward decoding systems level dynamics and the mapping of functional circuits. Assignment of ensembles of neurons to specific functional circuits is greatly facilitated by comparisons between stimulus and control periods, or between repeated trials, which can be challenging for GCaMPs in freely moving animals over large spatial scales or impossible for CaMPARI due to its irreversible nature. In this work, we have developed a new type of erasable calcium marker called rsCaMPARI. Our experiments in zebrafish demonstrate how rsCaMPARI now enables marking of multiple patterns of cells with elevated calcium by allowing the probe to be reset by erasing light between trials. Thus, the erasable nature of rsCaMPARI now allows comparisons to be made between activity patterns across multiple trials from a variety of different stimuli, all within the same sample preparation.</p><p>We achieved erasable marking of neuronal activity by engineering reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins, a class of fluorescent probes that has been utilized for superresolution microscopy approaches but which has not yet been exploited to create functional activity reporters. Another possible future application of reversibly switchable activity reporters is their use with superresolution microscopy techniques like nonlinear structured illumination to visualize physiological signals within intracellular microdomains.</p><p>In summary, rsCaMPARI retains many of the advantages of a calcium marker such as bright fluorescence, high contrast, light gating, short integration windows (seconds), and stable integrated signal, on top of being reusable. Additionally, rsCaMPARI can be used in a single (green) fluorescent color channel by comparing the post-marking light image to the post-erasing light image as we show in zebrafish, allowing the simultaneous use of complementary reporters or effectors in other color channels. We believe rsCaMPARI represents an important addition to the toolkit for marking active neuronal populations, and we expect it will enable functional circuit marking and mapping with higher accuracy than previously possible. Specifically, we envision rsCaMPARI being useful for single-neuron resolution mapping and comparison of activity patterns across the whole brain of freely swimming zebrafish during different behaviors or stimuli, as we have demonstrated here. We can also imagine similar experiments in mice. For example, marking and reading out activity patterns over regions of the cortex too large to image at single-neuron resolution with GCaMP, but doing so over numerous trials and behaviors in the same animal, which cannot be done with CaMPARI. This would enable better understanding of the interplay between cortical circuits at the single-neuron level.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Lobophyllia hemprichii</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mEos3.1</td><td valign="top">FPbase</td><td valign="top">FPbase:73GT1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pRSET_His-rsCaMPARI-mRuby3 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_120804">Addgene_120804</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Plasmid available at Addgene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAAV-hsyn_NES-His-rsCaMPARI-mRuby3 <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_120805">Addgene_120805</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Plasmid available at Addgene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAAV-hsyn_NLS-His-rsCaMPARI-mRuby3 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_122092">Addgene_122092</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Plasmid available at Addgene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pTol2-elavl3_NES-rsCaMPARI-mRuby3 (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_122129">Addgene_122129</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Plasmid available at Addgene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pAAV-hsyn_ChrimsonR-HaloTag (plasmid)</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509633">24509633</ext-link> and PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18533659">18533659</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">T7 express</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">C2566</td><td valign="top">Competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Primary rat hippocampal neurons</td><td valign="top">Janelia Research Campus</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated from <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg[<italic>elavl3</italic>:rsCaMPARI-mRuby3]<sup>jf93</sup></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">jf93Tg/+</td><td valign="top">ZFIN ID: ZDB-FISH-191008–1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Synaptic blockers</td><td valign="top">Tocris; PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24155972">24155972</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cat# 0190, 0247, 1262, 0337</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Janelia Fluor 635 dye, HaloTag ligand</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28924668">28924668</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Luke Lavis’ lab</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">E10521</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">4-Aminopyridine</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">275875</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">CMTK</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12670015">12670015</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002234">SCR_002234</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Directed evolution of rsCaMPARI</title><p>CaMPARI2 in a pRSET plasmid (Life Technologies) was circularly permutated back to the original N- and C-termini of EosFP. The CaMPARI2 calmodulin and RS20 peptide were deleted to repair the original β-strand 7 of mEos3.1. H62 of the chromophore was mutated to L with a mutagenic primer using the QuikChange method (Agilent) to produce a reversibly switchable mEos3.1 (rs-mEos3.1) construct variant. This construct contained the following mutations (derived from CaMPARI) relative to mEos3.1: V2 insert, F34Y, S39T, H62L, A69V, L93M, N102Y, N105S, C195T, L210I, and H213Y. A red fluorescent protein, mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>), was fused in frame at the C-terminus to normalize for expression and photoswitching. The plasmid was linearized by PCR such that calcium-binding domains could be inserted into β-strand 8 or 9. Calmodulin and RS20 were fused with a flexible (GGS)<sub>4</sub> amino acid linker in either the CaM-RS20 or RS20-CaM orientation for insertion as a single fragment using the Gibson assembly method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). The fragment was amplified with primers that contained (1) a variable region with 2 NNS codons plus 0 to 4 codons originating from EosFP in order to introduce linker composition and length diversity, and (2) a 5’ 30 bp region for annealing to the linearized plasmid. Each β-strand library had a theoretical diversity size of 8 × 10<sup>6</sup>. The Gibson assembly mixtures were diluted threefold in deionized water and transformed into T7 express <italic>E. coli</italic> (New England Biolabs) by electroporation. Transformed bacteria were plated on LB + ampicillin to isolate single colonies and a small number of clones were sequenced to confirm the desired library diversity.</p><p>Fluorescent colonies were manually picked and transferred to liquid growth media in 96-deep well plates and grown and harvested as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>). Two wells containing the rs-mEos3.1 construct without calcium-binding domain insertions and two wells containing a non-fluorescent variant, rs-Eos3.1(H62G, Y63G), were included in each plate as controls. To prepare lysates for screening, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 800 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) containing 50% BPER (Thermo Fisher) and shaken at 30°C for 30 min. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and 95 μl of the cleared lysate was transferred to four separate 96-well microplates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Two of the plates were mixed with 5 μl calcium chloride solution to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The other two plates were mixed with 5 μl EGTA solution to a final concentration of 1.0 mM. Green and red fluorescence intensities were measured on an Infinity M1000 fluorescence plate reader (Tecan). The plates were then illuminated with a 490 nm LED array (170 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, Luxeon) for 15 s before reading fluorescence intensities again. One of the original plates in high-calcium condition was swapped to high EGTA condition by adding 10 μl EGTA solution to a final concentration of 10 mM. Similarly, one of the original plates in high EGTA condition was swapped to high-calcium condition by adding 10 μl calcium chloride solution to a final concentration of 5 mM. Fluorescence intensities were measured again. Finally, the plates were illuminated with a 405 nm LED array (200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, Loctite) for 10 s before reading final fluorescence intensities.</p><p>Library variants were selected based on four criteria: (1) contrast in green fluorescence following 490 nm light illumination ± Ca<sup>2+</sup>, quantified as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>(2) recovery of fluorescence intensity following 400 nm light illumination, (3) minimum fluorescence change due to calcium binding in the absence of light illumination (indicator behavior), quantified as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>and (4) green brightness.

The F1 generation fish were later incrossed and 4–5 days post-fertilization (dpf) larvae exhibiting bright green fluorescence in the CNS were used for experiments.</p><p>We observed poor correlation between the rsCaMPARI green signal and the mRuby3 red signal in the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), presumably because the larval zebrafish brain is rapidly developing and the maturation time of the mRuby3 chromophore is slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balleza et al., 2018</xref>) compared to rsCaMPARI. Therefore, we caution against using mRuby3 as an expression normalization tag in larval zebrafish. However, the mRuby3 tag was useful for initially locating and positioning the zebrafish brain within the field of view for imaging without using blue light, which would induce further rsCaMPARI photoswitching.</p><p>Zebrafish in system water were illuminated for 10 s with marking light (470 nm Mightex LED fitted with a Chroma 485/25x filter, 400 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) under various stimulus conditions, including freely swimming in system water, anesthetized in 0.24 mg/mL tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222, Sigma), cold water (4°C), warm water (45°C), and following 15–30 min exposure to 800 µM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, Sigma). Following marking light exposure, the fish was anesthetized in 0.24 mg/mL MS-222 and immobilized with 2% agarose in a glass capillary tube (size 2, Zeiss) for imaging. For fish undergoing multiple cycles of marking and erasing, the fish was transferred to fresh system water and carefully removed from the agarose. The fish was allowed to recover to freely swimming behavior (typically within 15 min) and a brief 3 s illumination with erasing light (405 nm Loctite LED, 200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was used to reset the sensor before another marking cycle began.</p><p>Larval zebrafish brains were imaged on a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope equipped with 50 mW 405, 488, and 561 nm laser lines and a pco.edge 5.5 sCMOS camera (PCO).

The sample chamber was filled with system water containing 0.24 mg/mL MS-222 and the solidified agarose was partially extruded from the capillary tube to position the fish within the sample chamber. A 585 nm longpass emission filter was used to visualize mRuby3 fluorescence for positioning and a 505–545 nm bandpass emission filter was used to image rsCaMPARI fluorescence. Each Z slice was acquired in dual-side illumination mode with pivot scan using 1% 488 nm excitation and 100 ms exposure time.

CaMPARI confocal images of larval zebrafish brain exposed to MS-222, cold water, warm water, 4-AP, and freely swimming conditions were aligned to the rsCaMPARI images. The CaMPARI green image stack was first aligned with a rsCaMPARI reference image stack using an affine alignment in CMTK with the following parameters: exploration 26, accuracy 0.4, and dofs 6. The CaMPARI red image stack was then reformatted in CMTK to align with the respective CaMPARI green image stack. Finally, the CaMPARI red images were pseudo-colored using the ICA lookup table in Fiji and presented with the corresponding rsCaMPARI ΔF/F images from the same stimulus condition and Z slice.</p><p>To compute mean correlation coefficients between trials in the same fish, reference image stacks of the forebrain were first aligned to each other with an initial affine alignment in CMTK with the following parameters: exploration 26, accuracy 0.4, and dofs 12; the images were then further aligned with a restrained warp in CMTK with the following parameters: exploration 26, coarsest 4, grid-spacing 90, refine 3, accuracy 0.4, and jacobian-weight 0.05. Marked image stacks were reformatted in CMTK to align with its respective reference stack and ΔF/F images were calculated. The resulting ΔF/F image stacks were cropped to remove sub-pallium regions where excitation light was scattered by pigmentation in the eyes of the zebrafish, and brain tissue with rsCaMPARI expression was selected by a 0.25 ΔF/F threshold.

We observed that the off-switching rate contrast was dependent on the wavelength of blue light used and that using lower wavelengths resulted in better off-switching rate contrast (~10 fold at 500 nm to ~25 fold at 450 nm) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8a–c</xref>). However, when exposed to wavelengths &lt; 470 nm, rsCaMPARI never reached the fully off-switched state and instead settled at an intermediate level of fluorescence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8b</xref>). We attributed this behavior to spectral overlap of the switching light with the broad 392 nm peak that drives rsCaMPARI on-switching. Indeed, when starting from the fully off-switched state, 450–470 nm light on-switches the protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8d</xref>). Therefore, the observed intermediate resting fluorescence is due to 450–470 nm light driving both on- and off-switching to achieve an intermediate equilibrium state. For the marking light, we recommend that wavelengths between 470 nm and 490 nm should be used with rsCaMPARI to maintain high off-switching rate contrast while avoiding on-switching, and light that falls outside these wavelengths should be filtered out. The light source wavelengths should be verified, and it may be helpful to optimize light sources as we demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>.</p><p>The marking light intensity and duration is dependent on experimental parameters, which include how long the behavior of interest occurs and the level of underlying calcium activity. For rapid photoswitching, a bright light source is required. The photoswitching rate is linear with respect to light intensity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>), therefore the light intensity may be adjusted to match the desired light duration. Generating a photoswitching curve, for example see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8b</xref>, may be helpful for determining the appropriate light intensity and duration using a particular light source. In this work, we have successfully used marking light intensities from ~200 to 400 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> over a duration of 10–20 s to image calcium activity in neuron culture and larval zebrafish brain. Erasing light requirements are less stringent, because the erasing light does not need to coincide with the behavior of interest and on-switching is much more efficient than off-switching. We have successfully used erasing light intensity ~200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> over a duration of a few seconds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Sample handling and imaging rsCaMPARI signal</title><p>Care should be taken to not expose the sample to spurious and bright light in the blue and violet range, especially between marking light exposure and image acquisition. rsCaMPARI signal is stable in the dark (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and we generally handle samples under dim ambient light conditions. If the sample is exposed to spurious light that compromises the marked signal, the erasable nature of rsCaMPARI allows the tool to be easily reset for another marking cycle. We consider it good practice to initialize rsCaMPARI before each marking cycle with a short exposure of erasing light to ensure the tool is completely reset.</p><p>A key consideration for imaging rsCaMPARI is that the marking light is the same wavelength as the excitation light. For tissue volumes this means that the sample is very sensitive to out-of-plane excitation light and methods such as confocal microscopy are not suitable for imaging rsCaMPARI. We have found success with imaging rsCaMPARI in tissue volumes using light sheet fluorescence microscopy, which has good sectioning capabilities to keep the excitation light in-plane and allows rapid acquisition across the entire tissue volume. The sensitivity of the sample to excitation light also means that initial positioning of the sample within the sample chamber should not rely on rsCaMPARI. A fiducial marker in a separate color channel is ideal for positioning the sample and we have successfully used mRuby3 for this purpose.</p><p>Similar to CaMPARI, rsCaMPARI fluorescence is dependent on calcium (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and should therefore be imaged under uniformly low calcium conditions. For cultured neurons, we imaged in the presence of synaptic blockers to prevent spontaneous activity; and for the zebrafish, we imaged under anesthetized conditions using the sodium channel blocker tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222) to prevent action potential firing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Quantification of rsCaMPARI photoswitching</title><p>To normalize the magnitude of rsCaMPARI fluorescence change with protein expression, the post-marked green intensities must be quantified in relation to a reference image. This may be achieved in a couple ways. The first method is a ΔF/F metric, which normalizes the post-marked intensity change with either the pre-marked green image or an erased green image. For motionless samples, such as neuron culture, acquiring the pre-marked or erased image is relatively simple. The marking light is the same wavelength as the excitation light for green image acquisition, therefore the pre-marked image can be acquired concurrently during the first frame of marking light illumination. The erased image can be acquired after a short exposure to erasing light illumination. For moving samples, such as the zebrafish, acquiring the pre-marked image is more challenging, but the erased image can be easily acquired after the post-marked image acquisition while the sample is still immobilized on the imaging stage. The second method uses a separate channel to image a fiducial marker that is fused to rsCaMPARI. We demonstrated this method using mRuby3 in neuron culture (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) and showed there is good correlation between mRuby3 normalization and ΔF/F (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>). The choice of either method depends on experimental need and has certain advantages and disadvantages. For example, ΔF/F requires only a single-color channel, but may be more difficult to register due to separation in time between each image acquisition. A fiducial marker like mRuby3 can be acquired concurrently with rsCaMPARI, but may not correlate well with rsCaMPARI in a particular experimental system, such as the rapidly developing larval zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Janelia Experimental Technology (jET), Media Prep, Molecular Biology, Viral Tools, Vivarium, and Light Microscopy cores.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Amy E Palmer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Zha and colleagues introduce a new reversibly switchable calcium sensor, rsCAMPARI, that can be used to repetitively mark active neurons in vitro and in vivo. Calcium binding to the probe accelerates its dimming in response to blue light, identifying neurons that were active during the time of illumination, and violet light resets the probe for additional measurements. A major potential advantage of this probe over existing methods is that it may allow large-scale mapping of neural circuits in the same animal over time, enabling comparisons of variations of neural circuitry or response patterns within a single or among multiple individuals. The properties of rsCAMPARI are well-suited to delineate active neuronal networks; its response is graded with activity, the marked state is stable enough to permit delayed microscopic analysis up to an hour after marking, and the probe can distinguish activated neurons over 10 cycles. The authors illustrate its practical application in primary neuronal cultures upon field stimulation and in freely-swimming zebrafish exposed to warm and cold water.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers were impressed with the innovative design of rsCAMPARI and the quality of the results, and agreed that it is potentially a powerful tool, particularly for tracking spatial patterns of activity over multiple trials in freely behaving animals. However, they noted several essential issues that will need to be addressed, as detailed below. Given the difficulty of conducting lab experiments during the current pandemic, the number of required new experiments has been held to a minimum, and most of the changes can be made through revisions to the text.</p><p>1) A major concern is the lack of evidence showing that rsCAMPARI will enable live-animal studies that could not be carried out with existing tools. This bears on the significance and utility of rsCAMPARI and is mentioned only briefly in the Introduction and Discussion (first paragraph). To make the rationale for its use clearer for a broader audience, the limitations of current methods need to be described more fully with citations in the Introduction and/or Discussion. It will also be important to discuss the particular kinds of questions to which rsCAMPARI could be applied, to underscore the potential power of this new tool. Without stronger support, the last sentence of the Discussion (&quot;…we expect it will enable functional circuit marking and mapping with higher accuracy than previously possible.&quot;) sounds more like a hope than a likely outcome.</p><p>2) A more complete description of rsCAMPARI performance and technical limitations is needed, particularly in comparison to existing probes. A small and variable number of neurons appear active in the experiment of Figure 3D, and the question is whether the low number and high variability is a natural result of the biology or of the limited S/N properties of the probe. The reviewers suggest comparing the response of rsCAMPARI with that of GCaMP (or CAMPARI) in immobilized zebrafish subjected to cold/warm water. Does rsCAMPARI indicate all cells that fire? This was seen as a critical issue that would affect the choice of indicator for a variety of experiments and would determine whether rsCAMPARI is suitable for reconstructing a complete neuronal circuit.</p><p>3) A more systematic discussion is needed of the experimental parameters (marking time, observation window, illumination intensity) that define the usability window of rsCAMPARI. What factors led to the choice of 10 s marking time? Would the probe be useful for much shorter or longer integration times, and what considerations would affect this? How should the combination of illumination intensity and marking time be optimized?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57249.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers were impressed with the innovative design of rsCAMPARI and the quality of the results, and agreed that it is potentially a powerful tool, particularly for tracking spatial patterns of activity over multiple trials in freely behaving animals.

Additionally, responses in primary neuron cultures to controlled stimuli like those presented in panel 2B can also be quantitively compared between rsCaMPARI and other sensors. We believe that this is the best way for potential users to determine how rsCaMPARI may perform in their system relative to more familiar tools.</p><p>in vivo comparison of different tools is difficult, but we have added Figure 3—figure supplement 2 showing a visual comparison of rsCaMPARI and CaMPARI responses to several stimuli in transgenic larval zebrafish. There are spatial patterns of activity observed across the brain with rsCaMPARI that are generally similar to those observed with CaMPARI, but some differences exist due to differences in transgene expression patterns in these different transgenic animals, differences in the way the signal is marked (blue vs. violet light) and processed (comparison of marked and erased rsCaMPARI images vs. a single image of CaMPARI red or red/green), and variability from animal to animal and trial to trial that result from the animals current brain state and exactly how they experience the stimulus in a freely swimming behavioral setup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A more systematic discussion is needed of the experimental parameters (marking time, observation window, illumination intensity) that define the usability window of rsCAMPARI.

Generally, it is possible to mark the signal over shorter or longer times by using brighter or dimmer photoswitching light, respectively. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 9, photoswitching rate is linearly related to light intensity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
