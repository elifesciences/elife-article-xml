Recent studies identify <italic>PLS3</italic> as a novel bone regulator and <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations can lead to a rare monogenic early-onset osteoporosis. However, the mechanism of <italic>PLS3</italic> mutation leading to osteoporosis is unknown, and its effective treatment strategies have not been established. Here, we have constructed a novel rat model with clinically relevant hemizygous E10-16del mutation in <italic>PLS3</italic> (<italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic>) that recapitulates the osteoporotic phenotypes with obviously thinner cortical thickness, significant decreases in yield load, maximum load, and breaking load of femora at 3, 6, 9 months old compared to wild-type rats. Histomorphometric analysis indicates a significantly lower mineral apposition rate in <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats. Treatment with alendronate (1.0 µg/kg/day) or teriparatide (40 µg/kg five times weekly) for 8 weeks significantly improves bone mass and bone microarchitecture, and bone strength is significantly increased after teriparatide treatment (p＜0.05). Thus, our results indicate that <italic>PLS3</italic> plays an important role in the regulation of bone microstructure and bone strength, and we provide a novel animal model for the study of X-linked early-onset osteoporosis. Alendronate and teriparatide treatment could be a potential treatment for early-onset osteoporosis induced by <italic>PLS3</italic> mutation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>a novel rat model with PLS3 mutation</kwd><kwd>early-onset osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>alendronate</kwd><kwd>teriparatide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0800801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019018</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-C&amp;T-B-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No.81873668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7202153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3332022102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2501704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019018</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Initiative for Innovative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-1-051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82070908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Impaired bone microstructure and bone strength are prominent characteristics of rats with hemizygous E10-16del mutation in PLS3, and treatment with alendronate or teriparatide can improve bone mineral density and bone microstructure of this novel rat model with PLS3-related early-onset osteoporosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disorder and is characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), bone microarchitecture deterioration, and increased predisposition for bone fractures. Osteoporosis is usually regarded as an aging-related disease, however, idiopathic osteoporosis has also emerged in children and adolescents, which refers to significantly lower-than-expected bone mass manifesting in childhood with no identifiable etiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mäkitie and Zillikens, 2022</xref>). Recently, genetic variations have been found to be closely associated with diversities of BMD, fracture risk, and effects of anti-osteoporotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ralston and Uitterlinden, 2010</xref>). A series of studies identify multiple heritable genetic variants that lead to early-onset osteoporosis (EOOP).</p><p>In 2013, a new kind of severe EOOP was first described, which was caused by mutations in <italic>PLS3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dijk et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>PLS3</italic> (OMIM 300131) has 16 exons and spans approximately 90 kb, which is located on Xq23 and encodes a highly conserved protein plastin 3 (PLS3). PLS3 belongs to a family of actin-binding proteins, which is ubiquitously expressed in solid tissues and involved in the binding and bundling of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton, thus partaking in various cellular functions, such as cell migration and adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wolff et al., 2021</xref>). In bone, PLS3 is proposed to regulate cytoskeletal actin bundling, osteocyte function and their mechanosensory apparatus, osteoclast function, and bone matrix mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pathak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wolff et al., 2021</xref>). A series of pedigree studies demonstrated that variants in <italic>PLS3</italic> led to significantly reduced BMD and early-onset recurrent fragility fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costantini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fahiminiya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kämpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kannu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lv et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dijk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Till now, 29 different mutations in <italic>PLS3</italic> have been reported to induce EOOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brlek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wolff et al., 2021</xref>). Due to its X-chromosomal inheritance, <italic>PLS3</italic>-induced osteoporosis has more severe effects on males than females, although heterozygous carrier females also suffer from EOOP. However, the exact function of PLS3 in bone is still unknown.</p><p>So far, the animal models carrying patient-derived <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations have not been generated, which are valuable to unveil the pathogenesis of this ultra-rare X-linked osteoporosis induced by <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations. A previously reported <italic>PLS3</italic> knock-out (KO) murine model displayed a significant decrease in cortical thickness (Ct.Th) with normal or decreased trabecular number. This model harbored a complete deletion of <italic>PLS3</italic> gene that was different from mutations identified in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neugebauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yorgan et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, effective treatment strategies have not been established in EOOP related to <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations. Few patients with <italic>PLS3</italic>-related EOOP received bisphosphonates or teriparatide (TPTD) treatment, while the efficacy was variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fratzl-Zelman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lv et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Välimäki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dijk et al., 2013</xref>). To explore the potential pathogenesis and treatment strategies of <italic>PLS3</italic>-related EOOP, we independently constructed a novel rat model with ubiquitous deletion of the exon 10–16 of <italic>PLS3</italic> (<italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic>), which recapitulated a patient-specific mutation of exon 10–16 deletion in <italic>PLS3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lv et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, similar to the respective patient, displayed impaired bone strength due to thinner cortical bone, which could be improved by treatment with alendronate (ALN) and TPTD. Compared to the previously reported mice model, the novel rat model had a milder bone phenotype possibly due to the presence of truncated PLS3 variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The rats with hemizygous E10-16del mutation were successfully generated</title><p>A large fragment deletion of exon 10–16 in <italic>PLS3</italic> was introduced into the genome of rats, and a 9626 bp deletion from 84,172 to 93,797 bp (NC_051356.1) was confirmed by genotyping and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). PLS3 antibody used in this study targeted the KO region of PLS3 protein (deleted amino acid region: 331–630). Therefore, using western blotting of equivalent amounts of total proteins from wild-type (WT) and <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, we observed a band of appropriate size for PLS3 (~70 kDa) in membranes of WT rats, which was lacking in membranes of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of femoral sections also unraveled that PLS3 was present in osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts in cortical and trabecular bone of WT rats, while PLS3 was not seen in bone cells of the <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results also indicated that the expression level of <italic>PLS3 E10-16</italic> was extremely low in <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats. However, we found a similar expression level of <italic>PLS3</italic> E1-9 between <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> and WT rats, which indicated a possible presence of truncated PLS3 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Interestingly, although we observed no change in bone mass in <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, impaired bone strength was a prominent feature of this novel rat model, which could be attributed to the following factors. First, cortical wall thickness was significantly decreased in the <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, which was a fundamental structural determinant of bone strength. Second, higher porosity in cortical bone and disorganized collagen fibers in bone played important roles in impairment of bone strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gastaldi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues except hematopoietic cells and is involved in all the processes dependent on filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics. In bone, we also verified that PLS3 was widely expressed in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fahiminiya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamioka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neugebauer et al., 2018</xref>).

However, dysfunction of bone cells in <italic>PLS3</italic> mutant animal models and patients was found in the current and previous studies. Animal studies indicated PLS3 involvement in cytoskeletal actin bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oprea et al., 2008</xref>), thus mediating mechanotransduction in osteocytes and further affecting cellular signal transduction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, though the regulation was not confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pathak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dijk et al., 2013</xref>). Studies on patients’ bone biopsies collectively insinuated a role for PLS3 in bone matrix mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kämpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kannu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laine et al., 2015</xref>).

F-actin-bundling ability or Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity would be disturbed after <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwebach et al., 2020</xref>), which would affect intracellular calcium concentrations that was needed during osteoblasts differentiation and bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, though immunohistochemical staining showed no significant changes in the expressions of Ocn, which was a late osteoblastic differentiation marker but did not represent a degree of bone mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moriishi et al., 2020</xref>), we found an obvious reduction in MAR of trabecular bone, indicating PLS3 was more likely involved in regulating bone mineralization. More recently, experimental findings suggested the regulatory function of PLS3 in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast function through influencing podosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neugebauer et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these observations indicated that dysfunctional F-actin dynamics caused by <italic>PLS3</italic> mutation would lead to abnormal bone metabolism. However, the exact roles of <italic>PLS3</italic> regulating bone cells still needed to be further elucidated. Compared to the previously reported mice model with an entire deletion of <italic>PLS3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neugebauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yorgan et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats had a milder bone phenotype possibly due to the presence of truncated PLS3. PLS3 is comprised of an N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding regulatory domain (RD) followed by a core consisting of two actin-binding domains. F-actin bundling by PLS3 is tightly regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwebach et al., 2020</xref>). Deletion of <italic>PLS3</italic> E10-16 might result in a truncated protein with the RD retained as we detected the presence of PLS3 E1-9 cDNA.

Therefore, <italic>PLS3</italic> mutation could lead to increased osteoclasts differentiation through decreased <italic>PLS3</italic> and <italic>WNT16</italic> expression, which could lead to thin cortical bone. However, serum bone turnover biomarker levels of ALP and β-CTX were normal in this <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats and patients with <italic>PLS3</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balasubramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fahiminiya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kämpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laine et al., 2015</xref>), so more in-depth research on pathogenesis of <italic>PLS3</italic>-related osteoporosis was needed in the future.</p><p>Since patients with <italic>PLS3</italic> mutation presented with low BMD, multiple peripheral fractures, and vertebral compression fractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lv et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mäkitie et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dijk et al., 2013</xref>), it is of great clinical significance to establish an effective treatment regimen for <italic>PLS3</italic>-related osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are still recommended as the first-line antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis. TPTD, a recombinant fragment of human parathyroid hormone (1–34), is an extensively used bone anabolic drug for osteoporosis. It is noticed that the action mechanisms are completely different between antiresorptive and osteoanabolic agents. ALN inhibits osteoclast activity and bone resorption mainly via the mevalonate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cremers et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, TPTD stimulates bone formation by affecting protein kinases, MAP-kinase, phospholipases, as well as the WNT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canalis et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, ALN and TPTD were all effective in increasing BMD and improving bone microstructure of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, which were consistent with their efficacy in patients with PLS3-related EOOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fratzl-Zelman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lv et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Välimäki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">van Dijk et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, TPTD treatment obviously improved the bone mechanical strength of femora and vertebrae of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, consistent with the improvement of bone microstructure of the above sites. However, we did not observe that ALN significantly improved bone biomechanical properties of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, which may be related to the small therapeutic dose and the short treatment time in this study. In another study, treatment with ALN at a dose of 30 µg/kg/day for 12 weeks significantly improved stiffness of a murine model of osteogenesis imperfecta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCarthy et al., 2002</xref>). It is necessary to carry out studies with a larger dose and longer time treatment of ALN to clarify its effects on bone strength of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats.</p><p>Although the precise molecular mechanisms of <italic>PLS3</italic> mutation inducing EOOP needed to be clarified, we confirmed that <italic>PLS3</italic> played critical roles in regulating bone metabolism and maintaining the integrity of bone structure and mechanical properties in this novel <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rat model. Our results demonstrated for the first time that TPTD and ALN were effective to <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, which provided valuable experimental evidence for the treatment of <italic>PLS3</italic>-related EOOP. However, there were a few limitations. Since <italic>PLS3</italic> was widely expressed, we did not conduct enough morphometrical and functional analyses of other tissues and organs of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats. We did not conduct in-depth research on the signal pathways regulating bone metabolism, such as WNT/β-catenin, OPG-RANK-RANKL pathway, and so on in <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, which were helpful to clarify the pathogenesis of this EOOP.</p><p>In conclusion, <italic>PLS3</italic> plays major roles in bone metabolism and bone integrity. Impaired bone microstructure and bone strength were prominent characteristics of rats with hemizygous E10-16del mutation of <italic>PLS3</italic>, though the exact pathogenesis still needs further study. ALN and TPTD treatment can increase BMD and improve the bone microstructure of rats with <italic>PLS3</italic>-related EOOP.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>PLS3</italic> KO rat model and genetic identification</title><p>General <italic>PLS3</italic> KO rat model was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system at the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Peking Union Medical College.

Based on your suggestions, some further experiments were completed. We use DNA sequencing, western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemical staining to verify that a novel rat model with deletion of exons 10-16 in the rat <italic>PLS3</italic> gene was successfully built. The methods were described as follows:</p><p>“Genomic DNA was isolated from tail snips using E.Z.N.A. Tissue DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, US). Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The allele-specific primers were listed in Table 2. Primers P-KO-F/P-KO-R were used to amplify <italic>PLS3</italic> knock-out (KO) allele, and a 554bp PCR production would be generated. Primers P-WT-F/P-WT-R were used to amplify wild-type allele, and a 450bp PCR production would be generated. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 ℃ for 3 min, followed by 38 cycles at 95℃ for 30s, 52-58℃ for 30s, and 72℃ for 1 min. Sanger sequencing of PCR products was further completed.” (Page 14, Line 8-15)</p><p>“Western blot analysis</p><p>In order to confirm the general deletion of PLS3 protein, proteins from bone, muscle, heart, lung, renal, and liver of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> and WT rats were extracted for western blot. Briefly, the tissues were separately homogenized in RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The protein concentration was determined with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein samples (30 ug each) were loaded onto a 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to PVDF membranes. After being blocked with 5% BSA, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody against PLS3 (Cat# ab233104, Abcam, 1:1000) or GAPDH (Cat#ab8245, Abcam, 1:1000 dilution) and washed with TBST three times, which were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody. Finally, the immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.” (Page 14, Line 17-22, Page 15, Line 1-5)</p><p>“Real-time quantitative PCR</p><p>Total RNA was extracted from the tibia of WT and <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats with TRIzol reagent and was reversely transcribed to cDNA using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Kusatsu, Japan). The gene expression levels were quantified by qPCR using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNase H Plus, Takara) on a Viia 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, USA). Primer sequences for RT-qPCR were listed in Table 2. Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT method and normalized to the internal control <italic>GAPDH</italic>.” (Page 15, Line 7-12)</p><p>“Immunohistochemical staining</p><p>Paraffin-embedded femur samples were subjected to immunostaining for PLS3 and osteocalcin (Ocn). Slides were subjected to 0.05% trypsin at 37°C for 30 minutes for antigen retrieval and blocked in 3% hydrogen peroxide and 3% bovine serum albumin. Rabbit anti-PLS3 antibody (Cat#ab23310, Abcam, 1:200 dilution) or anti-Ocn antibody (Cat#ab93876, Abcam, 1:200 dilution) were applied, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO). PLS3 and Ocn expression were visualized using 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin. Ocn-positive area were quantified using Image-J software.” (Page 18, Line 4-12)</p><p>We summarized our findings in the result part as follows:</p><p>“A large fragment deletion of exon 10-16 in <italic>PLS3</italic> was introduced into the genome of rats, and a 9626-bp deletion from 84172 bp to 93797 bp (NC_051356.1) was confirmed by genotyping and Sanger sequencing (Figure 1A, 1B). PLS3 antibody used in this study targeted the knockout region of PLS3 protein (deleted amino acid region: 331-630). Therefore, using western blotting of equivalent amounts of total proteins from wild type (WT) and <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats, we observed a band of appropriate size for PLS3 (~70kDa) in membranes of WT rats, which was lacking in membranes of <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats (Figure 1C). Immunohistochemical staining of femoral sections also unraveled that PLS3 was present in osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts in cortical and trabecular bone of WT rats, while PLS3 was not seen in bone cells of the <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats (Figure 1E). Moreover, qPCR results also indicated that the expression level of <italic>PLS3 E10-16</italic> was extremely low in <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> rats. However, we found a similar expression level of <italic>PLS3</italic> E1-9 between <italic>PLS3<sup>E10-16del/0</sup></italic> and WT rats, which indicated a possible presence of truncated PLS3 variants (Figure 1D). Together, these results indicated that rats with hemizygous E10-16 deletion in <italic>PLS3</italic> were successfully built.” (Page 5, Line 1-14)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have added information about the differences in the bone phenotype between this novel rat model and the previously reported mice model with PLS3 knockout as follows:</p><p>So far, the animal models carrying patient-derived PLS3 mutations have not been generated, which are valuable to unveil the pathogenesis of this ultra-rare X-linked osteoporosis induced by PLS3 mutations. A previously reported PLS3 knock-out (KO) murine model displayed a significant decrease in cortical thickness with normal or decreased trabecular number. This model harbored a complete deletion of PLS3 gene that was different from mutations identified in patients (Neugebauer et al., 2018; Yorgan et al., 2020). Moreover, effective treatment strategies have not been established in EOOP related to PLS3 mutations. Few patients with PLS3-related EOOP received bisphosphonates or teriparatide treatment, while the efficacy was variable (Fratzl-Zelman et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2020; Lv et al., 2017; Valimaki et al., 2017; van Dijk et al., 2013). To explore the potential pathogenesis and treatment strategies of PLS3-related EOOP, we independently constructed a novel rat model with ubiquitous deletion of the exon 10-16 of PLS3 (PLS3E10-16del/0), which recapitulated a patient-specific mutation of exon 10-16 deletion in PLS3 (Lv et al., 2017). We observed that PLS3E10-16del/0 rats, similar to the respective patient, displayed impaired bone strength due to thinner cortical bone, which could be improved by treatment with alendronate and teriparatide. Compared to the previously reported mice model, the novel rat model had a milder bone phenotype possibly due to the presence of truncated PLS3 variants. (Page 4, Line 5-21)</p><p>Also, we discussed the differences in the discussion part as follows:</p><p>Compared to the previously reported mice model with an entire deletion of PLS3 (Neugebauer et al., 2018; Yorgan et al., 2020), PLS3E10-16del/0 rats had a milder bone phenotype possibly due to the presence of truncated PLS3. PLS3 is comprised of an N-terminal Ca2+-binding regulatory domain (RD) followed by a core consisting of two actin-binding domains. F-actin bundling by PLS3 is tightly regulated by Ca2+ binding to RD (Schwebach et al., 2020). Deletion of PLS3 E10-16 might result in a truncated protein with the regulatory domain retained as we detected the presence of PLS3 E1-9 cDNA. However, further studies are needed to verify the findings and explore the functional roles of different domains in bone regulation. (Page 10, Line 19-23.

We have added more information about the extra-skeletal phenotypes of PLS3E10-16del/0 rats and the life expectance were similar between the two groups. The additional experiments and related description were shown as follows:</p><p>Measurement of bone metabolic markers and metabolic parameters</p><p>Under abdominal anesthesia, blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture. Concentrations of serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, a bone formation marker) were measured by an automated chemistry analyzer (AU5800, Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea CA, USA). Serum level of C-telopeptide of type Ⅰ collagen (β-CTX, bone resorption marker) was measured by ELISA (Cat# CSB-E12776r, Cusabio Biotech Co., Wuhan, China). To determine whether PLS3 knock-out affected other metabolism, we measured the levels of serum Glu, TC, LDL, and TG using the automated chemistry analyzer. (Page 17, Line 4-5)</p><p>We described our findings as follows:</p><p>Moreover, the life span of WT and PLS3E10-16del/0 rats were similar and no rats died during the experimental period. There were also no statistical differences in body weight change between WT and PLS3E10-16del/0 rats during the whole experimental period (Figure 1- figure supplement 1). (Page 5, Line 18-21)</p><p>We also investigated the parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism and found similar levels of serum glucose (Glu), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) between PLS3E10-16del/0 rats and WT at all ages (Figure 2-figure supplement 3D). Besides, PLS3 mutations were reported to have patent ductus arteriosus (Qiu, Li, Zhang, &amp; Liu, 2022). However, no obvious abnormalities were found in ultrasonic cardiogram and hematein eosin (HE)-staining about the cardiac structure and function of PLS3E10-16del/0 rats.

PLS3E10-16del/0 rats displayed thinner cortical bone, which was a fundamental structural determinant of bone strength. In order to figure out more reason of impaired strength in femur and lumbar spine of PLS3E10-16del/0 rats, we also used qPCR to detect the expression of COL1A1, use picrosirius red staining to evaluate the content of collagen of bone tissue under polarized microscopy.</p><p>The methods of additional experiments are described as follows:</p><p>Bone slices were also subjected to the picrosirius red (PS) staining for the evaluation of the organization of collagen fibers through polarized light microscopy (Axio Imager D2, Zeiss, Germany).

The expression of COL1A1 in tibia were also similar between two groups. However, compared to WT rats, the cortical bone was more porous and the collagen fibers of PLS3E10-16del/0 rats were relatively disorganized (Figure 2H). (Page 7, Line 5-9).</p><p>We discussed the findings in our discussion part as follows:</p><p>Interestingly, although we observed no change in bone mass in PLS3E10-16del/0 rats, impaired bone strength was a prominent feature of this novel rat model, which could be attributed to the following factors. First, cortical wall thickness was significantly decreased in the PLS3E10-16del/0 rats, which was a fundamental structural determinant of bone strength. Second, higher porosity in cortical bone and disorganized collagen fibers in bone played important roles in impairment of bone strength(Gastaldi et al., 2020).
