Identifying radiotherapy-related biomarkers is crucial for improving patient survival outcomes. This study developed the nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy sensitivity score (NPC-RSS) to predict radiotherapy response. By evaluating 113 machine learning algorithm combinations, the glmBoost+NaiveBayes model was selected to construct the NPC-RSS based on 18 key genes, which demonstrated good predictive performance in both public and in-house datasets. The study found that NPC-RSS is closely associated with immune features, including chemokine factors and their receptor families and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Gene functional analysis revealed that NPC-RSS influences key signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and T cell receptors. Cell line validation confirmed that SMARCA2 and CD9 gene expression is consistent with NPC-RSS. Single-cell analysis revealed that the radiotherapy-sensitive group exhibited richer immune infiltration and activation states. NPC-RSS can serve as a predictive tool for radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC, offering new insights for precise screening of patients who may benefit from radiotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multi-gene signature</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003453</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021A1515012593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>The National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82172811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022A1515111212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010256</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou City</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023A04J1257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A machine learning-derived multi-gene score effectively predicts radiation sensitivity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by integrating immune characteristics and radiosensitivity-related pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which originates from the nasopharyngeal mucosal epithelium, is a malignant tumor with distinct epidemiological, histopathological, clinical, and therapeutic features among head and neck tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferlay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei and Sham, 2005</xref>). According to the most recent global cancer statistics, a total of 133,354 new cases of nasopharyngeal cancer were reported, accounting for only 0.7% of all new cancer cases that year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Although the incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer is relatively low compared with other cancer types, it has a unique geographic distribution. About 70% of new nasopharyngeal cancer cases occur in Eastern and Southeastern Asia, while the rest are mainly in South-Central Asia, North Africa, and East Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, radiotherapy is used as the primary curative treatment for patients with NPC. With the continuous advancement of radiotherapy technology, recent studies have shown that hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy increases the 3-year overall survival rate in these patients from 55.0% to 74.6% compared to conventional fractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">You et al., 2023</xref>). However, approximately 20–30% of patients experience locoregional recurrence of the tumor due to radiation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma and Chan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agulnik and Epstein, 2008</xref>). Studies have shown that radiotherapy resistance is the main reason for treatment failure in nasopharyngeal cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Linkous and Yazlovitskaya, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ribassin-Majed et al., 2017</xref>). Given the importance of radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal cancer treatment, it is imperative to investigate the molecular mechanisms of radiotherapy resistance and develop strategies to enhance the radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal cancer cells.</p><p>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deeply integrated into the medical field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khan, 2023</xref>). Machine learning (ML), an important branch of AI, has the ability to process nonlinear data, discover new patterns, and generate predictive models after learning from existing data. Machine learning plays a crucial role in developing predictive markers for tumor treatment and prognosis. Recent studies have focused on utilizing machine learning techniques to construct predictive models for these purposes. These studies employ various methods and algorithms, including integrated learning, immune-derived feature extraction, and AI network-guided signatures. For instance, one study utilized machine learning through tumor MR image feature mapping for patient stratification in adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Teng et al., 2023</xref>). Another study employed machine learning based on MRI/DWI radiomics signatures to predict the prognosis of NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, machine learning-based algorithms have been developed to create predictive models for identifying lncRNAs associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, aiming to improve prognosis and immunotherapy response in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). These studies aim to enhance patient outcomes and prognosis while providing superior predictive power for personalized clinical treatment strategies. However, there is still a lack of machine learning-based biomarkers for predicting radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC.</p><p>In this study, a combination of multiple machine learning methods and transcriptomic data from nasopharyngeal cancer patients was used to construct a biomarker that can predict the sensitivity to radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal cancer patients, termed the Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiosensitivity Score (NPC-RSS). In addition, we explored the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between NPC-RSS and radiotherapy response in nasopharyngeal cancer patients. We anticipate that the construction of NPC-RSS will guide the selection of radiotherapy strategies for NPC patients, thereby improving the clinical outcomes and prognosis of these patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of the NPC-RSS model</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 48 models were successfully constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) of each model was calculated in both the training and validation sets.

Among these, 22,796 cells were derived from the radiotherapy-sensitive group, and 6161 cells were from the radiotherapy-resistant group. Unsupervised clustering was performed on the 28,957 cells obtained from sequencing to identify cell subpopulations based on the similarity of their gene expression profiles. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, 17 cell subpopulations were identified through clustering. By examining the expression profiles of cell-type-specific marker genes, we determined that these 17 cell subpopulations belonged to seven distinct cell types: T cells, myeloid cells, B cells, epithelial cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts, and mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Biological characterization of key NPC-RSS genes at the single-cell level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clustered UMAP plot of three radiotherapy-sensitive and one radiotherapy-resistant sample with a total of 28,957 cells (n=4).

Radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality for NPC; however, treatment failure occurs in approximately 20–30% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chua et al., 2016</xref>). Radiotherapy sensitivity is a crucial factor influencing treatment outcomes in NPC patients. Thus, it is imperative to comprehensively investigate the mechanisms underlying radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC and identify effective therapeutic targets. Such investigations will facilitate the elucidation of therapeutic resistance mechanisms and provide a foundation for personalized treatment strategies. In the present study, we developed an integrative approach to establish a consistent nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy sensitivity signature (NPC-RSS) using NPC samples obtained from Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In summary, we fitted 113 models to the training dataset using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) framework. Further validation using the independent dataset GSE32389 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database demonstrated that the glmBoost + NaiveBayes model exhibited the best performance.</p><p>The integrated procedure’s advantage lies in its utilization of various machine learning algorithms and their combinations to fit models for NPC radiotherapy sensitivity, achieving a consensus performance. Furthermore, the combination of algorithms can reduce the dimensionality of the variables, resulting in a more simplified and easily translatable model. The predictive validity of NPC-RSS has been further validated using NPC cell lines generated at our local center. Moreover, we performed a related validation on local single-cell data, which revealed that the radiotherapy-sensitive group exhibited a significant predominance of immune cells, whereas the radiotherapy-resistant group primarily comprised malignant epithelial and stromal cells.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the core genes of NPC-RSS, including SMARCA2, DMC1, CD9, PSG4, and KNG1, are associated with tumor radiosensitization to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zernickel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erovic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jennrich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2018a</xref>). The protein encoded by the SMARCA2 gene plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cytokine response, DNA repair, regulation of cell proliferation, lineage specification and development, and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dykhuizen et al., 2013</xref>). These processes are intimately linked to the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. Cell proliferation and DNA repair are critical determinants of tumor cell response to radiotherapy, and the involvement of SMARCA2 may influence this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toulany et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hadjipanayis and DeLuca, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, SMARCA2 is implicated in processes such as cell adhesion and cytokine response, which are tightly coupled to the interactions of tumor cells within the microenvironment. Cell adhesion influences the low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity of a broad spectrum of tumor cells, potentially further modulating their sensitivity to radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathur et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Radiation is capable of inducing DNA double-strand breaks, and cells must repair this damage through DNA repair mechanisms to maintain genomic stability. DMC1, a key factor in homologous recombination, is involved in the repair process of DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, abnormal function or altered expression levels of DMC1 may influence cellular sensitivity to radiation and, consequently, the efficacy of radiation therapy. CD9 is believed to play a role in various stages of cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murayama et al., 2015</xref>). As a cell surface protein, CD9 is involved in regulating cell-cell adhesion and interactions, which may affect the response of tumor cells to radiation therapy. Moreover, CD9 may impact tumor sensitivity to radiation therapy by modulating the metastatic and invasive properties of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hori et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rappa et al., 2015</xref>). It has been shown that all human PSGs initiate TGF-β1. In vivo, PSGs may increase the availability of active TGF-β1 in both soluble and matrix-bound forms of this potential cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, TGF-β1 levels accurately predict radiosensitization in elderly patients with unresectable NSCLC undergoing 3D-CRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) may influence radiosensitivity by regulating transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) activity. In radiation therapy, radiation can induce an inflammatory response in tissues and affect angiogenesis. Kininogen-1 (KNG1), a factor associated with coagulation and inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah-Soheimi et al., 2010</xref>), may play a regulatory role in radiosensitivity and the effects of radiation therapy. Furthermore, we found that the core genes of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiosensitivity signature (NPC-RSS), namely SMARCA2, DMC1, CD9, PSG4, and KNG1, had significant correlations with previously published genes related to radiosensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The roles of these genes in regulating radiosensitization further support the importance and reliability of the NPC-RSS developed in this study for predicting radiosensitization in NPC.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that SMARCA2 has a significant effect on the responsiveness to radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, and its depletion can increase the sensitivity to radiotherapy, suggesting that SMARCA2 may be a potential therapeutic target for sensitization to radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zernickel et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the DMC1 gene was used in the construction of the radiosensitivity index (RSI) to assess the sensitivity and prognosis of radiotherapy, especially in endometrial cancer providing an important perspective on the DNA damage repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2024</xref>). For CD9, its study in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) revealed that the increase of CD9 and CD81 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) after radiotherapy was closely related to the cytotoxic response after treatment, which provided a new biomarker for radiotherapy monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jennrich et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, the relationship between PSG4 and KNG1 and radiotherapy resistance has not been reported. In the future, the expression pattern of SMARCA2 in NPC patients and its relationship with the effect of radiotherapy can be analyzed by clinical samples to determine its potential as a therapeutic target for sensitization to radiotherapy. For DMC1, studying the correlation between its expression level and radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC may be helpful in predicting the efficacy and adjusting the treatment regimen. Meanwhile, by analyzing EVs, especially CD9-containing vesicles, in NPC patients after radiotherapy, we assessed its feasibility as a biomarker to monitor radiotherapy response. These studies not only contribute to an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of these genes in NPC radiotherapy, but may also open up new strategies to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy.</p><p>Radiotherapy plays a pivotal role in cancer treatment, and there is growing evidence of the potential for synergistic effects between radiation therapy and components of the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ngwa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binder et al., 2015</xref>). However, there are limited data depicting the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) associated with radiotherapy sensitivity. Indeed, recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that irradiated tumors can act as adjuvants to the immune system, promoting local tumor control and inducing regression of distant tumor deposits through abscopal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ngwa et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to potential systemic effects, radiation significantly alters the distribution of tumor antigens, recruits anti-tumor T cells, and induces a distinct inflammatory microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demaria et al., 2021</xref>). Some studies have shown that tumors with high immune cell infiltration are more sensitive to radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grass et al., 2022</xref>); however, the relationship between radiation and immune response remains complex and context-dependent, and the optimal approach to integrating radiation and immunotherapy remains uncertain.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that over one-third of tumor types in the radiotherapy-sensitive group of solid tumors exhibit an enrichment of CD8 + T cells, M1 macrophages, and NK + cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grass et al., 2022</xref>). To further investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed the immune infiltration between different subgroups of NPC-RSS and annotated the key NPC-RSS genes with immune-related features. The results demonstrated that the NPC radiosensitized group exhibited a higher level of immune infiltration and immune initiation, characterized by a greater abundance of activated NK cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and follicular helper T cells. The NPC-RSS key genes also exhibited a significant correlation and synergism with immune-related features. Notably, this synergistic correlation was most prominent in chemokines and chemokine receptor families, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), immune cell interactions, and signaling pathways. These findings suggest that the radiosensitivity estimated by the NPC-RSS may be associated with a distinct tumor immune microenvironment, which could potentially be exploited through a combinatorial immunotherapy approach.</p><p>Notably, the results obtained from the collected single-cell data were consistent with the predicted trends of our constructed model. The radiotherapy-sensitive group exhibited a significant predominance of immune cells, while the radiotherapy-resistant group primarily comprised malignant epithelial and stromal cells. Furthermore, utilizing NPC-RSS to calculate the radiotherapy sensitivity score for each cell revealed that the predicted scores of cells in the sensitized group were significantly higher than those in the resistant group, particularly in epithelial cells, myeloid cells, fibroblasts, and mast cells. This finding suggests that the presence of immune cells might have influenced the tumor’s responsiveness to treatment to some extent prior to radiation therapy. Tumors with a predominance of immune cells may be more likely to exhibit a positive response to radiation therapy, either due to the involvement of immune cells in tumor surveillance and clearance or because the responsiveness of tumors to radiation therapy is modulated by immune cells.</p><p>Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may be associated with the radiosensitivity of NPC. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that the differential expression levels of SMARCA2, DMC1, CD9, PSG4, and KNG1 in the core of the NPC radiosensitivity signature (NPC-RSS) might influence various signaling pathways associated with disease progression, involving multiple biological processes such as DNA damage repair, cell death, immune regulation, cell proliferation, metabolism, tumor microenvironment regulation, and cell survival. For instance, the SMARCA2 high-expression group, which was the most significant, was enriched in the UV response, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, NOTCH signaling pathway, TGFβ signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, Interferon Alpha response, Interferon Gamma response, and other signaling pathways. Previous studies have demonstrated that proteins related to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (DKK-3, β-catenin, and c-MYC) are involved in the development of NPC, and that knockdown of FOXO3a promotes radioresistance in NPC through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that SMARCA2 may regulate the radiosensitivity of NPC via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</p><p>Incorporating the NPC-RSS scoring system into clinical decision-making and patient management involves several key steps: first, making genetic testing a standard part of nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosis and ensuring that physicians have timely access to scoring results to guide treatment planning. Second, physicians need to use the scoring results to customize individualized treatment plans and discuss them in a multidisciplinary team to optimize decision-making. At the same time, physicians should explain the clinical significance of the scores in detail and communicate effectively with patients to achieve shared decision-making. In addition, continuously monitoring the relationship between scoring and treatment outcomes, optimizing the scoring model based on actual data, and ensuring the integration of technology platforms and regulatory compliance are essential to safeguard the effective operation of the scoring system and the security of patient information.</p><p>The novelty of this study lies in the utilization of NPC expression data collected from Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, combined with multiple machine learning models, to develop NPC-RSS, a tool capable of effectively identifying the patient population more sensitive to radiotherapy. The tool was validated using single-cell data and cell lines from the in-house cohort, with the validation results aligning with the predictions of our constructed model. However, this study has several limitations. First, this study focuses on specific types of NPC, and thus may not be directly generalizable to other subtypes or related head and neck cancers. Second, the sample size of the dataset is small, which may affect the generalization and extrapolation ability of the model. To minimize the impact of the small sample size, we used advanced statistical techniques, such as cross-validation, to enhance the stability and credibility of the results. Nonetheless, we realize that larger datasets are necessary, so we are collaborating with other research centers to expand our sample size to make our findings more robust and widely applicable. Further, while our study relies on bioinformatics methods to identify and analyze key genes, the lack of direct experimental validation of function is a glaring deficiency. We are currently seeking additional funding support and plan to collaborate with laboratories to conduct the necessary functional validation experiments, which will help to further confirm the specific role of these genes in radiotherapy. In addition, we recognize that there may be a risk of overfitting when using machine learning algorithms to process biomedical data. For this reason, we not only implemented regularization techniques during the model development stage, but also adopted a rigorous cross-validation strategy during model validation. These measures help ensure that our models maintain good predictive performance on unseen data.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our study provides new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of radiotherapy sensitivity and points to possible directions for future research. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, performing experimental validation, and further optimizing our predictive model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>NPC patient data sources and data processing</title><p>We downloaded chemotherapy-related gene expression data from the GEO database for 20 NPC patients (GSE32389).

The raw gene expression matrices for each sample, generated by the CellRanger software, were merged in R and converted to Seurat objects for downstream analysis using the Seurat R package. Subsequently, cells with the following characteristics were removed: (1) number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) less than 201, (2) fewer than 100 or more than 6000 expressed genes (potential cellular duplicates), and (3) percentage of mitochondrial genes greater than 20%. Additionally, genes expressed in fewer than three cells were removed from the dataset. After quality control, 28,957 high-quality NPC cells were retained for further analysis. Subsequently, the gene expression matrix was normalized to the total cell reads and mitochondrial reads using linear regression with Seurat’s RegressOut function. Following data normalization, highly variable genes were identified across all individual cells while controlling for the relationship between mean expression and dispersion. Prior to the joint analysis of the four-sample scRNA-seq dataset, we employed the R package Harmony to mitigate batch effects and minimize their impact on downstream analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we utilized Seurat’s ‘CellCycleScoring’ function to identify the expression of cell cycle-related genes across various cell subpopulations. We employed a previously defined core set of 43 G1/S and 54 G2/M cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>). Cells were categorized based on the maximum average expression (‘cycle score’) across both gene sets. Following cell cycle analysis, no bias attributable to cell cycle genes was observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell clustering analysis and identification of marker genes for cellular subpopulations</title><p>Normalization, clustering, differential gene expression analysis, and visualization were performed using the Seurat 3.1 R package. To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the 2000 variably expressed genes. The top 20 principal components were then used as input for the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, which was run using the default settings of the RunTSNE function in Seurat. Cell clustering was performed using the 'FindClusters' function in Seurat with a resolution of 0.3, resulting in the identification of 17 distinct cell clusters (clusters 0–16). Subsequently, the FindMarkers function was employed to identify specific marker genes for each cell subpopulation. The process was conducted as follows: (1) DEGs for each cell subpopulation were identified by comparing the cells of that subpopulation to all other cells using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; (2) Bonferroni-corrected p-values less than 0.05 were used as the cut-off for determining statistically significant DEGs; (3) Genes with an average expression level more than twofold higher in a specific cell subpopulation compared to other subpopulations were selected as marker genes. Cell type annotation for each subpopulation was performed based on marker genes reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), the CellMarker database, and the R package 'SingleR' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>GSVA and GSEA analysis of NPC-RSS key genes</title><p>GSVA and GSEA analysis of key NPC-RSS genes Based on the expression levels of key NPC-RSS genes, we stratified the patients into high and low expression groups and thoroughly investigated the signaling pathway differences between these groups using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We utilized the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets as the annotated gene sets for the subtype pathways to conduct differential expression analysis between subtypes. Gene consistency was assessed using a concordance score calculated by sorting the genes according to their LogFC (adjusted p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, to investigate the association of NPC-RSS with known radiosensitivity-related genes, we searched for ‘Radiosensitivity’ in the GeneCards database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.genecards.org/">https://www.genecards.org/</ext-link>) to obtain radiosensitization-related genes and examined the expression levels of the top 20 genes based on their Relevance scores and their correlation with the top-5 genes in NPC-RSS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The differentially expressed genes between NPCs of the sensitive and resistant groups in the dataset were identified using the R package ‘limma’. For normally distributed variables, statistical differences between two groups were determined by two-tailed t-test, while one-way ANOVA was used for multiple group comparisons. For non-normally distributed variables, statistical differences between two groups were determined by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple group comparisons. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.1.2). Each experiment was performed independently in triplicate unless otherwise specified. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was employed to assess the correlation between two variables.</p><p>In the single-cell sequencing data processing section, comparisons between two groups were performed using the unpaired two-tailed t-test (implemented in the R package limma) or the Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical analyses and graph visualizations were conducted using the R programming language.</p><p>For all experiments, samples from the same patient were processed in parallel. Cells from each patient sample were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (10 x Genomics) simultaneously but in different passages and vials. Boxplots were generated using the R base software package with default parameters. The boxes span the interquartile range (IQR; from the 25th to the 75th percentile), with the center line representing the median. The lower whiskers extend to the smallest value no further than 1.5×IQR from the 25th percentile. The upper whiskers extend to the largest value no further than 1.5×IQR from the 75th percentile. Due to the large number of data points represented in the box-and-whisker plots, individual data points were not shown to maintain clarity in the overall distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we developed a robust NPC-RSS using multiple bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms. The expression of key genes SMARCA2, DMC1, CD9, and KNG1 was validated to be consistent with the NPC-RSS in our in-house cell lines. Compared to the resistant group, the sensitive group classified by NPC-RSS exhibited a more abundant and active state of immune infiltration. Furthermore, in single-cell samples, NPC-RSS was elevated in the radiotherapy-sensitive group, where immune cells played a predominant role. Additional analysis uncovered substantial correlations between key NPC-RSS genes and genes previously demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of radiosensitization. Single-gene pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the top 2 NPC-RSS genes were associated with several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and T cell receptor signaling pathway. These pathways may influence the immune microenvironment of NPC, thereby affecting its susceptibility to radiotherapy. Our findings provide a novel perspective for understanding NPC radiosensitivity.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study analyzed publicly available human data from the GEO database (GSE32389).

We further acknowledge the necessity for larger and more diverse datasets to enhance model validity and generalizability, a concern we intend to address in our future research endeavors. The revised manuscript includes an expanded discussion on these critical points.</p><p>Here is the limitation section in the revised Manuscript:</p><p>“This study primarily focuses on specific subtypes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), potentially limiting its direct generalizability to other NPC subtypes or related head and neck malignancies. Furthermore, the limited sample size of our dataset may impact the model's generalizability and extrapolation capabilities. To mitigate the potential limitations associated with the small sample size, we employed advanced statistical methodologies, including cross-validation, to enhance the robustness and reliability of our findings. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the necessity for larger datasets and are actively collaborating with other research institutions to expand our sample size, thereby enhancing the robustness and broader applicability of our findings. Additionally, while our study utilizes bioinformatics approaches to identify and analyze key genes, we recognize that the absence of direct experimental functional validation represents a significant limitation. To address this limitation, we are actively pursuing additional funding and establishing collaborations with specialized laboratories to conduct crucial functional validation experiments, which will further elucidate the specific roles of these genes in radiotherapy response. Moreover, we acknowledge the potential risk of overfitting inherent in the application of machine learning algorithms to biomedical data analysis. To mitigate this risk, we implemented regularization techniques during model development and adopted a rigorous cross-validation strategy for model validation. These methodological approaches aim to ensure that our models maintain robust predictive performance on unseen data. Notwithstanding these limitations, our study offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC and indicates promising avenues for future investigation. Future research endeavors will prioritize expanding the dataset, conducting comprehensive experimental validation, and refining our predictive model to enhance its accuracy and clinical applicability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The study focuses on a specific type of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and may not be generalizable to other subtypes or related head and neck cancers.

This would help highlight the unique value and potential superiority of the NPC-RSS in predicting radiotherapy sensitivity.</p><p>1. The authors should consider expanding their discussion on the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the association between the key NPC-RSS genes and radiotherapy response. They could explore whether these genes have been previously implicated in radiotherapy resistance in other cancer types and discuss the potential functional roles of these genes in the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) We appreciate your thorough review and valuable suggestions concerning our study. In response to the suggestion of comparing the Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy Sensitivity Score (NPC-RSS) with existing prognostic models or biomarkers, we have carefully considered this proposal and determined that such a comparison is beyond the scope of our current study. The primary focus of our research is on the development and internal validation of the NPC-RSS model's accuracy and reliability. At present, we do not have access to the necessary external data to conduct a valid comparison, and the integration of such data extends beyond the parameters of this study. We intend to incorporate this comparative analysis in future studies to further validate the efficacy and explore the clinical application potential of the NPC-RSS model. We appreciate your understanding and continued support for our research endeavors.(2) In the revised manuscript, we have incorporated a comprehensive review of the functions of these key genes in various cancer types and explored their potential mechanisms of action in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Through the citation of pertinent studies, we have elucidated the impact of these genes on radiotherapy sensitivity and resistance. Furthermore, we have proposed future research directions to elucidate the specific roles of these genes in the radiotherapy response of NPC.</p><p>The following are new additions to the revised draft：</p><p>“Previous studies have demonstrated that SMARCA2 significantly influences the radiotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Depletion of SMARCA2 has been shown to enhance radiosensitivity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for radiosensitization [30478150]. Additionally, the DMC1 gene has been incorporated into the radiosensitivity index (RSI) to evaluate radiotherapy sensitivity and prognosis, particularly in endometrial cancers. This inclusion provides valuable insights into the DNA damage repair process [38628740]. Studies on CD9 in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have revealed that post-radiotherapy increases in CD9 and CD81 levels in extracellular vesicles (EVs) are strongly correlated with the cytotoxic response to treatment. This finding suggests the potential of CD9 as a novel biomarker for monitoring radiotherapy efficacy [36203458]. In contrast, the association of PSG4 and KNG1 with radiotherapy resistance remains unexplored in the current literature.</p><p>Future research should focus on analyzing the expression patterns of SMARCA2 in NPC patients and its correlation with radiotherapy efficacy using clinical samples. This analysis could elucidate its potential as a target for radiosensitization therapy. Investigating the correlation between DMC1 expression levels and radiotherapy sensitivity in NPC could potentially aid in predicting treatment efficacy and optimizing therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, analysis of extracellular vesicles, particularly those containing CD9, in post-radiotherapy NPC patients could assess their feasibility as biomarkers for monitoring treatment response. These proposed studies would not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the role of these genes in NPC radiotherapy but could also potentially lead to the development of novel strategies for enhancing radiotherapy efficacy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Recommendations:</p><p>(1) It is recommended that the author share the code for the article on Github or a similar open source platform.</p><p>(2) The manuscript would benefit from a thorough review of the punctuation and sentence structure to improve readability and clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) You suggest sharing the code utilized in this study on GitHub or a comparable open-source platform to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the research.

In the revised draft, we will include a section that elaborates on the integration of the NPC-RSS scoring system into daily clinical practice, detailing how it can assist physicians in developing individualized treatment plans and optimize patient management by predicting treatment responses.</p><p>The following are new additions to the revised draft:</p><p>“The incorporation of the NPC-RSS scoring system into clinical decision-making and patient management involves several key steps: first, establishing genetic testing as a standard component of nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosis and ensuring that physicians have prompt access to scoring results to guide treatment planning. Second, physicians should utilize the scoring results to tailor individualized treatment plans and engage in multidisciplinary discussions to optimize decision-making. Concurrently, physicians should elucidate the clinical significance of the scores and effectively communicate with patients to facilitate shared decision-making. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of the relationship between scoring and treatment outcomes, optimizing the scoring model based on empirical data, and ensuring the integration of technological platforms along with regulatory compliance are essential for safeguarding the effective operation of the scoring system and the protection of patient information.</p><p>(2) In light of the reviewers' valuable suggestions, we acknowledge the significance of prospective validation of the NPC-RSS scoring system in a broader patient population and the necessity for thorough exploration of the underlying biological mechanisms. Accordingly, we are incorporating a new section in the revised manuscript that elaborates on the limitations of the current study and outlines potential directions for future research. This encompasses plans to increase the sample size for validation and further investigations into the biological basis of the scoring system to enhance its predictive validity and clinical applicability.
