The caRNAs reported to date are transcribed from the nuclear genome. Here, leveraging a recently developed assay for detection of caRNAs and their genomic association, we report that mitochondrial RNAs (mtRNAs) are attached to the nuclear genome and constitute a subset of caRNA, thus termed mt-caRNA. In four human cell types analyzed, mt-caRNAs preferentially attach to promoter regions. In human endothelial cells (ECs), the level of mt-caRNA–promoter attachment changes in response to environmental stress that mimics diabetes. Suppression of a non-coding mt-caRNA in ECs attenuates stress-induced nascent RNA transcription from the nuclear genome, including that of critical genes regulating cell adhesion, and abolishes stress-induced monocyte adhesion, a hallmark of dysfunctional ECs. Finally, we report increased nuclear localization of multiple mtRNAs in the ECs of human diabetic donors, suggesting many mtRNA translocate to the nucleus in a cell stress and disease-dependent manner. These data nominate mt-caRNAs as messenger molecules responsible for mitochondrial–nuclear communication and connect the immediate product of mitochondrial transcription with the transcriptional regulation of the nuclear genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial RNA</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL145170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouman Chen</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM138852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Sheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD107206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Sheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1DK126138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Sheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL106089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Natarajan</surname><given-names>Rama</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ella Fitzgerald Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouman Chen</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007557</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EDU4-12772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapia</surname><given-names>Alonso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA033572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Armstrong</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kruger research grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Sheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial RNAs attach to chromatin and regulate nuclear transcription in endothelial stress response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are key cellular organelles that control energy production, stress response, and cell fate. Mitochondrial fitness is paramount to cellular homeostasis and organismal health, and its dysfunction is a common denominator of numerous diseases ranging from metabolic, cardiovascular, to neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wallace, 2005</xref>). As derivatives of endosymbiotic bacterial ancestors, mitochondria in eukaryotes possess their own circular and double-stranded genome (mtDNA) of 16.5 kb in size. mtDNA is bidirectionally transcribed to produce 13 mRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The mitochondrial genome also produces non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including small RNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), whose functions are yet to be fully characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mercer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rackham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ro et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As a critical hub for cellular processes and signaling pathways, mitochondria coordinate with the nucleus to regulate gene expression and cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quirós et al., 2016</xref>). On the one hand, the nucleus communicates to the mitochondria through anterograde signaling. For example, nucleus-encoded transcription factors (TFs) such as NRF1 and TFAM, co-regulators such as PGC1α, and the RNA polymerase POLRMT regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, mtDNA replication, and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gleyzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Virbasius and Scarpulla, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ojala et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falkenberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kühl et al., 2016</xref>). Nucleus-transcribed non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have also been shown to regulate mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) processing and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vendramin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Puranam and Attardi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, mitochondria can communicate with nucleus through mitochondrial retrograde signaling, typically mediated by reactive oxygen species, ATP, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Stefani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu and Butow, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vizioli et al., 2020</xref>). Mitochondria-derived short peptides have also been shown to regulate nuclear gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reynolds et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) and double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can also be released into the cytoplasm, which turn on an endogenous ‘danger signal’ to trigger a type-I interferon response and innate immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maekawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tigano et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is unclear whether the immediate output of mitochondrial transcription, that is, the mtRNAs, can act as retrograde signaling messengers to communicate directly with the nucleus.</p><p>Several mtRNAs have been detected in the nucleus. Burzio et al. detected <italic>MT-RNR2</italic>-derived sense non-coding mitochondrial RNA (SncmtRNA) in the nucleus of human endothelial cells (ECs) and several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Villegas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burzio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landerer et al., 2011</xref>). Perry et al. identified a small mitochondrial-encoded ncRNA, mito-ncR-805, localized in the nucleus of alveolar epithelial cells, and correlated with the increased expression of nuclear-encoded genes that regulate mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumental-Perry et al., 2020</xref>). Yet to be clarified is whether any nuclear-translocated mtRNA can alter the epigenome, and subsequently impact gene transcription and cellular behavior.</p><p>The chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) form a critical layer of the epigenome that can regulate nuclear transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li and Fu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that caRNAs are not exclusively nuclear genome-produced RNA – they also include mtRNA. The chromatin-associated mtRNAs (mt-caRNAs) preferentially attach to the promoter regions of the nuclear genome. In human ECs, the mtRNA–chromatin attachment levels change in response to cellular stress induced by high glucose and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (HT). As an example, we identify the mitochondrial lncRNA SncmtRNA as a mt-caRNA. In human ECs, suppression of SncmtRNA attenuates HT stress induction of nascent RNAs transcribed from the nuclear genome, including the cell adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1, and abolishes stress-induced monocyte–EC adhesion. In addition to SncmtRNA, we show nuclear localization of other mtRNAs including MT-CYB and MT-ND5 in human ECs, which is increased by HT and in diabetic human donors. Collectively, our findings suggest that mtRNAs are a class of retrograde messengers that mediates cellular response by attaching to chromatin and regulating nuclear transcription.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pervasive association of mtRNA with chromatin</title><p>To test whether mtRNAs are attached to the nuclear genome, we generated high-resolution RNA–genome interaction maps from human embryonic stem cells (H1), foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), and lymphoblasts (K562) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calandrelli et al., 2021</xref>) using our recently developed iMARGI (in situ mapping of RNA–genome interactions) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sridhar et al., 2017</xref>). By simultaneously sequencing caRNAs and their associated genomic DNA sequences from purified nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), iMARGI can differentiate the sequencing reads originating from RNA (RNA-end reads) and genomic DNA (DNA-end reads) in the chimeric reads.

Moreover, comparison between NM and HT revealed that HT further induced the CALs of most of the mtRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Specifically, SncmtRNA exhibited a 64-fold higher CAL than the average CAL of all nuRNAs in NM (p = 0.00082, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), which was further increased by HT (p = 0.034, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

Compared with other gene promoters, and other genomic regions including enhancers, SEs, introns, 5′ and 3′ UTRs, CDS, and intergenic regions, the promoters of HT-induced genes exhibited higher CAL of mtRNAs (p = 0.029, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L, M</xref>) and SncmtRNA (p = 0.016, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N, O</xref>).

As an FISH control, probe with scrambled sequence did not reveal specific signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistently, qPCR of SncmtRNA in different EC subcellular fractions detected the majority of SncmtRNA in the nuclear fractions including chromatin and nucleoplasm, with MALAT1 (predominantly nuclear localized), GAPDH (predominantly cytoplasm localized), and TUG1 (localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm) quantified as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, compared to NM, HT-increased chromatin-associated SncmtRNA in ECs, while there was no change for MALAT1, TUG1, and GAPDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The HT-increased mt-caRNA, including SncmtRNA could be due to the increased total levels of mtRNAs in ECs. Arguing against this possibility, high glucose and TNFα are known to impair mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shenouda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trudeau et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, bulk RNA-seq of ECs under NM vs HT revealed that several nuclear-encoded genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated recepter gamma (PPARG) and Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (<italic>TFAM</italic>) were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, mitochondria visualized by Mitotracker showed fragmentation under HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In terms of mitochondria-encoded transcripts, the majority remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Similarly, the total RNA levels of SncmtRNA as well as 16S rRNA and antisense mitochondrial non-coding RNA (ASncmtRNA), all derived from <italic>MT-RNR2</italic>, were comparable between NM and HT. In contrast, the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), hallmark of EC homeostasis was decreased, and that of VCAM1 and ICAM1, typical inflammation markers were strongly induced by HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, the pervasive increase of mt-caRNAs is unlikely due to a global increase of total mtRNAs.</p><p>Upon confirming the presence, sequence, and subcellular localization of SncmtRNA, we designed three SncmtRNA-targeting LNA GapmeRs, which can cause RNase H-mediated RNA degradation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liang et al., 2017</xref>). While LNA-S1 targets the unique chimeric junction in SncmtRNA, LNA-S2 and S3 target different regions of H strand portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As expected, only LNA-S1 (hereafter termed LNA-S) consistently decreased SncmtRNA level without affecting those of 16S rRNA and ASncmtRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and was thus used in the subsequent SncmtRNA knockdown (Snc-KD) experiments. While LNA-S decreased the total cellular SncmtRNA in ECs under both NM and HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the inhibitory effect was primarily in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This is likely because that LNA GapmeRs are predominantly localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castanotto et al., 2015</xref>). Their localization in mitochondria is unlikely in the absence of a carrier such as MITO-porter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furukawa et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, RNase-H1 is enriched in the nuclear and mitochondrial compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the transfection of LNA-S using lipofectamine would result in relatively selective effect in the nucleus. Therefore, any consequence observed with LNA-S should be primarily due to the reduction of SncmtRNA in the nucleus, including chromatin-associated SncmtRNA.</p><p>Bulk RNA-seq revealed that under NM, Snc-KD resulted in 265 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 160 down- and 105-upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Under HT, Snc-KD led to more DEGs, that is 732 DEGs (403 down- and 329 upregulated) in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), with 120 common DEGs between NM and HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that innate immune and inflammatory responses are the most consistently affected pathways under both NM and HT, with more pathways involved in innate immune response under NM (e.g. Type I interferon signaling and cellular response to virus and LPS) and more pathways involved in inflammatory response under HT (e.g., TNF signaling, leukocyte migration, and cell–cell adhesion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>). Moreover, these pathways are mainly enriched in the downregulated DEGs by Snc-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G, I</xref>). For example, hallmark genes for innate immune and inflammatory activation, including <italic>DDX58</italic>, <italic>MX2</italic>, <italic>VCAM1</italic>, and <italic>ICAM1</italic>, were strongly suppressed by Snc-KD under both NM and HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the gene expression changes, the HT-induced pro-inflammatory response of ECs assayed by monocyte adhesion, was abrogated by Snc-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>). In contrast, cell proliferation, cell division, and cell cycle regulation were mostly upregulated by Snc-KD, especially under HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>), evident by the significant induction of cell cycle regulators, for example, <italic>CDK1</italic> and <italic>CCNB1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). Fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) assay, which detects cell cycle progression and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>), revealed while HT caused a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, LNA-S led to a trend toward promoting the G1-arrested cells to S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N, O</xref>). In contrast, Snc-KD had no clear effect on mitochondria network or morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–F</xref>). Furthermore, Snc-KD led to minimal changes in mitochondrial function as quantified by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using Seahorse assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Additionally, we did not observe any significant effect on the levels of mtRNAs or those of nuclear-encoded genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis upon Snc-KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3H–K</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the mitochondria-encoded and partially chromatin-associated SncmtRNA plays a role in the regulation of nuclear-encoded transcripts.</p><p>The enriched CAL of SncmtRNA in the promoter regions of HT-induced genes and the effect of Snc-KD in the nuclear-encoded transcriptome raised the possibility that HT-induced gene transcription is in part through enriched association of SncmtRNA with promoters. Based on the iMARGI and RNA-seq data from ECs under NM vs HT, we identified 14 HT-induced genes that exhibit significant increase in the promoter-associated SncmtRNA (Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). To evaluate whether these genes are more likely to be downregulated by Snc-KD, we performed an association (Chi-square) test between these genes and the Snc-KD-reduced genes. Out of these 14 genes, Snc-KD reduced the expression levels of 12 of them under HT (Snc-KD vs Scr fold-change &lt;1), including 6 (<italic>ICAM1</italic>, <italic>ZFHX2</italic>, <italic>ABCA6</italic>, <italic>CSF1</italic>, <italic>PDE5A</italic>, and <italic>RND1</italic>) with statistical significance (Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value &lt;0.05), suggesting the genes suppressed by Snc-KD are enriched in these genes (odds ratio = 2.82, p-value = 0.0096, Chi-square test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This enriched association between genes that show increased SncmtRNA–promoter association and genes that are positively regulated by SncmtRNA supports our hypothesis that HT-induced transcription is likely through enriched SncmtRNA–promoter association.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SncmtRNA regulates transcription of the nuclear genome</title><p>The above described findings further prompted us to test the hypothesis that SncmtRNA regulates the transcription of nuclear-encoded genes. We reasoned that the effect of Snc-KD should be reflected by changes in the levels of nascent RNA, the immediate products of transcription. Furthermore, SncmtRNA transcriptional targets should show consistent changes between the nascent RNA levels in the nuclei and the total RNA levels in whole cells by Snc-KD. Thus, we performed single-nuclear and single-cell RNA-seq (snRNA and scRNA-seq) in ECs with or without Snc-KD and subjected to HT to capture simultaneously the nuclear and the whole-cell transcriptome at single-cell level. While scRNA-seq generated the majority of reads mapped to exons, snRNA-seq generated 40–50% of reads mapped to introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), enabling better interrogation of nascent RNAs. On average, 5500 cells/sample were sequenced for snRNA-seq and 3500 cells/sample were sequenced for scRNA-seq, both of which performed with biological replicates.

These genes may also be regulated by SncmtRNA but not via transcriptional regulation. Indeed, KLF2 is one such gene and its expression appears primarily regulated post-transcriptionally through miRNA-92a, which occurs in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang and Davies, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we performed nascent RNA pull-down assay to demonstrate that Snc-KD indeed led to a reduction of nascent transcripts of ICAM1 and VCAM1 in ECs exposed to HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Complementarily, we overexpressed SncmtRNA (Snc-OE) in ECs using AAV9, which enters the nucleus and drives the transcription of SncmtRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Snc-OE strongly induced ICAM1 and VCAM1, but not that of eNOS and KLF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). At a transcriptome level, Snc-OE resulted in 553 DEGs (289 down- and 264 upregulated), among which similar pathways to those affected by Snc-KD, for example Type I interferon signaling and responses to virus and lipopolysaccharide were also enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>).

We ensured that the sequences used for design of RNAscope probes did not match any nuclear genome at 100%, minimizing the possibility of detecting signals from NUMTs. While the positive control (<italic>POLR2A</italic>, a universally expressed gene) detected strong punctate signals and the negative control (<italic>dapB</italic>, a bacterial gene not expressed in humans) yielded no specific signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), smFISH for MT-CYB and MT-ND5 detected signals largely overlapping with that of Mitotracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

Mitochondrial–nuclear retrograde signaling can be mediated through an array of molecules including but not limited to metabolites, peptides, and Ca<sup>+</sup>. These signaling molecules often activate TFs in the cytoplasm, which subsequently translocate into the nucleus to alter transcription. It remains an open question whether any other means of transducing retrograde signals and whether there are other types of molecules that can serve as the messenger.</p><p>To be a messenger of retrograde signaling, two criteria must be satisfied. First, this molecule must reflect certain functional status of the mitochondria. Second, this molecule must either directly or indirectly alter the epigenome and thus impact the transcription of nuclear genes. In this work, we report a widespread association of mtRNAs with nuclear chromatin. As the transcriptional output of the mitochondrial genome, mtRNA reflects the transcriptional status of the mitochondria and thus satisfies the first criterion. Furthermore, the presence of high glucose and inflammatory cytokines induced the chromatin-associated mtRNA (mt-caRNA) in human EC, confirming that the level of mt-caRNA responds to cellular stress. Mt-caRNA establishes a direct connection between mtRNA and the epigenome.</p><p>Correlated with the stress-induced increase of mt-caRNA are the transcription levels of nuclear genes including adhesion molecules ICAM1 and VCAM1, and increased monocyte–EC attachment. Depletion of a specific mt-caRNA ameliorated stress-induced transcription of nuclear genes including ICAM1 and VCAM1, and abolished the stress-induced increase in monocyte–EC attachment. Reversely, inducing this mt-caRNA in the normal condition reproduced the stress-induced transcriptional changes and the increased monocyte–EC attachment, confirming a for mt-caRNA in transcriptional regulation. These data nominate mtRNA–chromatin interaction as a means of retrograde signaling.</p><p>To ensure our discovered mt-caRNA did not originate from NUMTs, we examined the distribution of the mismatch bases between any mtRNA-aligned sequencing reads and NUMT sequences. Not only that all the several million mtRNA-aligned reads exhibited better alignment to mtRNA than any NUMTs, but most of these reads also contain five or more bases of mismatches to any NUMTs. These data suggest that most of mtRNA–nuDNA read pairs are not attributable to possible misalignments. Consistently, to target SncmtRNA, we used BLAST to ensure that the LNA-S GapmeR does not potentially target any homologous transcripts arising from NUMTs. Furthermore, the lack of any detectable signals for MTCYB and MTND5 in the Rho<sup>0</sup> cells also excluded the potential possibility of capturing NUMT-derived transcripts in smFISH. Collectively, these controls should be sufficient to differentiate mtRNA from NUMT-derived RNA. Future studies on the mechanism of nuclear translocation of mtRNA are warranted.</p><p>Using SncmtRNA and ECs as an exemplar model to investigate the role of mt-caRNA in nuclear transcription, we observed a strong effect of Snc-KD (primarily in the nucleus) on nuclear transcriptome but not on mitochondrial gene expression and function. At basal (NM) condition, Snc-KD led to a strong suppression of anti-viral and Type 1 interferon response pathways in ECs. While similar effect was observed in HT-stressed EC, Snc-KD also suppressed multiple inflammatory response pathways. These findings support a positive regulation of mt-caRNA in innate immune and inflammatory response and are in line with the well-recognized role of mitochondria in innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">West et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to the release of mtDNA and dsRNA by mitochondria into cytoplasm, mt-caRNA (exemplified by SncmtRNA) may also participate in the mitochondria-controlled intrinsic immune surveillance by transducing the defense signal to the nucleus. This mechanism may also ‘prime’ the cells for activation of the inflammatory response under pathological stimuli, for example diabetes-mimicking HT or bacterial infection. Indeed, Snc-KD also attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression, including DDX58, VCAM1, and ICAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Of note, Snc-KD also had a strong effect in upregulating many cell cycle regulators, as revealed by bulk RNA-seq. However, these genes were not significant DEGs in the snRNA-seq data, suggesting that the effect of SncmtRNA on cell cycle may not be primary. It will be interesting to dissect in future studies the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying mt-caRNA-modulated nuclear transcription.</p><p>Finally, using smRNA FISH we showed that MT-CYB and MT-ND5, two other mt-caRNAs are localized in the nucleus of freshly isolated human ECs. Furthermore, their nuclear signals are increased in ECs from diabetic donors and co-localize with active transcription foci, providing in vivo and human disease relevance of mt-caRNAs. A limitation of our study is that these experiments were performed for a few mtRNAs and are with relatively low number of human donor mesenteric arteries. Future studies in ECs from different vascular beds and disease conditions are needed to generalize our findings. As suggested by iMARGI data, the chromatin attachment of mt-caRNAs is likely a more widespread phenomenon in various cell types. Given the critical nuclear–mitochondria crosstalk in most cellular functions and biological processes, our study unravels a previously unidentified mechanism by which mt-caRNA forms an additional layer for nuclear transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, which may have important implications in health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>iMARGI data analyses</title><p>iMARGI sequencing reads were processed by the iMARGI-Docker software to identify the RNA–DNA read pairs including nuRNA–nuDNA and mtRNA–nuDNA read pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).

For analysis, raw sequencing reads were processed using Trim Galore and the trimmed reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). HTseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) was used to generate counts and DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was then used to perform differential gene expression analysis with default parameters (genes with p-values &lt;0.05 and Log<sub>2</sub> fold-change &gt; |0.5| were considered significant differently expressed genes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Monocyte adhesion assay</title><p>Leukapheresis products and discards were obtained from consented research participants (healthy donors) under protocols approved by the City of Hope Internal Review Board (IRB #09025). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) followed by multiple washes in PBS/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were rested overnight at room temperature on a rotator, and subsequently washed and resuspended in complete X-VIVO. Up to 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> PBMC were incubated with anti-CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at room temperature and magnetically enriched using the CliniMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The monocytes were labeled with CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with monolayer HUVECs (4 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells per cm<sup>2</sup>) for 15–30 min in a cell culture incubator. The nonattached monocytes were then washed off with complete EC growth medium. The attached monocyte numbers were quantified on Cytation1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek) using green fluorescent channel. Average numbers per condition were calculated from two randomly selected fields of technical duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>FUCCI analysis</title><p>Cell cycle analysis was performed using the Premo FUCCI Cell Cycle Sensor kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat # P36237) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, Premo geminin-GFP and Premo Cdt1-RFP were added to the EC culture medium at 80 particles per cell. Cdt1 levels are highest during G1, while Geminin levels are highest during the S, G2, and M phases. Thus, tracking the fluorescence will enable monitoring cell cycle progression overtime. Twenty-four hours later, cells were imaged using Cytation1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek). Green fluorescent channel was used for GFP, and red fluorescent channel for RFP. The number of cells with red fluorescence (indicative of G1 phase), yellow fluorescence (indicative of G1/S transition), and green fluorescence (indicative of G2/M) was counted from at least 4 fields per condition and five independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>scRNA- and snRNA-sequencing and analysis</title><p>HUVECs treated with HT and transfected with LNA in biological replicates were processed following the Drop-seq protocol from 10× Genomics. For scRNA-seq, ECs were washed, trypsinized, and suspended into a single-cell solution for the library preparation using 10× Genomics Chromium 3.1’ expression kit as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calandrelli et al., 2020</xref>).

The resulting nuclei underwent the Drop-seq protocol with 10× Genomics Chromium 3.1’ expression kit.</p><p>scRNA- and snRNA-seq data were processed using the standardized pipeline provided by 10× Genomics. The reads were aligned to both intronic and exonic regions of the human hg38 reference genome by utilizing include-introns command during alignment with Cell Ranger. Seurat R package (v3) was used following well-established filtering steps to remove genes expressed in &lt;3 cells and cells expressing &lt;200 genes. For the differential analysis between HT-Scr and HT-LNA conditions, rare cells/nuclei with very high numbers of genes (&gt;8500 and 7000 genes for scRNA- and snRNA-seq, respectively; potential multiplets) and cells/nuclei with high mitochondrial read percentages (&gt;15% for scRNA-seq and &gt;25% for snRNA-seq) were removed. HT_Scr and HT_LNA samples were first separately normalized with ‘sctransform’ and then integrated into one dataset based on Seurat-selected anchor genes. This integrated dataset was used for clustering analysis. Clusters of nuclei were identified by Seurat based on shared nearest neighbor using the first 10 principal components as input resolution = 0.5. Differential expression analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test with default parameters in Seurat. The threshold for the avg_logFC was set to be 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Nascent RNA pull-down</title><p>Nascent RNA pull-down assay was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calandrelli et al., 2020</xref>).

mitochondria-encoded RNAs playing a role in controlling nuclear gene expression. How mitochondria and the nucleus communicate is an important yet, not well-appreciated area of biology. Using the iMARGI (in situ mapping of RNA-Genome Interactions) technology developed by this team, the authors found that mitochondria-encoded RNAs play an unexpected role in regulating nuclear gene expressions in endothelial cells and intriguingly, depletion or overexpression of a specific mt-caRNA altered stress-induced transcription of nuclear genes encoding for innate inflammation and endothelial activation. Overall, these findings are interesting and supported by experimental confirmation, bulk-RNA-seq, and snRNA and scRNA-seq data and will be of interest to the field studying RNA regulation, gene expression, and cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86204.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0243gzr89</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.12.10.519922">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.10.519922v1.full">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

There are heterogeneities in the response of vascular beds in different organ to diabetic/ inflammatory conditions. Mesenteric arteries, used here, have been observed to be less prone to atherosclerosis compared to large central arteries like the coronary or carotid arteries. Hence, the increased mt-caRNA nuclear signals in endothelial cells from diabetic donors, and their co-localization with active transcription loci may not have proven that it is a common phenomenon present in all cell types, nor is it a validation of pathogenic response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86204.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Can the authors clarify if mt-caRNAs is enriched at the promoters of genes that respond to HT stress conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Comparing the RNA-seq data in HT and baseline (NM) conditions, we identified 312 genes with higher expression in HT (HT-induced genes) (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05). These HT-induced genes included pro-inflammatory and extracellular matrix remodeling genes.</p><p>We compared the chromatin-association levels (CAL) of all mtRNAs in the promoters of HT-induced genes against the other promoters, and other genomic regions including enhancers, super enhancers, introns, 5UTRs, 3UTRs, coding sequences (CDS), and intergenic regions. The promoters of HT-induced genes exhibited higher CAL of mtRNAs than all other types of genomic regions under NM condition (p=0.029, student’s t test). In line with the overall mtRNA CAL, that of SncmtRNA is also higher in the promoters of HT-induced genes than the other genomic regions under normal condition (p=0.016, student’s t test). We observed the same behaviors for both mtRNA and SncmtRNA under HT condition with slightly higher statistical significance (p=0.025 for mtRNA, p=0.0087 for SncmtRNA, student’s t test). These results indicate that mt-caRNAs including SncmtRNA are indeed enriched at the promoters of genes that respond to HT conditions under both normal and HT conditions. We have included these data in the revised Figure 1L-O.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please clarify if Snc-KD affects mitochondrial function at the phenotypic level?

To evaluate whether these genes are more likely to be downregulated by SncmtRNA knockdown (Snc-KD), we performed an association (Chi-square) test between these genes and the Snc-KD-reduced genes. Out of these 14 genes, Snc-KD reduced the expression levels of 12 of them under HT (Snc-KD vs Scr fold-change &lt; 1), including 6 (<italic>ICAM1, ZFHX2, ABCA6, CSF1, PDE5A</italic> and <italic>RND1)</italic> with statistical significance (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value&lt;0.05), suggesting the genes suppressed by Snc-KD are enriched in these genes (odds ratio=2.82, p-value=0.0096, Chi-square test). These data reveal an enriched association between genes that show increased SncmtRNA-promoter association and genes that are positively regulated by SncmtRNA (i.e., Snc-KD-reduced genes) under HT. This supports the thesis that HT-induced transcription of a set of pro-inflammatory (and extracellular matrix remodeling) genes is likely through enriched association of SncmtRNA with their promoters. We have added these new data to Figure 2—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Any interpretation of this?</p></disp-quote><p>While the fraction % of SncmtRNA in the nucleoplasm at steady state is about 50%, that in the cytoplasm is indeed surprisingly low. Our interpretation, largely speculative, is the following:</p><p>1) Unlike in the nucleus, where SncmtRNA can bind to chromatins, SncmtRNA may not have binding partners (e.g., proteins or DNA) in the cytoplasm, rendering the transcript more prone to degradation; 2) SncmtRNA, without any coding potential to support the mitochondrial structure/function per se, may mainly serve as a messenger from mitochondria to communicate with the nucleus, where it exerts its regulatory function. As revealed by Snc-KD experiments, the nuclear inhibition of SncmtRNA under NM led to a significant effect in pathways such as Type I inflammatory response and cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Have they measured changes in SncmtRNA expression due to HT condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured the changes in SncmtRNA expression by RT-qPCR under HT conditions and observed no significant differences compared to NM conditions from 5 independent experiments, as shown in Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. We recognize the difficulty in obtaining human vascular biopsy. There are heterogeneities in the response of vascular beds in different organ to diabetic/ inflammatory conditions. Mesenteric arteries, used here, have been observed to be less prone to atherosclerosis compared to large central arteries like the coronary or carotid arteries. Hence, the increased mt-caRNA nuclear signals in endothelial cells from diabetic donors, and their co-localization with active transcription loci may not have proven that it is a common phenomenon present in all cell types, nor is it a validation of pathogenic response.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s critique and have added this as a limitation of our study in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
