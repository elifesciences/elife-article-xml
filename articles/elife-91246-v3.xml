How epithelia respond to and cope with disturbances of barrier functions to allow tissue integrity maintenance is poorly characterised. Cellular junctions play an important role in this process and intracellular traffic contribute to their homeostasis. Here, we reveal that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal <italic>notum</italic>, alteration of the bi- or tricellular septate junctions (SJs) triggers a mechanism with two prominent outcomes. On one hand, there is an increase in the levels of E-cadherin, F-actin, and non-muscle myosin II in the plane of adherens junctions. On the other hand, β-integrin/Vinculin-positive cell contacts are reinforced along the lateral and basal membranes. We found that the weakening of SJ integrity, caused by the depletion of bi- or tricellular SJ components, alters ESCRT-III/Vps32/Shrub distribution, reduces degradation and instead favours recycling of SJ components, an effect that extends to other recycled transmembrane protein cargoes including Crumbs, its effector β-Heavy Spectrin Karst, and β-integrin. We propose a mechanism by which epithelial cells, upon sensing alterations of the SJ, reroute the function of Shrub to adjust the balance of degradation/recycling of junctional cargoes and thereby compensate for barrier junction defects to maintain epithelial integrity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epithelia</kwd><kwd>cell-cell junction</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>adherens junctions</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT202001010770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esmangart de Bournonville</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE13-0015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Borgne</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20191209388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Borgne</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ministry of Sciences and Higher Education for the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N18/DBS/000013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaglarz</surname><given-names>Mariusz K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In response to disruption of barrier functions mediated by septate junctions, <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells restrict endosomal degradation of transmembrane cell adhesion proteins to promote their recycling in order to maintain tissue integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelia are key tissues of organisms, facing the outside and protecting the inner part of the organism against both physical and chemical injuries. Although the epithelial cells composing the tissue need to establish solid and resistant barriers, they remain highly plastic. Indeed, throughout development, epithelial cells undergo profound changes in cell shape or cell–cell contacts during cell movements, divisions, cell intercalation, or extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godard and Heisenberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matamoro-Vidal and Levayer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perez-Vale and Peifer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pinheiro and Bellaïche, 2018</xref>). Most of these mechanisms imply junctional remodelling and rely on a set of molecular actors that form those junctions. The transmembrane protein E-cadherin (E-cad) connects to cellular cytoskeleton, made of proteins such as non-muscle myosin II (Myo-II) and filamentous actin (F-actin), through α- and β-catenins, and together they build up the adherens junction (AJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke and Martin, 2021</xref>). AJs play the role of a mechanical barrier in the tissue, ensuring that cells are closely packed and resistant to physical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charras and Yap, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Basal to AJs, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia, a second type of intercellular junctions are septate junctions (SJs), appearing as a ladder-like structure at the electron microscope resolution. SJs provide a paracellular diffusion barrier to solutes, similar to that of tight junctions in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genova and Fehon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ward et al., 1998</xref>). In addition to the occludens barrier function, SJs also exert a structural role including cell adhesion, cell polarity, and cell shape regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laprise et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rice et al., 2021</xref>). The cytosolic polarity regulators Scribble, Discs Large, and Lethal Giant Larvae are SJ resident proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izumi and Furuse, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rice et al., 2021</xref>), but not per se SJ components. The so-called ‘core SJ complex’ is composed of cell adhesion proteins including Neurexin-IV (Nrx-IV) and Neuroglian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgartner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genova and Fehon, 2003</xref>), Claudin-like family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2007</xref>), and cytosolic proteins such as Coracle (Cora) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lamb et al., 1998</xref>) and Varicose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). At the meeting point of three cells within an epithelium, a specialised domain called a tricellular junction (TCJ) arises, and to date three proteins have been described as enriched at the SJ level: Gliotactin (Gli) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulte et al., 2003</xref>), Anakonda (Aka; also known as Bark Beetle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hildebrandt et al., 2015</xref>), and the myelin proteolipid protein family member M6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunn et al., 2018</xref>). We and others have recently described an intricate interplay in which both Aka and M6 are required to recruit and stabilise themselves at the TCJ, while Gli is needed to stabilise them both at the TCJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wittek et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, we have shown that TCJ proteins are required to ensure the anchoring of SJ proteins at the three-cell contact, also called a vertex, and, in turn, vertex-specific enrichment and restriction of TCJ proteins are linked to SJ integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>).</p><p>As described above for AJs, SJs must also be highly plastic to cope with a high rate of cell division, tissue growth, cell intercalation, or delamination, while maintaining the integrity of the permeability barrier. Our previous work contributed to show that SJs are stable complexes, exhibiting a turnover rate of 90 min. SJ components are delivered and assembled apically, just basal to AJs, and continue to be progressively dragged basally in a treadmill-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). At the basal SJ belt, SJ components are thought to be disassembled, internalised, and recycled apically to form new SJs or to be degraded. Several studies have revealed that intracellular trafficking actors, such as Rab11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2014</xref>), the retromer, and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III component Shrub, are key regulators of SJ establishment and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pannen et al., 2020</xref>). Retromer is implicated in the retrieval of cargoes from endosomes while ESCRT-III regulates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of transmembrane cargoes. In addition, the Ly6-like proteins Crooked, Coiled, Crimpled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nilton et al., 2010</xref>), and Boudin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hijazi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tempesta et al., 2017</xref>), four SJ accessory proteins required for SJ assembly, have been reported to regulate the endocytic trafficking of Nrx-IV and Claudin-like Kune-Kune.</p><p>Despite the fact that SJs have been extensively studied for the past decades, it only recently emerged that they might be involved in additional mechanisms beyond their initially described filtering actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rice et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, a striking feature of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo SJ mutants is the appearance of a wavy trachea associated with defects in SJ-mediated endocytic trafficking. Other morphogenetic defects include diminished and deformed salivary glands, head involution, and dorsal closure defects. SJ proteins also regulate the rate of division of intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Resnik-Docampo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Resnik-Docampo et al., 2017</xref>), as well as hemocyte lineage differentiation via interactions with the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khadilkar and Tanentzapf, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khadilkar et al., 2017</xref>). Another intriguing feature is the confirmation of the role of SJ components in wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvalho et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, lack of different SJ components impairs the formation of actomyosin cables, which are regulated by AJs and under normal conditions ensure the proper healing of the tissue. Hence, the studies cited revealed that SJ proteins can impact mechanical properties of the tissue, calling for a deeper understanding of the impact that the loss of SJ integrity has on general mature tissue homeostasis.</p><p>We recently reported that defects at tricellular SJs (tSJs) are accompanied by bicellular SJs (bSJs) defects. Indeed, restriction of tSJ components at the vertex is dependent on bSJ integrity. Conversely, loss of tSJ components causes considerable membrane deformation and the loss of bSJs abutting the vertex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>). However, and surprisingly, under these conditions, cells remain within the epithelial layer and do not delaminate. Also, in embryonic and larval epithelia lacking tSJs, bSJs assemble initially, but degenerate later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hildebrandt et al., 2015</xref>). In this paper, we investigate how cell adhesion is modulated and allows epithelial integrity to be maintained following disruption of the integrity of SJs. We use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal <italic>notum</italic> as a model of mature epithelium with established and functional mechanical and paracellular diffusion barrier functions. This tissue lends itself to quantitative imaging in which we can easily dissect the mechanics and genetics of epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Disruption of tSJ and bSJ integrity alters the distribution of AJ components</title><p>We have previously described that NrxIV-labelled bSJs no longer terminate at vertices when TCJ components are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>). Here, we carried out the following morphometric experiment on RNAi-treated tissue, allowing us to compare wild-type (WT) and <italic>aka</italic> mutant tissues. At the electron microscopy resolution, analysing thin sections parallel to the plane of the epithelium, we report that, depletion of Aka induces weaknesses in tissue integrity manifested by the appearance of sizeable intercellular holes in the plane of SJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–A’’</xref>). These observations are reminiscent to the paracellular cavities observed in embryos lacking Aka or Gli, interpreted as being due to a loss of cell–cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hildebrandt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schulte et al., 2003</xref>). To investigate whether this morphological defect affects overall epithelial integrity, we studied the relationship between tSJs and AJs using clonal mosaic cell approach. In this figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and following figures, clone boundaries in the AJ plane are indicated by yellow dashed lines and have been determined as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–A’’</xref>. We measured a 2-fold enrichment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> E-cad tagged with GFP (E-cad::GFP) at tAJs and 1.5-fold enrichment at bAJs in <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B’</xref>). The increased signal of E-cad::GFP was accompanied by an enrichment of junctional Myo-II tagged with GFP (Myo-II::GFP) both at tAJs (1.7-fold enrichment) and bAJs (1.8-fold enrichment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’</xref>). The junctional and medial pools of Myo-II act in synergy with forces exerted by the medial–apical meshwork transmitted onto the junctional pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecuit and Yap, 2015</xref>). The medial–apical network was also stronger in <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> cells than in WT cells (1.5-fold enrichment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’</xref>). In addition, we probed F-actin and determined that loss of Aka resulted in a 1.9-fold and 2.5-fold increase in staining at bAJs and tAJs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–D’</xref>). We observed similar results upon loss of Gli, resulting in a 2-fold enrichment of E-cad at both bi- and tricellular junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–B’</xref>), suggesting that loss of tSJ components is responsible for the observed defects. Next, using a hypomorphic allele of the transmembrane bSJ protein Nervana 2 (Nrv2), we found that E-cad::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–E’</xref>) and Myo-II::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–F’</xref>) were enriched at both bAJs (E-cad::GFP 2.5-fold enrichment, Myo-II::GFP 2-fold enrichment), tAJs (E-cad::GFP 2.3-fold enrichment, Myo-II::GFP 2.3-fold enrichment), and medial network (Myo-II::GFP 2.3-fold enrichment) in <italic>nrv2<sup>k13315</sup></italic> cells compared with WT cells. E-cad::GFP enrichment was also observed upon loss of GPI-anchored bSJ protein Coiled (cold) at BCJ (2.3-fold enrichment) and vertices (2.2-fold enrichment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–G’</xref>). Those results indicate that alteration of the SJ resulted in increased levels of E-cad in the plane of AJ and thus raises the possibility of concomitant changes in epithelial cell adhesive and mechanical properties, which we have subsequently studied.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Consequence of loss of Anakonda on tricellular septate junction morphology and adherens junction components.</title><p>Transmission electron microscopy of wild-type (<bold>A</bold>) and aka RNAi (<bold>A’</bold>) pupal <italic>notum</italic>.

The enrichment was of 1.6-fold at tAJs and bAJs and of 1.8-fold at the medial–apical network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A’</xref>). Next, we probed junctional tension using two-photon laser-based nanoablation in the plane of the AJ labelled with E-cad::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).

This prompted us to analyse the length of the new adhesive interface formed during cell cytokinesis. Indeed, when a cell divides and forms its new cell–cell adhesive interface at the AJ level, the length of the new junction is determined by various factors: the force balance between the cells’ autonomous strength in the actomyosin contractile ring, the cells’ non-autonomous response of neighbouring cells that recruit contractile Myo-II at the edges to impose the geometry/length of the new interface, and the strength of intercellular adhesion defining the threshold of disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Founounou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herszterg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morais-de-Sá and Sunkel, 2013</xref>). Notably, E-cad overexpression was reported to delay junction disengagement leading to a shorter interface in early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>). First, we observed that when a WT cell divides between one WT and one <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> cell, the Myo-II::GFP signal was higher during the formation of and at the future vertex formed at the interface between WT and <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> cell, where there is no Aka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>; white arrow) compared to the WT interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>; green arrow).

Among them, Vps35 subcellular localisation is regulated by Shrub, which is itself needed to ensure correct bSJ protein delivery at the plasma membrane. In the pupal epithelium, loss of Shrub causes loss of ATP-α::GFP signal, indicative of an interplay between SJs and endosomal sorting machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pannen et al., 2020</xref>). Upon loss of Aka, bSJs are no longer connected to vertices and exhibit membrane deformation with increased levels of bSJ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>). The higher level of bSJ components could result from an increased delivery of newly synthesised proteins, reduced endocytosis, and/or increased recycling of bSJ proteins. We hypothesise that defects in SJ integrity might feedback on the endocytosis recycling of bSJ proteins, to compensate for SJ defects. To probe for possible membrane traffic alterations, we investigated the ESCRT complex by examining the multivesicular body (MVB) marker, the ESCRT-0 component hepatocyte-growth-factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS)/Vps27 and Shrub/Vps32 endogenously tagged with GFP (Shrub::GFP).

A way to probe putative defects in ESCRT function is to monitor the amount of poly-ubiquitinylated proteins targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>). First, we used an anti-FK2 antibody, a monoclonal antibody targeting poly-ubiquitinylated proteins, in a Shrub RNAi context and confirmed that depletion of Shrub led to both appearance of poly-ubiquitinylated proteins aggregates and SJ alterations as observed by the inhomogeneous Nrx-IV signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Then, using the Cora-RNAi approach again, we observed Shrub::GFP and poly-ubiquitinylated proteins FK2 as small punctate compartments in the control portion of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In striking contrast, in the Cora-depleted domain, Shrub::GFP and anti-FK2 labelled large structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–C’’</xref>). Shrub::GFP-positive structures were closely juxtaposed and/or partially colocalised with FK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C’–C’’</xref>).

In other words, the accumulation of Shrub::GFP in enlarged compartments seen upon Cora depletion is not functionally equivalent to the loss of Shrub. We propose that it is the Shrub activity that is being modified upon SJ alteration, preventing SJ component degradation in favour of SJ component recycling. In support of this proposal of increased recycling, loss of TCJ components was shown to cause membrane deformations enriched in SJ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>).

Loss of Shrub results in an elongated sinusoidal tube phenotype which was shown to be caused by mislocalised Crb activity. Indeed, in <italic>shrb<sup>4</sup></italic> clones, instead of being restricted to the junctional domain, Crb is present in ESCRT-0-positive endosomal compartments causing Crb activity in endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, the authors raised the possibility that the defect of bSJ caused by loss of Shrub might also contribute to an excess of Crb activity, a possibility that we then tested. As a control, we monitored the localisation of SJ protein Kune Kune (Kune) and Crb using an anti-Crb antibody targeting its N-terminal extracellular domain (anti-Crb). We showed a colocalisation in small vesicles at the basal level of the cell (white vesicles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–A’’</xref>), suggesting that Kune and Crb traffic together. Upon knock-down of Shrub via RNAi, we observed defects of Kune and Crb characterised by enrichment of Crb and Kune in basal aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–B’’’</xref>). The apparent similarities between depletion of Shrub and that of b/tSJ components on FK2 and HRS raised the question whether the loss of Aka could result in defective Crumbs localisation. To investigate this possibility, we monitored Crb localisation in tSJ defects situation using Crb tagged with a GFP in its extracellular domain (Crb::GFP) or an anti-Crb antibody in <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> context. Crb signal was detected both at junctional and medial apical parts of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). Strikingly, in <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> and in bSJ defective <italic>nrv2<sup>k13315</sup></italic> cells, the apical–medial Crb signal was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Concerning junctional Crb, we observed both an enrichment at the plasma membrane associated with small punctate structures at or adjacent to the junctions using Crb::GFP in <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–A’</xref>) and an enrichment of punctate structures at or adjacent to the plasma membrane when using the anti-Crb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–B’</xref>). In <italic>nrv2<sup>k13315</sup></italic> cells, although junctional Crb::GFP signal was not significantly different than in control cells, the anti-Crb signal showed differences and displayed again a less well-defined pattern at the junction compared to Crb::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). While the reason for the difference in plasma membrane and/or cortical labelling appearance between the GFP probe and antibody remains unknown at present, these observations could indicate that Crumbs is closely juxtaposed to the plasma membrane rather than residing at the plasma membrane. Interestingly and in striking contrast to Shrub depletion, we did not observe Crb and Kune basal aggregates in <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic> and <italic>nrv2<sup>k13315</sup></italic> conditions. Hence, if both Shrub and bSJ/tSJ defects lead to Crumb altered signals, Shrub depletion is responsible for Crb being enriched in enlarged intracellular compartments whereas loss of Aka or Nrv2 triggers Crb enrichment at the apical level of the cell. Thus, as proposed above for Nrx-IV, these data further suggest a hijacking of Shrub activity towards recycling components upon alteration of SJ integrity. The elevated apical levels of Crb upon depletion of SJ component is proposed to be causal to apical enrichment of the Crumbs effector Karst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–D’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Médina et al., 2002</xref>).

We report that loss of bSJs and tSJs by altering SJ integrity triggers an ESCRT-dependent response to favour bSJ transmembrane proteins recycling instead of promoting lysosomal degradation. By reducing the ESCRT-dependent degradative pathway, the cellular levels of ESCRT cargoes, including Crb and Mys, become elevated. Firstly, we propose that increased levels of Crb induce elevated Crb activity which may, at least in part, be responsible for the enhancement of apical actomyosin contractility/cellular mechanics. Secondly, FA contact points, containing Vinc and Mys, are assembled. We propose a model whereby increased Crb activity and FA contact formation may compensate for bSJ contact alteration, by reinforcing adhesion, ensuring mechanical barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model summarising the effects of the disruption of septate junction (SJ) integrity in pupal notum.</title><p>In wild-type conditions, bicellular SJ (bSJ) proteins, β-integrin, and Crumbs are recycled to the membrane, thanks to the endosomal–retromer complex.

The accumulation of β-integrin and Crumbs leads to a strengthening of the adhesive structure as shown by increased quantity of adherens junction (AJ) proteins but also by the appearance of focal adhesion contacts.

Because the observed phenotypes on E-cad, Crb, Integrin, Shrb, FK2 are cell-autonomous (only mutant cells are affected), we do not favour a model according which SJ alteration would cause indirect hormonal and/or gene expression defects at the organismal level. However, as the phenotypical consequences of SJ alteration are analysed 2–3 days after the induction of clones or gene silencing, to unambiguously demonstrate that the observed effects are a direct consequence of SJ alteration or not awaits further investigation using for instance acute methods of gene product depletion.</p><p>Keeping in mind this potential limitation, we propose, based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Esmangart de Bournonville and Le Borgne, 2020</xref>) and the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babatz et al., 2018</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fox and Andrew, 2015</xref>, in which SJ defects have been shown to trigger large membrane deformations, that mutant epithelial cells are capable of detecting SJ defects. Our work shows that a part of the SJ complex defects involves the ESCRT machinery. This machinery exhibits two main functions in endosomal sorting. Firstly, at the outer surface of nascent MVBs, ESCRT machinery is involved in the targeting of ubiquitinylated proteins into intraluminal vesicles, which contain the cargoes destined for lysosomal degradation. Secondly, ESCRT machinery regulates retromer-dependent recycling of bSJ components. The accumulation of the FK2 epitopes observed in this study indicates that the primary function of Shrub is attenuated upon alteration of SJ integrity, and we propose that it is in favour of the recycling function. The increased recycling of bSJ components occasioned by the loss of tSJs would thus be responsible for the large membrane deformations containing an excess of bSJ components, demonstrating a feedback between bSJs and tSJs. In contrast, the loss of bSJ components, such as Nrv2, Cora, or Nrx-IV, leads to an overall reduction in the bSJ components Cora, Nrx-IV, ATP-α, and Kune-Kune at the plasma membrane. This is explained by the fact that upon loss of a core SJ component, bSJs are not assembled into stable structures, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>). Hence, we propose that in this situation, SJ components are more recycled. We cannot exclude the possibility that the components of the SJ are partly degraded, but in this condition, the degradation would be independent of ESCRT-III.</p><p>How can SJ alteration modify Shrub function and impact intracellular trafficking? Is it due to the sensing of defects in the paracellular diffusion barrier or in cell adhesive properties, or a combination of both? It is interesting to note that numerous SJ components are GPI-anchored proteins and that, for example, <italic>wunen-1</italic> and <italic>wunen-2</italic> encode lipid phosphate phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ile et al., 2012</xref>), raising the question of whether the lipid composition of the lateral plasma membrane can be altered by the loss of SJ components. In vertebrates, the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is regulated by the major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). Mfsd2a is a central nervous system (CNS) endothelial-cell-specific lipid transporter that delivers the omega3-fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid into the brain via transcytosis. Lipids transported by Mfsd2a create a unique lipid composition in CNS endothelial cells that specifically inhibits caveolae-mediated transcytosis to maintain BBB integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>). By analogy to Mfsd2a, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal <italic>notum</italic>, changes in the lipid transported or in the lipid content of the plasma membrane could be sensed upon alteration of SJ integrity and modify intracellular trafficking, i.e., ESCRT-dependent recycling of SJ components. Changes in lateral plasma membrane lipid composition upon SJ alteration could also impact the lipid composition of endosomal compartments that, in turn, could participate in modulating recycling versus the degradative function of ESCRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Record et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cause and consequences of SJ alteration on cell mechanics and adhesion</title><p>We do not favour a model in which the effects on cell mechanics and adhesive properties resulting from altered SJ integrity can be caused by a defect in cell polarity. Indeed, loss of cell polarity regulators Scrib/Dlg causes delocalisation of E-cad/Arm and of Crb to the basolateral part of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>), phenotypes we never observed upon loss of SJ components including Aka, M6, Gli, Nrv2, and Cora. Here, in both bSJ and tSJ mutant cells, Crb is enriched at the apical pole of the cells. This might be the result of an overall increased Crb transcription levels. However, in the event of a transcriptional response, this would be a global effect on gene expression since E-cad, Crb, Mys, and bSJ components levels are also increased. Hence, although we cannot firmly exclude a global effect at transcriptional level, we favour the hypothesis of increased recycling.</p><p>As Crb is a known binding partner of the β-Heavy Spectrin Karst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Médina et al., 2002</xref>), Crb defects are proposed to cause the enrichment of Karst in the bSJ/tSJ mutant cells. Furthermore, the enrichment of Myo-II::GFP, and especially p-Myo-II, might be due to the upregulation of the activator Rho-kinase (Rok), another known partner of Crb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sidor et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tSJ protein M6 has been recently reported to act as an interplay partner of Ajuba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ikawa et al., 2023</xref>) and loss of M6 is associated with elevated signal of Ajuba at vertices in pupal wing epithelium. The fact that we similarly observed elevated signal of Ajuba upon loss of Aka in the pupal <italic>notum</italic> reinforces the idea of AJ remodelling by mechanistic links between tSJ and AJ/actomyosin cytoskeleton components.</p><p>The formation of shorter cell–cell interfaces during cytokinesis in <italic>aka</italic> mutant cells could argue for changes in tensile forces. However, these short interfaces could also result from high contractile forces within the cytokinetic ring and reduced resistance from neighbours. It can also be the consequence of delayed E-cad disengagement due to higher levels of E-cad, as reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guillot and Lecuit, 2013</xref>), rather than an overall change in tissue tensile forces. In fact, we did not observe differences in the recoil velocity of <italic>aka</italic> or <italic>nrv2</italic> mutant cells upon junction nanoablation. A plausible explanation seems related to the fact that all mutant cells have their level of medial and junctional Myo-II and linked AJs increased. Therefore, the pulling forces might be at equilibrium as in WT condition, and might be equal on both sides of the junctions. An argument in favour of similar tension in both WT/heterozygous and mutant cells is that clones of mutant cells are compact and do not disperse among WT cells (or vice versa). One could expect mixing of cells upon differential tension at boundaries, as highlighted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levayer et al., 2015</xref>.</p><p>In any case, despite the increased amount of E-cad and Myo-II, <italic>aka</italic> mutant cells do not undergo apical constriction, basal cell extrusion nor induce a fold in the tissue. Thus, the changes observed argue in favour of reinforcing adhesion to prevent cell extrusion. Another argument in favour of a reinforcement of adhesive properties upon SJ alterations is the assembly of Vinc and Mys FAs laterally and basally. Although FA contacts, restricted to the basal site, are present at the location of attachment sites of flight muscles, rather late in pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017</xref>), it is notable that FAs are being detected in <italic>aka</italic> clones as early as 15–16 hr after puparium formation (APF). Although Mys and Vinc are expressed in control epithelial cells, they do not assemble into detectable FAs. Although, as mentioned above, we cannot exclude the possibility that this is due to transcriptional upregulation of Mys, we favour the hypothesis that reduced degradation of Mys by the ESCRT machinery contributes to FA assembly. We propose that such contacts contribute to the maintenance of epithelial cells within the epithelium layer, hence contributing to mutant cells’ preservation of epithelial mechanical integrity upon SJ disturbance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conservation of the process?</title><p>Does a similar detection mechanism exist in vertebrates upon alteration of TJs? Of note, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, leaks at TJs occurring as cell boundaries elongate are detected and induce transient and local activation of Rho, named ‘Rho flares’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stephenson et al., 2019</xref>). This leads to localised contraction of the cell boundary to restore the local concentration of TJ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stephenson et al., 2019</xref>). During the course of our study, Rho-flare formation was shown to be mechanically triggered by mechanosensitive calcium-channel-dependent calcium flashes in TJ remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Varadarajan et al., 2022</xref>). This mechanism permits epithelium to repair small TJ leaks induced by mechanical stimuli. Whether a similar mechanosensitive-dependent repair mechanism is at play in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires further investigation. If so, how does this compare with the mechanism described in our study?</p><p>Another recent study revealed that serine proteinases are used to cleave the TJ complex form by proteins EpCAM and Claudin-7 upon TJ damages, releasing Claudin-7 and ensuring TJ rapid repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Higashi et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, it remains to be determined whether such mechanisms described for small leaks apply to larger alterations of the TJ belt, as we report here in flies, and involve AJ and FA reinforcement of adhesive properties.</p><p>Due to their importance in ensuring epithelia homeostasis, deciphering between direct and indirect consequences of TJ alterations remains a key question to explore in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Experimental model</title><sec id="s3-3-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genotypes</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (A–A’) UAS-Aka-RNAi-TRiP; <italic>pnr</italic>-Gal4 obtained by crossing UAS-Aka-RNAi-TRiP with <italic>pnr</italic>-Gal4/TM6, <italic>Tb1.</italic> (B–B’) <italic>hs</italic>-FLP; <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic>, FRT40A/<italic>ubi</italic>-RFP nls, FRT40A, E-cad::GFP; obtained by crossing <italic>hs</italic>-FLP; <italic>aka<sup>L200</sup></italic>, FRT40A/CyO with <italic>hs</italic>-FLP; <italic>ubi</italic>-RFP nls, FRT40A, ECad::GFP/CyO.

Briefly, the samples were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 2 hr. Then, they were stained for 1 hr in 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide and 1.5% (wt/vol) K4[Fe(CN)6] in cacodylate buffer followed by 1 hr in 1% (wt/vol) tannic acid in 100 mM cacodylate buffer. Finally, they were incubated for 30 min in 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide followed by 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 2 hr. After the dehydration cycles, samples were embedded in Epon–Araldite mix. To ensure precise orientation and access to the samples, a two-step flat-embedding procedure was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kolotuev, 2014</xref>). Sections were cut with an Ultracut E microtome (Reichert-Jung, Austria, now Leica Microsystems) parallel to the plane of the pupal nota epithelia. Semi-thin sections (0.7–1 μm thick) were mounted on microscope slides and stained with 1% aqueous solution of methylene blue in 1% borax. Ultrathin sections (70–80 nm thick) were collected on either standard copper grids or single-slot nickel grids coated with formvar (polyvinyl formal; Polysciences, Inc). The sections were contrasted with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate solution for 20 s, rinsed with double-distilled water, and stained in Reynolds solution (lead citrate; Sigma-Aldrich) for up to 3 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reynolds, 1963</xref>). After several rinses with deionised water and drying, the sections were examined with a JEM-2100 HT (JEOL Ltd, Japan) transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. The pupal nota of three WT and three aka RNAi specimens were examined, and at least 10 ultrathin sections of the region of interest were analysed in each specimen. At least three TCJs were examined in each set of sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Pupae aged from 16 hr 30 min to 19 hr APF were dissected using Cannas microscissors (Biotek, France) in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (1× PBS, pH 7.4) and fixed 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gho et al., 1996</xref>). Following fixation, dissected nota were permeabilised using 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS (PBT), incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBT for 2 hr at room temperature. After three washes of 5 min in PBT, nota were incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in PBT for 1 hr, followed by two washes in PBT, and one wash in PBS, prior mounting in 0.5% N-propylgallate dissolved in 90% glycerol/PBS 1× final.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Genetics tools</title><p>37° heat shocks to induce clones of WT, heterozygous, and mutant cells were performed at L2 and L3 larval stages for an hour each time.

Pupae were sticked on a glass slide with a double-sided tape, and the brown pupal case was removed over the head and dorsal thorax using microdissection forceps. Pillars made of four and five glass coverslips were positioned at the anterior and posterior side of the pupae, respectively. A glass coverslip covered with a thin film of Voltalef 10S oil is then placed on top of the pillars such that a meniscus is formed between the dorsal thorax of the pupae and the glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gho et al., 1999</xref>).

Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>The paper is completely focused on the septate junctions as a paracellular diffusion barrier. However, many of the septate junction components, including Scribble, Dlg, and Lgl, have well documented (if poorly understood) basolateral polarity functions, and considering that septate junctions contain 15 or more cell-cell adhesion proteins, they are also likely to have a adhesive/structural function in addition to paracellular barrier and polarity functions. There is no attempt in the paper to consider or disentangle these multiple roles. Indeed, the introduction and discussion consider the vertebrate tight junction as the analogue of the insect septate junctions when a better view would be that the septate junction is a combination of the claudin-based barrier function of the vertebrate tight junction and the vertebrate basolateral polarity proteins Scribble, Dlg and Lgl that localize similarly and presumably have a function similar to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> basolateral polarity/SJ proteins for which they are named. Moreover, there are no experiments in the paper to address whether the relevant parameter being sensed in SJ defects is loss of the paracellular barrier, loss of cell adhesion/contact/structure or disruption of the polarity function of the SJ complex. Notably, there aren't any experiments in the paper that test paracellular barrier function. This criticism does not in any way reduce the importance of the paper or the results, but to avoid presenting an overly simplistic and probably misleading view of the cellular processes in play, a more comprehensive discussion of SJs is in order.</p></disp-quote><p>The concerns raised by the reviewer are entirely correct. Indeed, in our Ms we were referring the paracellular diffusion barrier function of SJ, that to our mind covers the barrier function to solute diffusion through the intercellular space as well as the structural strength. As such, it gave the impression that we were focusing solely on the paracellular diffusion barrier whereas our study unravels the additional roles of SJ proteins, linked to cell/cell adhesion and structural function as pointed out by the reviewer. We have amended the text, including title, to take this first point into consideration, i.e. replacement of paracellular diffusion barrier by septate junctions that include the two functions, the diffusion barrier and structural function.</p><p>We considered the possibility of a cell polarity defect from the outset, but consider that we can rule out this possibility. Indeed, loss of scribble/Dlg causes delocalisation of E-Cad/Arm and of Crumbs to the basal pole, phenotypes we never observed in mutants or upon depletion of SJ components including Aka, M6, Gli, Nrv, Cora. We have added a sentence to explain this in the revised version (line 437).</p><p>With regard to the criticism that &quot;<italic>the article contains no experiments testing paracellular barrier function</italic>&quot;, our previous work demonstrates the loss of SJ-specific proteins such as NrxIV at the vertices upon loss of TCJ proteins. Here, we are confident that our EM analysis provides irrefutable evidence that Aka depletion leads to the appearance of holes at contacts between three cells in the plane of septate junctions, giving credit for defects in defective permeability barrier function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 245: &quot;We propose that it is the Shrub activity that is being modified upon SJ alteration, preventing SJ component degradation in favour of SJ component recycling.&quot;</p><p>line 288, &quot;Thus, as proposed above for Nrx-IV, these data further suggest a hijacking of Shrub activity toward recycling components upon alteration of SJ integrity.&quot;</p><p>Model in Figure 7 Arrows showing increased SJ protein delivery in right bottom panel, but decreased bicellular SJ complex formation in the left bottom panel.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that in bicellular SJ mutants, there is increased accumulation of Crb, adherens junction components, focal adhesion components, and in the text and in the model in Figure 7 focus on the upregulation of recycling activity. However, as indicated by the reduced bSJs in the left bottom panel in Figure 7, and in the reduced Nrx levels in 3C' and in the text in lines 351-53, the levels of most septate junction proteins drop in the absence of any of 15+ bicellular septate junction mutants. Previously the authors should that reduction of tricellular septate junction proteins increased levels of septate junction proteins in bicellular junctions which the authors translate to increased delivery of &quot;SJ components&quot; to the membrane in SJ mutants as shown in Figure 7 bottom right panel and stated in lines 245 and 288. But the data in the paper, which is consistent with statements on lines 351-353 saying that bicellular SJ mutations cause a general reduction of SJ protein levels, suggests either a more nuanced role of recycling such that Crbs and other proteins show increased recycling in bicellular SJ mutants, but bicellular SJ proteins show decreased recycling, or an alternative scenario in that the SJ proteins are recycled more in a SJ mutant, like Crb is, but SJ proteins don't form stable complexes which leads to their modification that targets them for destruction despite being recycled more. Regardless of the actual explanation, I think readers will be confused by the statements in the current version of the paper about upregulation of recycling activity but apparent reduction of SJ proteins. The authors should address this issue with appropriate changes to text and the model figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out to this potential confusion between the description of the data, the model in Figure 7 and the interpretation of the data. We appreciate her/his suggestion of interpretation ‘an alternative scenario in that the SJ proteins are recycled more in a SJ mutant, like Crb is, but SJ proteins don't form stable complexes which leads to their modification that targets them for destruction despite being recycled more.’ We do favour the hypothesis according which not only Crumbs and β-integrin are recycled at higher rates but also SJ components even in the case of loss of a bSJ component. However, in this latter situation, we do not see the bSJ components accumulating at the plasma membrane as they are not forming stable complex (short time residence according to FRAP analyses), nor we detect them in endosomal/recycling compartments. In fact, with the exception of blocking MVB-dependent protein degradation, we only detect SJ components (GFP lines, antibody staining) at the plasma membrane but not in the secretory nor the endocytic compartment, and we have no explanation for this (small compartments, low amounts of protein/ compartment, short residency time?)</p><p>Accordingly, we have amended the text (lines 405-410, and 482-485) to better explain our thoughts and taking into account the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The assumption in the paper is that the changes in protein levels result from changes in recycling of the proteins. However, it would be nice to rule out transcriptional regulation. Has anyone established smFISH in the notum that would allow quantification of Crb or other marker RNA to show that there is not increased accumulation of the Crb RNA in the SJ mutant backgrounds?</p></disp-quote><p>SmFISH is described in whole mounted <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains or embryos, however, we do not master the technique on adult thin tissues. However, in the event of a transcriptional response, this would be a global effect since E-Cad, Crumbs, β-integrin and bSJ components levels are increased upon loss of Aka (M6 or Gli).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have modified the text (lines 440-445) and argue in favour of the hypothesis of increased recycling, although we cannot exclude an overall effect at transcriptional level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 58. SJ are only the functional equivalent of tight junctions for paracellular barrier function. SJ have basolateral polarity function that correspond to basolateral polarity proteins in vertebrates, whereas vertebrate TJs are associated with apical complexes. In addition, the mechanical properties of SJ and TJ are probably wildly different since the SJ is a much more elaborate structure with many more cell-cell adhesion proteins than TJs. I feel the presented over-simplification do not adequately inform the reader about alternative functions and therefore hypotheses about the data in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have therefore reworded the paragraph to avoid oversimplification: lines 58-70</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>lines 120-121 , Figure 1A-A'. Please quantify the relative frequency of holes observed in the EM sections. Is it every tricellular junction or 1 in 100?

We have included it in the revised version, and added the quantitative analyses in Figure 1A’’. We are confident that our analysis allows us to conclude that Aka depletion causes the appearance of these holes, and consequently the loss of barrier function integrity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 713-737</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy sample preparation</p><p>WT and aka RNAi <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal nota (16h APF) were dissected in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at room temperature and immediately processed (Kolotuev, 2014). Briefly, the samples were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 2h. Then, they were stained for 1h in 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide and 1.5% (wt/vol) K4[Fe(CN)6] in cacodylate buffer followed by 1h in 1% (wt/vol) tannic acid in 100 mM cacodylate buffer. Finally, they were incubated for 30min in 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide followed by 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 2h. After the dehydration cycles, samples were embedded in Epon–Araldite mix. To ensure precise orientation and access to the samples, a two-step flat-embedding procedure was used (Kolotuev, 2014). Sections were cut with an Ultracut E microtome (Reichert-Jung, Austria, now Leica Microsystems) parallel to the plane of the pupal nota epithelia. Semi-thin sections (0.7–1 μm thick) were mounted on microscope slides and stained with 1% aqueous solution of methylene blue in 1% borax. Ultrathin sections (70–80nm thick) were collected either on standard copper grids or single-slot nickel grids coated with formvar (polyvinyl formal; Polysciences, Inc). The sections were contrasted with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate solution for 20s, rinsed with double-distilled water and stained in Reynolds’ solution (lead citrate; SigmaAldrich) for up to 3min (Reynolds, 1963). After several rinses with deionized water and drying, the sections were examined with a JEM-2100 HT (JEOL Ltd, Japan) transmission electron microscope at 80kV. The pupal nota of three WT and three aka RNAi specimens were examined, and at least 10 ultrathin sections of the region of interest were analyzed in each specimen. At least three tricellular junctions were examined in each set of sections.</p><p>line 126-127 (data not shown). Does EMBO allow data not shown?

The Abstract states: &quot;We report that the weakening of SJ integrity, caused by the depletion of bi- or tricellular SJ components, reduces ESCRT-III/Vps32/Shrub-dependent degradation and promotes instead Retromer-dependent recycling of SJ components.&quot; This is too strong, as the role of the retromer, while plausible, is not directly tested. It's fine to speculate about this in the Discussion but drawing a conclusion like this in the Abstract is unwarranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with her/him and have made the appropriate changes in the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similarly, the title suggests that &quot;ESCRT-III-dependent adhesive and mechanical changes are triggered by a mechanism sensing paracellular diffusion barrier alteration&quot;. They show that knocking down septate junctions alters localization of vesicle trafficking machinery, and that it leads to alterations in apparent recycling of cargo, but do they ever really assess whether these changes are ESCRT-III-dependent? Wouldn't this require knocking down ESCRT-III in cells with defects in septate junctions? There was a lot of data in this paper and perhaps I missed it but was this experiment done? I am not suggesting they do it, but that they temper this conclusion if not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated a line to simultaneously deplete Cora and Shrub.

I found the Discussion challenging to follow. Rather than focusing on the core observations, it addresses many, not very well-connected speculative possibilities, and in my opinion, will be challenging for most readers to follow. I would encourage the authors to revisit it from top-to-bottom.</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult for us to respond specifically to this general comment on the discussion. We have reworded the discussion to consider the criticisms made by the three reviewers and we tried to better connect the hypotheses formulated.</p><p>We have shortened and simplified the section on ‘cell mechanics and adhesion’ and added a section on the potential conservation of the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>The title refers to a &quot;mechanism sensing paracellular diffusion barrier alteration&quot;, and in the discussion (line 325) authors state that &quot;loss of bSJs and tSJs by altering the paracellular diffusion barrier triggers an ESCRT-dependent response…&quot;. However, no experiments to assess paracellular barrier function (epithelial permeability) are shown in the paper, and it is not clear that the ESCRT-dependent responses described here are triggered by altered barrier function per se, as stated by the authors, or by changes in other SJ-dependent parameters, such as cell adhesion or intra-membrane mobility of lipids and proteins. Statements about paracellular barrier alteration should be rephrased accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these issues, which were also raised by reviewer 1. In accordance, we have rephrased the sentences (see also our response to reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Altered epithelial barrier function will likely influence osmoregulation via changes in organismal hormonal status and gene expression, which may contribute to the phenotypes described here. How much time passed between induction of mutant clones and phenotypic analysis? The authors should discuss these aspects, and consider that effects of altered barrier function will depend on the distribution and size of clones with defective SJs.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we have analysed clones of mutant cells at 16h after formation of the pupae. Heat shock to induce clones were done at L2 and L3 stages. The effect of gene silencing on the pupal notum (using pnr and sca-Gal4 drivers) is initiated at L3 stage. The phenotypical consequences are therefore analysed 2 to 4 days after the induction of clones or gene silencing. In that sense, the reviewer is fully correct and we cannot exclude hormonal and gene expression defects at the organismal level.</p><p>However, we have systematically observed the effects reported on E-Cad, Crb, Integrin, Shrb, FK2, etc. independently of clone position on the notum and clone size. In addition, these effects remain cell-autonomous. We do not expect this to be the case in the event of a defect (hormonal or gene expression) at the organism level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion the authors speculate about a &quot;sensing&quot; mechanism based on (hypothetical) altered membrane lipid composition upon loss of SJs. However, such effects would not explain how altered barrier function per se (epithelial permeability) would be sensed by cells, as stated in the title and throughout the text. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, the point we are making here is to say how an SJ defect can lead to a lipid composition defect which in turn would lead to a transport defect (as shown for Mfsd2 for BBB in vertebrates). This argument provides an explanation of how this could contribute to the transport defect, but in no case a detection mechanism. We have amended the text and reformulated it as such in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How Shrb/ESCRTIII activity could be &quot;redirected&quot; or &quot;modulated&quot; by disruption of SJs remains unclear. Can the authors briefly outline possible mechanisms for modulation of ESCRT activity?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the manuscript, recent work reports that ESCRT function is required for apical localization and mobility of retromer positive carrier vesicles (Pannen et al., 2020). One could envisage that upon loss of Aka or bSJ component, a specific subset of ESCRT cargoes (perhaps SJ components themselves) are found in higher amounts in endosomes and favors the above mentioned function of ESCRT instead of promoting MVB formation and ubiquitinated protein degradation.</p><p>A second possible explanation relies on a repair mechanism. ESCRTIII is known to be recruited to the plasma membrane or to the membrane of organelles in the event of injury in order to repair it. This mechanism relies on the detection of calcium. It is therefore conceivable that a change in the composition of the SJ could send a signal via calcium, leading to ESCRTIII being 'hijacked' to these locations. As the SJ is continuously perturbed in our situation, ESCRTIII is continuously addressed to the cell membrane.</p><p>In plants (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9171914/), ESCRT machinery (ALiX) interacts with the retromer core subunits, by recruiting Retromer onto endosomes to trigger recycling of Vacuolar sorting receptors. By analogy to plant, a third possibility would be that increased levels of ESCRT on endosomes could result in increased recruitment of retromer to trigger recycling of cargos (including Crb, β integrin, SJ components). These possibilities are now discussed in the revised Ms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presentation of fluorescence intensity data in a rescaled (&quot;standardized&quot;) format is uncommon and non-intuitive, as it obscures the true scale (fold-changes) and variation of the data. Also, if data were plotted as a range from 0 to 10, as stated in Materials &amp; Methods, it is not clear why in all graphs (except for a single datapoint in Figure 5C'?) values start at 1, not at 0. Highest values appear to cluster at 10 and lowest values at 1, suggesting these represent saturated or clipped signals, respectively. Were these datapoints taken into consideration for calculating mean values? Authors need to explain exactly how the analysis was done.

The basis for choosing these different conditions is not always clear and makes results difficult to compare.</p></disp-quote><p>Whenever possible, we diversified tools to confirm that what we observed in mutant conditions were also observed using another independent approach. We used Cora and NrxIV RNAi due to the limited genetic tools to induce mosaic clones for those genes. We choose Sca over Pnr when it was too detrimental for the pupa. For instance, pnr-Gal4 &gt; Shrub RNAi does not allow us to analyse pupae as it dies before reaching 16h APF. In that case, we had to use Sca-Gal4 which allows pupal development.</p><p>Explaining all these subtleties and experimental limitations seems to us to make the text even more cumbersome, so we have decided not to provide these details systematically.</p><p>In the revised Ms, we will specify the reasons for which this or that tool is used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The TEM images shown in Figure 1A are difficult to interpret, because plasma membrane is barely visible. The images do not seem to contribute much and can be removed from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct by saying that the plasma membranes are not always easily detectable. To be more precise, they are not nicely delineated along their entire length and show low contrast. Also, one should keep in mind that the sections are only 70-80 nm thick and the appearance of the cell membranes very much depends on a sectioning plane. Nevertheless, we can make out the separation between neighboring cells of the notum (indicated by arrows in the micrographs).</p><p>We believe this EM dataset of epithelial sections parallel to the plane of the epithelium is essential to demonstrate the holes at TCJ resulting from aka depletion, a phenotype never observed in the control situation (see also our answer to reviewer 1 concerning the quantitation of the phenotype).</p><p>This is why we have retained this essential data to demonstrate the loss of integrity of the epithelial barrier for the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The position of mutant clones is marked by absence of nuclear RFP (Figure 1B and elsewhere), but drawings of clone boundaries (Figure 1B) do not match with the pattern of RFPpositive/ -negative nuclei (Figure 1B'), presumably because different optical sections are shown in Figure 1B and B'. This is confusing and needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed due to different optical sections. To ascertain the clone boundary in the apical plane, we draw boundaries at the apical level by maximising the nls-RFP signal.</p><p>In the revised version, we have modified the Figures as follows:</p><p>Figure S1 A-A&quot; explains how clonal boundaries are unambiguously determined by showing apical and basal confocal sections.</p><p>In Figure 1A-C, E-G, and following, we have removed the panels showing the nls::RFP marker that was used to determine clone boundaries and instead have labelled clone boundaries only. This makes the data clearer and avoids the reader wondering how the clone boundaries were defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 102: &quot;We recently reported that defects at tricellular Septate Junctions (tSJs) are always accompanied by bicellular Septate Junctions (bSJs) defects&quot;.
