latent infection in neurons and periodically reactivates to cause disease. The stimuli that trigger HSV-1 reactivation have not been fully elucidated. We demonstrate HSV-1 reactivation from latently infected mouse neurons induced by forskolin requires neuronal excitation. Stimuli that directly induce neurons to become hyperexcitable also induced HSV-1 reactivation. Forskolin-induced reactivation was dependent on the neuronal pathway of DLK/JNK activation and included an initial wave of viral gene expression that was independent of histone demethylase activity and linked to histone phosphorylation. IL-1β is released under conditions of stress, fever and UV exposure of the epidermis; all known triggers of clinical HSV reactivation. We found that IL-1β induced histone phosphorylation and increased the excitation in sympathetic neurons. Importantly, IL-1β triggered HSV-1 reactivation, which was dependent on DLK and neuronal excitability. Thus, HSV-1 co-opts an innate immune pathway resulting from IL-1 stimulation of neurons to induce reactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>herpes simplex virus</kwd><kwd>IL-1</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>dual leucine zipper kinase</kwd><kwd>hyperexcitability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS105630</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cliffe</surname><given-names>Anna R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuddy</surname><given-names>Sean R</given-names></name><name><surname>Suzich</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dochnal</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzich</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30EY030397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzich</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12014/5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boutell</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM108989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>Bimal N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seegren</surname><given-names>Philip V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Herpes simplex virus reactivates from a latent infection when neurons become hyperexcitable in response to an inflammatory cytokine known to be released during fever and stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that is present in approximately 40–90% of the population worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arvin, 2007</xref>). HSV-1 persists for life in the form of a latent infection in neurons, with intermittent episodes of reactivation. Reactivation from a latent infection and subsequent replication of the virus can cause substantial disease including oral and genital ulcers, herpes keratitis, and encephalitis. In addition, multiple studies have linked persistent HSV-1 infection to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Itzhaki, 2018</xref>). Stimuli in humans that are linked to clinical HSV-1 reactivation include exposure to UV light, psychological stress, fever, and changes in hormone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzich and Cliffe, 2018</xref>). How these triggers result in reactivation of latent HSV-1 infection is not fully understood.</p><p>During a latent infection of neurons, there is evidence that the viral genome is assembled into a nucleosomal structure by associating with cellular histone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deshmane and Fraser, 1989</xref>). The viral lytic promoters have modifications that are characteristic of silent heterochromatin (histone H3 di- and tri-methyl lysine 9; H3K9me2/3, and H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Knipe and Cliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cliffe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kwiatkowski et al., 2009</xref>), which is thought to maintain long-term silencing of the viral lytic genes. Hence, for reactivation to occur, viral lytic gene expression is induced from promoters that are assembled into heterochromatin and in the absence of viral proteins, such as VP16, which are important for lytic gene expression upon de novo infection and full reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). The initiation of viral lytic gene expression, including <italic>VP16</italic>, during reactivation is therefore dependent on host proteins and the activation of cellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suzich and Cliffe, 2018</xref>). However, the full nature of the stimuli that can act on neurons to trigger reactivation and the mechanisms by which expression of the lytic genes occurs have not been elucidated.</p><p>One of the best characterized stimuli of HSV reactivation in primary neuronal models is nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation and subsequent loss of PI3K/AKT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wilcox and Johnson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilcox et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camarena et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, we found that activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cell stress response via activation of dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) was required for reactivation in response to loss of NGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, recent work has identified a role for JNK in HSV reactivation following perturbation of the DNA damage/repair pathways, which also triggers reactivation via inhibition of AKT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). DLK is a master regulator of the neuronal stress response, and its activation can result in cell death, axon pruning, axon regeneration or axon degeneration depending on the nature of activating trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geden and Deshmukh, 2016</xref>). Therefore, it appears that HSV has co-opted this neuronal stress pathway of JNK activation by DLK to induce reactivation. One mechanism by which JNK functions to promote lytic gene expression is via a histone phosphorylation on S10 of histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). JNK-dependent histone phosphorylation occurs on histone H3 that maintains K9 methylation and is therefore known as a histone methyl/phospho switch, which likely permits viral lytic gene transcription without the requirement for recruitment of histone demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gehani et al., 2010</xref>). This initial wave of viral lytic gene expression is known as Phase I, and also occurs independently of the lytic transactivator VP16. In addition, late gene expression in Phase I occurs independent of viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cliffe and Wilson, 2017</xref>). A sub-population of neurons then progress to full reactivation (also known as Phase II), which occurs 48–72 hr post-stimulus and requires both VP16 and histone demethylase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Messer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), and includes viral DNA replication. However, this bi-phasic progression has not been observed in some models of reactivation such as axotomy, which results in more rapid viral gene expression and a dependence on histone demethylase activity for viral gene expression at the earliest time points investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine if we could identify novel triggers of HSV reactivation and determine if they involved a bi-phasic mode of reactivation. We turned our attention to forskolin treatment and neuronal hyperexcitability because hyperstimulation of cortical neurons following forskolin treatment or potassium chloride mediated depolarization has previously been found to result in a global histone methyl/phospho switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Noh et al., 2015</xref>). Whether this same methyl/phospho switch occurs in different types of neurons, including sympathetic neurons, is not known. Although forskolin has previously been found to induce HSV reactivation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Regge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danaher et al., 2003</xref>), the mechanism by which forskolin induces reactivation is not known. In particular, it is unknown if forskolin acts via causing increased neuronal activity and/or as a consequence of activation of alternative cAMP-responsive proteins including PKA and CREB. Hyperexcitability of neurons is correlated with changes in cellular gene expression, increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alt and Schwer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Madabhushi et al., 2015</xref>), and epigenetic changes including H3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Noh et al., 2015</xref>). However, DLK-mediated activation of JNK has not been linked to changes in cellular gene expression nor epigenetic changes in response to hyperexcitability. Using a variety of small-molecule inhibitors, we found that forskolin-induced reactivation was dependent on ion-channel activity. In support of a role for neuronal hyperexcitability causing HSV reactivation, stimuli that are well established as causing heightened neuronal activity also induced HSV to undergo reactivation. In addition, DLK and JNK activity were required for an initial wave of viral lytic gene expression, which occurred prior to viral DNA replication and independently of histone demethylase activity, indicating that hyperstimulation-induced reactivation also involves a biphasic viral gene expression program.</p><p>We were also keen to determine whether we could identify a physiological stimulus for HSV reactivation that acts via causing neurons to enter a hyperexcitable state. IL-1β is released under conditions of psychological stress and fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ericsson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goshen and Yirmiya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koo and Duman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saper and Breder, 1994</xref>); both known triggers of clinical HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chida and Mao, 2009</xref>). IL-1β has previously been found to induce heightened neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vezzani and Viviani, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binshtok et al., 2008</xref>). However, an intriguing feature of IL-1β signaling is its ability to have differential effects on different cell types. For example, IL-1β is involved in the extrinsic immune response to infection via activation of neutrophils and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sims and Smith, 2010</xref>). In addition, it can act on non-immune cells including fibroblasts to initiate an antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orzalli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarreberg et al., 2019</xref>), as has previously been described for lytic infection with HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orzalli et al., 2018</xref>). Given these differential downstream responses to IL-1β signaling, we were particularly interested in the effects of IL-1β treatment of latently-infected neurons. Interestingly, we found that IL-1β was capable of inducing reactivation of HSV from mature sympathetic neurons. Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels impeded reactivation mediated by both forskolin and IL-1β. Activity of the cell stress protein DLK was also essential for IL-1β-mediated reactivation. We therefore identify IL-1β as a novel trigger from HSV reactivation that acts via neuronal hyperexcitability and highlight the central role of JNK activation by DLK in HSV reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased intracellular levels of cAMP induces reactivation of HSV from latent infection in murine sympathetic neurons</title><p>Both forskolin and cAMP mimetics are known to induce neuronal hyperexcitation and have previously also been found to trigger HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Regge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danaher et al., 2003</xref>). Using a model of HSV latency in mouse sympathetic neurons isolated from the superior-cervical ganglia (SCG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>) we investigated whether forskolin treatment induced reactivation in this system and the potential mechanism resulting in the initial induction of viral lytic gene expression. Sympathetic SCG neurons were infected with a Us11-GFP tagged HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benboudjema et al., 2003</xref>) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 7.5 PFU/cell in the presence of acyclovir (ACV). After 6 days the ACV was washed out and the neuronal cultures monitored to ensure that no GFP-positive neurons were present. Two days later, reactivation was triggered by addition of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). WAY150138 was added to the media post-reactivation to prevent cell-to-cell spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Newcomb and Brown, 2002</xref>). As represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, forskolin can act either extracellularly on ion channels or intracellularly to activate adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoshi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kandel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Rooij et al., 2000</xref>). Activation of adenylate cyclase results in the propagation of second-messenger pathways resulting from activation of PKA, EPAC1 (Exchange Factor directly Activated by cAMP, also known as Rap Guanine Nucleoside Exchange Factor 1) or EPAC 2. In addition, cAMP can act directly on cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, and PKA can also modulate ion-channel activity via phosphorylation. Dideoxy-forskolin (dd-forskolin) is a cell-impermeable forskolin analog that can act directly on voltage-gated ion channels but does not activate adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoshi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gandía et al., 1997</xref>). We found addition of forskolin but not dd-forskolin triggered robust HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A slight increase in GFP-positive neurons did occur with dd-forskolin treatment compared to mock (approximately 6.5-fold increase compared to a 130-fold increase for forskolin). Based on a Tukey’s multiple comparison test, this change from mock treated neurons was not significant (p=0.07), however, a direct comparison between mock and dd-forskolin using a T-test suggested a significant induction (p=0.03). Therefore, direct stimulation of ion-channels by dd-forskolin may trigger some reactivation. However, maximal reactivation requires forskolin to enter neurons. Treatment of latently-infected primary neurons with a cAMP mimetic (8-bromo-cAMP) was sufficient to trigger reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that increased intracellular levels of cAMP are capable of inducing HSV reactivation. Furthermore, inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity using SQ22, 536 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haslam et al., 1978</xref>) significantly diminished HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, activation of adenylate cyclase, which results in increased intracellular levels of cAMP, is required for robust forskolin-mediated reactivation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HSV-1 Reactivation from sympathetic neurons is induced by adenylate cyclase activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the primary sympathetic superior cervical ganglia (SCG)-derived model of HSV latency.

The previously described bi-phasic progression to viral reactivation is characterized by viral DNA replication and production of infectious virus, occurring around 48–72 hr post-stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), but with an earlier wave of lytic gene expression occurring around 20 hr post-stimulus. To determine whether forskolin-mediated reactivation results in a similar kinetics of reactivation, we investigated the timing of Us11-GFP synthesis, viral DNA replication, production of infectious virus, and lytic gene induction following forskolin treatment. In response to forskolin treatment, Us11-GFP synthesis in neurons started to appear around 48 hr post-reactivation, with more robust reactivation observed at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast to forskolin-mediated reactivation, the number of GFP-positive neurons following superinfection with a replication competent wild-type virus resulted in a rapid induction of GFP-positive neurons by 24 hr post-superinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, forskolin-triggered reactivation results in slower synthesis of Us11-GFP than superinfection. In addition, these data highlight the ability of forskolin to trigger reactivation from only a subpopulation of latently-infected neurons (approximately 1 in every 3.4 neurons compared to superinfection).</p><p>The production of infectious virus also mirrored the data for the detection of Us11-GFP-positive neurons, with a robust increase in viral titers between 24 hr and 60 hr post-stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which reflects both release of infectious virus from reactivating neurons and potentially cell-to-cell spread as WAY150138 could not be included. An increase in viral genome copy number was also not detected until 48 hr post-stimulus, which continued between 48 hr and 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The quantification of viral genome copy number was also carried out in presence of WAY-150138, therefore indicating that DNA replication occurs in reactivating neurons and not as a consequence of cell-to-cell spread.</p><p>Given the observed 48 hr delay in viral DNA replication and production of infectious virus, we were interested to determine if there was a Phase I wave of lytic gene expression that occurred prior to viral DNA replication. We therefore carried out RT-qPCR to detect representative immediate-early (<italic>ICP27</italic> and <italic>ICP4</italic>), early (<italic>ICP8</italic> and <italic>UL30</italic>), and late (<italic>UL48</italic> and <italic>gC</italic>) transcripts between 5 hr and 20 hr-post addition of forskolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> and S1C-E). For all six transcripts, a significant up-regulation of mRNA occurred at 20 hr post-treatment, including the true late gene <italic>gC</italic>, whose expression would usually only be stimulated following viral genome replication in the context of de novo lytic replication. Therefore, this indicates that lytic gene expression is induced prior to viral DNA replication and that forskolin does trigger a Phase I wave of lytic gene expression. Notably, we did detect small but reproducible induction of <italic>ICP27</italic> mRNA at 5 hr post-stimulus, followed by a second induction at 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that there is likely differential regulation of some viral lytic transcripts during Phase I reactivation induced by forskolin that is distinct from both NGF-deprivation and de novo lytic infection.</p><p>To determine whether JNK and DLK were required Phase I gene expression in response to forskolin, we investigated viral mRNA levels following forskolin-mediated reactivation in the presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125. We found a significant reduction in <italic>ICP27</italic> (2.2-fold), <italic>UL30</italic> (3.3-fold) and <italic>gC</italic> (5.5-fold) mRNA levels at 20 hr post-stimulus in the presence of SP600125 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). For all genes tested, there was no significant increase in mRNAs in the JNK inhibitor treated neurons compared to mock. We observed comparable results following treatment with the DLK inhibitor GNE-3511, with a 2.3-, 3-, 8.8-fold decrease in <italic>ICP27</italic>, <italic>UL30,</italic> and <italic>gC</italic> mRNAs, respectively, compared to forskolin treatment alone, and no significant increase in mRNA levels compared to the unreactivated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). To further confirm that DLK is required for Phase I gene expression following forskolin treatment, we depleted DLK protein using two independent shRNAs via lentivirus mediated transduction of latently infected sympathetic neurons. Transduction with the DLK targeting shRNA vectors resulted in &gt;90-fold reduction in DLK protein levels compared to the shRNA control transduced neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). We observed a significant reduction in HSV reactivation and I<italic>CP27</italic>, <italic>UL30,</italic> and gC mRNA levels at 20 hr post-forskolin treatment following transduction with either DLK shRNA lentivirus compared to the shRNA control transduced neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).</p><p>It was possible that in addition to JNK, other signal transduction proteins were important in forskolin-mediated reactivation. A previous study found that DLK can be activated by PKA, which is known to be activated by cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hao et al., 2016</xref>). However, using well a characterized inhibitor of PKA (KT 5720), we were unable to find a role for PKA in Phase I reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), although full reactivation was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). PKA has a number of downstream targets, including the transcription factor CREB, which is also involved in cellular gene expression changes in response to neuronal stimulation. Although addition of a CREB inhibitor (666-15), inhibited full reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) it did not inhibit Phase I gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Because we did not detect a role for PKA we also investigated two additional proteins that can respond to increased levels of cAMP and mediate downstream signaling responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); EPAC1/Rapgef1 (inhibited by ESI09) and EPAC2/Rapgef2 (inhibited by SQ22,536). Downstream targets of EPAC1 1 and 2 include ERK and PKC respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang and Gu, 2017</xref>). However, inhibition of EPAC1 with ESI09 did not inhibit forskolin-mediated reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). SQ22,536 is known to inhibit both adenylate cyclase and EPAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emery et al., 2013</xref>). Given that we had already found that SQ22,536 inhibited forskolin-mediated reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), to directly test the inhibition of EPAC2 by SQ22,536 in a way that bypasses adenylate cyclase we investigated the effect reactivation induced by 8-Bromo-cAMP. Addition of SQ22,536 did not prevent reactivation triggered by the cAMP mimetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that forskolin induces a Phase I wave of gene expression that does not depend on activation of PKA, EPAC1 or EPAC2 but does require DLK and JNK activity. Because additional targets of cAMP in neurons include cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, we turned our attention to the role of hyperexcitability in HSV reactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Forskolin triggers a Phase I wave of viral gene expression that is independent of histone demethylase activity</title><p>Hyperexcitability results in the propensity of neurons to fire repeated action potentials, and is associated with specific changes in histone posttranslational modifications and accumulation of nuclear cFOS.

To also indirectly probe for neuronal hyperexcitability following forskolin treatment, we also quantified nuclear cFOS accumulation and found that the intensity increased at 5 hr post-forskolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>A second reason for probing the DNA damage/repair pathway in response to forskolin treatment is that an elegant study from the Huang lab found that reactivation of HSV from latency was associated with perturbation of the DNA damage/repair response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, both inhibition of repair and exogenous DNA damage resulted in loss of AKT phosphorylation by PHLPP1, which was required for HSV reactivation. Although we did observe increased levels of γH2AX following forskolin treatment, we did not detect a concurrent loss of pAKT measured at 15 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), whereas PI3-kinase inhibition by LY294002 did result in loss of pAKT. Both PI3-kinase inhibition and forskolin treatment did result in activation of the JNK cell stress pathway, indicated by increased c-Jun phosphorylation. This indicates that HSV reactivation and JNK activation in response to forskolin treatment does not involve dephosphorylation of AKT. Therefore, hyperexcitability triggers reactivation via an alternative mechanism that does not feed into AKT phosphorylation.</p><p>Previously, we found that Phase I reactivation is accompanied with a JNK-dependent histone methyl/phospho (marked by H3K9me3/pS10) switch on lytic promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). In cortical neurons, one study has found that hyperexcitability results in increased H3K9me3/pS10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Noh et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we were particularly interested to determine whether forskolin treatment of sympathetic neurons triggered a histone S10 phosphorylation on H3K9me3. Forskolin triggered a transient increase in H3K9me3/S10p at 5 hr post-treatment that had returned to baseline by 10 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This indicates that, in keeping with cortical neurons, forskolin induces a histone H3K9me3/pS10 methyl/phospho switch on regions on cellular chromatin.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether the phospho/methyl switch that arises as a result of hyperexcitability plays a role in Phase I of HSV reactivation.

Therefore, we investigated whether histone demethylase activity was required for the initial induction in lytic gene expression following forskolin treatment.

Increasing the extracellular concentration of KCl is well-known to induce action potential firing. Therefore, we investigated the timing of both KCl and forskolin-mediated hyperexcitability in HSV reactivation.

The addition of TTX to neurons results in synaptic scaling whereby a neuron’s excitatory synaptic strength increases in response to inhibition of firing, so that when the TTX is removed the neurons enter a hyperexcitable state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee and Kirkwood, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sokolova and Mody, 2008</xref>).

However, we wished to link this response to a physiological trigger that may stimulate HSV reactivation in vivo. Increased HCN channel activity has been associated with inflammatory pain resulting from the activity of pyrogenic cytokines on neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emery et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, IL-1β is known to act on certain neurons to induce neuronal excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vezzani and Viviani, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binshtok et al., 2008</xref>). IL-1β is released in the body during times of chronic, psychological stress. In addition, IL-1β contributes to the fever response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ericsson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goshen and Yirmiya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koo and Duman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saper and Breder, 1994</xref>). In sympathetic neurons, we found that exposure of mature neurons to IL-1β induced an accumulation of the hyperexcitability-associated histone post-translational modifications γH2AX and H3K9me3/S10p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We did not observe the same changes for post-natal neurons. The precise reasons for this maturation-dependent phenotype are unknown at this point but we hypothesize it could be due to changes in the expression of cellular factors required to respond to IL-1β. Therefore, these experiments were carried out on neurons that were postnatal day 36. The kinetics of induction of these histone modifications were different from what we had previously observed for forskolin treatment, as both γH2AX and H3K9me3/S10p steadily accumulated to 20 hr post-treatment. This likely reflects the activation of upstream signaling pathways in response to IL-1β prior to inducing neuronal excitation as IL-1β is known to increase the expression of voltage-gated sodium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binshtok et al., 2008</xref>).

We also added an IL1R neutralizing antibody to verify that the response was specific to signaling via IL-1 mediated binding to its receptor. Addition of either TTX or anti-IL1R antibody resulted in a significant reduction in γH2AX and H3K9me3/S10p levels in response to IL-1β treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>), indicating that the response is directly due to IL1 and requires activity of voltage-gated sodium channels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>IL-1β Treatment of sympathetic neurons results in changes consistent with heightened neuronal excitability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adult P36 SCG neurons were treated with IL-1β (30 ng/mL) for 15 hr and stained for H3K9me3/S10p, γH2AX and beta II-tubulin to mark neurons.

HSV establishes latency in neurons and has previously been found to respond to activation of a neuronal stress signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). As an excitable cell type, the function of neurons is to rapidly transmit stimuli via the firing of action potentials, and under conditions of hyperexcitability, neurons increase their propensity to fire repeated action potentials. Here we show that this state of hyperexcitability induces HSV to undergo reactivation in a DLK/JNK-dependent manner, indicating that the virus responds to both activation of cell stress signaling and prolonged hyperexcitability via a common pathway to result in reactivation. This common pathway also permits viral lytic gene expression from silenced promoters without the requirement of histone demethylase activity via a histone methyl/phospho switch. Conditions that result in hyperexcitability include prolonged periods of stress, sun burn and inflammation, which are both linked to the release of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ericsson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goshen and Yirmiya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koo and Duman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saper and Breder, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kupper et al., 1987</xref>). Consistent with this, here we show that IL-1β induces DNA damage and histone H3 phosphorylation in sympathetic neurons, which are both markers of neuronal excitability, and causes increased responses to neurotransmitter stimulation. Importantly, IL-1β triggered HSV reactivation that was dependent on neuronal activity and activation of DLK. Therefore, this study identifies a physiological stimulus that induces HSV reactivation via increasing neuronal excitability and places DLK/JNK signaling and a histone phospho/methyl switch as central to HSV reactivation.</p><p>In this study, we employed an in vitro system using primary murine sympathetic neurons. In vitro systems using primary neurons from rats and mice or differentiated embryonic human neurons are now being used in many laboratories to elucidate molecular mechanisms of HSV latency and reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thellman and Triezenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edwards and Bloom, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Aiuto et al., 2019</xref>). Model systems for lytic replication commonly use fetal or new born fibroblasts. These model systems come with the caveat that viral replication, entry into latency and reactivation take place in the absence of the host immune response. In particular for latency, where there is a complex interplay between the host immune response and infected neurons during the establishment and reactivation from latency, and latency in humans occurs over a period of decades. There is also evidence of persistent immune infiltration into the ganglia that correlates with herpesvirus latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Theil et al., 2003</xref>). However, in vitro systems are powerful for identifying neuronal pathways important for different phases of reactivation reactivation, adding back components of the host immune response at specific times and investigating the role of viral gene products solely in reactivation.</p><p>Experiments using primary neuronal in vitro model systems and inducing reactivation by PI3-kinase inhibition have shown that reactivation in these models involves two phases. Importantly, these in vitro models permit the dissection of rapid molecular events that may be difficult to observe in in vivo models. Phase I involves the synchronous up-regulation of lytic gene expression that occurs independently of the viral transactivator VP16 and the activity of cellular histone demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). Synchronous induction of lytic gene expression has also been observed in an ex vivo model of HSV reactivation induced by axotomy combined with inhibition of NGF-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Du et al., 2011</xref>). A population of neurons progresses to full reactivation (Phase II), which is dependent on both VP16 and HDM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). We previously found that lytic gene expression in Phase I is DLK/JNK-dependent and is correlated with a JNK-dependent histone methyl/phospho switch on lytic gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>). Here we demonstrate that a Phase I wave of viral gene expression that is dependent on activation of JNK but not histone demethylases also occurs in response to forskolin. The co-localization of viral genomes with H3K9me3/pS10 indicates that a histone methyl/phospho switch also permits lytic gene expression to occur following forskolin treatment in a manner that is independent of HDM activity. This indicates that reactivation proceeds via a Phase I-wave of gene expression in response to multiple different stimuli. However, we note that there may be differences in the mechanism and kinetics of reactivation with different stimuli and/or strains of HSV-1 as reactivation triggered by axotomy or heat shock following infection with a more pathogenic strain of HSV may bypass Phase I or occur more rapidly, making Phase I difficult to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cliffe and Wilson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doll et al., 2020</xref>). It will be especially interesting to determine in the future whether there are differences in the progression to reactivation with different strains of HSV, further elucidate the underlying progression to reactivation and requirements for Phase I. Ultimately, reactivation kinetics may relate to differences in the epigenetic structures of viral genomes that vary based on virus strains or differential manipulation of host-cell signaling pathways.</p><p>The host immune response should also be taken into account when considering the progression to full reactivation. The interplay between the host immune response and progression to reactivation is complex and differential responses likely inhibit, or as this study suggests, even promote different phases of the reactivation pathway. The presence of IFN can prevent Phase I reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Linderman et al., 2017</xref>). CD8 T cells have been linked to controlling HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Divito et al., 2006</xref>), and regulatory T cells have been found to facilitate HSV reactivation in an in vivo model by suppressing CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). However, a recent in vivo study found that Iba+ phagocytic cells play a key role clearing reactivating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doll et al., 2020</xref>), which required viral DNA replication. HSV latency is not fully silent, with detectible lytic gene expression in infected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singh and Tscharke, 2020</xref>). Stimuli, including IL-1, enhanced neuronal excitation and neuronal stress likely contribute to bursts of lytic gene expression in vivo, but full reactivation could be controlled by the host immune response. Because of the potential link between HSV infection and the progression of neurodegenerative disease, understanding the mechanism of ‘leaky’ latency, how this is controlled by the host immune response and any potential effects on neuronal function will be especially important.</p><p>The Wilcox lab demonstrated in 1992 that reactivation can be induced by forskolin, and it has since been used as a trigger in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Regge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danaher et al., 2003</xref>). However, the mechanism by which increasing levels of cAMP induces lytic gene expression was not known. Here, we link cAMP-induced reactivation to the excitation state of the neuron and show that the initial induction of viral gene expression is dependent on DLK and JNK activity but independent of CREB and PKA. The activity of PKA may be required for full reactivation, which is also consistent with a role for PKA in overcoming repression of the related Pseudorabies Virus during de novo axonal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koyuncu et al., 2017</xref>). Our data also suggest that CREB may be involved in the progression to full reactivation. However, the mechanism of action of the inhibitor used here, 666–15, is not entirely clear. It has been reported as preventing CREB-mediated gene expression, but may act to prevent recruitment of histone acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xie et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of Phase II reactivation by 666–15 would be consistent with more large-scale chromatin remodeling on the viral genome at this stage. In addition, previous work has identified a role for inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER) in HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgin et al., 2001</xref>). ICER is a repressor of gene expression that acts via heterodimerization with members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. CREB expression is also down-regulated by loss of NGF-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riccio et al., 1999</xref>), a known trigger of HSV reactivation. Therefore, it is conceivable that inhibition, rather than activation, of CREB is important for reactivation of HSV from latency.</p><p>Neuronal hyperexcitability results in DNA damage followed by repair, which together are thought to mediate the expression of cellular immediate-early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alt and Schwer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Madabhushi et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that forskolin treatment and IL-1β also induce DNA damage in sympathetic neurons. Previously, HSV reactivation has been found to occur following inhibition of DNA damage, inhibition of repair, and exogenous DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). In the context of repair inhibition or exogenous DNA damage, reactivation was dependent on dephosphorylation of AKT by the PHLPP1 phosphatase and activation of JNK, and therefore feeds into the same pathway as PI3K-inhibition. However, we did not observe decreased AKT phosphorylation in response to forskolin treatment, indicating that the mechanism of reactivation is distinct following physiological levels of DNA damage resulting from neuronal hyperexcitability versus perturbation of the damage/repair pathways.</p><p>Conditions that result in hyperexcitability include prolonged periods of stress and inflammation, which are both linked to the release of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ericsson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goshen and Yirmiya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koo and Duman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saper and Breder, 1994</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we show that IL-1β treatment induces two markers of neuronal excitability, DNA damage and histone H3 phosphorylation, in primary sympathetic neurons in addition to promoting a heightened excitation response to acetylcholine. The IL-1 family of cytokines act via the IL-1 receptor to activate downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). IL-1α, which also signals via the IL-1R, is released locally as an alarmin. Interestingly, IL-1α and IL-1β are found at high levels in keratinocytes and are released upon HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orzalli et al., 2018</xref>), where they can mediate antiviral responses in underlying stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Notably, upon UVB radiation exposure, keratinocytes and corneal epithelial cells upregulate and release IL-1α and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kupper et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keadle et al., 2000</xref>), potentially linking cytokine and alarmin release from keratinocytes to reactivation of HSV following UV damage. It should also be noted that additional cytokines and growth factors are released from keratinocytes upon damage, including NGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tron et al., 1990</xref>). Although deprivation of NGF results in activation of a neuronal cell stress pathway that can induce HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cliffe et al., 2015</xref>), exposure of neurons to increased levels of NGF can cause them to become hyperexcitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McMahon, 1996</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the correct balance of neurotrophin levels may balance HSV latency, akin to how the correct balance of DNA damage and repair is also required to maintain latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cliffe, 2019</xref>). It will be incredibly interesting to determine how neurotrophin balance, cytokine release and hyperexcitability converge to regulate HSV latency in vivo. Although there is no direct evidence as yet for neuronal excitability inducing reactivation in an in vivo model, a commonly used trigger for HSV reactivation, axotomy, can directly induce hyperexcitability and also result in IL-1β release from satellite glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanani and Spray, 2020</xref>). Thermal stress is used as an in vivo trigger of HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sawtell and Thompson, 1992</xref>), which can also cause increased neuronal firing of nociceptor sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Paricio-Montesinos et al., 2020</xref>). IL-6, which is also a known-inducer of neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vezzani and Viviani, 2015</xref>), has been linked to heat stress-induced HSV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Noisakran et al., 1998</xref>). However, a direct role for hyperexcitability and/or IL-1 remains to be explored in this or other in vivo models of HSV reactivation.</p><p>Previously, we found that JNK activation by DLK is required for reactivation following interruption of the NGF-signaling pathway. Here, we find that forskolin and IL-1β-mediated reactivation also required DLK activity, further reinforcing the central role of DLK and JNK in reactivation of HSV from latency. DLK is known as a master regulator of a neuronal response to stress stimuli and mediates whole cell death, axon pruning, regeneration or degeneration depending on the nature of the stimuli. However, it has not before been linked to neuronal hyperexcitability or the response to IL-1β signaling. The known mechanisms of DLK activation include loss of AKT activation and phosphorylation by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), neither of which could be linked to HSV reactivation mediated by forskolin in this study. Following activation by DLK, one mechanism by which JNK is thought to permit lytic gene expression is via recruitment to viral promoters and histone phosphorylation. However, it is likely that there are additional, JNK-dependent effects including activation of pioneer or transcription factors that also mediate viral gene expression. Further insight into how HSV has hijacked this cellular pathway to induce lytic gene expression may lead to novel therapeutics that prevent reactivation, in addition to providing information on how viral gene expression initiates from promoters assembled into heterochromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, M/F)</td><td valign="top">CD1</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">Crl:CD1(ICR)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Human herpesvirus 1</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HSV Us11-GFP</td><td valign="top">I gift from Ian Mohr, NYU.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work addresses the key question how the herpesvirus HSV-1 reactivates from latency in neurons and shows that neuronal excitability plays a major role for controlling latency and reactivation. How hyperexcitability might influence the behavior of a latent, neurotrophic virus was previously unknown, and the authors show that neuronal hyperexcitability induces HSV reactivation in a DLK/<italic>JNK</italic>-dependent manner. In additon, the authors identify the cytokine IL-1β as a stimulus that triggers HSV reactivation in neurons, dependent on neuronal excitability, which is also a novel finding and of great interest for the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that your work about the potential link between IL1β, neuronal hyperexcitability, and HSV-1 reactivation is very interesting. However, we think that the three experiments listed below would be needed to substantiate the conclusion regarding the link between these three elements.</p><p>1) To make sure that the results obtained with the inhibitors are not off-target effects, experiments with KO cells or siRNA knockdowns of DLK/<italic>JNK</italic> would strengthen the manuscript. Can you please specify in the manuscript the specific targets of the three inhibitors that were used – if they have discrete mechanisms of action, off-target effects may actually not be a problem. However, KO or knockdown experiments would validate the inhibitor results by an independent method and should be doable in these cultures.</p><p>2) To substantiate the very interesting finding with IL1β, an experiment with a neutralizing IL1β antibody should be performed to unequivocally show that IL1β induces reactivation (this would exclude that impurities in the cytokine batch such as LPS activate the cells).</p><p>3) To unequivocally show that IL1β induces reactivation through increasing neuronal hyperexcitability, calcium flux, which is induced by neuronal hyperexcitability, should be measured. A simple method to do this would be the use of Fura-2 AM or similar dyes. An advantage of this approach is that it could be measured what percentage of neurons are excited upon IL1β treatment and this could be correlated with the percentage of neurons that reactivate. This could also be performed in the presence of IL1β neutralizing antibodies to confirm that this cytokine induces neuronal hyperexcitability and HSV-1 reactivation.</p><p>These three additional experiments would make the report more robust and elegantly correlate hyperexcitability of neurons with HSV-1 reactivation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Cuddy et al., entitled &quot;Neuronal hyperexcitability is a DLK-dependent trigger of HSV-1 reactivation that can be induced by IL-1&quot; aims at discovering and characterizing novel stimuli that lead to reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV).</p><p>They show that reactivation can occur upon addition of compounds that induce neuronal excitability and that inhibitors of this process reduce reactivation. They also show that interleukin 1 β (IL1β) induces HSV reactivation, linked it to neuronal excitability and suggest that this may be a reactivation trigger in vivo during situations in which IL1β expression is enhanced (e.g., fever, stress).</p><p>The work is very interesting, solid and well performed but it requires certain controls and experiments to support the claims of the authors.</p><p>1) The authors indicate that the compounds used induce neuronal hyperexcitability and that this is demonstrated by the detection of DLK, gH2AX, indicative of DNA damage, and H3K9me/S10p. These are indirect readouts of neuronal excitability. To prove that there is such excitability the authors should perform other assays, such as patch clamp. This is of particular importance to prove that IL1β-induced reactivation is mediated by induction of neuronal excitability.</p><p>2) Similarly, the authors base most of their conclusions on the use of inhibitors of certain pathways. This is a valid approach but it will be better to complement it with KD or KO experiments due to the potential unspecific effect of the inhibitors, especially if the concentration used is much higher than their Ki (e.g., 4 μm of GNE-3511 when its Ki is 0.5 nM). For instance ZD 7288 is not a specific inhibitor of HCN channels since it also blocks Na currents (Wu et al., 2012). They should use KD or KO at least for experiments dealing with the effect of IL1β in reactivation and its potential link to DLK. There are published reports on other topics using KD and KO for IL1β (or its receptor) and DLK KD and conditional KO.</p><p>3) Regarding IL1β, there are not data in the manuscript showing how active the recombinant protein used is. It would be important to test the activity of IL1β in a classic assay such as proliferation to know the amount of units that are needed to induce reactivation and whether this would correspond to physiological levels. Moreover, since some of these recombinant proteins may contain impurities that activate other signaling cascades, it is important to know the specificity of IL1β signaling in this process. The authors could use neutralizing antibodies blocking IL1β or its receptor (or KD/KO as above) and then measure HSV reactivation. What is the level of IL1β receptor in the neurons used in these experiments?</p><p>4) The use of imaging techniques to show histone modifications should be complemented by ChIP assays, especially when investigating the effect of IL1β and neuronal hyperexcitability and reactivation. They should investigate these modifications at least on control cellular genes and HSV IE and E genes upon addition of IL1β and conditions of neuronal excitability. The authors are experts on this type of assay.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript focuses on the hypothesis that reactivation of HSV in cultures of primary neonatal mouse sympathetic neurons is triggered by neuronal hyperexcitibility. Understanding the triggers and signaling pathways that activate the latent HSV genome in the individual latently infected neuron remains an important and challenging question. The authors utilize a mouse superior cervical ganglion neuronal culture model of short term latency. Latency is forced through suppression of viral replication using the antiviral DNA chain terminator acyclovir (ACV) and the cultures are infected with an moi of 7.5 pfu/cell in its presence. After 6 days, ACV is removed and two days later, these cultures are considered latently infected and reactivation triggers and inhibitors are applied. In this model, activation occurs in ~2% of the neurons, presumably 100% latently infected. Thus even in this culture system, a minor subset of the neurons actually undergo reactivation despite the application of the compounds to all of the neurons in the well, making analysis at the individual neuron level critical but absent in this study in certain key analyses.</p><p>1) The stated aim of this study is to &quot;…. identify novel triggers of HSV reactivation and determine if they involved a bi-phasic mode of reactivation.&quot; The authors utilize a series of antagonists, agonists, and inhibitors on the cultures. These authors confirm previous studies by others using this model showing that forskolin, like NGF withdrawal, results in the activation of the viral lytic cycle. There are several novel observations that are of interest. However, it is this reviewer's opinion that in the absence of any measurement of excitability in these neurons (cultures) is problematic considering the impact that ongoing HSV infection may have on the physiological properties of the neurons and their responses to commonly used agents. There is the assumption that the electrophysiological effect of the agents added to the cultures is totally predictable. This is not so straightforward. For example, it has been reported that forskolin reduces excitability of SCG neurons by enhancing the spike frequency-dependent adaptation. FSK reduced the number of spikes from 8 to 2. doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126365. While an argument for a role of hyperexcitibility can be made from the studies, the strong stance taken throughout the manuscript and including the title is not warranted. While the authors' observations are consistent with the connection between neuronal excitation and reactivation, this has been shown in 2003 in a similar culture model in which the calcium-dependent activation of VR-1 channel resulted in HSV reactivation. &quot;A common feature of all of these reactivation stimuli (including forskolin) is hyperexcitation of the neuron resulting in elevated calcium cause by VR-1 activation.&quot; doi 10.1099/vir.0.18828-0.</p><p>2) In this study, advances in drawing links between the viral genome and histone modifications that could potentially be associated with the observed increase in transcriptional activity from the genome (phospohmethyl switch) have been made but fall short of showing a connection to reactivation. While &quot;reactivation&quot; is loosely used throughout the manuscript, it is a term that has a meaning and is based on infectious virus production from a previously latent viral genome. The use of Us11GFP as a surrogate marker is understandable and acceptable. However, reactivation is not the detection of transcriptional fluctuations from the viral genome. This is a well-recognized feature of in vivo viral latency. This low level of virally related RNA is not necessarily limited to gene coding regions and not associated with detectable viral protein expression or infectious virus (ie not associated with reactivation). In this culture model whether changes in transcripts observed in phase I are required for Phase II is not clear. The localization of these Phase I transcripts is not known nor do we know their magnitude. Do the phase I transcripts localize to neurons in which the viral genome is associated with HeK9me3/S10p? Are these the neurons that proceed to reactivation? The potential biological significance of the data could be better appreciated if the authors tied these changes together. It is difficult to appreciate the biological relevance of the viral RNA detected since it is presented as a value normalized to the levels in control cultures prior to induction. The level of virally related RNA present in the cultures prior to induction is important information. This data presentation style is also an issue with the number of EdC labelled neurons in the culture. Assuming that the cultures were infected at the same moi as US11GFP virus, all of the neurons would be expected to contain labelled HSV DNA. The % of the neurons in the cultures that contain EdC labelled viral DNA should be included but only normalized values are given.</p><p>3) The wt superinfection experiment is quite interesting and seems to reveal that only a small portion of the neurons in the culture either contain the viral genome or contain reactivation competent genomes. Presumably, there are ~10,000 neurons/well. The infected cultures were superinfected with wt virus at an moi of 10. This would result in all neurons being superinfected, the vast majority with multiple wild type virions. Presumably this is known. The expectation would be that the wt virus would activate the US11GFP genome and most or all of the neurons would express GFP. Variations on this type of superinfection experiment have been done many times and reported in the literature. It is surprising that only ~650 of the 10,000 neurons expressed GFP. Does this suggest that most of the neurons do not contain reactivation competent &quot;latent&quot; DNA and what are the implications of this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Using a powerful neuronal culture model of HSV latency and reactivation, Cuddy et al. establish how fundamental parameters of neuronal cell physiology regulate critical aspects of the virus latency program at the molecular, mechanistic level. The work addresses a key, long-standing knowledge gap that has remained intractable for some time by directly addressing the role of neuronal excitability and its role in controlling latency and reactivation. While neuron hyperexcitability enables firing of repeated action potentials, how this basic property of an excitable host cell type might influence the behavior of a resident latent, neurotrophic virus was unknown. The authors definitively establish that neuronal hyperexcitability, modeled by forskolin or cAMP mimetic treatment, induces HSV reactivation in a DLK/<italic>JNK</italic>-dependent manner. This indicates that latent HSV1 responds to both axonal stress signaling and prolonged hyperexcitability via a common pathway (DLK/<italic>JNK</italic>) to result in reactivation. They go on to show that neuronal hyperexcitability and neuronal activity trigger reactivation via a histone phospho/methyl switch (H3K9me3/S10p), which enables Phase I viral gene expression from epigenetically silenced genomes containing repressive histone methylation marks. Most significantly, the authors' establish that reactivation dependent upon DLK/<italic>JNK</italic> was induced by (i) forskolin and obviated by blocking hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated (HCN) channels that are normally activated by membrane hyper-polarization; (ii) chronic neuronal excitability in response to extracellular [KCl]; and (iii) direct induction of neuronal hyperexcitability by release from a tetrodotoxin (TTX) block. Finally, they identify IL-1β, a known mediator of prolonged stress inflammation, and neuronal hyperexcitability, as a physiological stimulus that triggers HSV reactivation in mature neurons. IL1β induced reactivation was suppressed by TTX, an inhibitor of voltage gated sodium channels, indicating that IL1β triggers reactivation by increasing neuronal activity. Reactivation induced by IL1β was similarly dependent upon DLK/<italic>JNK</italic> signaling via a histone phospho/ methyl switch that triggers viral genome wide expression (Phase 1).</p><p>The experiments are well executed, the data are appropriately rigorous and convincing and the manuscript is well written. The study makes important, exciting findings by answering long-standing, highly significant questions regarding molecular mechanisms that have been nearly impossible to investigate in small animal models. It will undoubtedly have an oversized impact on the field and provides fundamental insight on understanding how a neurotrophic pathogen colonizes a host neuron, remains in an epigenetically silenced state, and periodically re-emerges to replicate productively in response to neuronal excitability. It will be of interest to a wide readership interested in neuronal cell biology, infection biology, stress responses and the epigenetic control of gene expression.</p><p>I have no further experiments to suggest that will improve this already terrific study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58037.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that your work about the potential link between IL1β, neuronal hyperexcitability, and HSV-1 reactivation is very interesting. However, we think that the three experiments listed below would be needed to substantiate the conclusion regarding the link between these three elements.</p><p>1) To make sure that the results obtained with the inhibitors are not off-target effects, experiments with KO cells or siRNA knockdowns of DLK/JNK would strengthen the manuscript. Can you please specify in the manuscript the specific targets of the three inhibitors that were used – if they have discrete mechanisms of action, off-target effects may actually not be a problem. However, KO or knockdown experiments would validate the inhibitor results by an independent method and should be doable in these cultures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more details on the published specificity of the DLK inhibitor used. We have also validated the DLK inhibitor data by knock down with 2 independent shRNAs and shown that this inhibits HSV reactivation and Phase I gene expression following forskolin treatment, in addition to reactivation in response to release from a tetrodotoxin block and following IL-1 treatment. Knock-down of JNK itself is more challenging because there are three <italic>JNK</italic> encoding genes expressed in sympathetic neurons. However, because JNK is activated by DLK in neurons we are convinced that the combined data using JNK and DLK inhibitors in addition to the DLK knock-down experiments demonstrate a requirement for DLK in hyperexcitability-induced HSV reactivation.</p><p>We have also added more information on the mechanisms of action of the three HCN channel inhibitors. We have not performed knockdown of the HCN channels because there are four possible HCN channels expressed in sympathetic neurons and we have been unable to be sure of the specificity of available antibodies to know which are present. This is why we confirmed the data using the HCN channel inhibitor (ZD7288) with two additional HCN channel blockers. However, we have also changed the wording of the manuscript to acknowledge that ZD7288 can also inhibit voltage gated sodium channel activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To substantiate the very interesting finding with IL1β, an experiment with a neutralizing IL1β antibody should be performed to unequivocally show that IL1β induces reactivation (this would exclude that impurities in the cytokine batch such as LPS activate the cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to the possibility of impurities in the IL-1β. To confirm that our observed phenotypes are linked to IL-1 specifically and not impurities in the cytokine batch, we have performed experiments with an IL1 RI neutralizing antibody. We have found that this inhibits reactivation in response to IL-1 treatment in addition to inhibiting histone phosphorylation and IL-1 mediated increased neuronal excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To unequivocally show that IL1β induces reactivation through increasing neuronal hyperexcitability, calcium flux, which is induced by neuronal hyperexcitability, should be measured. A simple method to do this would be the use of Fura-2 AM or similar dyes. An advantage of this approach is that it could be measured what percentage of neurons are excited upon IL1β treatment and this could be correlated with the percentage of neurons that reactivate. This could also be performed in the presence of IL1β neutralizing antibodies to confirm that this cytokine induces neuronal hyperexcitability and HSV-1 reactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now carried out calcium flux experiments in IL-1 treated neurons and demonstrated that sympathetic neurons exhibit increased intracellular calcium flux following stimulation when pre-treated with IL-1β. This response was inhibited by co-treatment with the IL-1R blocking antibody.</p><p>The reviewers do bring up an interesting point concerning the fraction of neurons capable of undergoing reactivation with IL-1 treatment. We also performed additional experiments showing that the fraction of neurons reactivating with IL-1 is comparable to the fraction reactivating with forskolin treatment. The ability of only a subpopulation of latently infected neurons to undergo reactivation could be due to heterogeneity in neuronal excitation, which we do observe based on the calcium imaging. However, there are likely many factors that contribute to reactivation efficiency including heterogeneity in viral latent gene expression and epigenetic structure of the latent viral genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These three additional experiments would make the report more robust and elegantly correlate hyperexcitability of neurons with HSV-1 reactivation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Cuddy et al., entitled &quot;Neuronal hyperexcitability is a DLK-dependent trigger of HSV-1 reactivation that can be induced by IL-1&quot; aims at discovering and characterizing novel stimuli that lead to reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV).</p><p>They show that reactivation can occur upon addition of compounds that induce neuronal excitability and that inhibitors of this process reduce reactivation. They also show that interleukin 1 β (IL1β) induces HSV reactivation, linked it to neuronal excitability and suggest that this may be a reactivation trigger in vivo during situations in which IL1β expression is enhanced (e.g., fever, stress).</p><p>The work is very interesting, solid and well performed but it requires certain controls and experiments to support the claims of the authors.</p><p>1) The authors indicate that the compounds used induce neuronal hyperexcitability and that this is demonstrated by the detection of DLK, gH2AX, indicative of DNA damage, and H3K9me/S10p. These are indirect readouts of neuronal excitability. To prove that there is such excitability the authors should perform other assays, such as patch clamp. This is of particular importance to prove that IL1β-induced reactivation is mediated by induction of neuronal excitability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now carried out calcium flux experiments in IL-1 treated neurons and demonstrated that sympathetic neurons exhibit increased intracellular calcium flux following stimulation when pre-treated with IL-1β.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the authors base most of their conclusions on the use of inhibitors of certain pathways. This is a valid approach but it will be better to complement it with KD or KO experiments due to the potential unspecific effect of the inhibitors, especially if the concentration used is much higher than their Ki (e.g., 4 μm of GNE-3511 when its Ki is 0.5 nM). For instance ZD 7288 is not a specific inhibitor of HCN channels since it also blocks Na currents (Wu et al., 2012). They should use KD or KO at least for experiments dealing with the effect of IL1β in reactivation and its potential link to DLK. There are published reports on other topics using KD and KO for IL1β (or its receptor) and DLK KD and conditional KO.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm the link to DLK we have performed DLK shRNA knock-down experiments using 2 independent shRNAs and found that this inhibits HSV reactivation and Phase I gene expression following forskolin treatment, in addition to reactivation in response to release from a tetrodotoxin block and following IL-1 treatment.</p><p>We have also amended the text in regards to ZD 7288.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding IL1β, there are not data in the manuscript showing how active the recombinant protein used is. It would be important to test the activity of IL1β in a classic assay such as proliferation to know the amount of units that are needed to induce reactivation and whether this would correspond to physiological levels. Moreover, since some of these recombinant proteins may contain impurities that activate other signaling cascades, it is important to know the specificity of IL1β signaling in this process. The authors could use neutralizing antibodies blocking IL1β or its receptor (or KD/KO as above) and then measure HSV reactivation. What is the level of IL1β receptor in the neurons used in these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>The IL-1β used I has ED50 = 1.09 pg/mL based on proliferation of D10S cells, according to the certificate of analysis. This is equivalent to 9.2 x 10<sup>8</sup> units/mg. The units have been added into the Materials and methods. The reviewer does raise an interesting point concerning exposure of neurons to IL-1 and local versus systemic concentrations. To our knowledge, the serum concentration of IL-1β during fever is less than the concentration of recombinant IL-1β used here (1-1000pg/ml compared to 30ng/ml here). However, it is harder to assess the physiological level of IL-1 exposure to a neuron, especially since IL-1α/β can be release in high levels by epithelial cells, which will be in close proximity to neurites. In addition, satellite glial cells, which are found in close proximity to the somas of peripheral neurons are known producers of IL-1. Therefore, the exact physiological concentration of IL-1 to which a neuron can be exposed is incredibly challenging to assess.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to the possibility of impurities in the IL-1β. To confirm that our observed phenotypes are linked to IL-1 specifically and not impurities in the cytokine batch, we have performed experiments with an anti-ILR blocking antibody. We have found that this inhibits reactivation in response to IL-1 treatment in addition to inhibiting histone phosphorylation and IL-1 mediated increased neuronal excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of imaging techniques to show histone modifications should be complemented by ChIP assays, especially when investigating the effect of IL1β and neuronal hyperexcitability and reactivation. They should investigate these modifications at least on control cellular genes and HSV IE and E genes upon addition of IL1β and conditions of neuronal excitability. The authors are experts on this type of assay.</p></disp-quote><p>While we are experts at performing ChIP assays, each replicate requires around 30 mice and needs repeating about 5 times and would likely need multiple time points. The imaging approach gives valuable information on the co-localization of viral genomes with the histone phospho/methyl switch on a single neuron basis and accounts for the heterogeneity in the viral genome epigenetic structure. In the future we hope to perform additional studies on the epigenetic changes over the course of hyperexcitability-mediated reactivation and whether we can develop novel approaches that probe the nature of the heterogeneity. We hope that the reviewer appreciates the scale of these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript focuses on the hypothesis that reactivation of HSV in cultures of primary neonatal mouse sympathetic neurons is triggered by neuronal hyperexcitibility. Understanding the triggers and signaling pathways that activate the latent HSV genome in the individual latently infected neuron remains an important and challenging question. The authors utilize a mouse superior cervical ganglion neuronal culture model of short term latency. Latency is forced through suppression of viral replication using the antiviral DNA chain terminator acyclovir (ACV) and the cultures are infected with an moi of 7.5 pfu/cell in its presence. After 6 days, ACV is removed and two days later, these cultures are considered latently infected and reactivation triggers and inhibitors are applied. In this model, activation occurs in ~2% of the neurons, presumably 100% latently infected. Thus even in this culture system, a minor subset of the neurons actually undergo reactivation despite the application of the compounds to all of the neurons in the well, making analysis at the individual neuron level critical but absent in this study in certain key analyses.</p><p>1) The stated aim of this study is to &quot;…. identify novel triggers of HSV reactivation and determine if they involved a bi-phasic mode of reactivation.&quot; The authors utilize a series of antagonists, agonists, and inhibitors on the cultures. These authors confirm previous studies by others using this model showing that forskolin, like NGF withdrawal, results in the activation of the viral lytic cycle. There are several novel observations that are of interest. However, it is this reviewer's opinion that in the absence of any measurement of excitability in these neurons (cultures) is problematic considering the impact that ongoing HSV infection may have on the physiological properties of the neurons and their responses to commonly used agents. There is the assumption that the electrophysiological effect of the agents added to the cultures is totally predictable. This is not so straightforward. For example, it has been reported that forskolin reduces excitability of SCG neurons by enhancing the spike frequency-dependent adaptation. FSK reduced the number of spikes from 8 to 2. doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126365. While an argument for a role of hyperexcitibility can be made from the studies, the strong stance taken throughout the manuscript and including the title is not warranted. While the authors' observations are consistent with the connection between neuronal excitation and reactivation, this has been shown in 2003 in a similar culture model in which the calcium-dependent activation of VR-1 channel resulted in HSV reactivation. &quot;A common feature of all of these reactivation stimuli (including forskolin) is hyperexcitation of the neuron resulting in elevated calcium cause by VR-1 activation.&quot; doi 10.1099/vir.0.18828-0.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the text to reflect the reviewer’s comments with regarding forskolin. However, we do use multiple inhibitors that all function to block neuronal excitation. In addition to forskolin, we show that reactivation can be directly induced via release from a tetrodotoxin block and potassium chloride.</p><p>We have also added addition data demonstrating that IL-1 treatment induces an increase in neuronal firing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In this study, advances in drawing links between the viral genome and histone modifications that could potentially be associated with the observed increase in transcriptional activity from the genome (phospohmethyl switch) have been made but fall short of showing a connection to reactivation.

The use of Us11GFP as a surrogate marker is understandable and acceptable. However, reactivation is not the detection of transcriptional fluctuations from the viral genome. This is a well-recognized feature of in vivo viral latency.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the phosho/methyl switch occurs prior to full reactivation of the virus in this system. In addition, the reviewer brings up an interesting point that fluctuations do occur in latency in vivo in mouse models. We predict that such fluctuations are linked to the state of the neuron; for example, Ma et al., 2014, found that latent neurons undergoing fluctuations in lytic gene expression had increased expression of <italic>Bim</italic>, a gene known to be induced following activation of DLK/JNK in neurons. Therefore, it is possible that small fluctuations in lytic gene expression or abortive reactivation does occur in vivo and could be associated with JNK activity and potentially a phospho/methyl switch.</p><p>Because of the repressed state of the viral genome in latency, we predict that there are likely many changes that occur on the viral genome prior to full packaging in the viral particle (and hence fully reactivating). We hope that the reviewer appreciates the value in understanding the early changes that occur on the viral genome following a reactivation stimulus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This low level of virally related RNA is not necessarily limited to gene coding regions and not associated with detectable viral protein expression or infectious virus (ie not associated with reactivation).

There are many unanswered questions on the progression to full viral reactivation that will require multiple future studies and we hope the reviewer and others can use our study to build on and answer these important and challenging questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to appreciate the biological relevance of the viral RNA detected since it is presented as a value normalized to the levels in control cultures prior to induction. The level of virally related RNA present in the cultures prior to induction is important information.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of relative expression is standard from multiple studies in the field. The values for our mock treated, latently infected neurons are close to the limit of detection of our assay. In terms of gene expression, mRNA levels are relative at any one time and even silenced genes are unlikely to be fully silencing in all cells all the time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This data presentation style is also an issue with the number of EdC labelled neurons in the culture. Assuming that the cultures were infected at the same moi as US11GFP virus, all of the neurons would be expected to contain labelled HSV DNA. The % of the neurons in the cultures that contain EdC labelled viral DNA should be included but only normalized values are given.</p></disp-quote><p>The normalized values are given so that the proportion of viral genomes that are co-localizing with the histone phospho-methyl switch. When working with primary neuronal systems there is a great deal of heterogeneity including the proportion of latently infected neurons from one field of view to another. This is why we perform a high number of replicates in all our experiments. However, this does require quantification of the proportion of latently infected neurons using click-chemistry where multiple images through the Z-plane of the neurons are required to find genomes the 3-dimensional neuronal nucleus. This is much more challenging than in fibroblasts. For this reason, we felt that the proportion of neurons that we imaged in an unbiased fashion that can be found co-localized with the phospho/methyl switch would be the best approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The wt superinfection experiment is quite interesting and seems to reveal that only a small portion of the neurons in the culture either contain the viral genome or contain reactivation competent genomes.

Variations on this type of superinfection experiment have been done many times and reported in the literature. It is surprising that only ~650 of the 10,000 neurons expressed GFP. Does this suggest that most of the neurons do not contain reactivation competent &quot;latent&quot; DNA and what are the implications of this?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this does mean that many neurons do not contain reactivation competent genomes, with more reactivation occurring in response to superinfection compared to forskolin. This is not unique to our model and model systems using axotomy or in vivo reactivation also exhibit low levels of reactivation (and for heat-shock in vivo between 50-65 neurons in total have been reported as reactivating; Thompson et al., 2009). It is not surprising that superinfection results in increased reactivation compared to forskolin. However, the numbers for superinfection do indicate that there could be genomes that are unable to undergo reactivation. As mentioned above, quantifying the exact number of infected neurons is challenging, but based on the fields of view we have imaged viral genomes appear to be present in 40-50% of neurons. The number of surviving neurons after dissection is approximately 5,000-7,500. Therefore, the number of latently infected neurons is approximately 2,000-3,750/well. However, what also needs to be factored in here is the consequence of superinfection itself. Neurons are much more repressive for lytic infection; most studies thus far using superinfection have been performed in fibroblasts to show re-expression of lytic transcripts from quiescent, replication defective viral genomes. Using the same MOI with a reporter virus that is unable to spread cell-to-cell, we have found that the virus undergoes lytic replication in only a fraction of neurons.</p><p>There are many implications for this low induction of reactivation, which may relate to the heterogeneity of the neuron themselves, differences in the epigenetic structure of the viral genome from one neuron to another or even communication between cells that limits reactivation from neighboring cells. We are currently carrying out studies investigating the outcome of neuronal infection at the single cell basis. There is much work to be done that is beyond the scope of this publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
