id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>World Health Organization has called for research into predictive factors for selecting persons who could be successfully treated with shorter durations of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C. We evaluated early virological response as a means of shortening treatment and explored host, viral and pharmacokinetic contributors to treatment outcome.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Duration of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) was determined according to day 2 (D2) virologic response for HCV genotype (gt) 1- or 6-infected adults in Vietnam with mild liver disease. Participants received 4- or 8-week treatment according to whether D2 HCV RNA was above or below 500 IU/ml (standard duration is 12 weeks). Primary endpoint was sustained virological response (SVR12). Those failing therapy were retreated with 12 weeks SOF/DCV. Host IFNL4 genotype and viral sequencing was performed at baseline, with repeat viral sequencing if virological rebound was observed. Levels of SOF, its inactive metabolite GS-331007 and DCV were measured on days 0 and 28.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Of 52 adults enrolled, 34 received 4 weeks SOF/DCV, 17 got 8 weeks and 1 withdrew. SVR12 was achieved in 21/34 (62%) treated for 4 weeks, and 17/17 (100%) treated for 8 weeks. Overall, 38/51 (75%) were cured with first-line treatment (mean duration 37 days). Despite a high prevalence of putative NS5A-inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions (RASs), all first-line treatment failures cured after retreatment (13/13).

Antiviral therapies can cure most cases of infection in 12 weeks. Unfortunately, treatment is expensive, and sticking with the regimen for 12 weeks can be difficult. It may be especially challenging for unhoused people or those who use injection drugs and who have high rates of hepatitis C infection.</p><p>Shorter durations of therapy may make it more accessible, especially for high-risk populations. But studies of shorter antiviral treatment durations have yet to produce high enough cure rates. Finding ways to identify patients who would benefit from shorter therapy is a key goal of the World Health Organization.</p><p>Potential characteristics that may predict a faster treatment response include low virus levels before initiating treatment, patient genetics, drug resistance mutations in the virus, and higher drug levels in the patient's blood during treatment. For example, previous research showed that a rapid decrease in virus levels in a patient's blood two days after starting antiviral therapy with three drugs predicted patient cures after three weeks of treatment.</p><p>To test if high cure rates could be achieved in just four weeks of treatment, Flower et al. enrolled 52 patients with hepatitis C in a study to receive the most widely accessible dual antiviral treatment (sofosbuvir and daclatasvir). Participants received four or eight weeks of treatment, depending on the amount of viral RNA in their blood after two days of treatment. The results indicate that a rapid decrease in virus levels in the blood does not adequately predict cure rates with four weeks of two-drug combination therapy. However, eight weeks may be highly effective, regardless of viral levels early in treatment.</p><p>Thirty-four individuals with low virus levels on the second day of treatment received four weeks of therapy, which cured 21 or 62% of them. All seventeen individuals with higher viral levels on day two were cured after eight weeks of treatment. Twelve weeks of retreatment was sufficient to cure the 13 individuals who did not achieve cure with four weeks of therapy. Even patients with drug resistance genes after the first round of therapy responded to a longer second round.</p><p>Flower et al. show that patient genetics, virus subtype, drug levels in the patient's blood, and viral drug resistance genes before therapy, were not associated with patient cures after four weeks of treatment. Given that retreatment is safe and effective, larger studies are now needed to determine whether eight weeks of therapy with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir may be enough to cure patients with mild liver disease. More studies are also necessary to identify patients that may benefit from shorter therapy durations. Finding ways to shorten antiviral therapy for hepatitis C could help make treatment more accessible and reduce therapy costs for both individuals and governments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hepatitis C</kwd><kwd>genotype 6</kwd><kwd>response guided therapy</kwd><kwd>sofosbuvir</kwd><kwd>daclatasvir</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P025064/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooke</surname><given-names>Graham S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206/296/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooke</surname><given-names>Graham S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In low- and middle-income countries, where treatment is limited to second-generation NS5A/NS5B-inhibitor combinations, standard treatment is at least 12 weeks. This duration presents a barrier to successful engagement in care for some populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kracht et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>), hampering the elimination of HCV as a public health threat. Novel treatment strategies are required for hard-to-reach individuals such as people who inject drugs and those of no fixed abode.</p><p>In Vietnam, DAA therapy remains prohibitively expensive for many of those infected. A standard 12-week course of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) was priced at US$2417–2472 in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen Thanh et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the government subsidising 50% of drug costs since, the Ministry of Health estimates only 1000 individuals accessed DAA treatment through health insurance in 2019, and 2700 in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ministry of Health V, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The World Health Organization has called for research into predictive factors for selecting persons who could be successfully treated with shorter durations of therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>), which could expand access to treatment and reduce drug costs. Studies evaluating short-course therapy are challenging for infectious diseases where there are significant clinical risks of failure (e.g., TB and sepsis). However, HCV provides a model where treatment failures can be successfully retreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooke and Pett, 2021</xref>) allowing exploration of mechanisms underlying successful therapy.</p><p>Shortened DAA therapy is associated with disappointing rates of cure, such that it could never be recommended routinely. A systematic review and meta-analysis into treatment optimisation for HCV with DAA therapy in individuals with favourable predictors of response, found that pooled sustained virological response (SVR) for regimens of ≤4 weeks duration was 63.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.9–83.7), 6 weeks duration was 81.1% (75.1–86.6) and 8 weeks duration was 94.2% (92.3–95.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2019</xref>). However improved rates of cure were seen with an increased number of individual-level factors known (or assumed) to be favourable, such as non-genotype 3 infection, lower body mass index (BMI), lower baseline viral load, mild liver disease, absence of prior treatment failure and a rapid virological response to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Rapid virological response offers a promising means of shortening treatment duration while maintaining high rates of cure. So-called response-guided therapy (RGT), whereby antiviral duration is shortened in individuals who rapidly suppress virus levels in blood after starting treatment, was routinely used in the era of interferon-based therapy, when an undetectable HCV RNA at 4 weeks was used to determine a shorter course of pegylated interferon and ribavirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried et al., 2011</xref>). Evidence supporting RGT with DAAs at earlier time points is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooke and Pett, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yakoot et al., 2017</xref>), notably using day 2 (D2) viral load to determine treatment duration in genotype 1b infection. In this population, high cure rates were observed with just 3 weeks triple therapy (protease inhibitor [PI], NS5A inhibitor and NS5B inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau et al., 2016</xref>). In a UK treatment shortening study, which used 4–8 weeks ombitasvir, paritaprevir, dasabuvir and ritonavir based on baseline viral load, all 10 individuals who became undetectable at D3 of treatment achieved first-line SVR12 regardless of treatment duration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooke and Pett, 2021</xref>). There is currently no data for RGT durations less than 8 weeks with SOF/DCV, which remains the lowest-priced and most widely available treatment option globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clinton Health Access Initiative, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Drug resistance in association with particular viral genotypes and subtypes is also known to influence treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silva Filipe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>) and may predict who can be treated with shortened therapy.

For the secondary endpoint—SVR12 after combined first-line therapy or retreatment—cure was 100%, with mean treatment duration of 58 days, saving 26 days DAAs per participant.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Effect of shortening therapy</title><p>Inferior rates of cure are well described when DAA therapy is shortened below 8 weeks without use of early on-treatment virological response, falling below 50% with ≤4 weeks therapy without stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emmanuel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooke and Pett, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sulkowski et al., 2017</xref>). A few small studies have reported high rates of cure with shortened therapy based early virological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Etzion et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Shabrawi et al., 2018</xref>; ). The only previous RGT study to use less than 6-week treatment, by Lau et al., found a cure rate of 100% with just 3-week DAA therapy in 18 individuals whose HCV viral load was suppressed below 500 IU/ml after 2 days of therapy. This was the same threshold and time point used in our study. One important difference was in the treatment regimen, which included a protease inhibitor (simeprevir or asunaprevir). Although NS5A- (DCV) and NS5B- (SOF) inhibitors rapidly eliminate HCV from the blood, second-phase decline in viral load appears to be enhanced by addition of a protease inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perelson and Guedj, 2015</xref>). This may be crucial in sustaining high rates of cure with shortened therapy. Viral kinetics in our participants were broadly similar to those observed in patients treated with DCV-containing regimens in the study by Lau et al., with a rapid first-phase viral decline leading to an approximate 4 log10 IU/ml decline in HCV RNA in the first 48 hr of treatment. However, a detailed comparison of viral kinetics is limited by differences in sampling schedule, baseline viral loads and the HCV PCR platforms used. Another key difference relates to infecting genotypes—all participants in the Lau study had genotype 1b infection, compared with just 23% (n=12) in ours. Genotype 1b is associated with favourable outcomes with some DAAs compared with other genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferenci et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohli et al., 2015</xref>; ). Although real-world 1b outcomes with standard duration SOF/DCV appear similar to other non-3 genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charatcharoenwitthaya et al., 2020</xref>; ), subtype may be more important when treatment is shortened.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Role for RGT with SOF/DCV</title><p>Cure rates with this strategy are too low for it to be recommended routinely. With standard duration therapy, SVR12 is known not to be impacted by time to first undetectable HCV RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kowdley et al., 2016</xref>) or by the presence of detectable virus at the EOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pal et al., 2020</xref>). This also appears to be true of shortened treatment: in one individual who experienced treatment failure, HCV viral load was already &lt;LLOQ by day 7; in five of the 4-week cures, HCV VL was only suppressed to &lt;LLOQ virus for the first time at EOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Comparison of 4-week cures and 4-week treatment failures indicates that an HCV RNA&lt;LLOQ by day 7 may be a useful discriminator of 4-week treatment outcome (p=0.054). However, day 10, HCV RNA&lt;LLOQ was not predictive of response to shortened treatment. Day 7 viral load thresholds for shortening DAA therapy are currently being evaluated as part of a large ongoing randomised controlled trial in Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCabe et al., 2020</xref>; ).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>A case for 8-week SOF/DCV therapy</title><p>Given the high rates of cure observed with 8-week SOF/DCV in participants with a slow initial virological response (17/17), there is a case for reducing SOF/DCV therapy from 12 to 8 weeks in individuals with mild liver disease. Prior evidence for caution regarding 8-week SOF/DCV comes predominantly from a small 2015 study in HIV-coinfected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wyles et al., 2015</xref>), in which 7/10 treatment failures in the 8-week arm received half-dose daclatasvir (30 mg) because participants were taking concomitant darunavir–ritonavir. This dose adjustment was subsequently deemed unnecessary once drug-interaction data emerged, such that this study is likely to underestimate the efficacy of 8-week SOF/DCV. More recent studies corroborate our finding of &gt;90% cure with 8 weeks NS5A/NS5A inhibitor combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yakoot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Shabrawi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2020</xref>). Larger trials are warranted to evaluate 8-week SOF/DCV therapy for patients with mild liver disease (irrespective of speed of virological response). This could save significant costs, particularly in countries where pricing is determined per pill rather than per treatment course, such as Vietnam, and the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emmanuel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clinton Health Access Initiative, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Impact of RASs and retreatment concerns</title><p>To our knowledge, this study is the largest assessment of G6 RAS in vivo with SOF/DCV therapy. We hypothesised that a high number of putative RAS at baseline may be associated with higher rates of failure with shortened treatment. However, we found no evidence that number or type of SOF- or DCV-RAS was different at baseline in 4-week cures compared with 4-week treatment failures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">8</xref>), although numbers were small. Additionally, the excellent retreatment outcomes observed (13/13) are reassuring, particularly for low-resource settings where protease inhibitor-based retreatment options are limited. Only one novel RAS was detected after first-line treatment failure, and the individual concerned achieved SVR with standard duration retreatment, suggesting this was not clinically relevant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Impact of drug levels</title><p>This was the first assessment of the impact of DAA drug levels on efficacy of shortened therapy. The inactive SOF metabolite GS-331007 is the main circulating metabolite of SOF prior to undergoing renal excretion, and it is frequently used to describe SOF’s pharmacokinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smolders et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesised that accumulation and slow elimination of GS-331007 and DCV in vivo might protect against the re-emergence of HCV viraemia. However, we found no evidence of a difference in AUC<sub>last</sub> between 4-week cures and 4-week treatment failures for SOF or DCV. Total exposure to GS-331007 was higher in treatment failures (15,100 [9240–19,700] vs. 11,700 [8420–14,100] [p=0.023]). This was a surprising result, given that SOF and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose proportional over the dose range of 200–1200 mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smolders et al., 2019</xref>), and higher day 10 concentrations of GS-331007 have been associated with improved rates of cure with SOF/ribavirin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). Further PK studies are warranted to better understand if SOF metabolism impacts treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has important limitations. First, it was powered to determine the overall cure rate with 4- and 8-week treatment, rather than outcomes with each duration. It is possible that we would have seen patients failing 8-week therapy with a larger sample, and our cure estimates may therefore be imprecise. Second, the participating cohort did not include any individuals with HIV, hepatitis B co-infection or renal impairment and only four participants reported a history of injecting drug use, of which none were currently injecting. These populations are known to have an altered immunological response and constitute an important part of the HCV epidemic. Third, in order to identify the timing of failure, the protocol required a visit schedule with many more visits than is standard of care, which many patients would not be able to follow. Consequently, adherence was very high, which may not reflect real-world practice.</p><p>Another potential limitation relates to our use of two different HCV RNA platforms which have previously been shown to give discrepant results in the same individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahari et al., 2016</xref>). The Abbott Architect has a lower LLOQ than the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan and may detect HCV RNA for longer on therapy than the COBAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maasoumy et al., 2016</xref>), though we found no evidence of difference in viral decline by platform. With regard to the PK analysis our non-compartmental analysis of drug levels may not adequately account for drug accumulation of sofosbuvir’s metabolite GS-331007 and DCV between days 0 and 28, which was observed (see Appendix 1 for more detail).</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that shortened SOF/DCV therapy cures a significant proportion of patients with mild liver disease without compromising retreatment with the same drug combination in those who fail first-line therapy. This study adds to a growing case for shortening SOF/DCV therapy in individuals with mild liver disease from 12 to 8 weeks, offering retreatment with 12-week SOF/DCV when required. There was no evidence that relatively high numbers of putative RASs at baseline were associated with treatment outcomes, suggesting routine sequencing at baseline or prior to retreatment remains unnecessary. We also found no evidence that drug levels affect virological response or influence treatment outcome. Further work is required to understand which factors predict cure with ultra-short DAA treatment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>has received a grant from the Medical Research Council UK to the MRC Clinical Trials Unit [MC_UU_00004/03].

The software’s automatic slope calculator was used to derive the elimination rate (λ) (adjusted R2 value with uniform weighting) and terminal elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>). The drug exposure measured as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was calculated for each drug using the trapezoidal method. Linear interpolation was used for acceding concentrations and log-linear interpolation for descending concentrations. For the individual analysis, the linear method was used for all measurements due to accumulation between the day 0 and day 28 measurements. Both the AUC to the last time point (AUC<sub>last</sub>, 8 hours for SOF and 24 hours for GS-331007 and DCV) and AUC to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>) were calculated.</p><p>A non-compartmental pharmacodynamic analysis were conducted using viral load data from enrolment to day 14 to calculate area under the viral load – time curve and terminal elimination half-life of the viral clearance curve, using the same methodology as explained above. In addition, the relative reduction in viral load between enrolment and day 1, and between enrolment and day 7 were calculated. Ordinary linear regression of drug exposure (AUC<sub>last</sub>) from the individual pharmacokinetic analysis and the outcome measurements were performed in GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Limitations of PK/PD analysis</title><p>Two different sampling schedules were used to collect pharmacokinetic samples on day 0 and day 28, resulting in an overlapping sampling profile overall. Therefore, data collected within an individual on a specific day was not dense enough to justify a non-compartment analysis. However, if the data on day 0 and 28 were combined. it resulted in a complete pharmacokinetic profile for the individual. Two separate pharmacokinetic analyses were carried out. A naïve-pooled analysis was performed separately conducted on day 0 and 28 data. This resulted in a summary of exposure (AUC and Cmax) and half-life of the drugs, but it would not be possible to link these measurements to treatment outcome due to the different sampling strategies. Therefore, a second analysis was performed in which the data from day 0 and 28 were pooled for each individual. This resulted in complete pharmacokinetic profiles for each patient, and the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysed demonstrated no significant relationship between drug exposure and treatment outcome. Drug accumulation was observed for the sofosbuvir metabolite GS-331007 and DCV between day 0 and 28. However, the individual analysis should still generate median exposure values for each patient, which can be linked with treatment outcome. Another drawback is that no pre-dose samples were collected. Therefore, the non-compartmental analysis will assume no concentration at day 0 on day 28 for GS-331007 and DCV, even though drug accumulation was observed.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mean (95% CI) HCV RNA by visit day.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81801-app1-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 2.</label><caption><title>HCV RNA kinetics in participants treated with 4 weeks SOF/DCV.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81801-app1-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Median HCV RNA (log10), by PCR assay, at different time points in participants treated with 4 weeks SOF/DCV <italic>A = Abbott Architect (LLOQ = 12 IU/ml</italic>).</title><p><italic>C=COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems, LLOQ = 15 IU/ml</italic>)</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81801-app1-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="app1fig4" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 4.</label><caption><title>Time to viral suppression &lt;LLOQ and eventual treatment outcome.</title><p>*No treatment failures in 8 week arm.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Harel Dahari (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another. Two reviewers were generally positive about the manuscript, while the other reviewer noted that the rationale for an ultrashort therapy to be effective for HCV global elimination is that it does not involve additional testing to identify a subpopulation that may benefit from ultra-short therapy. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors cite ref 8 as the main motivation to use RGT based on day 2 (d2) viral load with a cut-off of 500 IU/ml. In ref 8 the length of therapy for those with d2 &lt;500 IU/ml was used to allocate 3 weeks of therapy. It is not clear why in the current work, 4 weeks of therapy was chosen.</p><p>2. Some participants seem to have a very low baseline viral load which could indicate a recent HCV infection. Please elaborate.</p><p>3. Given the prospective nature of the study and its complexity, there are inherent limitations to the study that is hard to retrospectively fix. As the authors themselves suggest, a protease-inhibitor-free regimen in G1b patients might be incompatible with an efficient enough ultra-short treatment, however, at this stage, this is only a speculation. I would try to compare kinetics to historical cohorts of ultra-short triple (+protease inhibitor) treatment (Lau et al. lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2016)</p><p>4. Is there a particular pattern of viral kinetics to 4w cured patients Vs. failures? Figure 1 (Appendix 1) only shows the means of viral load and the general kinetics for the whole population, but individual plots of viral kinetics are not presented although could potentially be useful. Also, according to the presented data, day 7 VL</p><p>5. According to Table 3, no significant differences in the host or viral factors were detected between cured or failures of the 4w regimen. However, the low number of patients makes it very difficult to interpret these data and might miss potential differences between these two groups of patients, emphasizing again the difficulty in drawing firm conclusions from this study. In this context, I wonder whether a regression analysis would better define either viral (subtype, RAS) or host factors that are implicated in a 4w duration success.</p><p>6. Two assays, Abbott Architect and CobasTaqMan, were noted to be used in the study. Since it was reported that these assays yield different HCV kinetics within the same individual (e.g., DOI: 10.1016/j.jhep.2016.04.006) it would be important to stratify the analyses in the current work also based on these two assays, specifically:</p><p>i. In Table 2, four top parameters.</p><p>ii. In the viral kinetic analyses (lines 336 – 348).</p><p>iii. In Table 3 (days 2, 7, 10, 14 VL).</p><p>iv. Provide a figure with viral kinetics based on the two assays (e.g., median with IQR ranges) and perform an analysis to check whether the first phase of decline magnitude from baseline to day 2 and the second phase decline slope (from day 2 until the first time point that the HCV was lower than LLoQ or target not detected, whichever is first) are different as previously discussed, e.g., DOI: 10.1016/j.jhep.2016.05.028.</p><p>v. It would be nice to know whether all end of treatment HCV positive cases that went SVR were associated with a particular assay as discussed in DOI: 10.1016/j.jhep.2016.05.028 and/or HCV genotype. This will also clarify the statement in line 346 that begins with &quot;All treatment ….&quot;.</p><p>7. Reproducibility. I would suggest providing all readers access to the longitudinal raw data (de-identified) that was analyzed for the current study; The processed data uploaded by the authors in ISRCTN does not seem to provide such access. Others may wish to reproduce your analysis and/or try alternative methods to analyze. For example, see the relevant kinetic data-sharing mechanism provided in Supplementary Table 3 in DOI: 10.1111/liv.13335.</p><p>8. Limitations. Please consider discussing more study limitations based on the above comments.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Efficacy of ultrashort, response guided sofosbuvir and daclatasvir therapy for Hepatitis C: a single arm, mechanistic, pilot study&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We used the WHO recommended SOF/DCV (rather than unlicensed triple therapy) as it is the lowest priced and most widely available DAA globally, with the most generic manufacturers. Since we planned to enrol individuals with any genotype 1 or 6 subtype (not just 1b), we opted to use a minimum 4 week treatment duration to provide a greater chance of successful treatment. We have added the following sentence (in red) to the methods section (study design, paragraph 2, page 4).</p><p>“Treatment duration was determined using hepatitis C viral load measured 2 days after treatment onset (D2). Participants with viral load &lt;500 IU/ml at D2 (after 2 dose of SOF/DCV) were treated with 4 weeks of SOF/DCV. Those with HCV RNA ≥500 IU/ml received 8 weeks (figure 1). A previous study using this threshold<sup>8</sup> had found 100% SVR12 following 3 weeks triple therapy (NS5Ai, NS5Bi, PI). We chose a minimum 4-week duration based on our broader inclusion criteria and the use of dual class therapy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Some participants seem to have a very low baseline viral load which could indicate a recent HCV infection. Please elaborate.</p></disp-quote><p>Trial eligibility criteria required that participants had at least one detectable viraemia prior to the screening visit (by quantitative HCV RNA, qualitative assay or HCV genotype), with no intervening undetectable results and plasma HCV RNA &gt;LLOQ at screening. There was no requirement for evidence of chronic infection (&gt;6 months) and therefore there was potential for a patient with acute infection (that might resolve spontaneously) to be enrolled and treated.</p><p>Only one patient had a day 0 viral load of &lt;10,000 IU/ml: a 42 year old male with genotype 1b infection who was considered low-risk for acute infection. He had a screening viral load of 274,624 IU/ml, so was eligible for inclusion. However, his day 0 viral load (a few weeks later) was 618 IU/ml, and by 24 hours (day 1) HCV RNA was not detectable. He ultimately cured with 4 weeks therapy. We chose to display range (rather than IQR) in table 1 in part to show this data. To clarify this we have added the following sentence to the results:</p><p>“Baseline and clinical characteristics are described in Table 1. One participant, a male with genotype 1b infection who was cured with 4 weeks of therapy, had an HCV viral load of 618 IU/ml on day 0 which may have been consistent with spontaneously resolving acute infection, but could equally reflect fluctuating viraemia. Baseline viral load was &gt;10,000 IU/ml in all other participants, who were all assumed to have chronic infection.”</p><p>In addition, we have added the following sentence to ‘Results: Viral kinetics and timing of treatment failure’: “HCV RNA kinetics in those achieving SVR (blue lines) and those not achieving SVR (red lines) with 4 weeks SOF/DCV are shown in appendix 1, figure 2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Mean model trajectories were calculated from predicted viral load viral decline in 18 patients treated with three different DAA regimens (6 with SOF+LDV+asunaprevir, 6 with SOF+DCV+asunaprevir, and 6 with SOF+DCV+simeprevir). Their modelled data suggests a broadly similar viral decline to that observed in our study, in which mean HCV RNA was 2.90 (2.75, 3.04) log10 IU/ml at day 1, 2.35 (2.20, 2.50) log10 IU/ml at day 2 and 1.63 (1.50, 1.75) log10 IU/ml at day 7. Lau et al. used a different sampling schedule (7 viral loads in first 48h vs 3 viral loads in first 48h in our study), a different HCV RNA platform (COBAS), and the patients treated with DCV-containing regimens in their study had lower median HCV viral loads than in our study: 5·6 (5·3–6·7) (SOF/DCV/simeprevir) and 5·9 (5·2–6·5) (SOF/DCV/asunaprevir) versus 6.3 (5.8, 6.6) log10 IU/ml in our study. These differences make a detailed comparison of viral kinetics problematic. We have added the following sentence in the discussion.“One important difference was in the treatment regimen, which included a protease inhibitor (simeprevir or asunaprevir). Although NS5A- (DCV) and NS5B- (SOF) inhibitors rapidly eliminate HCV from the blood, second-phase decline in viral load appears to be enhanced by addition of a protease inhibitor<sup>41</sup>. This may be crucial in sustaining high rates of cure with shortened therapy. Viral kinetics in our participants were broadly similar to those observed in patients treated with DCV-containing regimens in the study by Lau et al., with a rapid first phase viral decline leading to an approximate 4 log10 IU/ml decline in HCV RNA in the first 48h of treatment. However, a detailed comparison of viral kinetics is limited by differences in sampling schedule, baseline viral loads and the HCV PCR platforms used.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Even though the numbers are small, this helps illustrate that early on-treatment response alone may be of limited value in determining cure with ultra-short therapy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

In this context, I wonder whether a regression analysis would better define either viral (subtype, RAS) or host factors that are implicated in a 4w duration success.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We previously avoided doing regression analysis due to the high number of host variables (age, gender, BMI, liver function tests) and virus variables (baseline viral load, viral kinetics, subtype, RAS) variables in a small sample size. We have performed regression analysis in response to this review and the only statistically significant result was that there was a significant <italic>reduction</italic> in treatment failure in participants with 2 resistance mutations compared to those with 1 (p=0.01). This is counter-intuitive and is likely a reflection of the small numbers involved: (6 (5 failures) with 1 RAS and 21 (8 failures) with 2 RAS). We would prefer not to present a regression analysis because this was not pre-defined in the study protocol. The study was not powered to detect differences between 4 week cures and 4 week treatment failures and we feel this post-hoc analysis may confuse things.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
