Standard models for memory storage assume that sensory signals reach the hippocampus from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Deep layers of the EC on the other hand relay hippocampal outputs to the telencephalic structures including many parts of the neocortex. Here, we show that cells in layer 5a of the medial EC send a copy of their telencephalic outputs back to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Combining cell-type-specific anatomical tracing with high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that in the mouse brain these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our results suggest that projections of deep medial EC neurons are anatomically configured to influence the hippocampus and neocortex simultaneously and therefore lead to novel hypotheses on the functional role of the deep EC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>feedback</kwd><kwd>layer 5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>211236/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surmeli</surname><given-names>Gulsen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>211236/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Surmeli</surname><given-names>Gulsen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M025454/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McClure</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel pathway from the deep entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus suggests that the hippocampal–neocortical loop is supported by a feedback projection from the entorhinal deep layers that copies entorhinal output to the hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interplay between the hippocampus and the neocortex is a central tenet of theories for systems memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Marr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). The entorhinal cortex (EC) mediates the two-way communication between the neocortex and the hippocampus. Its superficial and deep layers, respectively, channel inputs to and outputs from the hippocampus. During a new experience the superficial layers relay convergent inputs from the cortex to the hippocampus where initial conjunctive representations of everyday experiences are generated. Subsequently during rest or sleep, hippocampal output is redistributed to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Squire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frankland and Bontempi, 2005</xref>). Leading theoretical models consider the deep layers of EC as a relay of hippocampal output that reinstates neocortical activation patterns representing memories, enabling neocortex-wide synaptic changes required for long-term storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumaran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schapiro et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent discoveries revealed complex and distinct input–output interactions of molecularly defined subtypes of neurons in the deep layers of medial EC (MEC), suggesting their functions extend beyond passing on hippocampal outputs. Layers 5a (L5a) and 5b (L5b) of the EC are genetically distinct with differential input–output organizations. L5a but not L5b is the sole origin of the long-range telencephalic outputs of the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>), whereas L5b, but not L5a, is directly influenced by superficial layers of EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>). Inputs from the dorsal hippocampus preferentially target L5b over L5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rozov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wozny et al., 2018</xref>) whereas ventral hippocampus preferentially targets L5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rozov et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the capacity of deep layers to integrate neocortical inputs with hippocampal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Czajkowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>), suggest more complex roles.</p><p>An intriguing possibility, noted in experiments with classic retrograde tracers, is that deep layers of MEC might also project to the hippocampal CA1 region, which provides the deep EC with hippocampal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Köhler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witter and Amaral, 1991</xref>). Such recurrent connectivity between CA1 and the deep MEC could be important in coordinating hippocampal–entorhinal activity during memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2016</xref>), provide a shortcut for hippocampal outputs to re-enter the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumaran and McClelland, 2012</xref>) or have a more global coordination function encompassing the hippocampus and the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khodagholy et al., 2017</xref>). Despite its potential functional significance, the key properties of this projection pathway including whether it shares the same source with the telencephalon projections and which neurons it targets in the hippocampus remain unknown.</p><p>Here we reveal that, neurons in L5a, but not L5b, of the MEC project to hippocampal CA1. We establish that the telencephalon-projecting neurons copy their outputs directly to pyramidal and subclasses of interneuron populations in CA1. Our data define a novel anatomical framework for layer 5a of the MEC to coordinate neocortical and hippocampal networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To find out whether neurons in either L5a or L5b project to the hippocampus we injected retrograde adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) or mCherry into intermediate hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

In this mouse line, Cre expression is driven by the promoter of the retinol binding protein four gene (<italic>Rbp4-Cre</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerfen et al., 2013</xref>). Following injection of a Cre-dependent AAV expressing GFP or mCherry into the deep MEC of <italic>Rbp4-Cre</italic> mice, fluorescent signal was detected mainly in L5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). At the centre of the injection site, where labelling was densest, the majority of neurons in L5a (71.3% ± 2.2 %, <italic>n</italic> = 3 mice, 180 neurons) were found to be fluorescently labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Labelled neurons were non-GABAergic (99.5% ± 0.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 3 mice, 1137 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), most of which expressed Etv1 (88.6% ± 3.1 %, <italic>n</italic> = 3 mice, 1866 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is similar to the proportion of Etv1 expression in all L5a neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sürmeli et al., 2015</xref>) and also in retrogradely labelled subpopulations of L5a neurons from the hippocampus and from cortical and subcortical target areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). Moreover, axons of L5a neurons labelled in the <italic>Rbp4:Cre</italic> line were found in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we established that the <italic>Rbp4-Cre</italic> line provides unbiased genetic access to excitatory projection neurons in L5a.</p><p>To what extent does the projection from L5a to the hippocampus differ from previously identified projections arising from superficial layers of MEC? In contrast to projections from superficial layers 2 and 3, which, respectively, target stratum lacunosum (SL) and stratum moleculare (SM) of CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>), axons from L5a neurons were primarily found in deep stratum pyramidale (SP) and SL, but were sparse in SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Axons from L5a also differed in their proximo-distal organization within CA1. Whereas projections from superficial layers of MEC favour proximal CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1995</xref>), axons from L5a had highest density in distal CA1 (paired one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.0312, <italic>n</italic> = 5 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>) and the subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We observed the same topography when axons and axon terminals of L5a neurons were labelled with membrane-bound GFP and fluorescently tagged presynaptic proteins (synaptophysin), confirming that the topography is not a result of labelling of passing axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–O</xref>).

The hippocampus-projecting neurons in L5a may be distinct from the telencephalon-projecting neurons, implying separate processing within the deep MEC layers of signals to the hippocampus and telencephalon. Alternatively, the same neurons in L5a may project to both the telencephalon and the hippocampus, implying that telencephalic outputs from MEC are copied back to the hippocampus. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a combinatorial viral labelling strategy. We restricted reporter gene expression to subpopulations of L5a cells that project to specific targets by injecting a retrograde AAV expressing Cre recombinase in either the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) or nucleus accumbens (NucAcb), and a Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter virus into the MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). With this approach we detected in CA1 fluorescently labelled axons originating from both RSC- and NucAcb-projecting L5a neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). The axon distribution across layers was similar to when L5a neurons were labelled in bulk using the <italic>Rbp4-Cre</italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). These results establish the principle that axon projections from L5a of MEC to the hippocampus are collaterals of projections to telencephalic targets.

To test whether axon collateralization to the hippocampus is a general feature of all telencephalon-targeting neurons, we used Multiplex Analysis of Projections by Sequencing (MAPseq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>). MAPseq is a high-throughput alternative to single neuron anterograde tracing. In MAPseq, instead of multiple copies of a virus carrying the same genetic material, a virus library is utilized where each virus facilitates expression of a unique 30-nucleotide RNA particle. The vast diversity of unique RNA sequences and relatively small number of neurons infected allows each neuron to be marked with a unique RNA barcode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>). Because the barcodes are actively transported to axon terminals, their detection can be used to establish connectivity to putative target structures; if a neuron projects to multiple target structures then its barcode should be detected in each one.</p><p>We injected the MAPseq barcode RNA virus library into the full dorso-ventral extent of the deep MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and quantified barcode RNA expression in tissue collected from dorsal and ventral MEC (dMEC, vMEC), dorsal and ventral hippocampus (dHip, vHip), isocortex, cerebral nuclei (CNU), olfactory areas and cortical subplate (Olf/Ctxsp) as well as brainstem and spinal cord as negative controls (see Materials and methods for detailed description and controls, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The results were similar regardless of whether neurons were located in dorsal or ventral MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that collateralization does not depend on the neuron’s position in the dorso-ventral axis of the MEC. Using barcode counts as a measure of projection strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>) we further found that dorsal MEC neurons preferentially project to dorsal aspects of the hippocampus and ventral MEC neurons to the ventral aspects, indicating that the back-projections to the hippocampus are topographically organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Using two lines of evidence, combinatorial viral labelling and MAPseq, we show that L5a axons bifurcate to target both the telencephalon and the hippocampus. Our results imply that nearly all telencephalic output is copied onto the hippocampus regardless of its destination in the telencephalon. There is a topographical register between the dorso-ventral origin of the entorhinal cells and their target zone within the hippocampus. This is similar to the dorso-ventral topography of perforant-path projections of the superficial EC targeting the dentate gyrus, supporting the view that dorso-ventral compartments of the hippocampus operate independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruth et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dolorfo and Amaral, 1998</xref>). Interestingly in the transverse axis, the density of projections has a gradient descending towards proximal CA1 (towards CA2). This is in contrast to previous reports where labelling of MEC projections using traditional tracers revealed dense projections in proximal but not in distal CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tamamaki and Nojyo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Naber et al., 2001</xref>).

The distinct organization of projections originating in L5a of the MEC that we reveal here suggests that they serve functions distinct from the projections targeting CA1 from superficial layers instead of merely supplementing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Witter et al., 2017</xref>). This also opens a possibility for the lateral and medial EC input streams to converge in CA1.</p><p>Although cells in deep entorhinal layers have been previously observed when retrograde dyes were placed in the CA1-subiculum border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Köhler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Witter and Amaral, 1991</xref>), the tools we introduced in this study made it possible to investigate the layer origin of these projections and their targets within CA1 with cell-type-specific anterograde labelling. Our observation that L5b does not participate in this pathway reinforces the distinct input–output organization of the deep MEC. While L5b is a point of integration for local and neocortical input with hippocampal output and distributes its signals locally within MEC, based on our anatomical observations L5a appears to be suited to coordinate the wider hippocampal–neocortical loop by providing a copy of entorhinal output back to CA1.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Our findings raise new questions about the functional roles of outputs from the EC, and about the nature of interactions between the EC and the hippocampus. Telencephalic projections of L5a cells have been shown to be necessary for long-term memory formation and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>), likely by distributing compressed hippocampal outputs to the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). Returning a copy of these outputs back to CA1 might create a self-reinforcing or a self-correcting loop. They might also provide a gating signal to modulate the impact in CA1 of inputs from CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dudman et al., 2007</xref>) and/or neocortical return inputs via L3 of EC. It is also conceivable that they influence mechanisms of learning and memory by affecting rhythmic network activity through the inputs on the pyramidal cells and interneuron populations that we described here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colgin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ognjanovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xia et al., 2017</xref>).

After 44 hr, mice were sacrificed, brains were extracted and immediately immersed in oxygenated cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF prepared in ultrapure water). All surgical tools and surfaces were treated with RNaseZAP (Invitrogen) prior to the start of the experiment and in-between samples. 400 μm fresh sagittal brain sections were cut using a vibratome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pastoll et al., 2012</xref>). Immediately after this, GFP expression in the deep EC was verified under a fluorescent microscope and tissue was dissected in cold oxygenated ACSF using microdissection blades on sylgard covered Petri dishes which were kept on ice. Each slice was dissected on a previously unused surface of the plate with fresh ACSF and a dedicated microblade was used for the dissection of each brain division to prevent contamination. Tissue pieces were collected into bead containing (Qiagen 69989) collection tubes (Qiagen 19560) on dry ice. After tissue collection, 400 µl Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific #15596026) was added to each collection tube. The procedure was repeated for all five brains. Three brains with the largest coverage of MEC deep layers were selected to proceed to the next steps. Tissue was stored at −80° before it was shipped on dry ice to CSHL MAPseq core facility for further processing. RNA extraction, production of double-stranded cDNA, library preparation, and Illumina sequencing and preprocessing of sequencing data were performed by the MAPseq core facility as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>.</p><p>For the tissue dissections, identification of brain areas was done by using Allen Brain Reference Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org/">https://mouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). The isocortex division included the somatosensory, motor, visual, posterior parietal, anterior cingulate, and retrosplenial areas combined. The CNU division was restricted to striatum. The olfactory/cortical subplate division (Olf/Ctxsp) was a combination of olfactory areas and cortical subplate including amygdalar nuclei. The remaining two divisions were dorsal (dHip) and ventral hippocampus (vHip) including subiculum. Some brain areas were excluded from the study because of the difficulty in dissecting or identifying brain areas in the sagittal plane. All sections &gt;3.7 mm lateral to bregma are not annotated in Allen Brain Reference Atlas and were excluded. Therefore, neocortical areas in the most lateral sections such as perirhinal cortex, ectorhinal cortex, and temporal association areas were not included in the study. The claustrum and adjacent neocortical areas (visceral, agranular insular, gustatory) were excluded as it was not possible to separate these areas precisely to prevent contamination between the assigned divisions. Since borders between the brain divisions CNU and OLF/Ctxsp were not always clear, dissections avoided these areas hence the brain areas in these divisions are partially included. White matter between the hippocampus and the neocortex carrying axon tracts were also excluded. Brainstem and cervical spinal cord tissue were used as control. When L5a neurons in the MEC were labelled using strategies explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, no axonal projections to these areas were observed (unpublished experiments). Consistent with this, a low number of barcodes were identified in the negative control samples (on average 1.0% ± 0.3% of barcodes had counts in control areas, <italic>n</italic> = 3).</p><p>A limitation of the barcode-based single-cell tracing method comes from the possibility of multiple neurons being represented by the same barcode. This is prevented by adjusting the barcode diversity and the size of the target population as explained in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>. In order to assess the expected fraction of uniquely labelled neurons in our study we counted the total number of neurons in L5a of the MEC. A total of 2314 ± 131 (<italic>n</italic> = 2 mice) NeuN-labelled neurons were counted.

Orphan barcodes, barcodes which did not have counts in the injection site (dMEC or vMEC) were removed. We then calculated the 90th percentile of the barcode counts in our negative controls and based on this set all barcode counts of 1–0. A small number of barcodes had a higher count in any target area compared to the injection site which might be a result of incomplete dissection of the injection site or viral expression in areas that the virus spilled into as we retracted the pipette. These barcodes were removed. Since our goal was to find whether neurons projecting to the telencephalon also project to the hippocampus we removed the barcodes that had no counts in any of the telencephalic target areas. For the same reason, barcodes that were detected only in the hippocampus were also removed. Finally, we excluded all barcodes with counts of less than 400 in the injection site to minimize the possibility of incomplete transport of RNA barcodes to axons in target areas due to weak expression at the cell bodies or low counts due to PCR or polymerase errors. Barcodes with low counts in all target areas (&lt;10) were also excluded to account for potential false positives.</p><p>To quantify the proportion of barcodes that were present in both a target division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; isocortex, CNU, or Olf/Ctxsp) and the hippocampus, the following formula was used: (total number of barcodes with counts detected in both hippocampus and target division/total number of barcodes with counts detected in target division). To classify the barcodes as originating from dMEC vs vMEC, the barcodes were divided into two groups – ‘dorsal MEC’, where counts in dMEC were higher than in vMEC, and vice versa for ‘ventral MEC’.</p><p>For a visual display of the relative barcode counts in dHip and vHip of barcodes originating from ‘dorsal MEC’ or ‘ventral MEC’, we generated heat maps showing normalized projection strengths between dHip and vHip for all barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Slices were then washed and incubated in secondary antibody solution with Alexa-conjugated Streptavidin and DAPI prepared in 0.3% PBST and mounted on glass slides after overnight incubation.</p><p>A Zeiss LSM800 microscope was used for image acquisition of the slices. Pinhole was set to 1 Airy Unit. Objectives used include ×10 (air), ×20 (air), and ×40 (oil) to image the hippocampal formation, morphology of biocytin filled cells, and immunolabelling of interneurons, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image processing and generation</title><p>Experimental design sketches were generated using Brainrender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Claudi et al., 2021</xref>) or Affinity Designer.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Telencephalic outputs from the medial entorhinal cortex are copied directly to the hippocampus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kevin Allen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. While the reviewers felt the paper presented robust analyses of novel anatomical pathways, without functional evidence for how these pathways interact or support memory processing, the interest may be limited to specialists and not broad enough for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, if additional experiments were to lead to insight regarding the function of these pathways, <italic>eLife</italic> would consider a new submission of the manuscript. Please note in this case, the manuscript would be treated as anew submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript characterizes where deep layers of the medial entorhinal cortex (layer 5a and layer 5b) project to in the brain. Using a variety of circuit mapping techniques (cell-type specific anatomical tracing, high-throughput RNA sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping), the authors find that the same neurons in the layer 5a of the medial entorhinal cortex send projections to both the telencephalon and the hippocampus. They also find that the projections target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons and has a unique topography. While these findings are interesting and suggest that deep layers of the entorhinal cortex may coordinate hippocampal-cortical interactions in memory processing, but this is just speculation based on the anatomical connections.</p><p>The manuscript does a great job of characterizing the anatomical projections with a variety of approaches and the results are interesting. However, without functional evidence of how these projections interact with other brain regions to support cognition or memory processing, I think the current version of the manuscript does not quite meet the impact level for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors have characterized a novel projection from layer 5a of entorhinal cortex to CA1 of hippocampus. Overall the data are convincing that 5a cells project to CA1. The optogenetic experiments provide strong evidence that the projection to CA1 is glutamatergic and targets pyramidal cells and several classes of interneurons. The authors present some evidence that the same 5a cells send axon collatorals to retrosplenial cortex + CA1 and nucleus accumbens + CA1 - however these data could be strengthened by making it more clear whether only 5a cells were targeted within the MEC. This reviewer does not have the expertise to comment on the MAPseq experiments.</p><p>The data characterize the projection well - but lack any kind of functional insight. Without this, it is difficult to place these findings in context. For example, are the projections to different interneuron subtypes different? Are there conditions when input to CA1 would be strong or weak - in other words - what are the dynamics of the layer 5MEC to CA1 pathway? Does silencing this projection effect behavior?</p><p>In summary - these data nicely characterize a novel projection from layer 5a of MEC to CA1, but leave open questions as to the function of this projection.</p><p>Regarding the axon collateral experiments: In Figure 3- supplement 1, it was unclear to me whether only layer 5a is targeted. Could you label layers on the figure to ensure this? Did you consider doing retrograde injections in CA1 and in RSC/NucAcb to look for double labeled 5a cells?</p><p>Regarding the optogenetic aided circuit mapping experiments: These comprise a large set of recordings which are technically challenging. I was hoping, however, that you might go beyond the characterization of connections to give some functional context to this pathway. In the abstract you state – 'Our results suggest that rather than serving as a relay, deep EC may coordinate hippocampal-neocortical interactions in spatial cognition and memory'. I think this statement requires experiments aimed at understanding the dynamics and magnitude of the connection at the very least.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Layer 5 neurons of the entorhinal cortex are thought to play a key role in memory consolidation because they receive inputs from the hippocampus and send axons to large parts of the neocortex (Rosov et al., 2020; Witter et al., 2017). Six years ago, it was shown that Layer 5 neurons of the entorhinal cortex can in fact be divided into 2 populations (Layer 5a and 5b) with very different axonal profiles (Surmeli et al., 2015). Neurons in Layer 5a, but not those in layer 5b, project to the neocortex. Based on these findings, Layer 5a neurons appear perfectly suited to influence neocortical areas and contribute to memory consolidation.</p><p>The current manuscript by Tsoi et al. reveals an important new twist to our understanding of this Layer 5 output pathway: a large proportion of layer 5a neurons that project to the telencephalon (including the neocortex) also provide excitatory inputs to the hippocampus. The idea that neurons in the deeper layers of the entorhinal cortex send axons to the hippocampus is not new (Köhler, 1985; Witter and Amaral, 1991), but, until now, it was not clear if the population of neurons projecting to the neocortex was also sending axons to the hippocampus.</p><p>Tsoi and colleagues make use of two modern tracing strategies to test whether Layer 5a neurons projecting to the telencephalon also project to the hippocampus. First, they inject a retrograde AAV expressing Cre-recombinase in extra-hippocampal areas targetted by Layer 5a neurons. A second AAV expressing a reporter protein in a Cre-dependent manner was also injected in the deep layer of the medial entorhinal cortex. The Cre-dependent reporter protein was observed in the CA1 areas. The second approach used is MAPseq. A MAPseq barcode RNA virus library was injected into the deep layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. With this technique, the majority of infected neurons are expected to express a unique RNA sequence, which will be present both in the cell body the axon terminals. The entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and other telencephalic structures were then processed to identify the bar codes present in the different target areas of Layer 5a neurons. The majority of barcodes found in the telencephalic structures were also found in the hippocampus, suggesting that a very large proportion of Layer 5a neurons projecting to the hippocampus also project to the hippocampus.</p><p>The manuscript has a clear message and the conclusions are generally well supported by the data presented. Two complementary methods are used to show that MEC deep layer neurons projecting to the telencephalon also project to the hippocampus. The reported proportion of Layer 5a neurons having projections towards the telencephalon and the hippocampus is very high, suggesting that this is an important feature defining this cell population.</p><p>One limitation of this work is that the functional role of the axon collaterals in the hippocampus is not explored in detail. The main target cells in the CA1 areas have however been identified. In addition, the authors describe a mouse line in which Cre-recombinase in the entorhinal cortex is limited to Layer 5a neurons. These mice will surely prove useful in future studies investigating the role of Layer 5a neurons.</p><p>It is not clear whether there are differences in connectivity between Layer 5a and CA1 superficial or deep pyramidal cells.</p><p>The MAPSeq technique is relatively new and the percentage of shared barcodes between the hippocampus and the telencephalic areas is very high (approaching 99%). Given these high values, more control data would be beneficial. What is the overlap of barcodes across animals or between telencephalic brain areas? It would be interesting to know whether the layer 5a neurons projecting to the Isocortex also project to the CNU? The results on the control brain area shown in the Methods section (line 433) could be moved to the Results section.</p><p>Line 209: Does light stimulation lead to suprathreshold PSP in CA1 pyramidal cells? If so, how confident can we be that the responses observed in interneurons are not due to feedback connectivity between spiking CA1 pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons? Is the latency sufficiently low to rule out indirect connectivity? It would be beneficial to show the response latency for these responses.</p><p>Line 159: The MAPSeq technique is relatively new compared to viral tracing and many readers might not know how it works. I would suggest adding a few sentences explaining this method.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73162.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

We understand that readers might not be familiar with the appearance of layers of the EC in coronal sections. The curved geometry of the medial entorhinal cortex makes layer organization in caudal sections in the coronal plane unintuitive: L5 cells look like a clump as opposed to a thin layer of neurons that most readers would be familiar with from horizontal or sagittal sections as in Figure 1A-D. Therefore, it is difficult to demarcate layer borders without misleading the reader. In the revised manuscript, we now provide labels on Figure 3- supplement 1 for guidance but without demarcating layer borders<italic>.</italic> We also added extra text in the figure legend to clarify this point and refer the reader to a previous publication from our group that shows back-labeled neurons from neocortical target structures in sagittal sections by using the same injection strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did you consider doing retrograde injections in CA1 and in RSC/NucAcb to look for double labeled 5a cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We did consider doing these experiments.

To make sure our speculations are not mistaken as conclusions we revised the text in the abstract and result sections to emphasize that our findings are limited to the anatomical properties of deep EC projections. We now discuss our predictions on the functional role of this pathway in the “Ideas and speculation” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>It is not clear whether there are differences in connectivity between Layer 5a and CA1 superficial or deep pyramidal cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now added this analysis to the manuscript and Figure 5 D. We also added a section in the methods that describe our criteria for assigning positional identities to the neurons used in this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The MAPSeq technique is relatively new and the percentage of shared barcodes between the hippocampus and the telencephalic areas is very high (approaching 99%). Given these high values, more control data would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>As we understand it, the reviewer is concerned about false positives. There are three main possible reasons for false positives in these experiments. First is RNA contamination between samples during the dissection. Second is PCR errors. Third is infection of more than one neuron with virus carrying the same RNA barcode sequence. We explain each of these and our control measures in detail in the methods section. Given these control measures, we are confident that the shared barcode values we present here are accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the overlap of barcodes across animals or between telencephalic brain areas?</p></disp-quote><p>We are unable to understand the value of investigating barcodes that overlap across animals since we do not pool the barcodes across animals. Theoretically there should be minimal overlap since a random selection of barcodes will be expressed in each experiment. We predict that the reviewer might be under the impression that the barcodes were pooled because we present a total number of barcodes across three animals in the legend of Figure 4B. We now present barcode numbers from each of the 3 mice separately as opposed to a total number to prevent misdirecting the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to know whether the layer 5a neurons projecting to the Isocortex also project to the CNU?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting point and the organizational logic of EC layer 5a projections to its telencephalic targets are currently being investigated by our group. However, we believe it is not within the scope of our manuscript as we prefer to keep the focus on establishing the principles of hippocampal projections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results on the control brain area shown in the Methods section (line 433) could be moved to the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point that we may not have emphasized enough in the main text. We now make clear in the main text the usage of control tissue and refer the reader to the methods section where control measures are discussed in detail. We also modified the sketch in figure 3 to emphasize the location of where the control tissue was extracted from.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 209: Does light stimulation lead to suprathreshold PSP in CA1 pyramidal cells? If so, how confident can we be that the responses observed in interneurons are not due to feedback connectivity between spiking CA1 pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons? Is the latency sufficiently low to rule out indirect connectivity? It would be beneficial to show the response latency for these responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe suprathreshold responses from pyramidal neurons under our stimulation conditions but some neurons did show large EPSPs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1E). Nevertheless, we did consider the possibility of indirect activation of the interneurons and addressed this by measuring latencies and pharmacology (presented in the text and figures: Figure 6G,H,I,J and Figure 5—figure supplement 1G,H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 159: The MAPSeq technique is relatively new compared to viral tracing and many readers might not know how it works. I would suggest adding a few sentences explaining this method.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion from the reviewer. We added more explanation on the technique to the relevant section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
