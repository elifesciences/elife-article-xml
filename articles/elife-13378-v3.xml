anti-apoptosis. Here, we report a neglected but important bioenergetic effect of mTOR inhibition in neurons. mTOR inhibition by rapamycin significantly preserves neuronal ATP levels, particularly when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired, such as in neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors, or in neurons derived from maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS) patient iPS cells with ATP synthase deficiency. Rapamycin treatment significantly improves the resistance of MILS neurons to glutamate toxicity. Surprisingly, in mitochondrially defective neurons, but not neuroprogenitor cells, ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation increased over time, despite activation of AMPK, which is often linked to mTOR inhibition. A rapamycin-induced decrease in protein synthesis, a major energy-consuming process, may account for its ATP-saving effect. We propose that a mild reduction in protein synthesis may have the potential to treat mitochondria-related neurodegeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13378.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13378.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13378.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells need to maintain an optimal balance between making new proteins and destroying older ones. Building proteins requires a supply of nutrients and appropriate levels of energy, and mammalian cells rely on a protein called mTOR to sense both nutrient availability and energy levels. Nutrients activate mTOR signaling to promote protein synthesis. In contrast, a lack of nutrients and low energy levels inhibit mTOR, which slows down protein synthesis to help the cell to conserve vital resources.</p><p>The balance between protein synthesis and degradation is often perturbed in diseases that involve the progressive loss of nerve cells, and a drug called rapamycin – which inhibits mTOR signalling – can help treat this neurodegeneration in mice. Neurodegenerative diseases are also often linked to problems with the cellular structures called mitochondria that provide the cell with energy in the form of the chemical ATP. Previous research suggests that abnormal mitochondrial activity and energy deficiency could be a critical step that leads to neuron death in neurodegeneration. So far, the effect of rapamycin on energy deficiency in neurons has not been explored in detail.</p><p>Zheng, Boyer et al. have now tested the therapeutic potential of rapamycin in a genetic disease called maternally inherited Leigh syndrome in which children suffer from severe neurodegeneration due to defects in their mitochondria. The experiments made use of neurons that could be grown in the laboratory and which faithfully mimicked the problems observed in maternally inherited Leigh syndrome patients. In some experiments, healthy neurons were treated with chemicals that inhibit ATP production. In other experiments, cells collected from a maternally inherited Leigh syndrome patient were coaxed into becoming neurons. Signaling via mTOR was enhanced in both kinds of neurons. Zheng, Boyer et al. then treated the defective neurons with rapamycin, which led to a significant rise in ATP levels. The production of proteins also slowed down. This could explain the observed rise in ATP levels, as making proteins consumes a lot of energy.</p><p>Zheng, Boyer et al. propose that a mild reduction in protein synthesis may have the potential to treat neurodegeneration caused by defective mitochondria. Further work is needed to extend this analysis to animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13378.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13378.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>rapamycin</kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd><kwd>iPS disease modeling</kwd><kwd>maternally inherited Leigh syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK057978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Ronald M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR2-01778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gage</surname><given-names>Fred H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA14195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA80100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA82683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rapamycin treatment inhibits mTOR activity and preserves ATP levels in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells from a maternally inherited Leigh syndrome patient.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mTOR complexes coordinate nutrient availability with cell growth and proliferation, promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Protein homeostasis is often distorted in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as PolyQ and other proteinopathies, making mTOR an attractive therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bové et al., 2011</xref>). Studies from animal models support mTOR inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases, although several distinct beneficial mechanisms have been proposed. Rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, reduces neuronal cell death in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, and decreased synthesis of DDIT4 (DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4) was proposed to provide the protective effect by maintaining AKT pro-survival phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malagelada et al., 2010</xref>). Rapamycin strongly suppresses degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with loss of function mutations of <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>PARKIN</italic>, genes in which mutations cause human early onset Parkinsonism; importantly, overexpression of 4E-BP, a protein synthesis inhibitor downstream of the mTORC1 pathway, also rescues neuronal degeneration in these fly mutants. Increased production of GSTS1, a detoxifying enzyme, was suggested to be the beneficial factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tain et al, 2009</xref>). In a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, deleting one mTOR allele decreases amyloid-β deposits and ameliorates memory deficits possibly through enhanced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caccamo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial dysfunctions are frequently observed in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin and Beal, 2006</xref>). Proteins causing neuronal degeneration often have either direct or indirect deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions. For example, α-synuclein inhibits mitochondrial fusion and causes mitochondrial fragmentation followed by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration and neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>). Pink1 and Parkin are critical in mitochondrial quality maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>). Amyloid precursor proteins accumulate in mitochondrial import channels, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction as a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devi et al., 2006</xref>). In Huntington's disease, mutant huntingtin also has detrimental effects on mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zuccato et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it appears that mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetic collapse could be a critical step towards neuronal death.</p><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction results in decreased ATP levels in neurons. The delicate influence of ATP level on neuronal survival is best exemplified by maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disease, characterized by severe early childhood neurodegeneration. T8993G in <italic>MT-ATP6</italic>, encoding an ATP synthase subunit, is the most common mutation in MILS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finsterer, 2008</xref>). A unique feature of mtDNA disease is that disease severity is correlated with the mutation load, i.e., the percentage of mutated mitochondrial DNA copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor and Turnbull, 2005</xref>). Higher than 90% <italic>ATP6</italic> T8993G causes MILS, whereas, 70~90% causes a less severe disease called NARP syndrome with symptoms, such as neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa, that gradually develop with age. In a cybrid study where patient platelets containing the T8993G mtDNA mutation were fused to human osteosarcoma cells devoid of mtDNA, ATP synthesis was found to be negatively correlated with the mutation load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiazzi et al., 2004</xref>), indicating that a moderate difference in ATP level can dictate disease severity and the extent of neuronal death.</p><p>mTOR inhibition by rapamycin greatly attenuates neurodegeneration caused by mitochondrial complex I defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2013b</xref>). This study showed a dramatic therapeutic effect of rapamycin on a mouse model of Leigh syndrome, deficient in <italic>Ndufs4</italic>, a nuclearly-encoded component of complex I. The life span is significantly extended, and neuronal degeneration is greatly attenuated. The exact rescue mechanism is unclear, but autophagy or mitochondrial biogenesis was excluded. It is not known if mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin would have similar beneficial effects on the mutations affecting other respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vafai and Mootha, 2013</xref>).</p><p>So far, rapamycin’s effects on neuronal bioenergetics have not yet been explored. Here, we show that rapamycin significantly preserves neuronal ATP levels, particularly when mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is impaired by mitochondrial inhibitors. To test the therapeutic potential of rapamycin on neurodegeneration due to energy deficiency, we developed an iPSC-based disease model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), due to a T8993G mtDNA mutation in the <italic>ATP6</italic> gene. The MILS neurons exhibited energy defects and degenerative phenotypes consistent with patient clinical observations. Rapamycin treatment significantly alleviated ATP deficiency, reduced aberrant AMPK activation in MILS neurons and improved their resistance to glutamate toxicity. Mechanistically, MILS neurons and neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors all exhibited enhanced mTORC1 activity, signified by elevated ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation, indicating a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and mTOR signaling in neurons, and providing a rationale for treatment with rapamycin, which reduces protein synthesis, a major energy-consuming process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapamycin preserves neuronal ATP level</title><p>The effect of rapamycin on cellular ATP level was examined in neurons derived from human embryonic stem cells, an approach that has been successfully used to model a variety of neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiang et al., 2013</xref>). Three mitochondrial drugs were used to mimic mitochondrial oxidative defects: oligomycin, blocking the ATP synthase; rotenone and antimycin-A, inhibiting complexes I and III, respectively, and CCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler. We first tested whether rapamycin would affect neuronal ATP level. After a 6 hr rapamycin treatment of cultured wild type neurons differentiated from human neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) derived from H9 human ESCs, the ATP level was increased by ~13% compared to neurons treated with DMSO as control. FK-506 (tacrolimus) that binds FKBP12, which is also a rapamycin target protein, but inhibits calcineurin signaling rather than the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2005</xref>), did not change the ATP level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Oligomycin treatment alone decreased neuronal ATP level to ~ 64% of that in neurons treated with DMSO, but strikingly, cotreatment with oligomycin plus rapamycin maintained the ATP level at ~86% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with the higher ATP level, neurons cotreated with rapamycin showed lower AMPK T172 phosphorylation, an indicator of cellular ATP deficiency, compared to treatment with oligomycin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar effects of rapamycin were observed in neurons treated with rotenone and antimycin-A; but, interestingly, rapamycin was not able to preserve ATP when neurons were treated with CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It should be noted that both oligomycin and rotenone/antimycin-A treatment reduce ATP production by directly inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation; in contrast, CCCP does so by uncoupling electron transport from ATP production, which not only reduces ATP production, but also stimulates oxidative phosphorylation and induces mitochondrial substrate burning and heat production. We suspect that this difference may account for the different effects of co-treatment with rapamycin. These data indicate that rapamycin can increase neuronal ATP levels and preserve cellular energy when oxidative phosphorylation is impaired.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13378.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapamycin treatment increased neuronal ATP levels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effect of rapamycin (RAPA) on cellular ATP level was examined in 5-week neurons differentiated from human neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) derived from H9 ESCs. Rapamycin was used at 20 nM (final concentration).

We found an ~2-fold increase in ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation in neurons treated for 6 hr with oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A, but not CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E and 1F</xref>). Rapamycin only partially decreased mTOR S2481 phosphorylation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>), but almost completely abolished the ribosomal S6 and S6K phosphorylation observed in oligomycin-treated neurons, indicating its dependence on mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We did not observe a consistent change of mTOR phosphorylation at S2481 or S2448 (not shown) upon oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A treatment. The increased S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation was not due to AMPK activation, as AICAR, an AMPK agonist, did not alter their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, AMPK activation is generally associated with decreased mTORC1 activity and S6K phosphorylation as a result of direct phosphorylation of Tsc2 and Raptor by AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gwinn et al, 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, NPCs treated with oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A for 20 min or for 6 hr showed decreased S6 and S6K phosphorylation, increased phosphorylation of AMPK and its substrate, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and 1I</xref>). In contrast to the 6 hr treatment, 20 min of oligomycin or rotenone/antimycin-A treatment did not significantly alter S6 and S6K phosphorylation in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the increased S6 and S6K phosphorylation in neurons treated for 6 hr with these mitochondria inhibitors is a neuron-selective response to some cumulative effect caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Protein synthesis inhibition spares a significant amount of ATP in neurons</title><p>As rapamycin was able to preserve ATP in neurons treated with rotenone/antimycin-A, which largely abolishes oxidative phosphorylation, it is unlikely that the effect of rapamycin is through increasing ATP production from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Nevertheless, we measured the basal oxygen consumption rate in neurons treated with rapamycin, and the rate was similar to that in DMSO-treated controls, supporting the conclusion that rapamycin’s effect does not come from increasing oxidative phosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Rapamycin treatment did not increase neuronal glucose consumption indicating that glycolysis was not increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species causing cellular damage; however, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a commonly used anti-oxidant, was unable to maintain the ATP level in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>With long-term treatment, both oligomycin and rotenone/antimycin-A treated neurons showed increased ribosomal S6 and S6K phosphorylation, which are indicators of mTORC1 signaling and, indirectly, the rate of protein synthesis, a major cellular energy-consuming process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>), and the increase in ribosomal S6 phosphorylation in oligomycin-treated neurons was almost completely abolished by rapamycin treatment, which inhibits mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). One consequence of rapamycin inhibition of mTORC1 is a decrease in protein synthesis, and to explore the potential ATP-saving effect of protein synthesis inhibition, neurons were treated for 2 hr with cycloheximide (CHX), a widely-used protein synthesis inhibitor, and 4E1RCat, a protein synthesis initiation inhibitor that blocks eIF4E:eIF4G and eIF4E:4E-BP1 interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cencic et al., 2011</xref>), causing a drop in protein synthesis to ~ 9% and ~55% of that of neurons treated with DMSO as control, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a result of this inhibition, the neuronal ATP level increased by ~26% and ~14%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Similar to rapamycin, cycloheximide and 4E1RCat could also significantly preserve ATP levels in neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These results imply that reduction of protein synthesis is an important factor for rapamycin to preserve ATP in neurons.</p><p>The increased S6 and S6K phosphorylation in neurons treated with mitochondrial inhibitors at later times implies that an increase in protein synthesis should occur. To monitor neuronal protein synthesis during the treatment with mitochondrial inhibitors, we labeled neuronal cultures with <sup>35</sup>S-cysteine/methionine at different time points after rotenone/antimycin-A treatment. During the first 2 hr, protein synthesis dropped to ~36% of that of neurons treated with DMSO as control, but, interestingly, protein synthesis recovered and reached ~80% by 4–6 hr despite the sustained decrease in neuronal ATP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Such increased protein synthesis would consume more ATP and presumably aggravate the energy crisis. When rapamycin was added together with rotenone/antimycin-A, after 4 hr treatment, protein synthesis was ~38% of the control, while in neurons treated with rotenone and antimycin-A, the protein synthesis rate was ~62%, and rapamycin treatment alone decreased protein synthesis to ~60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Therefore, rapamycin may help to preserve ATP through reducing protein synthesis. Protein synthesis was not restored in NPCs treated with rotenone/antimycin-A for 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), consistent with the phosphorylation status of S6K and S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>iPSC-based model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome</title><p>Our results so far indicated that rapamycin can preserve the ATP level in neurons treated with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors, which cause acute mitochondrial dysfunction. To test the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for neurodegeneration resulting from energy deficiency, we developed an induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell model of maternally-inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), an infantile neurodegenerative disease due to mitochondrial DNA mutation. We obtained a clone of primary fibroblasts (GM13411) derived from a male MILS syndrome patient, who died at 8 months; the patient’s symptoms, disease development and brain pathology were typical of MILS syndrome as described in a clinical report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pastores et al., 1994</xref>). The GM13411 MILS patient fibroblast line has a T8993G mutation resulting in a change from a conserved leucine to arginine at amino acid position 156 in ATP6, a subunit of Complex V/ATP synthase.

The mitochondrial genomes from these T8993G and BJ iPS cells were sequenced, and no major pathogenic mutations, apart from T8993G, were found compared to mitochondrial genome variation databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Subsequently, three neural progenitor cell lines (NPC) were derived from the respective patient iPS cell lines using the embryoid-body based protocol outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>. Expected neural progenitor markers were present by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and all the T8993G NPC lines retained the T8993G mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Presumably, in iPSCs and NPCs, the increased production of lactate allows more NADH to be recycled to NAD<sup>+</sup>, which is required for the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and results in production of more glycolytic ATP. Without LDHA and HK2, neurons appear unable to compensate for the mitochondrial ATP deficiency through aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, the data also argue that even when short of energy, neurons cannot turn on aerobic glycolysis, at least in MILS neurons. In spite of ATP deficiency in T8993G neurons, we did not detect enhanced autophagy (data not shown), probably due to mTOR activation, which suppresses autophagy. Moreover, there was no marked increase in mitochondrial mass in T8993G neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that mitochondrial biogenesis was not deployed to compensate for cellular energy deficiency.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13378.018</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Shutoff of aerobic glycolysis during neuronal differentiation exposes mitochondrial ATP synthesis deficiency in T8993G MILS neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative ATP level of T8993G compared to healthy control (BJ, H9 hESC) in iPSCs, NPCs and neurons. The relative percentage of ATP levels in T8993G was calculated by comparing to the mean of control cells respectively.

T8993G neurons were hypersensitive to increased levels of extracellular glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). In neurons expressing GFP driven by the neuron-specific DCX promoter to highlight neuronal structures, a 6-h treatment with 100 µM glutamate abolished neuronal processes in T8993G neurons, whereas the neuronal fibers from control neurons, differentiated from BJ iPSCs or H9 hESCs, remained intact, and could tolerate up to 300 µM glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and 4H</xref>).

The increased intracellular amino acids levels in MILS neurons may also be attributable to the accumulated glycolytic intermediates and a clogged TCA cycle, because the synthesis and catabolism of amino acids is linked to glycolysis and the TCA cycle; under catabolic conditions the carbon atoms of amino acids are oxidized by the TCA cycle for ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stryer et al., 2002</xref>).

For example, the extent of glycine increase in inhibitor-treated neurons is not as pronounced as in MILS neurons. These differences may be due to the difference in mechanism or extent of mitochondrial inhibition between mitochondrial inhibitors and <italic>ATP6</italic> T8993G mutation. The large increase of glycine in MILS neurons may be an anti-oxidant response to chronic mitochondrial oxidative stress. In the mitochondrial matrix, serine is converted to glycine catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a reaction coupled with covalent linkage of tetrahydrofolate to a methylene group to form 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, which is subsequently used to generate 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate and NADPH by tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) in mitochondria.

The exact rescue mechanism is unclear, but increased autophagy or upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis seem not be involved. Here, we demonstrated that rapamycin treatment significantly preserved neuronal ATP level, particularly when oxidative phosphorylation was impaired, revealing an important beneficial mechanism of rapamycin. To test its therapeutic potential on neurodegeneration resulting from energy deficiency, we developed an iPSC-based disease model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS), an infantile neurodegenerative disease with a complex V (ATP synthase) defect due to mitochondrial DNA mutation. Rapamycin treatment significantly alleviated the ATP deficiency, reduced aberrant AMPK activation in MILS neurons, and improved their resistance to glutamate toxicity. Strikingly, ribosomal S6 and S6K phosphorylation, indicators of mTORC1 activity, were increased in neurons treated for a significant time with mitochondrial inhibitors and in MILS neurons, arguing that enhanced mTORC1 signaling might be a frequent feature of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>mTOR signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons</title><p>Our observation that in mitochondrially-defective neurons mTORC1 activity increased, rather than decreased concurrent with AMPK activation is contrary to previous reports that pharmacological disruption of mitochondrial function leads to mTORC1 inhibition due to AMPK activation by reduced energy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). In proliferating NPCs, we did find that mitochondrial inhibitors activated AMPK and, consistently, decreased S6 and S6K phosphorylation.

This paradoxical observation could be due to unknown differences in the mTORC1 complex between NPCs and neurons. We found that AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was dramatically decreased in wild type neurons compared to NPCs, as was phosphorylation of its substrate PRAS40 at Thr246 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). PRAS40 is an inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 hyperactivation in <italic>Tsc2</italic> -/- mutant cells, with AKT-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 preventing its inhibition of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vander Haar et al., 2007</xref>). An alternative explanation for mTORC1 activation emerged from our metabolite analysis, which showed that MILS neurons and neurons treated with mitochondrial drugs had significantly higher levels of amino acids, which can activate mTORC1. Indeed, it has been shown that the basal activity of S6 kinase rises progressively with increased concentration of medium amino acids in a nearly linear fashion; and at a 2-fold increased concentration, S6 kinase activity is close to maximal and no longer shows further activation by growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hara et al, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the increased amino acid levels in MILS neurons or mitochondria-inhibitor treated neurons are significant, and may account for the elevated mTORC1 activity. Certainly, there are other possible mechanisms; for instance, the effect might be due to decreased S6 and S6K phosphatase activity.</p><p>Similar paradoxical observations have been described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakai et al., 2015</xref>). In an extracellular matrix detachment model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ng et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated that after detachment AMPK is activated in both K-Ras V12-transformed and non-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts; interestingly, mTORC1 activity only decreased, in an AMPK-dependent manner, in transformed but not non-transformed fibroblasts. They further showed that this AMPK-mediated mTORC1 inhibition decreased protein synthesis, thus preserving ATP in the detached transformed fibroblasts and delaying cell death. As in our study, rapamycin or cycloheximide treatment had a significant cell survival effects in their model. Notably, in the transformed fibroblasts, the level of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was markedly stronger than in non-transformed cells, reminiscent of the situation in NPCs and neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein synthesis, rapamycin and neuronal ATP deficiency</title><p>When neurons were treated with rotenone and antimycin-A, protein synthesis initially dropped to ~ 36% but gradually recovered to almost 80%, correlating with the increase in S6 and S6K phosphorylation, in spite of a continuous drop in ATP levels. In the MILS neurons, S6 and S6K phosphorylation were significantly higher than in BJ and H9 control neurons. Neuronal energy deficiency caused by mitochondrial dysfunction occurs in the presence of sufficient oxygen and ample nutrition, a situation that cells in vivo rarely encounter, and there is probably no selection pressure to evolve a proper response program. We believe that the recovery of protein synthesis in such situations is an improper response that further aggravates energy deficiency. Therefore, manipulating protein synthesis to match ATP production is beneficial for neurons. Hints exist in the work of others. Overexpression of 4E-BP, a negative regulator of protein synthesis, rescues the neuronal degeneration observed in Pink1 and Parkin fly mutants with mitochondrial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tain et al., 2009</xref>); in light of our finding, an alternative explanation is that reduction of protein synthesis is energetically beneficial for neurons with mitochondrial dysfunction. Strikingly, pathogenic LRRK2 mutation in Parkinson's disease has recently been found to induce a large increase in protein synthesis in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, and, when treated with a low-dose of the anisomycin protein synthesis inhibitor, the locomotor deficits and dopamine neuron loss in mutant LRRK2 transgenic flies were rescued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, a recent genetic screen in yeast also revealed that downregulation of protein synthesis could rescue the growth of mutant cells with mitochondrial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ATP sparing by rapamycin is significant</title><p>As discussed in the Introduction, a cellular load of <italic>ATP6</italic> T8993G greater than 90% causes Leigh syndrome, a severe form of infantile neurodegeneration, whereas a 70~90% load causes a less severe neurological disease called NARP syndrome with symptoms, such as neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa, gradually developing with age. In contrast, carriers with a ~50% load are generally normal, only developing late-onset cone-rod dystrophy in their forties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porto et al., 2001</xref>). In a cybrid study, where patient platelets containing the T8993G mtDNA mutation were fused to human osteosarcoma cells devoid of mtDNA, mitochondrial ATP production was found to be negatively correlated with the mutation load in a nearly linear fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiazzi et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we found that rapamycin treatment of T8993G neurons increased ATP level and improved their resistance to glutamate-induced neuronal fiber collapse, a process caused by decreased intracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takeuchi et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, a ~20% increase in ATP, the amount saved by rapamycin, which may seem small, could indeed have a significant effect on neuronal survival in Leigh or NARP syndrome patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Use rapamycin to treat Leigh, NARP syndromes and other mitochondria-related neurodegenerative disorders</title><p>Leigh syndrome affects 1 in 40,000 newborns in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darin et al., 2001</xref>). In one fourth of the cases, these mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Finsterer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pinto and Moraes, 2014</xref>). The neurological degenerative phenotypes are usually apparent in newborns, but, currently, no effective therapy is available. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al. (2013b)</xref> reported a dramatic therapeutic effect of rapamycin on a mouse model of Leigh syndrome. We also observed beneficial effects of rapamycin in human neurons treated with mitochondria inhibitors and in an iPSC-based disease model of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome. However, potential negative effects of rapamycin on neuronal development should not be neglected. A previous study found that focal infusion of rapamycin into dorsal hippocampus blocks axon fiber sprouting, but it should be noted that such a treatment is unable to reverse already established axon organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckmaster et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that long-term usage of rapamycin for newborns should be considered with caution, but could be tried on older NARP syndrome patients to delay disease progression, and short term rapamycin usage could be considered for younger Leigh patients in emergency situations, such as fever, which often drastically and irreversibly worsens the neurodegenerative symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uziel et al., 1997</xref>). Besides these hereditary mitochondrial diseases, mitochondrial dysfunctions are frequently observed in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin and Beal, 2006</xref>). Elevated p70 S6 kinase activity has been documented in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, a mild reduction in protein synthesis may be useful in other neurodegenerative diseases by increasing ATP level and simultaneously decreasing the workload of protein folding systems.</p><p>We emphasize that, whether or to what extent, our observations from a cell culture-based mitochondrial disease model reflect the in vivo situation needs further investigation using animal models with various mitochondrial deficiencies. In particular, there are some critical questions that need to be addressed under in vivo condition, e.g., the role of ATP deficiency in the neurodegenerative process; whether a reduction in protein synthesis can help balance neuronal energy expenditure and thereby delay neurodegeneration. Brain tissue is composed of mixed cell types, neurons and glial cells, which have distinct metabolic profiles and different responses to energy deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bélanger et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al 2001</xref>); therefore, to study the changes in ATP levels in situ and in specific cell types, an effective approach preferably at the single cell level is required. An engineered ATP fluorescent biosensor is available for cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tantama et al, 2013</xref>), which could be adapted and introduced into animal models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Cells were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. iPSCs, NPCs and neurons were permeabilized at room temperature for 15 min in 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS.

Moreover, they attribute some of the beneficial effect of rapamycin treatment to reduction is protein synthesis mediated by reduction in S6 phosphorylation. Consequently, they propose that rapamycin and/or mild inhibition of protein synthesis may be therapeutically useful for treating mitochondrial diseases. These cell culture results are encouraging; however, it is imperative that the treatment strategies be tested in animal models of various mitochondrial deficiencies before proposing therapeutic approaches.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Since it is unrealistic for the authors to add therapeutic testing to this paper, they should acknowledge the need to test their ideas in existing animals’ models and/or develop appropriate models to test whether inhibition of mTOR or protein synthesis are universally beneficial and assess the mechanisms involved in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This study by Zheng et al. builds on prior work indicating that mTOR is hyperactivated in response to certain forms of mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of mTOR can improve outcome in animal and cell based models of mitochondrial disease. Specifically, the authors show that cells treated with mitochondrial poisons show increased mTOR signaling and reduced ATP levels that can be rescued by rapamycin treatment. They further show that inhibition of protein synthesis in these cells can partially phenocopy rapamycin by rescuing ATP levels. They go on to describe an iPSC model of Leigh Syndrome in which they observe increased mTOR signaling. They show that treatment with rapamycin can improve some cellular phenotypes, in particular rescuing ATP levels, and propose that this is mediated through inhibition of protein synthesis.</p><p>Overall, this study provides important additional evidence for the idea that mTOR inhibitors may be of therapeutic value for treatment of mitochondrial disease. It also supports a specific model that rescue of mitochondrial defects by rapamycin is mediated in part by reducing protein synthesis, a particularly ATP consuming process, and thereby rescuing ATP deficits in cultured cells.</p><p>My main question about this study is the extent to which these observations are relevant in a whole animal or person. It is not clear that ATP deficiency is a major driver of disease in mitochondrial disease, nor is it clear that rapamycin treatment significantly reduces protein synthesis in vivo. I can imagine that the high nutrient growth conditions used for cell culture create a somewhat artificial system in which protein synthesis and ATP consumption by protein synthesis are elevated relative to any physiologically relevant situation. In this regard, it may be worth noting that the <italic>NDUFS4</italic> study by Johnson et al. did not detect a significant difference in ATP levels in KO compared to WT animals nor was a change in ATP levels in whole brain upon rapamycin treatment observed. Obviously, this negative result from Johnson et al. is not conclusive, but it would greatly enhance the relevance of this study if the authors could offer some direct experimental evidence that their proposed mechanism is important in a mouse model. At a minimum, the possibility that the importance of the translation/ATP mechanism proposed here is enhanced in cell culture relative to tissues in vivo should be addressed in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript uncovering an unanticipated pathway of mTOR activation in neurons as a consequence of mitochondrial stress induced chemically or genetically. This mTOR activation in context of mitochondrial insufficiency leads to ATP depletion and neurotoxicity and may explain some of the neurological features of mitochondrial diseases. This pathway in differentiated neurons is absent in neural progenitor cells. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide rescue the ATP depletion and cell death suggesting some new rationales for therapeutic intervention.

Reviewer #1: My main question about this study is the extent to which these observations are relevant in a whole animal or person. It is not clear that ATP deficiency is a major driver of disease in mitochondrial disease, nor is it clear that rapamycin treatment significantly reduces protein synthesis in vivo. I can imagine that the high nutrient growth conditions used for cell culture create a somewhat artificial system in which protein synthesis and ATP consumption by protein synthesis are elevated relative to any physiologically relevant situation. In this regard, it may be worth noting that the Ndufs4 study by Johnson et al. did not detect a significant difference in ATP levels in KO compared to WT animals nor was a change in ATP levels in whole brain upon rapamycin treatment observed.

At a minimum, the possibility that the importance of the translation/ATP mechanism proposed here is enhanced in cell culture relative to tissues in vivo should be addressed in the text.</italic> We appreciate and agree with the reviewer's point that the cell culture system may not fully reflect the in vivo situation. Going forward it will indeed be important to examine whether rapamycin treatment or reduction of protein synthesis is able to preserve neuronal ATP levels and show beneficial effects in animal models of mitochondrial diseases, but it would be hard to generate a model of MILS for mitochondrial DNA mutant, and we feel that this is beyond the scope of the present study. To acknowledge the limitations of the current study and highlight the issues raised by the reviewer, we have added the following paragraph in the Discussion.</p><p>&quot;We emphasize that, whether or to what extent, our observations from a cell culture-based mitochondrial disease model reflect the in vivo situation needs further investigation using animal models with various mitochondrial deficiencies. […] An engineered ATP fluorescent biosensor is available for cell culture systems (Tantama et al., 2013), which could be adapted and introduced into animal models. &quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: Comments: In the subsection “Shutoff of aerobic glycolysis during neuronal differentiation exposes ATP synthesis deficiency in T8993G MILS neurons”: &quot;Without LDHA and HK2, neurons cannot[…]&quot; – cannot seems too strong. If the authors reintroduce LDHA and/or HK2 and this rescues ATP levels the statement would be justifiable. As it stands &quot;cannot&quot; would be better stated something like &quot;appear unable&quot;. The reintroduction would be an interesting experiment to perform.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for highlighting the importance of our work.</p><p>We were also intrigued by the disappearance of HK2 and LDHA during neuronal differentiation and the functional significance of their loss. In a separate project to investigate metabolic changes during differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons we analyzed the effect of constitutive expression of HK2 and LDHA during neuronal differentiation, and these data will be included in another manuscript describing the metabolic transition from neural progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons. The data are shown in Author response image 1. In brief, we stably transduced neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with constitutively expressed HK2 and LDHA; ~80% of NPCs had discernible expression and proliferation appeared normal. However, constitutive HK2 and LDHA expression during neuronal differentiation led to extensive cell death and significantly increased GFAP-positive glial cells from 4% of total cells in the control NPC cells containing expression vector alone to ~40% of total cells. The LDHA signals were readily detected in GFAP-positive glial cells but not in MAP2-positive neurons. Importantly, the dead cells signified by condensed nuclei were associated with punctate staining of LDHA and MAP2, a neuronal marker, indicating that neurons were sensitive to HK2 and LDHA re-expression. At the moment, we do not fully understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon. We agree with the reviewer's point, and have changed the phrase according to their suggestion.</p><p>The effects of HK2 and LDHA re-expression on neuronal differentiation.
