proliferation in health and disease. As a prerequisite for activation of mTORC1 by hormones and mitogens, there first has to be an available pool of intracellular amino acids. Arginine, an amino acid essential during mammalian embryogenesis and early development is one of the key activators of mTORC1. Herein, we demonstrate that arginine acts independently of its metabolism to allow maximal activation of mTORC1 by growth factors via a mechanism that does not involve regulation of mTORC1 localization to lysosomes. Instead, arginine specifically suppresses lysosomal localization of the TSC complex and interaction with its target small GTPase protein, Rheb. By interfering with TSC-Rheb complex, arginine relieves allosteric inhibition of Rheb by TSC. Arginine cooperates with growth factor signaling which further promotes dissociation of TSC2 from lysosomes and activation of mTORC1. Arginine is the main amino acid sensed by the mTORC1 pathway in several cell types including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Dependence on arginine is maintained once hESCs are differentiated to fibroblasts, neurons, and hepatocytes, highlighting the fundamental importance of arginine-sensing to mTORC1 signaling. Together, our data provide evidence that different growth promoting cues cooperate to a greater extent than previously recognized to achieve tight spatial and temporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11058.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11058.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11058.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to be able to sense and respond to signals from their environment. A group (or complex) of conserved proteins called mTORC1 acts a key signaling hub that regulates cell growth and many other processes. This complex can be activated by many different signals from outside the cell. However, mTORC1 can only be activated by these signals if there is also a good supply of amino acids – which are needed to make new proteins – within the cell.</p> <p>The amino acids are thought to be presented to mTORC1 on the outer surface of cellular compartments known as lysosomes. A protein called Rheb on the surface of the lysosomes activates mTORC1, while a protein complex called TSC inhibits the activity of Rheb to regulate mTORC1 activity. Previous studies have shown that some amino acids influence whether mTORC1 can be activated by affecting whether it is localized to the lysosomes or not.</p> <p>Here, Carroll et al. explored how an amino acid called arginine regulates mTORC1. The experiments show that arginine is the major amino acid that influences whether mTORC1 can be activated in several different types of human cell. When cells were deprived of arginine, the activity of the complex was strongly suppressed. However, microscopy showed that arginine had no effect on whether mTORC1 was found at the lysosomes or not, which suggests that arginine might be acting in a different way to other amino acids.</p> <p>Further experiments found that a lack of arginine led to an increase in the number of TSC complexes at the lysosomes. This led to the inhibition of Rheb and therefore prevented mTORC1 from being activated. Together, Carroll et al.’s findings provide evidence that the different signals that regulate mTORC1 signaling cooperate to a greater extent than previously thought. A future challenge will be to understand the molecular details of how the arginine is detected.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11058.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11058.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korolchuk</surname><given-names>Viktor I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korolchuk</surname><given-names>Viktor I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000296</institution-id><institution>British Skin Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korolchuk</surname><given-names>Viktor I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korolchuk</surname><given-names>Viktor I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signaling pathway mTOR can sense its principal activator amino acid arginine via a different mechanism than that previously described for other amino acids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells rely on the ability to appropriately sense and respond to intra- and extracellular stimuli in order to ensure their proper function, maintenance, and growth. Dysregulation of pathways required to control this homeostasis frequently occur in human pathologies such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, and aging. As such, intense efforts have been made to understand the regulatory signaling pathways and underlying mechanisms via which cells sense anabolic and catabolic signals.</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a fundamentally important role in the integration of metabolic, energy, hormonal, and nutritional stimuli to promote cellular biosynthesis and suppress the catabolic process of macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2014</xref>). The two most proximal regulators of mTORC1 are small GTPases of the Ras superfamily: Rheb and the Rag GTPases. Both are considered to be resident on the cytoplasmic surface of the lysosome, a site that has in recent years come to the very forefront of mTORC1 signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buerger et al., 2006</xref>). The Rag GTPases facilitate signaling of amino acids to mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>), a stimulus that has long been known to be both necessary and sufficient, albeit minimally, for mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hara et al., 1998</xref>). The current consensus is that amino acids activate mTORC1 by promoting its localization to the cytoplasmic surface of late endosomes and lysosomes (for simplicity this mTOR-positive compartment is referred to as lysosomes) via a heterodimeric complex of Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2010</xref>). There are four mammalian Rag GTPases that show functional redundancy, A or B dimerize with C or D and unlike most small GTPases they rely on another complex, the Ragulator, for tethering them at the membrane. The Ragulator complex further acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to activate the Rag GTPases and works in opposition to the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) complex, GATOR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2013</xref>) to ensure the tight control of Rag GTPases and therefore mTORC1 activity.</p><p>mTORC1 localization to the lysosome is thought promote its activity by bringing it into close proximity to the membrane-associated Rheb. Rheb is the master activator of mTORC1 and, although the mechanism by which GTP-loaded Rheb stimulates mTORC1 kinase activity remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avruch et al., 2009</xref>), it has been demonstrated that the nucleotide and therefore activity status of Rheb is controlled by a wide range of upstream stimuli. Potent mTORC1 regulators, for example energy status via AMPK and growth factors via PI3K and Akt converge upstream of Rheb to positively or negatively control the TSC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoki et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Manning, 2008</xref>). The TSC complex consists of TSC1, TBC1D7, and TSC2, where TSC2 has GAP activity that specifically inactivates Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoki et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dibble et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt has recently been shown to regulate localization of the TSC complex to the cytoplasm and away from the lysosome thereby preventing Rheb inactivation and promoting mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). The regulation of TSC2 localization to the lysosome has also been associated with the amino acid/Rag GTPase axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that the underlying mechanisms controlling the opposing localization of mTOR and TSC2 to the lysosome involve complex interplay between different upstream stimuli.</p><p>Leucine and glutamine are the best-studied mTORC1-regulating amino acids and their mechanisms of action have been partially elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to leucine and glutamine, mTORC1 has also been shown to sense the presence of arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2004</xref>), an amino acid essential during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). It has recently been suggested that arginine activates mTORC1 via a mechanism similar to that of leucine, involving Rag GTPases where a membrane transporter SLC38A9 acts as a sensor of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2015</xref>), including arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebsamen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), on lysosomal membranes.</p><p>Here, we show that arginine has an unexpected role in activating mTORC1 via the TSC/Rheb signaling axis. Most notably, we demonstrate that arginine does not significantly affect mTORC1 localization but rather, it is required for maximal growth factor signaling by preventing TSC2 localization to the lysosome and it’s interaction with Rheb. We demonstrate that TSC2 localization is modulated by arginine together with the classical TSC regulators, growth factors, to tightly control Rheb and ultimately mTORC1 activity in a spatial and temporal manner. Arginine is likely to act as an intact molecule as its metabolism is not required for mTORC1 activation but it remains to be elucidated whether the effect is direct or indirect. Finally, arginine is the only amino acid that mTORC1 activity shows sensitivity to in both undifferentiated stem cells and subsequent differentiated lineages demonstrating the fundamental importance of the mechanism described herein. This report further highlights the complex signaling interplay between different growth-promoting stimuli in regulating mTORC1 at the level of lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arginine is essential for mTORC1 activity</title><p>The presence of amino acids is a prerequisite for mTORC1 activity. Leucine in particular has been well documented for its role in the regulation of mTORC1 and its growth-promoting properties. However, the contribution and mechanisms of action of other amino acids are not as well understood. To further explore amino acid signaling, we investigated the sensitivity of mTORC1 to essential and conditionally essential amino acids in a panel of cell lines. Acute deprivation of leucine, arginine, or glutamine alone was observed to significantly perturb mTORC1 activity in multiple cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–G</xref> and see, among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>]). Deprivation of other single amino acids, including isoleucine and methionine, did not significantly affect mTORC1 activity in any cell line tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–G</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, mTORC1 was found to be differentially sensitive to amino acids in different cell lines. For example, sensitivity to glutamine, previously associated with leucine-dependent and -independent mechanisms of mTORC1 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jewell et al., 2015</xref>), varied significantly. While glutamine was essential for mTORC1 activation in both HeLa and HEK293T cells, it was less important in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, removal of leucine significantly suppressed mTORC1 activity in most cell lines with an exception of HeLa and U2OS. Of particular interest, we found that mTORC1 activity is dependent on arginine in every cell line tested. Therefore, this amino acid appears to be a fundamentally important regulator of mTORC1.</p><p>Simultaneous deprivation of arginine and leucine had an additive effect on mTORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>), while at the same time they (alongside glutamine which is known to be required for the transport of leucine into the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>]) represent a sufficient signal to activate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). No one individual amino acid is sufficient to activate mTORC1, but this is unlikely to be a result of lower intracellular concentrations. Thus, for example, arginine uptake is in fact increased in cells completely starved of all amino acids compared to the cells incubated with complete amino acids, presumably due to a lack of competition for transport into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). mTORC1 activity induced by a combination of arginine, leucine, and glutamine is minimal compared to that of a complete set of amino acids; however, it is not further enhanced by the addition of any other individual amino acid, such as isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref> and data not shown). Together, these data suggest that arginine, leucine and glutamine represent the major contributors to amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation. Moreover, the synergistic effect of these amino acids on mTORC1 activity rather than simply concentration-dependent effects suggests they act via multiple mechanisms.</p><p>We observe that metabolism or cellular utilization of arginine does not participate in its ability to activate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–J</xref>). Rather, interventions that increase intracellular levels of arginine (such as knock-down of arginyl-tRNA synthetase (RARs), L-norvaline (an arginase inhibitor), and cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein translation)) enhanced the activity of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,E,J</xref>), suggesting that arginine acts as an intact molecule. Indeed, we observed that upon arginine starvation and recovery, arginine uptake is rapid and intracellular concentrations of arginine recover to steady state levels within 15 min of arginine re-addition. Within this same time frame, there were no changes in metabolites associated with arginine metabolism such as ornithine, citrulline, arginosuccinate, or fumarate indicating that arginine remains intact during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Furthermore, following the addition of stable radiolabeled arginine (13C6,15N4) for 2 hr, we did not observe its incorporation into any other metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that arginine turnover is slow, at least in HeLa cells. These data suggest that free arginine is an important signal regulating mTORC1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Arginine activates mTORC1 via TSC-Rheb axis</title><p>Several observations argue for a mechanism of arginine action different to that of leucine. First, deprivation of arginine but not leucine or isoleucine, significantly perturbed the growth factor-dependent input into mTORC1. This is evident from suppressed phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ULK1, with a concomitant increase in autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Deprivation of arginine in the presence of growth factors limits mTORC1 activation to a level similar to that resulting from serum starvation. Addition of growth factors to leucine or isoleucine-deprived cells, however, permits maximal mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Amino acids, particularly leucine, are known to signal to mTORC1 via the V-ATPase/Ragulator/Rag GTPase protein complexes and have been comprehensively demonstrated to control mTORC1 localization to the lysosome and its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 2014</xref>). We observed that arginine did not affect mTOR localization in any cell line tested. While complete amino acid starvation and, to a lesser extent, leucine starvation, caused redistribution of mTORC1 to the cytoplasm, arginine deprivation led to a strong suppression of mTORC1 without a significant reduction in co-localization of mTOR with the lysosomal marker Lamp1 in HeLa, MEFs, and HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active Rag heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>) did not completely rescue the effect of arginine starvation in the absence or presence of growth factors, thus suggesting that arginine may affect mTORC1 both via Rag-dependent and Rag-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>).

Note that exogenous L-citrulline, supplemented to the cells can be efficiently metabolised into arginosuccinate (<bold>H</bold>) and that in the presence of L-norvaline, intracellular levels of ornithine are decreased (<bold>I</bold>). Moreover, L-norvaline increased mTORC1 signaling, supporting the idea that by preventing arginine metabolism and increasing its levels one can enhance activity of mTORC1. These data together suggest that arginine molecules themselves participate in mTORC1 regulation as treatments that cause an increase in intracellular arginine concentration (e.g. by suppression of protein translation and inhibition of arginase) lead to increased mTORC1 activity, while arginine metabolism is not required for mTORC1.

Upstream signaling events from growth factors via PI3K-Akt to TSC are not affected by deprivation of arginine (or complete amino acid or leucine), as assessed by Akt phosphorylation at both threonine 308 and serine 473 and downstream phosphorylation of TSC2 at serine 939 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H–K</xref>). Similarly, arginine starvation is unlikely to suppress mTORC1 via activation AMPK, as neither in HeLa cells, where this pathway has low activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corradetti et al., 2004</xref>), nor in MEFs did we observe any increase in AMPK phosphorylation in response to arginine, leucine or complete amino acid withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3L,M</xref>). The loss of <italic>TSC2</italic>, however, did render MEFs insensitive to arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3N,O</xref>), suggesting that arginine contributes to mTORC1 activity at the level of TSC. At the same time, sensitivity to leucine and complete amino acid starvation was preserved in <italic>TSC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3N,O</xref>) in agreement with the idea that they are activating mTORC1 via other mechanisms such as Rag-dependent mTOR localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Dynamic changes in TSC localization to lysosomes have been shown to control mTORC1 activity; however, it remains controversial whether it is regulated by growth factors or amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we next investigated whether arginine could be involved in this process. In normal growth conditions, TSC2 was found in a diffuse pattern within both HeLa and MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). While serum starvation or arginine deprivation in the presence of dialyzed serum moderately promoted TSC2 localization to the lysosomal compartment, simultaneous starvation of arginine and growth factors resulted in an additive effect leading to very strong recruitment of TSC2 to Rab7- and Lamp1-positive late endosomal and lysosomal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), which also correlates with a robust impairment of mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref>). Recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes was confirmed to be specific and no significant localization of TSC2 to other cellular organelles such as mitochondria, Golgi, or peroxisomes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>]). The effect of arginine is similar to that of all amino acids, while leucine did not influence lysosomal localization of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Replenishment of amino acids or arginine following starvation caused re-distribution of TSC2 to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of arginine but not leucine to cells starved of all amino acids was sufficient to cause significant re-distribution of TSC2 to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>), demonstrating that arginine acts as a specific inhibitor of TSC2 recruitment to lysosomes. We further confirmed these immunofluorescence observations by lysosomal fractionation (enrichment of lysosomes was determined by western blot for multiple membrane and soluble proteins [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>]). Indeed, TSC2 was found to strongly accumulate upon a combination of serum and arginine (or all amino acid) starvation and, to a lesser extent, upon removal of a single stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The amount of Rheb in lysosomal fractions was not significantly affected by our starvation protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>), suggesting that changes in localization of TSC in response to arginine may regulate Rheb function on lysosomes.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11058.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Arginine regulates TSC2 localization to the lysosome.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Starvation of arginine and growth factors cooperate to promote recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes.

In our system, we confirmed the central importance of Rheb in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al., 2014</xref>) by demonstrating that Rheb knock-down or inhibition of Rheb farnesylation (and therefore its membrane recruitment) completely prevented the arginine and growth factor starvation-induced re-localization of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>), we also found that expression of the dominant negative Rag constructs partially reduced lysosomal localization of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Consistent with its role in regulating mTORC1 via Rag GTPases, knock-down of SLC38A9 had a mild effect on TSC2 re-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Furthermore, we tested whether mTOR itself is required for TSC recruitment to lysosomes. Knock-down of mTOR suppressed recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). At the same time, rapamycin did not affect TSC2 recruitment suggesting that the activity of mTORC1 is not required for this translocation event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>). As knockdown or hyperactivation of Rheb did not affect either total mTOR protein levels or lysosomal localization of mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>, also see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>]), Rheb-dependent recruitment of TSC2 is unlikely to be indirectly mediated by perturbed mTOR localization. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that interaction with Rheb is the main mechanism of TSC2 recruitment to lysosomes but, in addition, the integrity of a larger lysosomal protein complex, including mTORC1 and Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>), is also important, possibly indirectly by regulating Rheb activity, localization or availability.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11058.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Rheb is required for the amino acid-dependent recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomal membranes.</title><p>HeLa cells (<bold>A–C</bold>) and MEFs (<bold>D–F</bold>) were treated with scramble (Scr) or Rheb siRNA for 96 hr and subjected to different starvation protocols as indicated.

It was not clear, however, whether this interference was occurring at the surface of the lysosome. To investigate this, TSC2 was constitutively targeted to the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes by a p18-derived lysosomal targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, inactivation of mTORC1 signaling by either wild-type or constitutively lysosomal TSC2 was found to be suppressed by arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that arginine interferes with Rheb-TSC2 interaction irrespective of lysosomal recruitment. To test this, we performed pull-down assays where immunoprecipitated Flag-Rheb was incubated with lysates of cells expressing V5-TSC2 and subjected to serum and amino acid starvation protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In agreement with inhibition of Rheb-TSC2 interaction by arginine, deprivation of arginine but not leucine promoted strong binding of TSC2 to Rheb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, an interaction of TSC2 (immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells) with recombinant GST-Rheb in vitro was perturbed by the addition of physiological concentrations of arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These findings do not preclude an indirect effect of arginine via a putative sensor co-immunoprecipitated with TSC2; however, it strongly supports the role of arginine in regulating Rheb-TSC2 interaction. In agreement with binding assays, arginine also reduced the ability of TSC2 to promote hydrolysis of Rheb-bound GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TSC inhibits GTP-loaded Rheb by a GAP-independent mechanism</title><p>Interestingly, despite the strong interaction of Rheb with TSC2 in the absence of arginine, a large fraction of Rheb (~40%) remains in GTP-bound active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>). This is consistent with data in vivo suggesting that a large fraction of Rheb remains in GTP-bound form even when mTORC1 is inactivated by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Long et al., 2005b</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a stable interaction between GTP-loaded Rheb and TSC2 may lead to steric hindrance or a conformational change thus preventing activation of mTORC1 by Rheb. In agreement with this idea, the increased binding of TSC to Rheb is at the expense of the interaction between Rheb and mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), which would render mTORC1 inactive and explain severe inhibition of its activity seen in complete starvation conditions.</p><p>If TSC2 can inactivate Rheb by an additional, GAP-independent mechanism then TSC2 should still be able to inhibit mTORC1 activity driven by constitutively GTP-loaded Rheb mutants. Indeed, overexpression of TSC2 efficiently inhibited activation of mTORC1 by both wild-type and active Rheb mutants (R15G and N153T) both in the presence and absence of growth factors, despite resistance of these constructs to GAP activity of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B,H</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Urano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marshall et al., 2009</xref>]). Similarly, if binding of TSC2 to Rheb is sufficient to inhibit its activity towards mTORC1, then GAP activity of TSC2 may be dispensable. This is indeed the case as overexpression of GAP-domain-dead TSC2 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) efficiently suppressed activity of endogenous or overexpressed Rheb, and perturbed Rheb-mTOR binding, albeit to a lesser extent when compared to the wild-type construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I,J</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we propose that one of the mechanisms by which serum and amino acid (particularly arginine) starvation suppresses activity of mTORC1 is by increased TSC2-Rheb interaction on lysosomes, which results in a partial hydrolysis of GTP as well as in the shielding of remaining GTP-loaded Rheb from mTORC1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Arginine is a primary amino acid input into mTORC1</title><p>Finally, we tested the relative contribution of arginine-dependent mTORC1 regulation as compared to branched chain amino acids, sensing of which is believed to be the main function of mTORC1, in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and adult human cells differentiated from hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>).

While the role of leucine, together with glutamine, in Rag-dependent activation of mTORC1 has been the subject of intense investigations, the role of arginine in mTORC1 activation has remained relatively understudied. Arginine can contribute to mTORC1 activity via the canonical amino acid sensing, Ragulator/Rag signaling pathway via the recently characterized low-affinity amino acid transporter SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebsamen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jung et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that arginine also works via the parallel, TSC2-Rheb signaling axis upstream of mTORC1 and stimulation of both inputs is required for the maximal activation of this signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In particular, we show that arginine cooperates with growth factors and acts as a permissive factor for their activation of mTORC1. Growth factors and arginine interfere with the TSC2-Rheb interaction; while Akt-mediated growth factor signaling phosphorylates TSC2, arginine does not affect phosphorylation of Akt, at least on the sites tested in this study. Instead, arginine appears to act as an intact molecule at a site more proximal to the TSC2-Rheb interaction, whether acting directly or via a putative sensor molecule.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11058.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model of amino acid-dependent mTORC1 regulation.</title><p>Amino acids, most notably <bold>l</bold>eucine activates mTORC1 via Rag GTPases and recruitment of mTOR to lysosomes.

Our measurements of TSC2 localization and nucleotide loading of Rheb help to explain this mechanistically. We propose that in response to serum or arginine starvation TSC2 transiently interacts with Rheb in a GTP-bound conformation on the surface of lysosomes promoting its GTPase activity. However, due to high basal GTP levels of Rheb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2004</xref>), the GAP activity of TSC2 is not sufficient for complete GTP hydrolysis to GDP leaving a substantial fraction of Rheb in a GTP-bound state. This residual-active GTP-bound Rheb allows for the low level of mTORC1 activation in conditions of serum or arginine starvation. On the other hand, deprivation of both stimuli results in a complete suppression of mTORC1 activity, which is associated with a stable interaction of TSC with Rheb on lysosomes. This complex formation serves to sequester Rheb and to prevent its interaction with mTORC1 and its activation. By regulating Rheb-TSC2 interaction, arginine acts as a switch for upstream signaling inputs from growth factors.</p><p>Previous reports describing the spatial regulation of TSC2 as a mechanism controlling mTORC1 activity have demonstrated that various inputs such as mechanical stimulation, growth factors and amino acids can contribute to the tight regulation of the lysosomal localization of TSC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al. (2014)</xref> argue the importance of an amino acid/Rag GTPase-dependent recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes, while instead <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrate that deprivation of growth factors, the classical regulators of TSC activity, controls its recruitment to lysosomes. Our findings begin to reconcile these differences by identifying that amino acids (specifically arginine) cooperate with growth factors to fine tune the spatial and temporal regulation of TSC and therefore mTORC1. We show that both arginine and growth factors suppress strong recruitment of TSC2 to lysosomes by interfering with stable TSC2-Rheb interaction as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Menon et al. (2014)</xref>. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al. (2014)</xref>, we also find a role of Rag GTPases in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demetriades et al., 2014</xref>), which are likely to be acting via mTORC1, thus suggesting that the recruitment of TSC to lysosomes is a complex process mediated not only by Rheb but also by its interacting partners. At the same time, by proposing a dual mechanism of Rheb inhibition by TSC (GTPase activation and sequestration into a stable complex which prevents the interaction of Rheb with mTOR as discussed above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), our interpretation of TSC2 localization phenotypes conceptually extends the conclusions of others.</p><p>The ability of arginine to regulate mTORC1 activity is fundamentally important, and it is the only amino acid essential to both undifferentiated stem cells and differentiated lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The fact that mTORC1 sensitivity to leucine is acquired only after differentiation might reflect the need to integrate an increased complexity of extracellular stimuli to mTORC1. Arginine is an essential amino acid during embryogenesis which is a period of active growth and proliferation largely driven by mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hentges et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2013</xref>), and we speculate that this underlies the dependence of mTORC1 on this amino acid. Growth-promoting signals in the absence of arginine would lead to defective protein synthesis, which would explain the need for coordination between growth factor and arginine availability. We acknowledge, however, that other, arginine-independent molecular mechanisms contribute to mTORC1 regulation, and, together, these serve to provide extremely tight spatial and temporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling in response to nutrients. Indeed, while arginine, leucine, and glutamine are sufficient for mTORC1 signaling, the level of activation achieved by these amino acids is very low compared to an entire set of free amino acids. Understanding the mechanisms by which mTORC1 is sensing the entire complement of amino acids provides an exciting challenge for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless indicated otherwise.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HeLa cells, HEK293T, the osteosarcoma U2OS, primary human fibroblasts (MRC5), TSC2-deficient (<italic>TSC2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) and wild-type (<italic>TSC2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines (MEFs) (a kind gift from D.

It was assumed that, because of the conservation of mechanism in small G-Protein-GAP systems, the two components of the Rheb-TSC2 complex would be oriented relative to one another in the same way, so an interface of approximately correct structure would be produced by superposing each component on its homologue in the Rap1-Rap1GAP complex.</p><p>TSC2: The model structure of the TSC2 GAP domain was generated with the SWISS-MODEL server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2006</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/">http://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>).

Briefly, hESC colonies were enzymatically removed from the MEF feeder layer using 1 mg/ml collagenase type IV. The hESC clusters were collected, rinsed, re-suspended in NPM medium (DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with B-27, 1 mM L-Glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin) and cultured as free–floating clusters in a low-adherent suspension culture plates; culture medium was replenished every 3–4 days. In the first 4 days of differentiation, hESC clusters were cultured in NPM medium in the presence of 10 μM SB431542 (Stemgent; inhibitor of activin and TGFβ signaling), 20 ng/ml FGF2 (R&amp;D Systems) and 500 ng/ml noggin (Peprotech). For the next 10 days, the clusters were cultured in NPM medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2 and 500 ng/ml noggin. The clusters were finally cultured for further 7 days in NPM medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2 only. After 3 weeks of culturing, the clusters were highly enriched for neural precursors (NPs) that could be further expanded and scaled up. For this purpose, clusters were collected, briefly treated with accutase (Life Technologies) and dissociated by gently pipetting. Cells were then plated in high density and cultured in NPM medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2 and 20 ng/ml EGF (R&amp;D Systems) on plates pre-coated with 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine and 4 μg/ml laminin for 1–2 weeks for expansion. The culture medium was replenished every 3–4 days. For further neuronal differentiation, NPs were passaged and plated in low density on poly-D-lysine/laminin–coated plates and cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with N-2 (Life Technologies), B-27 (Life Technologies), 1 mM L-Glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acid, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin with no mitogens for 2-3 weeks. Mature neurons were probed for cell-specific markers, such as neuronal class III β-tubulin (Tuj1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-3"><title>In vitro differentiation of hESCs into fibroblast-like cells</title><p>hESCs were differentiated into fibroblast-like cells as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). Briefly, hESC colonies were harvested using 1 mg/ml collagenase type IV, separated from the MEF feeder cells by gravity, gently triturated and cultured for 10 days in low-adherent suspension culture plates in fibroblast medium containing 20% FBS to form EBs. EBs were subsequently plated onto adherent tissue culture dishes and passaged according to primary fibroblast protocols using trypsin for at least four passages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Quantification of confocal images was carried out by two separate techniques. First, the percentage of cells with punctate mTOR or TSC2 (as a proxy for membrane localization of these proteins) was blindly scored. &gt;300 cells were counted per slide and quantification is based on at least three independent experiments unless otherwise stated. Second, confocal images were collected and the co-localization plug-in in ImageJ was used to measure the co-localization between mTOR or TSC2 and the lysosomal protein Lamp1. A constant threshold was applied to all the images in the z-stack, and for every image within each experiment. Following application of the co-localization plug-in, all channels were projected (max) and quantified using Analyse particle plugin (particles 5 pixels and above were included). The data were expressed as a percentage of mTOR or TSC2 that co-localized with Lamp1. Quantification was carried out on 20–40 cells per condition from at three independent experiments. Quantification of immunoblots was carried out using ImageJ software (NIH). Two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-tests were carried out on experimental data from at least three individual experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for funding from BBSRC, MRC, British Skin Foundation and NIHR (VIK) and the Association for International Cancer Research (Career Development Fellowship [No.06-914/915] (to A.R.T.); Addgene, David Kwiatkowski (Harvard University, Boston) and Mark Nellist (Erasmus MC, Rotterdam) and Brendan Manning (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston) for valuable reagents; Karen Vousden (Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow) for providing expertise in metabolomics; Manuele Rebsamen and Giulio Superti-Furga (CeMM, Vienna) for technical advice on SLC38A9 immunoblotting; S Drain, L Xie and MA Cohen for technical assistance.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>The authors report that, unlike other amino acids such as leucine, Arg is important for growth factor signaling to mTORC1 by negatively regulating the lysosomal translocation of the TSC complex. The depletion of arginine (but not leucine) induced the interaction between TSC2 and Rheb. The authors further suggest that the TSC complex inhibits mTORC1 activity not only by stimulating Rheb GTPase activity as a GAP, but also by sequestering the active Rheb from mTORC1 on the lysosomes. On the other hand, involvements of Rag, SLC38A9, and mTOR in the TSC2 translocation are minor. Finally, Arg is important for a wide range of cell types including hESCs. mTORC1 dependence on Leu is observed in differentiated cells but not in ESCs. Although there is no discussion of how TSC2 is sensing arginine, overall the manuscript represents a significant advance in this important field.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) The authors propose the model where arginine itself but not its metabolites blocks lysosomal localization of TSC2 likely though its inhibitory effect on the interaction between TSC2 and active Rheb. Is this due to a direct effect of arginine on TSC2 or Rheb, which interferes the interaction between TSC2 and active Rheb (GTP-bound form)? The effect of arginine should be studied in vitro using the immunoprecipitated TSC complex and the purified GTP-bound form of Rheb.</p> <p>2) Since both the TSC complex and mTORC1 directly interact with GTP-loaded Rheb in vivo, the model that TSC inhibits GTP-loaded Rheb by steric hindrance should be directly tested in cells in the presence or absence of arginine. Do both wild type and the mutant TSC2 sufficiently block the interaction between active Rheb and mTORC1 under arginine-deficient conditions?</p> <p>3) It is not convincing if this pathway is indeed independent of or parallel to the SLC38A9 pathway. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>, there is essentially no difference between siScr and siSLC38A9, but the knockdown of SLC38A9 is not supported by any data. Since these data suggest SLC38A9 does not affect mTORC1 activity, it is critical to demonstrate its knockdown efficiency.

Most importantly, the suggested experiments strengthened our conclusions about the role of arginine in disrupting the interaction between TSC2 and Rheb. Specifically, the new in vitro experiments performed with recombinant Rheb and immunoprecipitated TSC2 demonstrated an effect of arginine on binding and nucleotide loading of Rheb. These experiments do not demonstrate a direct effect of arginine on Rheb-TSC2 interaction (since a potential arginine sensor can be co-purified with TSC2) however they strongly support the role of arginine in regulating mTORC1 via this signalling axis.</p> <p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) The authors propose the model where arginine itself but not its metabolites blocks lysosomal localization of TSC2 likely though its inhibitory effect on the interaction between TSC2 and active Rheb.

The effect of arginine should be studied in vitro using the immunoprecipitated TSC complex and the purified GTP-bound form of Rheb.</italic> </p> <p>We thoroughly agree that the experiment suggested here will help further elucidate the specific role of arginine on TSC2-Rheb interactions. In collaboration with the lab of Owen Davies at Newcastle University we were able to purify recombinant GST-Rheb. This was loaded with non-hydrolysable GTP and incubated with TSC2 complexes immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells, in the presence or absence of arginine (100µM). We found that indeed, the presence of arginine perturbed the interaction of Rheb and TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, GAP assays show that in the presence of arginine (100µM) there is a small perturbation of TSC2-dependent GTP hydrolysis of Rheb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>).</p> <p>These new data do not exclude an indirect effect of arginine by acting upon a putative arginine sensor co-immunoprecipitated with TSC2 (this is made clear in the text), however they strongly support our conclusions about the role of arginine in controlling TSC2-Rheb interaction.</p> <p><italic>2) Since both the TSC complex and mTORC1 directly interact with GTP-loaded Rheb in vivo, the model that TSC inhibits GTP-loaded Rheb by steric hindrance should be directly tested in cells in the presence or absence of arginine. Do both wild type and the mutant TSC2 sufficiently block the interaction between active Rheb and mTORC1 under arginine-deficient conditions?</italic> </p> <p>We performed the experiments addressing this point where cells were transfected with TSC2 WT and GAP-deficient mutants, R1743Q and L1624P, and immunoprecipitations of GST-Rheb were carried out to monitor the effect of these mutants on its binding with mTOR. We find that R1743Q is as effective as WT TSC2 at disrupting the interaction of Rheb and mTOR while the additional TSC2 L1624P has a lesser effect but is still able to cause some dissociation between mTOR and Rheb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>)</p> <p><italic>3) It is not convincing if this pathway is indeed independent of or parallel to the SLC38A9 pathway.

Is it also possible to include some positive controls to show that the function of SLC38A9 is suppressed? Additionally, the authors need to provide an explanation for the difference between the current results and published results by Sabatini's and Superti-Furga's groups.</italic> </p> <p>We have now included Western blot data to confirm the knock-down of SLC38A9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Apologies but we were unable to find a suitable positive control for the knock down of SLC38A9 in the literature. The efficiency of knock-down is similar to that reported by Sabatini and Superti-Furga groups and we confirm their previous findings that knock-down of SLC38A9 leads to a significant delay in recovery following amino acid (specifically arginine) starvation and re-addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref> panel 1, left hand side). Both groups show SLC38A9 as a critical component of the Ragulator-Rag amino acid sensing pathway and Guan’s group have shown similar kinetics of mTORC1 perturbation in Rag knock-out MEFs characterised by a significant delay and dampening in recovery of mTORC1 activity following re-addition of amino acids (Jewell et al, Science, 2015). It is not clear from either Sabatini or Superti-Furga reports whether basal levels of mTORC1 are affected by SLC38A9. Our data would suggest mTORC1 is still active in basal conditions in SLC38A9 depleted cells (similar to Rag KO MEFs (Jewell et al, Science, 2015)). Furthermore, in support of both previous papers, we find that mTORC1 is effectively inhibited upon amino acid removal, i.e. there is no defect in sensing loss of amino acids.</p> <p>We believe our data is in line with previously published reports and there is little discrepancy.</p> <p><italic>4) The biochemical data showing that Arg starvation causes TSC2 translocation to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) is important to support the microscopy data. However, it is unclear how specifically lysosomes are enriched in the &quot;lysosome&quot; fraction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> 2H, only peroxisome and plasma membrane markers are tested. At least major organelles such as the ER and mitochondria should be included.</italic> </p> <p>These have now been included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>). There is significant enrichment of lysosomes in the preps but also some contamination from other cellular membrane compartments including plasma membrane, Golgi and mitochondria. We make it clear in the text that these preparations are enriched in lysosomes rather than pure lysosomal fractions. Please note that the level of contamination by organelles other than lysosomes does not correlate with the levels of TSC2 in different starvation conditions.</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
