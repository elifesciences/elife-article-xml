essential role in human health and agriculture. Pathogenic mutations in the P5CS gene (ALDH18A1) lead to neurocutaneous syndrome and skin relaxation connective tissue disease in humans, and P5CS deficiency seriously damages the ability to resist adversity in plants. We have recently found that P5CS forms cytoophidia in vivo and filaments in vitro. However, it is difficult to appreciate the function of P5CS filamentation without precise structures. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we solve the structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> full-length P5CS in three states at resolution from 3.1 to 4.3 Å. We observe distinct ligand-binding states and conformational changes for the GK and GPR domains, respectively. Divergent helical filaments are assembled by P5CS tetramers and stabilized by multiple interfaces. Point mutations disturbing those interfaces prevent P5CS filamentation and greatly reduce the enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal that filamentation is crucial for the coordination between the GK and GPR domains, providing a structural basis for the catalytic function of P5CS filaments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>P5CS</kwd><kwd>cytoophidium</kwd><kwd>proline synthesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>metabolic enzyme</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA0804701-4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ji-Long</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ji-Long</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20JC1410500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ji-Long</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length P5CS, the proline synthesis enzyme, reveal that filamentation is crucial for the coordinated catalytic reactions between the glutamate kinase and γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase domains.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bifunctional enzyme Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) is responsible for proline and ornithine metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumgartner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgartner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pérez-Arellano et al., 2010</xref>).

Therefore, P5CS is of great significance in human health and agriculture.</p><p>Previous studies have revealed a characteristic compartmentation of enzymes via filamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hunkeler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson and Kollman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park and Horton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stoddard et al., 2020</xref>). This filamentous structure is membraneless and termed the cytoophidium for its appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu, 2016</xref>). The cytoophidium has emerged as a mechanism for the regulation of metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hansen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, we have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS forms cytoophidia in vivo and forms individual filaments in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>P5CS corresponds to two individual proteins in prokaryotes and some lower eukaryotes such as yeast. One is the glutamate kinase (GK, <italic>pro</italic>B gene), and the other is γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase (GPR, <italic>pro</italic>A gene) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Kinetic analysis suggest that bacterial GK and GPR form a complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gamper and Moses, 1974</xref>). The dual functions of P5CS in higher eukaryotes implicate that both GK and GPR have evolved into one single protein for coupling reactions. However, no structure of the full-length P5CS has been solved. The underlying mechanisms of the catalytic reaction and the function of filamentation remain unknown.</p><p>Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), here we solve the structures of full-length P5CS in multiple filamentous states. We reconstruct <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS structures at 3.1–4.3 Å resolutions, providing detailed information of the P5CS filaments bound with different ligands. Our results describe the assembly mechanism of P5CS filaments, in which the GK domain forms tetramer and the GPR domain forms dimer structure, and both domains form specific interaction interfaces. Based on these structures, we propose a working model that filamentation is critical for the coordinated reactions between GK and GPR, the two domains of P5CS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structures of P5CS filaments</title><p>The P5CS molecule contains two domains, GK and GPR, catalyzing the first and second steps in the biosynthesis of proline from glutamate.

First, we analyzed the APO and substrate-bound states of P5CS by negative staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). In our previous study, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS in the APO state is hard to form filaments at low concentrations (&lt;0.05 μM). The addition of glutamate to the P5CS samples induces micron-scale filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we observe that increasing P5CS concentration (&gt;1 μM) also promotes the formation of filaments in the APO state. Our results show that the P5CS proteins can be self-assembled into filaments without ligands, and adding all substrates increases the length of filaments at the same concentration of the P5CS proteins. Consistent with our previous study, glutamate (a substrate of P5CS) promotes the formation and maintenance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, samples of the P5CS proteins incubated with different combinations of substrates were prepared for cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–J</xref>). Filaments in three conditions with (1) glutamate (P5CS<sup>Glu</sup>), (2) glutamate and ATPγS (P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup>), and (3) glutamate, ATP, and NADPH (P5CS<sup>Mix</sup>) were imaged in cryo-EM for single-particle analysis (SPA). Long and flexible filaments of P5CS were observed under all the three conditions. After 3D classification and 3D reconstruction, the electron density maps of the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup>, P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup>, and P5CS<sup>Mix</sup> filaments reached resolutions of 4.0 Å, 4.2 Å, and 3.6 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).

GK domain; (3) the NADPH-binding domain (NBD), (4) the catalytic domain (CD), and (5) the oligomerization domain (OD) at the GPR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). In the model, two P5CS monomers dimerize through the interaction between their GPR domains, where the β21 at the CD interacts with the β24 at the OD of the other monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This interaction connects two groups of hairpins and maintains the homodimer structure by a hydrogen bond network. Two P5CS dimers further assemble into a compact tetramer through the interaction at the GK domains. The P5CS tetramer serves as the building block of P5CS filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>P5CS filament structures in all the three states showed characteristics of double helix (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). We chose the P5CS<sup>Mix</sup> filament to display the details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In the helical P5CS filament structure, the GK tetramers serve as the core of the filament, and the GPR dimers form left-handed double helix structures around the central axis. The overall diameter of P5CS filaments in all three states is 180 Å, while the helical twist is 68° and the helical rise is 60 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structural comparison of ligand-bound GK domains</title><p>The GK domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS is conserved with the GK protein in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

We speculate that there are two ligand-binding modes (bound with Glu-Mg-ATPγS and G5P-Mg-ADP, respectively) in the P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup> filament. These two modes may coexist in the active sites of the GK tetramer, thereby affecting the 3D reconstruction of the structures. The unexpected presence of G5P could be due to the contamination of ATP in the commercial ATPγS (80% pure) and all substrates were in excess during our sample preparation. Thus, no ligand was modeled in the GK domain structure of the P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup> filament.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes in the glutamate kinase (GK) domain-binding pocket.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GK domain of the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup> filament, with glutamate shown as sticks with yellow carbons.

In the P5CS<sup>Mix</sup> filament, the same segment shifts away from the top of the binding pocket and forms an open loop, in which residue M213 interacts with G5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We notice that the closed loop has a steric clash with G5P, preventing the binding of G5P under such a conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We have found that the structures of CD and OD are generally consistent in those two states, while NBD of the GPR domain in those two states differs greatly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

A similar phenomenon was also observed in ALDH1L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsybovsky and Krupenko, 2011</xref>). This transformation contributes to bringing the nicotinamide ring of the NADP(H) close to the catalytic residue C598 of CD.

In a GK tetramer, four hooks extrude toward two opposite directions to form a ‘spinning top’ arrangement. Therefore, two pairs of hooks in a GK tetramer interact with their counterparts in two adjacent GK tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>). The hook interaction forms strong contacts via hydrogen bonds (M119-R124, L121-M123) and salt bridges (E116-R124).

Due to the lack of ATP-bound structure, it is difficult to determine whether ATP plays a decisive role in these conformational changes. According to a previous report on the N-acetyl-<sc>l</sc>-glutamate kinase (NAGK), nucleoside is important for the conformational change of the AAK domain, and the structures are similar when bound by ADP or AMPPNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gil-Ortiz et al., 2011</xref>). Based on the similarity of sequences and structures between GK and NAGK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marco-Marín et al., 2007</xref>), we propose that the conformation of the GK domain in the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup> filament would transform upon the binding of ATP, thereby triggering the formation of hook structure and completing the catalytic reaction. Although we solved the clear structure of the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup> filament, further research is needed to understand how the conformation of glutamate binding contributes to the extension of P5CS filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The GPR domain</title><p>Aspartate-β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH) catalyzes NADPH-dependent reductive dephosphorylation of β-aspartyl phosphate to aspartate-β-semialdehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karsten and Viola, 1991</xref>). The GPR domain of P5CS and ASADH catalyzes the same type of reaction. Interestingly, the binding of NADP<sup>+</sup> will change the cofactor binding domain of ASADH from open conformation to closed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hadfield et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, we speculate that their catalytic mechanisms have something in common. In the GPR domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS, our data suggest that the catalytic residue C598 of CD attacks the G5P to form the first tetrahedral thioacetal intermediate in the reaction, and then expulsion of phosphate collapses to form a stable thioacyl enzyme intermediate. A hydride is then transferred to this intermediate from NADPH, with subsequent collapse to release the product GSA. Furthermore, the NADPH-binding site is located inside the filament, close to the GK domain. The G5P binding site is close to the external solution environment, which is proposed to facilitate the release of the product GSA/P5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). G5P can freely bind to the GPR domain in our model (G5P-binding state). However, in the closed conformation, when the nicotinamide ring of NADP(H) approaches the G5P-binding site, the substrate tunnel entrance may be blocked by NADP(H). This may affect the subsequent binding of G5P. Therefore, we speculate that the GPR domain should bind with G5P prior to NADPH binding. However, whether this mechanism is a preferred binding order needs to be further verified by kinetic experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The P5CS filament</title><p>As mentioned in the ‘Results’ section, we observed that mutated residues R124A and F642A do not directly participate in the active sites, while they are crucial for filamentation. This suggests that the P5CS filamentation couples the reaction catalyzed between the GK domain and GPR domain through transferring unstable intermediate G5P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pérez-Arellano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seddon et al., 1989</xref>).

In addition, P5CS filamentation may create a half-opened chamber with the active sites located at the inner part of the filament. Since the GK domain is catalytically faster than the GPR domain, the unstable intermediates G5P accumulate within the filament. This microenvironment may reduce the amount of G5P escaped into the solvent, thereby facilitating the rate-limiting reaction at the GPR domain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The working model</title><p>Together, we propose a coupling catalytic reaction mechanism of <italic>Drosophila</italic> dynamic P5CS filament. In this proposed model, spontaneous filamentation occurs at the APO state, and elongation of P5CS filament is associated with the binding of glutamate. Upon the binding of glutamate, the binding pocket at the GK domain is bound by ATP; subsequently, conformational changes facilitate the formation of a hook structure and phosphorylation of glutamate, which produces G5P. When products of the GK domain dissociate from the active site, G5P would be trapped by the channel and chamber within the filament and further captured by the GPR domain. Next, NADPH binds to the GPR domain, triggering the conformational change into closed conformation, which brings the NADPH towards the catalytic residue C598 and facilitates the reaction. After this reaction, NADP<sup>+</sup> and GSA will be released, and the GPR domain returns to its open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This working model suggests that the GK and GPR domains undergo continuous conformational transition during catalysis, resulting in a dynamic filament.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of P5CS filament structural transitions during GSA/P5C synthesis.</title><p>The P5CS molecule polymerizes into filaments at the APO state or after binding with the glutamate.

NADPH binding to the GPR domain transforms the domain to closed conformation, which enables NADPH to approach the catalytic site and completes reductive dephosphorylation of G5P. The GSA/P5C will be released, and the GPR domain returns to the unliganded state with open conformation.

We speculate that the swing of GPR in the catalytic reaction could destabilize the interaction between adjacent GPR domain dimers in the filament. Therefore, the extra interaction at the hook structure of the GK domain may be required for the stabilization of the filament. This proposed stabilization is consistent with negative stain data showing that the P5CS<sup>R124A</sup> mutant cannot stabilize the filament structure in the catalytic process and lose the ability to form the long filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>P5CS and human disease</title><p>Recently, accumulative evidences have shown that mutations on the human P5CS gene (<italic>ALDH18A1</italic>) is one of the causes of hyperammonemia, neurocutaneous syndromes, and motor neuron syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumgartner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Magini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marco-Marín et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pérez-Arellano et al., 2010</xref>).

The prepared protein samples were applied to glow-discharged carbon-coated EM grids (400 mech, EMCN), and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Negative-stain EM grids were photographed on a Tecnai Spirit G21 microscope (FEI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cryo-EM grid preparation and data collection</title><p>For cryo-EM, purified full-length P5CS was diluted to approximately 2 μM and dissolved in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and incubated with 20 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamate for the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup> filament preparation. The P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup> filament was added with an additional 0.5 mM ATPγS (Abcam) compared to the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup> filament. For the P5CS<sup>Mix</sup> filament, P5CS proteins (2 μM) were incubated with 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamate, 2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM NADPH. All the samples were incubated for 1 hr on ice before vitrification. The P5CS filament samples were placed on H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Cu 300 mesh, R1.2/1.3) or amorphous alloy film (CryoMatrix M024-Au300-R12/13). Then, the grids were immediately blotted for 3.0 s and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) at 4°C with 100% humidity. Images were collected on Titan Krios G3 (FEI) equipped with a K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan), operating in counting super-resolution mode at 300 kV with a total dose of 72 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, subdivided into 50 frames in 4 s exposure using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>). The images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 22,500 × and a calibrated pixel size of 1.06 Å, with defocus ranging from 0.8 to 2.5 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image processing and 3D reconstruction</title><p>The whole-image analysis was performed with RELION3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). We used MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>) via RELION GUI to pr-process the image, movie frames were aligned, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated in this process. After manual selection, there are 4933 images for the P5CS<sup>Glu</sup> dataset, 6408 images for the P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup> dataset, and 10,566 images for the P5CS<sup>Mix</sup> dataset left for further processing. For the flexibility of P5CS filaments, SPA was carried out in our reconstructions and no helical symmetry was implied in the whole process. Reference-free particle picking built in RELION3 was performed. This process provides 1,994,786 particles for P5CS<sup>Glu</sup>, 2,024,372 particles for P5CS<sup>Glu/ATPγS</sup>, and 8,027,582 particles for P5CS<sup>Mix</sup>. At first, the particles were extracted binning two or three times for the fast 2D classifications. Datasets were cleaned with several rounds of 2D classification and the bin factors were gradually reduced to one at the same time. After 3D classifications with C1 symmetry were applied, several classes were selected to do finer 3D classifications with D2 symmetry. Classes with the intact structure were retained for 3D refinement with D2 symmetry. For the 3D refinement, 432,746, 327,841, and 1,412,498 particles were used for each dataset. The maps including three P5CS tetramer layers were obtained. The relative motion between GK and GPR limited the refinement at a high resolution, so we used the partition reconstruction strategy to improve the resolution for both the GK and GPR domains. For the GK domain, we used continued local refinement to improve the resolution with a mask focus on the middle layer GK. Then, the Ctf-refinement and Bayesian polishing were performed for the remained particles and improved the resolution to 4. 1Å, 4.1 Å, and 3.6 Å for three-layer P5CS maps and 3.5 Å, 3.4 Å, and 3.1 Å for GK maps. For the GPR domain, particles were expended symmetry for the 3D classification without alignment. Several classes with the intact structure were selected and oriented; symmetry collapse was done at the same time. Then, 3D classifications and refinements with C2 symmetry were performed. For the P5CS<sup>Mix</sup>, two different states of GPR were captured. Finally, we got 286,291, 348,804, 193,482, and 233,624 particles to construct maps for the GPR domain with 3.6 Å, 4.2 Å, 4.3 Å, and 4.2 Å resolutions. LocalRes was used to estimate the local resolution of our map.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Model building refinement and validation</title><p>Based on our maps with the near-atomic resolution, the model of the GK and GPR domains was generated with focused refinement maps in different states. The initial model of the GK and GPR domains was generated via swiss model regarding 4Q1T (GK from <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>) and 2H5G (human GPR domain) as a reference, respectively. Manual adjustment and building the missing regions were done in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). Real space refinements were performed with Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis of dynamic P5CS filaments&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of wom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. All reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The major criticism of all three reviewers was that the paper needs major rewriting both to improve the presentation and to improve its clarity.</p><p>2) Significant questions were raised about the need for more mechanistic insight. This may require some additional experiments such as those suggested, and would also require a better discussion in the paper about mechanisms. Further, some claims may need to be tempered in the absence of a structure with bound ATP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The writing would greatly benefit from a professional editor.</p><p>The paper uses &quot;spiral&quot; in many places when they really mean &quot;helical&quot;. A spiral is defined as: winding in a continuous and gradually widening (or tightening) curve, either around a central point on a flat plane or about an axis so as to form a cone. In contrast, a helix has a fixed radius.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Most importantly, how does filamentation facilitate the reaction? Is it merely by local concentration effects, a.k.a. &quot;channeling&quot; between active sites via the filament interior? Or is it via concerted or coupled conformational changes within the filament? Is it possible that particular interactions within the filament may be required to stabilize particular conformations of the enzyme required for its activity? If so, then the filament also performs this function in facilitating the enzyme reaction. One could address this by investigating whether or not each active site is fully functional in the absence of filamentation. This could be accomplished using the non-filament forming mutant enzymes, and testing for the presence of the product of the first step separately from that of the second, rather than for only the product of both steps, as done in Figure 5. If the reaction intermediate is too unstable, an active site mutation in the second step active site could be utilized to stall the second reaction step and enable G5P to be measured.</p><p>2. None of the structures contain ATP. One contains ADP. Speculation on what ATP does to the structure should be tempered by this fact. Structures of ATP dependent enzymes generally show distinct structures when bound to ATP vs. ADP, although this may or may not be relevant here. Still, the qualification should be made and the language more careful to reflect this fact.</p><p>3. Movement of NADPH towards a C598 is mentioned, and C598 is mentioned to be important for enzyme activity. What does C598 do? Where is it located? A figure showing the relationship between C598 and NADPH in the two conformations would be useful, as well as a description of why the close approach of these moieties is important. C598 is shown in Figure 4B, though not discussed in the text pertaining to that figure, and it is close to G5P. Could it merely be involved in G5P binding?</p><p>4. Figure 4B, inset – the close proximity of D715 to G5P would appear to not be a favorable interaction. Are these mediated by any cations, or is the pKa of D715 known to be raised perhaps to be involved in the reaction mechanism?</p><p>5. The document needs professional language editing throughout to make the text easier to read, although the issues did not impede this reviewer from understanding the main points of the manuscript.</p><p>6. Legends of Figures 2 and 3 should explain what the dashed lines represent. From the text, these appear to be disordered residues, but that is not clear in viewing the figure alone.</p><p>7. Figure 2: the structure with Glu/ATPgammaS is not shown, yet the text (page 9 line 156) implies it should be. Is it not shown because its conformation is the same as that with G5P-Mg-ADP? Also, the text refers to P5CS^Mix, but the figure shows &quot;G5P-Mg-ADP bound&quot;. I gather that these are the same, but this should be made clear in one or both of the places they are discussed (i.e. the text and the figure). The figure legend mentions P5CS^Mix as having G5P-Mg-ADP bound, but the figure itself could also indicate which structure is which using the nomenclature of the text (i.e. P5CS^Glu/ATPgammaS and P5CS^Mix).</p><p>8. Page 9, line 165 &quot;L-glutamate is bound in a vertical way&quot;. This is not obvious in the figure. Also, it is difficult to see the L-glutamate with the color scheme chosen (also true of the ADP).</p><p>9. Page 9, line 170, &quot;the loop shifts away from the top of the binding pocket (Figure 3A)&quot;. Which loop? Can it be identified in the figure?</p><p>10. Page 9, line 171, M213 is mentioned, but not shown in the figure (sticks of the side chain can be seen if one looks very closely, but the residue should be labeled in the figure if it is mentioned in the text). What is the significance of M213? Why mention it?</p><p>11. Page 11, line 207, &quot;G5P-binging&quot;, is this &quot;G5P-binding&quot;?</p><p>12. Page 12, line 221 and Figure 4F, why is it a &quot;Rossmann-like fold&quot; and not a &quot;Rossman fold&quot;?</p><p>13. Page 12, line 228, beta9-beta10 is mentioned in Figure 4F and Figure 4-Video 1, but not identified in the figure or video. Labeling the CD would also be helpful to connect to the text.</p><p>14. page 15, line 285. &quot;First, the intermediate G5P is instability and the distance between the two reaction centers is about 60 Å&quot;. Does this mean G5P is unstable? How unstable? What is its lifetime under normal enzymatic conditions? A source for this information should also be cited.</p><p>15. Figure 5, S2 – it would be helpful to show roughly where the filament axis is in panel B – there is some indication in A, but the map is truncated making it not as obvious to the reader without additional guesswork. This would help to see how the filament may sequester to some degree G5P. Also, a view from the top may be helpful to identify spaces within the filament and where pores are located.</p><p>16. Page 16, line 307, &quot;When the products of the GK domain dissociate from the pocket, the G5P is trapped within the filament and further captured by the GPR domain. Next, NADPH binds to the GPR domain, the conformational change brings the NADPH towards the catalytic residue C598, becoming the close conformation and facilitating the reaction&quot;. Is there evidence that NADPH does not bind until G5P is released? &quot;close conformation&quot; does this mean &quot;closed conformation&quot; or is it referring to the close proximity of C598? Again, the reader does not know the significance of C598 in how it participates in the reaction and this would be helpful to know here.</p><p>17. Page 16, line 319. Please add references to the statement in the first sentence of the paragraph regarding mutations and diseases.</p><p>18. Page 19, Enzyme assays. Please provide a reference for the method.</p><p>19. This reviewer is not a cryo-electron microscopist, so cannot comment on the quality of the data or its processing. However, is there a means to assess map/model agreement? For example, in crystallography one has the Rfree (in addition to quality indicators of the model geometry and x-ray data scaling, which has similar types of measures here) to determine the quality of the model. In cryoEM, perhaps a method such as cross-correlation and/or number of atoms within the envelope would be useful to assess how well the model and map agree?</p><p>20. Page 22, line 446, say what 4Q1T and 2h5g are (and why is one capitalized and one not?). It should be stated how these were used – was a homology model made with the P5CS sequence? How much of the model required changing?</p><p>21. Figure 3 and 4 – a color purple is indicated, but the structures in question appear blue.</p><p>22. Can the authors speculate on how ATP binding (really ADP) results in the formation of the hook? If not, can this be mentioned?</p><p>23. Page 12, Line 232, explain what ALDH family is and why this is relevant (presumably P5CS is a member, but this should be stated).</p><p>24. Why is are these new structures not analyzed and compared to the known crystal structure of human P5CS?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The weakness of the paper is the presentation in general. The authors should make an effort to improve the clarity of their descriptions and review the text carefully to correct grammatical issues.</p><p>This work reports high-quality cryo-EM reconstructions that reveal an impressive supramolecular filament of great beauty. My impression is that the description of the filament is correct, but that the structures offer a lot more of information that should allow to deepen in some crucial aspects such as the catalytic mechanisms, the communication of conformational changes or regulation between domains, which probably will be the subject of future publications.</p><p>My major criticism is that the manuscript requires a carefully re-writing to improve clarity and correct many language issues.</p><p>Some specific comments follow.</p><p>1. When describing the GK domain, the authors could reference the work describing the first G5K structure: Marco-Marín C, Gil-Ortiz F, Pérez-Arellano I, Cervera J, Fita I, Rubio V. A novel two-domain architecture within the amino acid kinase enzyme family revealed by the crystal structure of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> glutamate 5-kinase. J Mol Biol. 2007 Apr 13;367(5):1431-46. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.01.073.</p><p>2. The G5K fold is described as &quot;a sandwich-like α3β8α4 structure&quot;. Perhaps the authors could mention that this is fold is characteristic of the amino acid kinase family (http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00696), as predicted in: Ramón-Maiques S, Marina A, Gil-Ortiz F, Fita I, Rubio V. Structure of acetylglutamate kinase, a key enzyme for arginine biosynthesis and a prototype for the amino acid kinase enzyme family, during catalysis. Structure. 2002 Mar;10(3):329-42. doi: 10.1016/s0969-2126(02)00721-9.</p><p>3. When describing the structure of the GPR domain, the authors could mention that there is a crystal structure of the human P5CS GPR domain available in the PDB (entry 2H5G) without an accompanying publication.</p><p>4. It is unclear what is the ligand content for each of the reported cryo-EM reconstructions. The filaments grown with glutamate and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (ATPgS) showed the product glutamate 5-phosphate in the GPR active site. But what is the content of the GK domain in this structure? The authors state that (Page 9. Line 160) &quot;Three conformations of the GK domain with the different ligands were revealed clearly in our models&quot;. However, only two structures (bound to glutamate or in complex with glutamate 5-phosphate, ADP and Mg) are described and represented in the figures.</p><p>The authors could consider adding images with the densities for the bound glutamate 5-phosphate, ADP and Mg (as they have already done for the glutamate 5-phosphate and for NADPH)</p><p>Also, table 1 uses acronyms (GGL RGP NAP) for the bound ligands, but their meaning is not explained. The table also lists no ions bound in any structure, although the text mentions the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>5. (Page 10. Line 191-196) The authors refer to &quot;ATP binding&quot; and this is misleading because none of the structures has ATP bound.</p><p>6. They refer to four different states for the GPR domain: (Page 11, lines 199) &quot;… four different binding modes of GPR domain&quot;. But the differences between the apo state and the NADP(H)-released state are not clear since both show an empty active site.</p><p>7. The work reports the structures of the GPR domain bound to glutamate 5-phosphate or to NADP. Perhaps the authors could combine these structures by superimposing the active sites and provide some additional details about the reaction mechanism. Perhaps a composed figure that shows the active site with the bound NADP and G5P could be illustrative. The description of the proposed catalytic mechanism (page 12, lines 233-235) is not clear.</p><p>8. The authors could discuss why in presence of glutamate and ATPgS, the GPR active site has glutamate 5-phosphate bound, whereas in the filament grown with all substrates (glutamate, ATP and NADPH), the GPR active site only shows NADP bound.</p><p>9. There is certain inconsistency regarding the conditions for the formation of P5CS filament formation. It is not clear whether filament formation requires glutamate or not. In a previous paper (Zhang 2020), the authors stated that &quot;Purified P5CS in apo state could hardly form filaments&quot; and that &quot;Removing glutamate from solution almost abolished P5CS filament formation&quot;. However, the current work describes that &quot;P5CS proteins self-assemble into filaments without the requirement of ligands&quot; but also that &quot;addition of substrates could enhance the length of filaments&quot; and that &quot;In consistent (sic) with our previous study, L-glutamate (…) is critical in promoting the formation and stability of P5CS filament&quot;. Perhaps the authors should explain more clearly whether glutamate is needed or not, the required concentration, and provide any additional variables that influence the formation of the filaments in vitro.</p><p>10. (Page 15, lines 301-303) &quot;In the proposed model, spontaneous filamentation and elongation of P5CS is importantly associated with the binding of glutamate&quot;. To me, it is not clearly described in the manuscript how glutamate favors the formation or enhances the elongation of the P5CS filament. Perhaps the authors should reformulate this sentence or add a more detailed explanation.</p><p>11. It is not explained why ATP triggers the depolymerization of the filaments formed by mutant R124A, since according to the results, ATP favors the formation of the hook structures that glue the protein tetramers along the filament. One would expect that the nucleotide enhances rather than destabilizes the mutated filaments.</p><p>12. One important conclusion in the manuscript is that &quot;The disruption of P5CS filament may result in uncoupled catalytic reactions of bifunctional P5CS and a reduced activity&quot;. The authors measured the complete two-step reaction in the WT and mutated proteins. The decreased activity could mean that in absence of filaments, the product of the GK reaction, is not properly channeled to the GPR domain. However, the decreased overall reaction activity could also be caused by a reduced G5K efficiency. Perhaps the authors could compare the G5K activity of the WT and mutated proteins. If the efficiency of the partial reaction is similar, this would strongly support that defects in filament formation are causing a defect in the channeling of the intermediate metabolite to the GPR domain.</p><p>13. Some important references are missing. In addition to those indicated above (points 1 and 2), the authors should include references for RELION, COOT, Phenix, Chimera and for PDB entry 4Q1T cited in the methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A detailed list of issues and questions follows here.</p><p>Figure 1 suppl 1 – scalebars should be included on all micrographs; panel 1B should include all 3 ligand states evaluated in the paper.</p><p>Figure 1 suppl 2 – it is hard to know which regions of the filaments are covered by the masks. Please show the mask superimposed on the filament structure.</p><p>Page 7 – the discussion of focused classification is a bit confusing. Does &quot;multiple different conformational states&quot; mean multiple conformations within each liganded state, or that each liganded state had a unique conformation. I think it's the later, but if the former then this should be explained and a supplemental figure showing the refinement classification strategy should be presented.</p><p>Page 8 – in comparison to existing crystal structures, it would be helpful to know the % identity to the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme, and the RMSD when the two structures are aligned (and, ideally, a supplemental image showing superposition of the structures). Similarly, there appears to be a structure of part of the human enzyme available, pdb id 2h5g, and it would be good to know how similar this structure is to the reported <italic>Drosophila</italic> structure.</p><p>Page 9 – disordered loop in region II – what is meant by &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closure&quot; in terms of the disordered region. It is difficult to see in Figure 2 A/B, but it looks like the ordered region common to both structures is pretty much the same? If there are differences, this could perhaps be displayed differently.</p><p>Page 9 – &quot;with the binding of different ligands&quot; – does this mean that the ligands induce different conformational states, or that the same three conformations were observed regardless of ligand state? – Also, what are the &quot;three conformational states&quot;? This paragraph describes two?</p><p>Figure 2 A/B – very hard to assess the similarities and differences between the structures here. At a minimum the same regions should be shown for both structures. But from this it looks like the ordered part of the Glu-bound structure is the same as the &quot;mix&quot; structure, and the disordered loops have just been drawn in different positions. Maybe a superposition of the models would help clarify the differences? – Ah, there is a superposition in Figure 3A. Here it is clear, with the exception of one (or two?) residues if the Glu structure that point up (Figure 3A, left-hand side of the region II loop) the structures are the same. Is there additional evidence (weak density, perhaps?) to support where the disordered loops have been drawn? Showing the quality of the em density in this region is important to judge the conclusions being drawn about the potential movement of this loop.</p><p>Page 9, Figure 2 C/D – it is unclear where the &quot;closure loop&quot; is here, can this be highlighted?</p><p>Page 9 – How was the conversion of substrate to phosphorylated intermediate (G5P) assessed? Is this based just on the fit to the density, or is there orthogonal evidence (mass spec or something)? It's hard to judge the quality of the fit into the partial map shown in Figure 2D – a supplemental figure with the region around the G5P/ADP showing the quality of the model in this region and demonstrating a better fit of G5P/ADP than Glu/ATP would be helpful. Or a comparison to the Glu/ATPgS structure might be convincing.</p><p>Figure 3C – A supplementary figure showing the fit of the atomic model for the &quot;hook&quot; into density in Region 1 would be helpful in assessing the conformational change modeled here.</p><p>Page 10, last paragraph – the residues contacting the ligands are all in nearly the same positions in the two structures. Conformational changes described above are distal to the binding site.</p><p>Figure 5 supplement 1A – the quality of the negative stain images of F642A is insufficient to assess the protein quality. One cannot discern whether the protein is in a monomeric or tetrameric state, and the apo state micrograph would suggest that aggregation may be a problem for this mutant. Either better stain images or orthogonal data (circular dichroism, melting curve, etc.) are required to be certain that the protein is folded and stable upon introduction of the Phe to Ala mutation.</p><p>Figure 5 supplement 1B – While it appears that ATP does limit polymerization of the R124A mutant, a more quantitative measurement would be helpful, especially in interpretation of the enzyme activity data in Figure 5D. I suggest light scattering or ultracentrifugation could be used to quantify the fraction of enzyme in polymers.</p><p>Page 14, first paragraph – It is unclear why the R124A mutation would destabilize polymers. The P5CS(Glu) structure (Figure 1B) shows that the polymers are stable in the absence of longitudinal &quot;hook&quot; interactions that are presumably disrupted by this mutation.</p><p>Figure 5D – enzyme assays. The methods should indicate what concentration enzyme was used in this assay, and what concentration was imaged in negative stain. A major question is whether filaments are observed for the wildtype protein at whatever concentration was used for the enzyme assay. Presumably the answer is yes, but if this is not shown it would bring into question what causes the effect of the mutations on activity.</p><p>These data should be quantified by calculating specific activity of the enzymes under these conditions, which would allow comparison of these data with published values for P5CS.</p><p>This assay reads out the second step in a two-step reaction mechanism. If the function of filaments is to couple the two activities as asserted in the text (see comment below), then one would also expect that the point mutants would affect the rate of the first reaction. This should be tested using an assay to monitor ATP hydrolysis in the first step. If the rates of both reactions are reduced by the mutants this would be consistent with a coupling mechanism of the filament, but if only the second step is affected this would be consistent with the authors' hypothesis that the filament increases local intermediate concentration.</p><p>Page 15 – The rationale behind &quot;coupling&quot; of catalytic reactions by filament assembly is not clear. As the enzyme appears to undergo a complete ligand binding and catalytic cycle in the context of the filament, it is not clear how the filament contacts are coupling activities. While I realize it is asking a lot to add another cryo-EM structure, it seems that the structure of free P5CS tetramers would be an important piece of data to have in interpreting how filaments might be increasing activity.</p><p>Is there evidence to support an internal channel for G5P, as suggested here (at least I assume that is what is meant by &quot;electrostatic channeling&quot;)? If there were a relevant channel stabilized by the filament, it should be seen in the wildtype enzyme filament structure.</p><p>The proposal that filaments function to create a locally high concentration of intermediates is interesting, but should be tested. One way to do this would be to monitor NADPH production in the presence of G5P as a substrate – at high G5P concentrations one would expect the mutant protein to have the same enzymatic rate as the wildtype.</p><p>At the bottom of page 15, in proposing the model for &quot;filament catalysis&quot; the statement that upon dissociation from the active site G5P is &quot;trapped within the filament&quot; is not well supported. The architecture of the filament is such that G5 would appear likely to be able to freely diffuse away from the filament.</p><p>Figure 5, supplement 3 – It would be helpful to include subdomain delineation and the locations of regions I, II, and III with the sequence alignment.</p><p>Page 16/17 – The potential link between filament assembly and human disease is intriguing. Is there evidence that the human enzyme forms filaments? It would be good to indicate how well-conserved the filament assembly interfaces are between human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>In a similar vein, the introduction mentions the role of P5CS in plants being of potential significance in agriculture. It would be good to indicate how well conserved filament assembly interfaces are in the plant sequences, and whether based on that one would anticipate that they assemble filaments similar to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> structure reported here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76107.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The writing would greatly benefit from a professional editor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the paper to improve the clarity and the presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper uses &quot;spiral&quot; in many places when they really mean &quot;helical&quot;.

There is certain inconsistency regarding the conditions for the formation of P5CS filament formation. It is not clear whether filament formation requires glutamate or not. In a previous paper (Zhang 2020), the authors stated that &quot;Purified P5CS in apo state could hardly form filaments&quot; and that &quot;Removing glutamate from solution almost abolished P5CS filament formation&quot;. However, the current work describes that &quot;P5CS proteins self-assemble into filaments without the requirement of ligands&quot; but also that &quot;addition of substrates could enhance the length of filaments&quot; and that &quot;In consistent (sic) with our previous study, L-glutamate (…) is critical in promoting the formation and stability of P5CS filament&quot;. Perhaps the authors should explain more clearly whether glutamate is needed or not, the required concentration, and provide any additional variables that influence the formation of the filaments in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the main text at lines 99-110 in response to the comment:</p><p>“In our previous study, we found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> P5CS in the APO state is hard to form filaments at low concentrations (&lt;0.05 μM). The addition of glutamate to the P5CS samples induces micron-scale filaments (Zhang et al., 2020). Here, we observe that increasing P5CS concentration (&gt;1 μM) also promotes the formation of filaments in the APO state. Our results show that the P5CS proteins can be self-assembled into filaments without ligands, and adding substrates increases the length of filaments at the same concentration of the P5CS proteins.

(Page 15, lines 301-303) &quot;In the proposed model, spontaneous filamentation and elongation of P5CS is importantly associated with the binding of glutamate&quot;.

It is not explained why ATP triggers the depolymerization of the filaments formed by mutant R124A, since according to the results, ATP favors the formation of the hook structures that glue the protein tetramers along the filament. One would expect that the nucleotide enhances rather than destabilizes the mutated filaments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text and expanded the discussion of short <italic>P5CS<sup>R124A</sup></italic> filaments at lines 423-430:</p><p>“We speculate that the swing of GPR in the catalytic reaction could destabilize the interaction between adjacent GPR domain dimers in the filament. Therefore, the extra interaction at the hook structure of the GK domain may be required for the stabilization of the filament. This proposed stabilization is consistent with negative stain data showing that the P5CS<sup>R124A</sup> mutant cannot stabilize the filament structure in the catalytic process and lose the ability to form the long filaments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. One important conclusion in the manuscript is that &quot;The disruption of P5CS filament may result in uncoupled catalytic reactions of bifunctional P5CS and a reduced activity&quot;. The authors measured the complete two-step reaction in the WT and mutated proteins. The decreased activity could mean that in absence of filaments, the product of the GK reaction, is not properly channeled to the GPR domain. However, the decreased overall reaction activity could also be caused by a reduced G5K efficiency. Perhaps the authors could compare the G5K activity of the WT and mutated proteins. If the efficiency of the partial reaction is similar, this would strongly support that defects in filament formation are causing a defect in the channeling of the intermediate metabolite to the GPR domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tempered our claims and added a Discussion section for the potential working model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

The methods should indicate what concentration enzyme was used in this assay, and what concentration was imaged in negative stain.

As for the mechanism, more studies are needed. From our results, we observed that the activity of the R124A mutant was greatly reduced. We speculate that it will not have much effect on the rate of the first reaction, because the residue is not close to the active site. If the rate of the first reaction decreases, the destruction of the hook structure may lead to the conformational change of the GK domain tetramer.

As the enzyme appears to undergo a complete ligand binding and catalytic cycle in the context of the filament, it is not clear how the filament contacts are coupling activities.

We have tempered our claims and proposed a model for the discussion of the possible channel or chamber or communication between GK and GPR domains at lines 380-389:</p><p>“As mentioned in the ‘Results’ section, we observed that mutated residues R124A and F642A do not directly participate in the active sites, while they are crucial for filamentation. This suggests that the P5CS filamentation couples the reaction catalyzed between the GK domain and GPR domain through transferring unstable intermediate G5P(Pérez-Arellano et al., 2010; Seddon et al., 1989). Considering the distance between the GK and GPR domains is about 60 Å (Figure 5—figure supplement 3, Figure 5-Video 1Figure 5—video 1), we propose a model that P5CS filament may exhibit a scaffold architecture that stabilizes the relative position of the GK and GPR domains, the cooperation between which may produce electrostatic substrate channels that mediate the transfer of unstable intermediate G5P. In addition, P5CS filamentation may create a half-opened chamber with the active sites located at the inner part of the filament. Since the GK domain is catalytically faster than the GPR domain, the unstable intermediates G5P accumulate within the filament. This microenvironment may reduce the amount of G5P escaped into the solvent, thereby facilitating the rate-limiting reaction at the GPR domain.”</p><p>In our results, P5CS protein showed high filament-forming ability. The filamentation of P5CS is like a highly ordered factory to facilitate the two-step reaction, which is also an important feature of P5CS filament. Whether dynamic P5CS filaments produce transient conformations to promote the transfer of intermediates, resulting in the formation of the channel or chamber to couple filament reactions, more structural studies of P5CS filaments are required to determine an underlying regulatory mechanism that transmits information between the GK and GPR domain in the tetramer and along the filament.</p><p>We have updated this supplementary figure.
